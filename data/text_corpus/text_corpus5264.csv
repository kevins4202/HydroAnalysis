26320,coupled models of coastal hazards ecosystems socioeconomics and landscape management in conjunction with alternative scenario analysis provide tools that can allow decision makers to explore effects of policy decisions under uncertain futures here we describe the development and assessment of a set of model based alternative future scenarios examining climate and population driven landscape dynamics for a coastal region in the u s pacific northwest these scenarios incorporated coupled spatiotemporal models of climate and coastal hazards population and development and policy and assessed a variety of landscape metrics for each scenario coastal flooding and erosion were probabilistically simulated using 99 future 95 year climate scenarios five policy scenarios were iteratively co developed by researchers and stakeholders in tillamook county oregon results suggest that both climate change and management decisions have a significant impact across the landscape and can potentially impact geographic regions at different magnitudes and timescales keywords climate change adaptation planning coastal community resilience coastal flooding coastal hazards envision tillamook county or 1 introduction with the continuous influx of populations to coastal regions human stresses on resources and ecosystems coincide with climate change resulting in uncertain and potentially less habitable shorelines worldwide neumann et al 2015 the coastal u s pacific northwest faces an increased risk of hazards as a result of sea level rise slr and changing storminess patterns ruggiero et al 2010 allan and komar 2006 however future trends in slr storm frequency and wave climate attributed to global climate change are difficult to accurately predict particularly at local scales slr is highly spatially and temporally variable and while there is a documented acceleration of mean global slr local regional and global processes contribute a high degree of uncertainty

the inherent geographic variability in climate impacts emphasizes the need for place based approaches to climate vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning that also take into account the values of local stakeholders e g kelly and adger 2000 moser et al 2012 turner et al 2003 community exposure to coastal change hazards varies depending upon how communities respond and adapt to risk as well as to how human population growth and development drive the evolution of the coastal system as such it is critical that community planners understand the impacts of policy decisions when developing adaptation strategies to address these emerging challenges in ways that are both cost effective and sustainable into the future examples of solutions that can potentially prevent community exposure to coastal hazards include a hard and soft engineering solutions e g rip rap revetments sea walls or beach nourishment b nonstructural measures that accommodate coastal risks while continuing coastal occupancy and land use e g flood insurance stricter building and zoning codes and elevating structures or c relocation away from coastal hazard zones e g planned retreat using construction setbacks buy outs and reactive relocation from the shoreline klein et al 2001 understanding the consequences of such policies is essential to developing adaptive capacity or the ability to sustain quality of life within coastal communities gallopín 2006 smit and wandel 2006 to evaluate the impact of policy decisions under uncertain future climate conditions an approach is needed that marries the predictive and dynamic capabilities of simulation models with a scenario methodology that incorporates stakeholder values and co developed adaptation strategies keeler et al 2015 karvetski et al 2011 policy and climate scenarios have recently been combined within modeling platforms to assess climate change impacts and vulnerabilities across different sectors e g le et al 2010 mcnamara and keeler 2013 bolte et al 2007 and these platforms have emerged as powerful tools in integrated assessment and policy analysis within the context of climate change because they account for a range of uncertainty in complex dynamic systems berkhout et al 2002 modeling alternative pathways of plausible futures can estimate the magnitude and extent of future climate change the associated potential impacts on physical natural and human systems the costs and possible effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation policies the interactions among and trade offs between climate change impacts and adaptation policies and the relationships between climate change and socioeconomic development berkhout et al 2014 mokrech et al 2012 moss et al 2010 nicholls et al 2008 van vuuren et al 2011 simulations of alternative futures can ultimately help identify the most important interactions across spatial and temporal scales leading to improved understanding of the structure and behavior of these systems by researchers and stakeholders alike here we present a transferrable methodology for development and evaluation of alternative futures with respect to coastal flooding and erosion in tillamook county oregon within a spatially explicit multi paradigm model integration framework first the background establishes the historic climatologic and socioeconomic baseline in tillamook county followed by a discussion of the modeling platform used envision and the development of a suite of probabilistic climate change scenarios that reflect various assumptions regarding slr wave height and major enso occurrences and their impact on future total water levels twls in addition the methodology details the five policy scenarios that were developed iteratively with a group of stakeholders to capture a range of landscape management options finally the resulting alternative futures are evaluated using a suite of landscape metrics and the benefits and drawbacks of various adaptation strategies under a range of climate scenarios are explored along with an analysis of the model sensitivity to parameterization of the human system 2 coastal tillamook county oregon roughly 23 percent of tillamook county s approximately 25 320 permanent residents live within a half mile of the pacific ocean fig 1 u s census bureau 2014 the 104 km including the estuarine shoreline coastline also draws visitors and non permanent residents alike coastal geomorphology varies from sandy dune backed beaches which compose the majority of the shoreline 55 to cliffs 21 to bluff backed beaches 11 to sandy beaches backed by rip rap revetments 8 and cobble and boulder beaches adjacent to headlands less than 5 headlands restrict alongshore sediment transport between four littoral cells which are further divided by estuaries fig 1 an increase in coastal hazards over the past few decades within tillamook county can be attributed to three main climatological drivers slr increases in wave heights related to winter storms and the frequency of major enso events komar et al 2011 found rates of relative slr of approximately 1 3 mm per year along the central to northern oregon coast between 1980 and 2010 further the pacific northwest is exposed to extreme extratropical storms with winter waves regularly reaching heights in excess of 8 m allan and komar 2006 ruggiero et al 2010 found a trend of increasing wave heights along the oregon coast with the annual mean increasing at a rate of 1 5 cm per year the winter mean increasing at a rate of 2 3 cm per year and annual maximum wave heights increasing at a rate of 9 5 cm per year over a three decade period in addition recent major el niño events i e 1997 1998 2009 2010 resulted in severe flooding and erosion in the region sallenger et al 2012 at present over 65 of the tillamook county outer coastline is erosional with approximately 40 of the coast eroding at rates exceeding 1 m per year ruggiero et al 2013 3 envision framework envision bolte et al 2007 is a multi paradigm model integration platform which couples landscape process models with socioeconomic drivers and management strategies to explore trajectories of change through time via a variety of metrics fig 2 envision has been used to characterize floodplain trajectories hulse et al 2009 land use planning and impacts of urban expansion guzy et al 2008 wu et al 2015 wildfire land management yospin et al 2015 koch et al 2012 spies et al 2017 land use water climate interactions inouye et al 2017 hulse et al 2016 han et al 2017 turner et al 2015 and other coupled human natural systems envision s support for mixed simulations incorporating conventional models and decision making actors allows exploring the complexity of landscape patterns that result when decision making entities and their policies are included as part of evolving landscapes alternative futures analysis within envision involves three primary aspects 1 dataset development 2 model development and integration and 3 policy scenario development dataset development occurs in conjunction with stakeholder engagement subsequent to the determination of relevant evaluative metrics all datasets must be spatially explicit e g census tracks geomorphologic parameters envision enables spatial temporal simulation of landscape change through the synchronization of multiple submodels envision includes a multi agent modeling subsystem to represent human decisions on the landscape a set of actors operate across the landscape by selecting and applying policies in response to landscape signals and other factors influencing their decision making behavior in envision actors can be based on individuals collections of individuals or abstractions with no real world counterpart in the case of our application of envision to tillamook county actors represent the collection of individuals associated with county defined tax lots the application of a policy by an actor results in changes of landscape attributes policies decision rules contain information about site attributes defining where the policy can be considered and outcomes that the policy is intended to accomplish 3 1 envision simulation during simulation envision generates a set of both spatially detailed and spatially aggregated landscape evaluators reflecting scenario outcomes for a variety of metrics most notably development land use patterns shoreline modifications population projections and impacts to the landscape by coastal hazards these landscape metrics indirectly introduce feedbacks into the system by quantifying the actor or policy s impact on the landscape the sections below describe 1 how tillamook county was represented geospatially 2 the submodels used to simulate coastal hazards population growth and development and 3 the development of climate change and policy scenarios 3 2 geospatial representation of the landscape a landscape in envision consists of a set of spatial containers or polygons termed integrated decision units idus that specify the resolution at which processes and actors can operate on the landscape for this study the 2900 km2 study area of tillamook county was divided into approximately 130 000 idus areas of the idus range from less than 50 square meters to greater than 10 square kilometers the idus were formed through the intersection of multiple geometric layers representing baseline data the baseline geometry for the idu layer were county defined tax lots with underlying information including ownership zoning and presence of a dwelling or building each idu has a unique set of attributes relevant to the landscape and evaluative models taxlots near the shoreline were further subdivided using a 100 m alongshore by 10 m cross shore grid to more accurately resolve coastal flooding and erosion hazards 3 3 submodels submodels or plug ins periodically change the underlying landscape reflecting biophysical processes that occur independently of human action the modular architecture of envision allows for the inclusion of any number of compliant submodels the submodels used within this case study in coastal tillamook county or are described below while the coastal flooding and change hazards models implemented in envision are relatively simple the approach was designed to be modular and allows for the use of more sophisticated models when warranted 3 3 1 probabilistic simulation of total water levels probabilistic simulations of total water levels twls were used to derive coastal flooding and erosion submodels along the outer coast twls are calculated as a linear superposition of the tide non tidal residual and wave induced runup allan and komar 2006 ruggiero 2013 ruggiero et al 2010 1 t w l m s l η a η n t r r where msl is the mean sea level η a is the deterministic astronomical tide and η n t r is the nontidal residual generated by a range of physical processes including wind setup barometric surge and low frequency water level anomalies r the 2 exceedance level of the vertical extent of wave runup on a beach or structure above some datum was calculated using the empirical model of stockdon et al 2006 on dune backed sandy beaches and the modified taw technical advisory committee for water retaining structures van der meer 2002 allan et al 2015 approach on beaches backed by bluffs cobble berms and backshore protection structures bps i e riprap revetments using the total water level full simulation model twl fsm developed by serafin and ruggiero 2014 probabilistic time series of wave height wave period wave direction msl η a and η n t r allowed for the incorporation of variability and non stationarity within climate change scenarios these twl parameters were generated for a deep water location not affected by shoaling or refraction processes as such it was necessary to then propagate the waves toward the nearshore using regional bathymetry because the numerical transformation of waves is computationally expensive over a large study region lookup tables were developed to relate offshore deep water triplets of significant wave height swh peak period tp and mean wave direction mwd to their nearshore 20 m water depth equivalents using radial basis functions camus et al 2011 the wave climatology was discretized into representative wave conditions which were transformed to the nearshore garcía medina et al 2013 using stationary model runs of swan booij et al 1999 this allows for any combination of a deep water triplet s nearshore equivalent to be interpolated from the results of the swan model runs wave runup parameterization stockdon et al 2006 van der meer 2002 relies on the deep water equivalent swh and tp as inputs so transformed waves were linearly back shoaled from the 20 m contour to deep water these transformed deep water waves were ultimately used to generate twl conditions in combination with 100 m alongshore resolution geomorphology including backshore beach slope defined as the slope between the mhw shoreline contour and the dune toe dune crest and dune toe which were extracted from a combination of 2009 lidar data from oregon department of geology and mineral industries dogami and 2011 lidar data from u s army corps of engineers using techniques developed by mull and ruggiero 2014 3 3 2 coastal flooding to reduce computational complexity flooding within envision was calculated only for the maximum yearly twl event using a bathtub type inundation model which considers only two variables the inundation level and ground elevation schmid et al 2014 the coastal hazards submodel allows for selection of alongshore variable yearly maxima such that different storms throughout the year may produce the maximum twl event for each alongshore location depending upon local geomorphic and climatic conditions because of the simplicity of the bathtub model twls at inlets were reduced to reflect a combination of non tidal residual and tide only while the full twl was used for the remainder of the coastline flooding occurred only if the dune or bps crest was overtopped by the twl to determine pathways of flooding in the backshore hydraulic connectivity between individual idus was determined using a 1 m resolution digital elevation model dem 3 3 3 coastal erosion coastal retreat is evaluated following baron et al 2015 as 2 coastal erosion c c r s b c c r c l i m a t e t c c e v e n t where ccrsb is the long term interannual to decadal scale coastal change rate ccrclimate is the coastal change rate associated with slr t is time in years and ccevent is the event based erosion associated with the maximum yearly twl within the model erosion was restricted to dune backed beaches as failure of bps and bluff cliff erosion was not modeled extrapolating an end point shoreline change rate 1967 2002 was used to capture continued erosion associated with the regional sediment budget c c r s b ruggiero et al 2013 the influence of slr on erosion was characterized using the bruun rule bruun 1962 given a yearly rise in slr the yearly landward shoreline retreat was found as follows 3 c c r c l i m a t e l b h c s l r s l r t a n β s f where l is the cross shore distance to the water depth hc b is the elevation of a backshore feature bps or dune and tan β s f is the shoreface slope computed between mean high water line mhw 2 1 m contour relative to navd88 and hc taken here to be the 25 m isobath on dune backed beaches the shoreface slope remained static through time as the dune eroded landward while the dune toe elevation rose at the rate of slr on beaches backed by bps the beach was assumed to narrow at the rate of the total chronic erosion c c r s b c c r c l i m a t e beaches were further narrowed in the process of maintaining i e raising to accommodate higher twls and constructing bps structures at a 2 1 slope coastal retreat during large winter storm events or periods of elevated water levels was also modeled in the form of wave induced foredune erosion in which the magnitude of erosion depends on the elevation of the twl relative to the toe of the foredune ruggiero et al 2001 sallenger 2000 stockdon et al 2006 based on the model suitability study of mull and ruggiero 2014 a modification of the foredune erosion model presented by kriebel and dean 1993 was implemented within the coastal hazards submodel the event scale dune erosion model assumes that the volume of sediment eroded from the foredune during a storm is deposited in the nearshore as the equilibrium profile shifts as follows 4 c c e v e n t t d t s t w l max y e a r l y m h w x b h b t a n β f d h i g h m h w h b t w l max y e a r l y m h w 2 where t d is the storm duration t s is the erosion response time scale x b is the surf zone width measured from the mhw position using an equilibrium profile dean 1991 h b is the breaking wave water depth relative to mhw t a n β f is the beach slope and d h i g h is the elevation of the dune crest calculating c c e v e n t for a particular storm required scaling the erosion response using a ratio of the erosion response time scale t s to the storm duration t d t s is theoretically dependent upon the ability of sediment to withstand erosive wave forces and was calculated as a function of h b and d h i g h kriebel and dean 1993 a mean storm event duration approximately 10 h in which the twl is elevated above mhw was used for the entire study region calculated using an alongshore averaged value using the 30 year event record developed by serafin and ruggiero 2014 3 3 4 population growth while the allocation of people and development varied based upon policies articulated within policy scenarios the mechanisms for that allocation remained constant across all alternative future scenarios within envision two models were used to simulate the spatial pattern of population growth and subsequent development processes across the landscape of tillamook county an envision submodel target envision developer s manual 2015 was used to allocate new population growth at the idu level specific data required for this analysis included tax lot coverage zoning data and maximum capacities for each zone type census data and information regarding growth rates target allocates population at some overall study wide growth rate onto the polygonal idu landscape through the creation and examination of two surfaces 1 a current population density surface and 2 a population capacity surface the population capacity surface represents build out population density of the idu based on zoning class the allocation of growth involves an idu by idu evaluation of existing population and of the capacity for new population new population is spatially allocated proportionally to the difference between the existing density and the capacity surface resulting in the model moving the existing density surface towards the capacity surface this function was modified by introducing weighted preference factors e g a preference to locate near the coastline into the allocations these preference factors modify the differences between the existing density surface and capacity surface based on underlying idu values defined via a spatial query associated with the preference and were estimated based on past growth patterns in the study area in lieu of idu level population data initial idu population density was estimated from the 2010 census at the block group level a single projection of population growth from the oregon office of economic analysis through 2050 was used across all policy scenarios subsequent to 2050 a constant population growth rate was used allocating a total of approximately 12 000 new residents into the county by 2100 oregon office of economic analysis 2013 because no spatially explicit projections of population growth exist for the tillamook county study area urban growth areas and community growth areas were assumed to maintain a constant fraction of the county wide population through 2100 while still allowing geographic preferences between policy scenarios 3 3 5 development new development was allocated to the landscape based on the population growth rate in a separate envision submodel developer envision developer s manual 2015 the number of people per dwelling unit varied by town or city and also by distance from the coast many coastal dwellings are owned as non primary homes therefore the number of people per dwelling unit is much lower than the number of people per dwelling unit in areas further from the coast for each pre defined area new population growth determines the number of new dwelling units required and within each idu the dwelling unit capacity was based on the population density at each time step this capacity was used to generate a sorted list based on the greatest discrepancy between population density and number of existing dwelling units dwelling units were allocated until the entire new population for that time step was accommodated finally a hedonic pricing model e g bin et al 2008 was used to determine the value of new development as follows 5 a s s e s s e d v a l u e f l o t s i z e d i s t a n c e t o s h o r e l i n e p r e s e n c e o f b p s d i s t a n c e t o m a j o r h i g h w a y n u m b e r o f b u i l d i n g s g e o g r a p h i c l o c a t i o n w i t h i n g r o w t h b o u n d a r i e s 3 4 scenario development 3 4 1 climate change impact scenarios probabilistic twl simulations combining variations of slr wave climate and the probability of occurrence of major el niño events from the year 2005 through 2099 accounted for uncertainty in climate projections and served as climate impact scenarios first projections from the national research council s sea level rise for the coasts of california oregon and washington 2012 were used to define three slr scenarios low medium and high fig 3 the nrc 2012 report was used as it was well known to stakeholders during the project and was considered appropriate since it contains slr projections relevant for the us west coast while specific to oregon and washington bounds on the slr projections still maintained a high range of variability as they included a combination of regional steric and ocean dynamics cryosphere and fingerprinting effects and vertical land motion next projected changes in the wave climate were based on significant wave height swh distributions developed from the variability of statistically and dynamically downscaled projected global climate model estimates for the northeast pacific ocean hemer et al 2013 wang et al 2014 to account for the range in variability in the downscaled data the wave climate was allowed to increase or decrease across the various slr scenarios fig 3 finally water levels and wave heights are also affected by major el niño events which have been associated with severe flooding and erosion in the u s pacific northwest komar 1998 kaminsky et al 1998 barnard et al 2017 due to the uncertainty surrounding the changing occurrence of storms the frequency of major enso events was allowed to vary continuously between half of present day frequency once per two decades and double present day frequency these combinations of three slr scenarios wave climate variability and enso frequency projections were used to capture the inherent variability of the physical drivers thirty three probabilistic twl simulations for each high medium and low impact climate change scenario resulted in a total of 99 different 95 year projections of daily maximum twls 3 4 2 policy scenarios the alternative futuring process allowed for feedback and learning opportunities at several levels the first came through the utilization of the modeling framework envision as described above a second opportunity arose when the model design or results were used to interact with stakeholders to gain information with respect to decision making across the landscape to accomplish the latter a group of local stakeholders including representatives from state legislature community advisory committees city managers and mayors county commissioners and property owners among others were consulted to identify possible policy scenario narratives to be represented within envision this participatory modeling approach fostered an environment of ownership and understanding amongst both researchers and the stakeholder community and ensured that the co produced scenarios modeled were representative of a broad range of policy options more details describing the stakeholder interaction can be found in lipiec et al 2018 policies were developed based on discussions with stakeholders and reflect several categories including shoreline modifications and development restrictions each policy was modeled with as specific set of triggers or assumptions some of these triggers were based upon historic evidence while others that lacked concrete examples in the pacific northwest were generated and validated through collaboration with the stakeholders or a literature review for example in determining when buildings must be relocated within or removed entirely from parcels in response to hazards current policy language states that the building must require repairs equal to half of the value of the property i e a significant repairs requirement because the current version of the coastal hazards submodel computes flooding as a binary state and does not simulate flow depths and velocities the aforementioned threshold was impossible to capture in this particular case repetitive impact to buildings by coastal hazards provided a proxy for significant damage because the size of the study area precluded the use of more computationally expensive physics based flooding and erosion models sets of individual policies made up a total of four initial policy scenario narratives status quo hold the line realign and laissez faire in order for stakeholders to weigh tradeoffs and evaluate differences between scenarios table 1 each policy scenario narrative dictated how actors managed the landscape both in terms of how and where population growth and development were allocated and how people and resources were protected from coastal hazards a fifth policy scenario hybrid was generated through a ranking process in which stakeholders voted for preferred policies and scenarios based on initial results from the four initial policy scenarios each of the five policy scenarios was crossed with the 99 climate change impact scenarios resulting in 495 alternatives futures through which landscape metrics were evaluated to assess the relative effectiveness of management options 4 evaluating alternative futures with respect to landscape metrics while over 100 variables were tracked during simulations stakeholders identified a core set of metrics for the exploration of alternative futures within envision lipiec et al 2018 in general the most important metrics were related to 1 growth and development 2 exposure to coastal hazards and mitigation techniques 3 public good the following sections explore example metrics in each of these three categories as well as the relative difference in hazard impacts between individual communities see fig 4 4 1 metrics related to growth and development because many of the adaptation and land use management policies employed alter development patterns on the landscape growth and development were compared across the five different scenarios fig 4 illustrates the simulated trends involving development within the coastal hazard zone none of the five policy scenarios allocated more than 500 additional buildings within a coastal hazard zone determined by the oregon department of geology and mineral industries allan and priest 2001 with the laissez faire policy scenario allocating the greatest number due to the relaxation of growth boundaries and increased likelihood of development closer to the shoreline because the projected county wide growth rate was moderate 0 39 0 78 per year no community growth boundaries were filled to capacity in the hold the line policy scenario new growth in the hazard zone was limited primarily by a policy which permits construction only on the safest site within a parcel and secondarily by a policy which permits development only on beachfront properties eligible to construct bps table 1 the bounds of climate variability shaded areas within fig 4 were largest for the policy scenarios realign and hybrid which remove buildings and population from the coastal hazard zone through an easement process up to 1800 buildings were relocated to safer areas outside the hazard zone in the realign policy scenario under the mean of all high impact probabilistic climate twl scenarios fig 4 right approximately 500 fewer buildings are converted to easements in the mean low impact climate scenario in the hybrid policy scenario in which buildings are first relocated to the safest site of the parcel and then removed from the hazard zone if hazard exposure persists fewer properties were transitioned into easements than within the realign policy scenario these development patterns altered subsequent community exposure to coastal hazards 4 2 metrics related to hazard exposure metrics related to hazard exposure provided insight regarding 1 when homeowners will need bps to protect their property 2 how property will be impacted by coastal flooding and erosion hazards and 3 how costs of protecting property change over time within the five policy scenarios bps and beach nourishment were the only two coastal engineering mechanisms hard and soft considered for the protection of backshore development to protect property from erosion most beachfront property owners would need to armor their properties prior to 2040 according to simulation results fig 5 more bps were constructed in the laissez faire policy scenario than in the other policy scenarios as restrictions related to bps construction permitting were eliminated fig 6 in the realign and hybrid policy scenarios further armoring of the shoreline was prevented thus the percent of shoreline hardened was constant through time in rockaway beach a maximum of 80 of the shoreline was hardened as the community was predominately developed by the end of the century fig 6 left county wide however no policy scenario armored more than 30 of the entire shoreline as population along most of the coast was still relatively sparse by 2100 fig 6 right variability due to climate scenarios altered the extent of armored coastline by no more than 10 as a result of shoreline armoring the number of properties exposed to event based erosion through time was reduced in three of the five policy scenarios fig 7 right the sharp reduction in the number of buildings impacted by event based erosion is due to either the construction of bps or the formation of easements early in the century the laissez faire policy scenario resulted in the fewest number of buildings impacted by erosion event based or long term as property owners constructed bps regardless of current eligibility status variability in the number of buildings impacted by event based erosion was minimal between climate impact scenarios the lack of bps construction in the realign and hybrid policy scenarios resulted in greater impacts to buildings by erosion and greater variability with respect to climate scenarios in addition to the buildings exposed to event based erosion buildings were removed by the long term shoreline change rate due to both sea level rise and sediment budget factors once the toe of the dune moved landward of the building fig 7 left under policy scenarios in which bps construction was permitted but limited based on current oregon laws up to 45 buildings were lost due to long term shoreline change under the realign and hybrid policy scenarios buildings were removed via easements and thus were not lost due to chronic erosion the value of property impacted by flooding was assessed under both low and high impact climate scenarios fig 8 near the end of the century there was greater variability in the low climate impact scenario than in the high impact scenario although in general more property was impacted by flooding in the high impact climate scenario and is more than doubled under the laissez faire policy scenario the decrease in variability within the high slr scenario was due to the exceedance of a flooding threshold by approximately mid century after which the combined effects of slr and geomorphologic change resulted in the frequent to persistent inundation of property within the coastal hazard zone the increase of property impacted by flooding during the first half of the century was in response to the construction and maintenance of bps because bps prevented any landward migration of the dune the long term erosion rate due to both sediment budget factors and to slr causes the beach to narrow thus increasing twls while homeowners were able to build up bps in response to rising twls they were limited by the elevation of the property and a requirement to maintain a viable viewshed in addition raising the elevation of the structure crest forced the extension of the structure horizontally further narrowing the beach thus the presence of bps increased beach slope often increasing exposure to coastal flooding in this analysis bps were predominately unsuccessful at reducing flooding hazards within tillamook county the highest value of property impacted by flooding occurred under the laissez faire policy scenario both because bps construction was permitted without restriction and because the rate of new development near the shoreline was elevated in the realign and hybrid policy scenarios fewer flooding impacts occurred by 2100 compared to the other policy scenarios due to both the relocation of people and development away from coastal hazard zones and the limitation of further bps construction variability within these two policy scenarios realign and hybrid with respect to climate was also the smallest towards the end of the century because most of the population and buildings within the hazard zones are relocated through the formation of easements policies that move people and buildings away from coastal hazards were most successful in protecting property from flooding impacts whereas policies that permit the construction of bps protect property from erosion impacts comparing costs of policy scenarios over time allows for the evaluation of tradeoffs fig 9 bps construction and maintenance costs in the status quo and hold the line policy scenarios were similar early in the century but diverged towards the end of the century as nourishment offset some of the costs of raising bps to account for higher twls the greatest expenditures for both bps construction and maintenance occurred under the laissez faire policy scenario costing 250 million between 2010 and 2100 2 5 million per year the hold the line and realign policy scenarios were most expensive 300 million as a result of nourishment and the creation of easements under the assumption that the assessed value of the property was equal to the cost of easement creation respectively 4 3 metrics related to public good metrics related to public good include 1 the extent of shoreline that was accessible to recreation and 2 the length of road that was impacted by coastal hazards within the context of this analysis beach accessibility was defined as the ability to walk run ride etc the beach alongshore evaluated every 100 m based on stakeholder input particular sections of beach were considered inaccessible when the maximum daily twl reached the toe of the dune or structure more than 10 of the year by the end of the century the combination of climate impacts and hardening of the shoreline significantly reduced beach accessibility fig 10 accessibility was greatest under the realign hybrid and hold the line policy scenarios and the most limited access occurred under the status quo and laissez faire scenarios beach nourishment in the hold the line scenario was ineffective under the medium and high impact climate scenarios as the extension of bps onto the beach in response to higher twls prevented the maintenance of accessibility under the realign and hybrid policy scenarios the prevention of new bps construction and relocation of impacted buildings preserved accessibility while under the status quo and laissez faire policy scenarios bps reduced accessibility by mid century because the projected population growth rate in tillamook county is relatively low current infrastructure was considered sufficient to accommodate the projected growth within this analysis the length of road impacted by erosion not shown was greatest in the realign and hybrid policy scenarios 15 km as a result of lack of new bps construction in contrast the length of road impacted by flooding was greatest in the laissez faire policy scenario 23 km as a result of increased twls due to beach narrowing caused by the presence of bps overall options that relocate people away from the shoreline or preserve current geomorphic conditions through nourishment provide higher accessibility to beaches and roads through time a model sensitivity analysis presented in appendix a suggests that improvement in coastal hazards modeling techniques could potentially refine and improve results because landscape metrics were sensitive to values used to parameterize policies model results are estimates of landscape trajectories rather than projections of future values however consistent parameterization between policy scenarios allows for comparative analysis of management strategies under a range of climate change scenarios 4 4 assumptions limitations and constraints due to the co developed scope of the envisioning tillamook county coastal futures project lipiec et al 2018 a number of limitations and constraints were imposed during the data development and simulation phases of this alternative futures analysis these include 1 only datasets that were available for the entire tillamook county study area were employed in the analysis 2 the same policy sets were applied in each community no sub regional differences in policies were considered 3 population growth was assumed to be the same in all policy scenarios and was based on only county wide estimates of population growth for each county provided by the oregon office of economic analysis 4 no demographic shifts or corresponding shifts in choice behavior were considered throughout the analysis period 5 while a probabilistic failure model was considered there was no accounting for bps failure i e no erosion could take place once a bps was constructed 6 the model capturing yearly maximum inundation extent was binary the polygon was either flooded or not and did not account for wave forces upon structures polygons within the potential inundation erosion extent were refined from tax lot size to 100 m by 10 m resolution to better capture coastal hazard impacts 7 scarcity of resources e g sediment required for beach nourishment was not accounted for 8 this project did not include the effects of estuarine flooding on the landscape 9 this work predominately explored traditional structural solutions to erosion hazards future work being considered for the region will include more detailed coastal flooding approaches and will explore scenarios focused on optimizing ecosystem services throughout the landscape such as via the planting of various species of beach grasses along the dune for sediment entrapment zarnetske et al 2012 5 conclusions tillamook county oregon like many coastal communities will increasingly be faced with the impacts of climate change including sea level rise shifts in storminess patterns and possible changes in the frequency and magnitude of el niño events this paper presents a transferable methodology for comparing the effectiveness of coastal hazard adaptation policy decisions under a range of climate impact scenarios using the agent based modeling framework envision combined within envision were three distinct submodels used to represent change processes in the underlying landscape including a submodel which permits the probabilistic simulation of total water levels to capture flooding and erosion hazards in addition five policy scenarios were co developed with local stakeholders to represent a range of plausible management strategies simulated future landscapes resulting from physical and human drivers were compared both on a county wide scale and within individual communities using a set of metrics related to development property risk and public good the alternative future scenarios explored here were intended as bounds within which researchers stakeholders and policy makers can build shared problem understandings foster agreement around certain desirable and undesirable future outcomes explore trade offs and analyze policy options under different future climates for example tradeoffs must be considered when utilizing riprap revetments to reduce the risk of erosion hazards this analysis indicates that while these structures halt the impacts of erosion to backshore infrastructure they may simultaneously reduce beach accessibility through the modification of beach morphology and a coincident increase of total water levels and can substantially increase flooding hazards if the crest elevation of the structures is limited so as not to negatively impact the viewshed the approach described here can help coastal resource managers consider climate change adaptation and mitigation options by incorporating a greater understanding of the risks of sea level rise and other climate impacts under a range of management options methods outlined here to characterize the magnitude uncertainty and spatial variability of coastal flooding and erosion as well as potential changes in property exposure to these hazards provide insight on changes in hazard exposure over time while no alternative future presented in this analysis is presumed to forecast the future landscape in tillamook county or the range of futures allows comparative analysis of a suite of management solutions and their estimated costs in order to evaluate their effectiveness with respect to the changing coastal climate and to facilitate a dialog surrounding climate change adaptation planning towards resilience in this hazard prone region furthermore this approach can assist in the balancing of community development with long term sustainability and resilience in a manner that is feasible flexible and transferable among many growing coastal communities acknowledgements this

related to human decision making to determine the usefulness of the model under uncertain policy parameterization the landscape metrics described above were used to evaluate model sensitivity to various policy triggers for each parameter used in the model a minimum and maximum value was simulated in addition to the baseline under a medium impact climate scenario baseline or best guess values were determined predominately based upon conversations with stakeholders or using historic current values when available all population parameters were based on the current distribution of people across the tillamook county landscape parameter minima and maxima were intended to capture the possible range of the parameter in order to address the uncertainty within many of the parameters in lieu of a full monte carlo analysis the model was considered to be sensitive to a policy or socioeconomic parameter if the value of a metric i e buildings impacted by flooding differed from the baseline policy scenario value by more than 10 under a medium impact climate scenario of particular interest was how each of the policy parameters impacted exposure to erosion and flooding hazards under the status quo policy scenario fig 11 the only parameter to which the number of buildings impacted by erosion was sensitive to was development preference near the coastline figure left a larger growth rate near the coast increased the population at risk of erosion hazards the lack of sensitivity in metrics related to erosion indicates that the triggers for policies related to bps were fairly robust buildings impacted by flooding indicated higher sensitivity to policy parameters fig 13 right for instance both the frequency of maintenance and construction height of bps impacted the exposure to flooding hazards at varying magnitudes throughout the century height of bps construction was most important early in the century when twls were lower on average due to the combined effects of slr wave climate and geomorphology during this period the heights of new bps or elevated bps were more sensitive to whether the design was specified based on either the average yearly maximum twl or the greatest of the recent yearly maximum twls furthermore the sensitivity of the model to policy parameters was asymmetric raising one parameter may have no effect whereas lowering that same parameter may significantly impact a metric this was true with the policy parameters related to allocation of growth fig 11 example of sensitivity analysis for the status quo policy scenario for policy parameters included in two policies 1 determine urban community growth boundaries u cgb in accordance with present day policy and 2 maintain current bps and allow more bps to be built on eligible lots the number of buildings impacted by flooding left and erosion right per year averaged over the decade prior to 2040 2060 and 2100 blue indicates the minimum parameter value and red indicates the maximum parameter value the model was considered sensitive to the policy parameter if the metric was altered by more than 10 fig 11 time series of buildings impacted by hazards were also used to evaluate sensitivity over time under the hybrid policy scenario fig 12 flooding metrics were only sensitive to the frequency of flooding trigger required to first relocate the building to the safest location within the taxlot or parcel and following further impacts by flooding in the new location to relocate that building outside of the coastal hazard zone through an easement fig 12 left because the metrics shown in fig 12 were so sensitive to the frequency of hazard exposure the ability to model the force and depth of inundation events would be an improvement upon the current flooding trigger both flooding and erosion metrics were found to be sensitive to the frequency of flooding impacts required prior to relocation of buildings conversion into easements however this sensitivity was again asymmetric with greater sensitivity to raising the threshold for relocation and movement of population and buildings outside of the hazard zone fig 12 sensitivity of the number of buildings impacted by flooding left and number of buildings impacted by erosion right to the frequency of flooding and erosion impacts under the hybrid policy scenario and medium impact climate scenario the dashed lines surrounding the baseline metric value indicate the range of the metric using the minimum higher dashed line and maximum lower dashed line estimate in the figure on the left the green line is hardly visible as the variability caused by that trigger is minimal fig 12 in total 16 policies were modeled using 25 different policy parameters 11 of which were considered significant using the aforementioned threshold in general there were four categories of sensitive parameters including those related to bps characteristics beach nourishment frequency and cost criteria for easements and population allocation in this application the model is insensitive to policies focused on restricting new development because the projected county growth rate in the county was relatively slow a full discussion of model sensitivity can be found in mills 2015 
26320,coupled models of coastal hazards ecosystems socioeconomics and landscape management in conjunction with alternative scenario analysis provide tools that can allow decision makers to explore effects of policy decisions under uncertain futures here we describe the development and assessment of a set of model based alternative future scenarios examining climate and population driven landscape dynamics for a coastal region in the u s pacific northwest these scenarios incorporated coupled spatiotemporal models of climate and coastal hazards population and development and policy and assessed a variety of landscape metrics for each scenario coastal flooding and erosion were probabilistically simulated using 99 future 95 year climate scenarios five policy scenarios were iteratively co developed by researchers and stakeholders in tillamook county oregon results suggest that both climate change and management decisions have a significant impact across the landscape and can potentially impact geographic regions at different magnitudes and timescales keywords climate change adaptation planning coastal community resilience coastal flooding coastal hazards envision

simulations of alternative futures can ultimately help identify the most important interactions across spatial and temporal scales leading to improved understanding of the structure and behavior of these systems by researchers and stakeholders alike here we present a transferrable methodology for development and evaluation of alternative futures with respect to coastal flooding and erosion in tillamook county oregon within a spatially explicit multi paradigm model integration framework first the background establishes the historic climatologic and socioeconomic baseline in tillamook county followed by a discussion of the modeling platform used envision and the development of a suite of probabilistic climate change scenarios that reflect various assumptions regarding slr wave height and major enso occurrences and their impact on future total water levels twls in addition the methodology details the five policy scenarios that were developed iteratively with a group of stakeholders to capture a range of landscape management options finally the resulting alternative futures are evaluated using a suite of landscape metrics and the benefits and drawbacks of various adaptation strategies under a range of climate scenarios are explored along with an analysis of the model sensitivity to parameterization of the human system 2 coastal tillamook county oregon roughly 23 percent of tillamook county s approximately 25 320 permanent residents live within a half mile of the pacific ocean fig 1 u s census bureau 2014 the 104 km including the estuarine shoreline coastline also draws visitors and non permanent residents alike coastal geomorphology varies from sandy dune backed beaches which compose the majority of the shoreline 55 to cliffs 21 to bluff backed beaches 11 to sandy beaches backed by rip rap revetments 8 and cobble and boulder beaches adjacent to headlands less than 5 headlands restrict alongshore sediment transport between four littoral cells which are further divided by estuaries fig 1 an increase in coastal hazards over the past few decades within tillamook county can be attributed to three main climatological drivers slr increases in wave heights related to winter storms and the frequency of major enso events komar et al 2011 found rates of relative slr of approximately 1 3 mm per year along the central to northern oregon coast between 1980 and 2010 further the pacific northwest is exposed to extreme extratropical storms with winter waves regularly reaching heights in excess of 8 m allan and komar 2006 ruggiero et al 2010 found a trend of increasing wave heights along the oregon coast with the annual mean increasing at a rate of 1 5 cm per year the winter mean increasing at a rate of 2 3 cm per year and annual maximum wave heights increasing at a rate of 9 5 cm per year over a three decade period in addition recent major el niño events i e 1997 1998 2009 2010 resulted in severe flooding and erosion in the region sallenger et al 2012 at present over 65 of the tillamook county outer coastline is erosional with approximately 40 of the coast eroding at rates exceeding 1 m per year ruggiero et al 2013 3 envision framework envision bolte et al 2007 is a multi paradigm model integration platform which couples landscape process models with socioeconomic drivers and management strategies to explore trajectories of change through time via a variety of metrics fig 2 envision has been used to characterize floodplain trajectories hulse et al 2009 land use planning and impacts of urban expansion guzy et al 2008 wu et al

coupled human natural systems envision s support for mixed simulations incorporating conventional models and decision making actors allows exploring the complexity of landscape patterns that result when decision making entities and their policies are included as part of evolving landscapes alternative futures analysis within envision involves three primary aspects 1 dataset development 2 model development and integration and 3 policy scenario development dataset development occurs in conjunction with stakeholder engagement subsequent to the determination of relevant evaluative metrics all datasets must be spatially explicit e g census tracks geomorphologic parameters envision enables spatial temporal simulation of landscape change through the synchronization of multiple submodels envision includes a multi agent modeling subsystem to represent human decisions on the landscape a set of actors operate across the landscape by selecting and applying policies in response to landscape signals and other factors influencing their decision making behavior in envision actors can be based on individuals collections of individuals or abstractions with no real world counterpart in the case of our application of envision to tillamook county actors represent the collection of individuals associated with county defined tax lots the application of a policy by an actor results in changes of landscape attributes policies decision rules contain information about site attributes defining where the policy can be considered and outcomes that the policy is intended to accomplish 3 1 envision simulation during simulation envision generates a set of both spatially detailed and spatially aggregated landscape evaluators reflecting scenario outcomes for a variety of metrics most notably development land use patterns shoreline modifications population projections and impacts to the landscape by coastal hazards these landscape metrics indirectly introduce feedbacks into the system by quantifying the actor or policy s impact on the landscape the sections below describe 1 how tillamook county was represented geospatially 2 the submodels used to simulate coastal hazards population growth and development and 3 the development of climate change and policy scenarios 3 2 geospatial representation of the landscape a landscape in envision consists of a set of spatial containers or polygons termed integrated decision units idus that specify the resolution at which processes and actors can operate on the landscape for this study the 2900 km2 study area of tillamook county was divided into approximately 130 000 idus areas of the idus range from less than 50 square meters to greater than 10 square kilometers the idus were formed through the intersection of multiple geometric layers representing baseline data the baseline geometry for the idu layer were county defined tax lots with underlying information including ownership zoning and presence of a dwelling or building each idu has a unique set of attributes relevant to the landscape and evaluative models taxlots near the shoreline were further subdivided using a 100 m alongshore by 10 m cross shore grid to more accurately resolve coastal flooding and erosion hazards 3 3 submodels submodels or plug ins periodically change the underlying landscape reflecting biophysical processes that occur independently of human action the modular architecture of envision allows for the inclusion of any number of compliant submodels the submodels used within this case study in coastal tillamook county or are described below while the coastal flooding and change hazards models implemented in envision are relatively simple the approach was designed to be modular and allows for the use of more sophisticated models when warranted 3 3 1 probabilistic simulation of total water levels probabilistic simulations of total water levels twls were used to derive coastal flooding and erosion submodels along the outer coast twls are calculated as a linear superposition of the tide non tidal residual and wave induced runup allan and komar 2006 ruggiero 2013 ruggiero et al 2010 1 t w l m s l η a η n t r r where msl is the mean sea level η a is the deterministic astronomical tide and η n t r is the nontidal residual generated by a range of physical processes including wind setup barometric surge and low frequency water level anomalies r the 2 exceedance level of the vertical extent of wave runup on a beach or structure above some datum was calculated using the empirical model of stockdon et al 2006 on dune backed sandy beaches and the modified taw technical advisory committee for water retaining structures van der meer 2002 allan et al 2015 approach on beaches backed by bluffs cobble berms and backshore protection structures bps i e riprap revetments using the total water level full simulation model twl fsm developed by serafin and ruggiero 2014 probabilistic time series of wave height wave period wave direction msl η a and η n t r allowed for the incorporation of variability and non stationarity within climate change scenarios these twl parameters were generated for a deep water location not affected by shoaling or refraction processes as such it was necessary to then propagate the waves toward the nearshore using regional bathymetry because the numerical transformation of waves is computationally expensive over a large study region lookup tables were developed to relate offshore deep water triplets of significant wave height swh peak period tp and mean wave direction mwd to their nearshore 20 m water depth equivalents using radial basis functions camus et al 2011 the wave climatology was discretized into representative wave conditions which were transformed to the nearshore garcía medina et al 2013 using stationary model runs of swan booij et al 1999 this allows for any combination of a deep water triplet s nearshore equivalent to be interpolated from the results of the swan model runs wave runup parameterization stockdon et al 2006 van der meer 2002 relies on the deep water equivalent swh and tp as inputs so transformed waves were linearly back shoaled from the 20 m contour to deep water these transformed deep water waves were ultimately used to generate twl conditions in combination with 100 m alongshore resolution geomorphology including backshore beach slope defined as the slope between the mhw shoreline contour and the dune toe dune crest and dune toe which were extracted from a combination of 2009 lidar data from oregon department of geology and mineral industries dogami and 2011 lidar data from u s army corps of engineers using techniques developed by mull and ruggiero 2014 3 3 2 coastal flooding to reduce computational complexity flooding within envision was calculated only for the maximum yearly twl event using a bathtub type inundation model which considers only two variables the inundation level and ground elevation schmid et al 2014 the coastal hazards submodel allows for selection of alongshore variable yearly maxima such that different storms throughout the year may produce the maximum twl event for each alongshore location depending upon local geomorphic and climatic conditions because of the simplicity of the bathtub model twls at inlets were reduced to reflect a combination of non tidal residual and tide only while the full twl was used for the remainder of the coastline flooding occurred only if the dune or bps crest was overtopped by the twl to determine pathways of flooding in the backshore hydraulic connectivity between individual idus was determined using a 1 m resolution digital elevation model dem 3 3 3 coastal erosion coastal retreat is evaluated following baron et al 2015 as 2 coastal erosion c c r s b c c r c l i m a t e t c c e v e n t where ccrsb is the long term interannual to decadal scale coastal change rate ccrclimate is the coastal change rate associated with slr t is time in years and ccevent is the event based erosion associated with the maximum yearly twl within the model erosion was restricted to dune backed beaches as failure of bps and bluff cliff erosion was not modeled extrapolating an end point shoreline change rate 1967 2002 was used to capture continued erosion associated with the regional sediment budget c c r s b ruggiero et al 2013 the influence of slr on erosion was characterized using the bruun rule bruun 1962 given a yearly rise in slr the yearly landward shoreline retreat was found as follows 3 c c r c l i m a t e l b h c s l r s l r t a n β s f where l is the cross shore distance to the water depth hc b is the elevation of a backshore feature bps or dune and tan β s f is the shoreface slope computed between mean high water line mhw 2 1 m contour relative to navd88 and hc taken here to be the 25 m isobath on dune backed beaches the shoreface slope remained static through time as the dune eroded landward while the dune toe elevation rose at the rate of slr on beaches backed by bps the beach was assumed to narrow at the rate of the total chronic erosion c c r s b c c r c l i m a t e beaches were further narrowed in the process of maintaining i e raising to accommodate higher twls and constructing bps structures at a 2 1 slope coastal retreat during large winter storm events or periods of elevated water levels was also modeled in the form of wave induced foredune erosion in which the magnitude of erosion depends on the elevation of the twl relative to the toe of the foredune ruggiero et al 2001 sallenger 2000 stockdon et al 2006 based on the model suitability study of mull and ruggiero 2014 a modification of the foredune erosion model presented by kriebel and dean 1993 was implemented within the coastal hazards submodel the event scale dune erosion model assumes that the volume of sediment eroded from the foredune during a storm is deposited in the nearshore as the equilibrium profile shifts as follows 4 c c e v e n t t d t s t w l max y e a r l y m h w x b h b t a n β f d h i g h m h w h b t w l max y e a r l y m h w 2 where t d is the storm duration t s is the erosion response time scale x b is the surf zone width measured from the mhw position using an equilibrium profile dean 1991 h b is the breaking wave water depth relative to mhw t a n β f is the beach slope and d h i g h is the elevation of the dune crest calculating c c e v e n t for a particular storm required scaling the erosion response using a ratio of the erosion response time scale t s to the storm duration t d t s is theoretically dependent upon the ability of sediment to withstand erosive wave forces and was calculated as a function of h b and d h i g h kriebel and dean 1993 a mean storm event duration approximately 10 h in which the twl is elevated above mhw was used for the entire study region calculated using an alongshore averaged value using the 30 year event record developed by serafin and ruggiero 2014 3 3 4 population growth while the allocation of people and development varied based upon policies articulated within policy scenarios the mechanisms for that allocation remained constant across all alternative future scenarios within envision two models were used to simulate the spatial pattern of population growth and subsequent development processes across the landscape of tillamook county an envision submodel target envision developer s manual 2015 was used to allocate new population growth at the idu level specific data required for this analysis included tax lot coverage zoning data and maximum capacities for each zone type census data and information regarding growth rates target allocates population at some overall study wide growth rate onto the polygonal idu landscape through the creation and examination of two surfaces 1 a current population density surface and 2 a population capacity surface the population capacity surface represents build out population density of the idu based on zoning class the allocation of growth involves an idu by idu evaluation of existing population and of the capacity for new population new population is spatially allocated proportionally to the difference between the existing density and the capacity surface resulting in the model moving the existing density surface towards the capacity surface this function was modified by introducing weighted preference factors e g a preference to locate near the coastline into the allocations these preference factors modify the differences between the existing density surface and capacity surface based on underlying idu values defined via a spatial query associated with the preference and were estimated based on past growth patterns in the study area in lieu of idu level population data initial idu population density was estimated from the 2010 census at the block group level a single projection of population growth from the oregon office of economic analysis through 2050 was used across all policy scenarios subsequent to 2050 a constant population growth rate was used allocating a total of approximately 12 000 new residents into the county by 2100 oregon office of economic analysis 2013 because no spatially explicit projections of population growth exist for the tillamook county study area urban growth areas and community growth areas were assumed to maintain a constant fraction of the county wide population through 2100 while still allowing geographic preferences between policy scenarios 3 3 5 development new development was allocated to the landscape based on the population growth rate in a separate envision submodel developer envision developer s manual 2015 the number of people per dwelling unit varied by town or city and also by distance from the coast many coastal dwellings are owned as non primary homes therefore the number of people per dwelling unit is much lower than the number of people per dwelling unit in areas further from the coast for each pre defined area new population growth determines the number of new dwelling units required and within each idu the dwelling unit capacity was based on the population density at each time step this capacity was used to generate a sorted list based on the greatest discrepancy between population density and number of existing dwelling units dwelling units were allocated until the entire new population for that time step was accommodated finally a hedonic pricing model e g bin et al 2008 was used to determine the value of new development as follows 5 a s s e

probability of occurrence of major el niño events from the year 2005 through 2099 accounted for uncertainty in climate projections and served as climate impact scenarios first projections from the national research council s sea level rise for the coasts of california oregon and washington 2012 were used to define three slr scenarios low medium and high fig 3 the nrc 2012 report was used as it was well known to stakeholders during the project and was considered appropriate since it contains slr projections relevant for the us west coast while specific to oregon and washington bounds on the slr projections still maintained a high range of variability as they included a combination of regional steric and ocean dynamics cryosphere and fingerprinting effects and vertical land motion next projected changes in the wave climate were based on significant wave height swh distributions developed from the variability of statistically and dynamically downscaled projected global climate model estimates for the northeast pacific ocean hemer et al 2013 wang et al 2014 to account for the range in variability in the downscaled data the wave climate was allowed to increase or decrease across the various slr scenarios fig 3 finally water levels and wave heights are also affected by major el niño events which have been associated with severe flooding and erosion in the u s pacific northwest komar 1998 kaminsky et al 1998 barnard et al 2017 due to the uncertainty surrounding the changing occurrence of storms the frequency of major enso events was allowed to vary continuously between half of present day frequency once per two decades and double present day frequency these combinations of three slr scenarios wave climate variability and enso frequency projections were used to capture the inherent variability of the physical drivers thirty three probabilistic twl simulations for each high medium and low impact climate change scenario resulted in a total of 99 different 95 year projections of daily maximum twls 3 4 2 policy scenarios the alternative futuring process allowed for feedback and learning opportunities at several levels the first came through the utilization of the modeling framework envision as described above a second opportunity arose when the model design or results were used to interact with stakeholders to gain information with respect to decision making across the landscape to accomplish the latter a group of local stakeholders including representatives from state legislature community advisory committees city managers and mayors county commissioners and property owners among others were consulted to identify possible policy scenario narratives to be represented within envision this participatory modeling approach fostered an environment of ownership and understanding amongst both researchers and the stakeholder community and ensured that the co produced scenarios modeled were representative of a broad range of policy options more details describing the stakeholder interaction can be found in lipiec et al 2018 policies were developed based on discussions with stakeholders and reflect several categories including shoreline modifications and development restrictions each policy was modeled with as specific set of triggers or assumptions some of these triggers were based upon historic evidence while others that lacked concrete examples in the pacific northwest were generated and validated through collaboration with the stakeholders or a literature review for example in determining when buildings must be relocated within or removed entirely from parcels in response to hazards current policy language states that the building must require repairs equal to half of the value of the property i e a significant repairs requirement because the current version of the coastal hazards submodel computes flooding as a binary state and does not simulate flow depths and velocities the aforementioned threshold was impossible to capture in this particular case repetitive impact to buildings by coastal hazards provided a proxy for significant damage because the size of the study area precluded the use of more computationally expensive physics based flooding and erosion models sets of individual policies made up a total of four initial policy scenario narratives status quo hold the line realign and laissez faire in order for stakeholders to weigh tradeoffs and evaluate differences between scenarios table 1 each policy scenario narrative dictated how actors managed the landscape both in terms of how and where population growth and development were allocated and how people and resources were protected from coastal hazards a fifth policy scenario hybrid was generated through a ranking process in which stakeholders voted for preferred policies and scenarios based on initial results from the four initial policy scenarios each of the five policy scenarios was crossed with the 99 climate change impact scenarios resulting in 495 alternatives futures through which landscape metrics were evaluated to assess the relative effectiveness of management options 4 evaluating alternative futures with respect to landscape metrics while over 100 variables were tracked during simulations stakeholders identified a core set of metrics for the exploration of alternative futures within envision lipiec et al 2018 in general the most important metrics were related to 1 growth and development 2 exposure to coastal hazards and mitigation techniques 3 public good the following sections explore example metrics in each of these three categories as well as the relative difference in hazard impacts between individual communities see fig 4 4 1 metrics related to growth and development because many of the adaptation and land use management policies employed alter development patterns on the landscape growth and development were compared across the five different scenarios fig 4 illustrates the simulated trends involving development within the coastal hazard zone none of the five policy scenarios allocated more than 500 additional buildings within a coastal hazard zone determined by the oregon department of geology and mineral industries allan and priest 2001 with the laissez faire policy scenario allocating the greatest number due to the relaxation of growth boundaries and increased likelihood of development closer to the shoreline because the projected county wide growth rate was moderate 0 39 0 78 per year no community growth boundaries were filled to capacity in the hold the line policy scenario new growth in the hazard zone was limited primarily by a policy which permits construction only on the safest site within a parcel and secondarily by a policy which permits development only on beachfront properties eligible to construct bps table 1 the bounds of climate variability shaded areas within fig 4 were largest for the policy scenarios realign and hybrid which remove buildings and population from the coastal hazard zone through an easement process up to 1800 buildings were relocated to safer areas outside the hazard zone in the realign policy scenario under the mean of all high impact probabilistic climate twl scenarios fig 4 right approximately 500 fewer buildings are converted to easements in the mean low impact climate scenario in the hybrid policy scenario in which buildings are first relocated to the safest site of the parcel and then removed from the hazard zone if hazard exposure persists fewer properties were transitioned into easements than within the realign policy scenario these development patterns altered subsequent community exposure to coastal hazards 4 2 metrics related to hazard exposure metrics related to hazard exposure provided insight regarding 1 when homeowners will need bps to protect their property 2 how property will be impacted by coastal flooding and erosion hazards and 3 how costs of protecting property change over time within the five policy scenarios bps and beach nourishment were the only two coastal engineering mechanisms hard and soft considered for the protection of backshore development to protect property from erosion most beachfront property owners would need to armor their properties prior to 2040 according to simulation results fig 5 more bps were constructed in the laissez faire policy scenario than in the other policy scenarios as restrictions related to bps construction permitting were eliminated fig 6 in the realign and hybrid policy scenarios further armoring of the shoreline was prevented thus the percent of shoreline hardened was constant through time in rockaway beach a maximum of 80 of the shoreline was hardened as the community was predominately developed by the end of the century fig 6 left county wide however no policy scenario armored more than 30 of the entire shoreline as population along most of the coast was still relatively sparse by 2100 fig 6 right variability due to climate scenarios altered the extent of armored coastline by no more than 10 as a result of shoreline armoring the number of properties exposed to event based erosion through time was reduced in three of the five policy scenarios fig 7 right the sharp reduction in the number of buildings impacted by event based erosion is due to either the construction of bps or the formation of easements early in the century the laissez faire policy scenario resulted in the fewest number of buildings impacted by erosion event based or long term as property owners constructed bps regardless of current eligibility status variability in the number of buildings impacted by event based erosion was minimal between climate impact scenarios the lack of bps construction in the realign and hybrid policy scenarios resulted in greater impacts to buildings by erosion and greater variability with respect to climate scenarios in addition to the buildings exposed to event based erosion buildings were removed by the long term shoreline change rate due to both sea level rise and sediment budget factors once the toe of the dune moved landward of the building fig 7 left under policy scenarios in which bps construction was permitted but limited based on current oregon laws up to 45 buildings were lost due to long term shoreline change under the realign and hybrid policy scenarios buildings were removed via easements and thus were not lost due to chronic erosion the value of property impacted by flooding was assessed under both low and high impact climate scenarios fig 8 near the end of the century there was greater variability in the low climate impact scenario than in the high impact scenario although in general more property was impacted by flooding in the high impact climate scenario and is more than doubled under the laissez faire policy scenario the decrease in variability within the high slr scenario was due to the exceedance of a flooding threshold by approximately mid century after which the combined effects of slr and geomorphologic change resulted in the frequent to persistent inundation of property within the coastal hazard zone the increase of property impacted by flooding during the first half of the century was in response to the construction and maintenance of bps because bps prevented any landward migration of the dune the long term erosion rate due to both sediment budget factors and to slr causes the beach to narrow thus increasing twls while homeowners were able to build up bps in response to rising twls they were limited by the elevation of the property and a requirement to maintain a viable viewshed in addition raising the elevation of the structure crest forced the extension of the structure horizontally further narrowing the beach thus the presence of bps increased beach slope often increasing exposure to coastal flooding in this analysis bps were predominately unsuccessful at reducing flooding hazards within tillamook county the highest value of property impacted by flooding occurred under the laissez faire policy scenario both because bps construction was permitted without restriction and because the rate of new development near the shoreline was elevated in the realign and hybrid policy scenarios fewer flooding impacts occurred by 2100 compared to the other policy scenarios due to both the relocation of people and development away from coastal hazard zones and the limitation of further bps construction variability within these two policy scenarios realign and hybrid with respect to climate was also the smallest towards the end of the century because most of the population and buildings within the hazard zones are relocated through the formation of easements policies that move people and buildings away from coastal hazards were most successful in protecting property from flooding impacts whereas policies that permit the construction of bps protect property from erosion impacts comparing costs of policy scenarios over time allows for the evaluation of tradeoffs fig 9 bps construction and maintenance costs in the status quo and hold the line policy scenarios were similar early in the century but diverged towards the end of the century as nourishment offset some of the costs of raising bps to account for higher twls the greatest expenditures for both bps construction and maintenance occurred under the laissez faire policy scenario costing 250 million between 2010 and 2100 2 5 million per year the hold the line and realign policy scenarios were most expensive 300 million as a result of nourishment and the creation of easements under the assumption that the assessed value of the property was equal to the cost of easement creation respectively 4 3 metrics related to public good metrics related to public good include 1 the extent of shoreline that was accessible to recreation and 2 the length of road that was impacted by coastal hazards within the context of this analysis beach accessibility was defined as the ability to walk run ride etc the beach alongshore evaluated every 100 m based on stakeholder input particular sections of beach were considered inaccessible when the maximum daily twl reached the toe of the dune or structure more than 10 of the year by the end of the century the combination of climate impacts and hardening of the shoreline significantly reduced beach accessibility fig 10 accessibility was greatest under the realign hybrid and hold the line policy scenarios and the most limited access occurred under the status quo and laissez faire scenarios beach nourishment in the hold the line scenario was ineffective under the medium and high impact climate scenarios as the extension of bps onto the beach in response to higher twls prevented the maintenance of accessibility under the realign and hybrid policy scenarios the prevention of new bps construction and relocation of impacted buildings preserved accessibility while under the status quo and laissez faire policy scenarios bps reduced accessibility by mid century because the projected population growth rate in tillamook county is relatively low current infrastructure was considered sufficient to accommodate the projected growth within this analysis the length of road impacted by erosion not shown was greatest in the realign and hybrid policy scenarios 15 km as a result of lack of new bps construction in contrast the length of road impacted by flooding was greatest in the laissez faire policy scenario 23 km as a result of increased twls due to beach narrowing caused by the presence of bps overall options that relocate people away from the shoreline or preserve current geomorphic conditions through nourishment provide higher accessibility to beaches and roads through time a model sensitivity analysis presented in appendix a suggests that improvement in coastal hazards modeling techniques could potentially refine and improve results because landscape metrics were sensitive to values used to parameterize policies model results are estimates of landscape trajectories rather than projections of future values however consistent parameterization between policy scenarios allows for comparative analysis of management strategies under a range of climate change scenarios 4 4 assumptions limitations and constraints due to the co developed scope of the envisioning tillamook county coastal futures project lipiec et al 2018 a number of limitations and constraints were imposed during the data development and simulation phases of this alternative futures analysis these include 1 only datasets that were available for the entire tillamook county study area were employed in the analysis 2 the same policy sets were applied in each community no sub regional differences in policies were considered 3 population growth was assumed to be the same in all policy scenarios and was based on only county wide estimates of population growth for each county provided by the oregon office of economic analysis 4 no demographic shifts or corresponding shifts in choice behavior were considered throughout the analysis period 5 while a probabilistic failure model was considered there was no accounting for bps failure i e no erosion could take place once a bps was constructed 6 the model capturing yearly maximum inundation extent was binary the polygon was either flooded or not and did not account for wave forces upon structures polygons within the potential inundation erosion extent were refined from tax lot size to 100 m by 10 m resolution to better capture coastal hazard impacts 7 scarcity of resources e g sediment required for beach nourishment was not accounted for 8 this project did not include the effects of estuarine flooding on the landscape 9 this work predominately explored traditional structural solutions to erosion hazards future work being considered for the region will include more detailed coastal flooding approaches and will explore scenarios focused on optimizing ecosystem services throughout the landscape such as via the planting of various species of beach grasses along the dune for sediment entrapment zarnetske et al 2012 5 conclusions tillamook county oregon like many coastal communities will increasingly be faced with the impacts of climate change including sea level rise shifts in storminess patterns and possible changes in the frequency and magnitude of el niño events this paper presents a transferable methodology for comparing the effectiveness of coastal hazard adaptation policy decisions under a range of climate impact scenarios using the agent based modeling framework envision combined within envision were three distinct submodels used to represent change processes in the underlying landscape including a submodel which permits the probabilistic simulation of total water levels to capture flooding and erosion hazards in addition five policy scenarios were co developed with local stakeholders to represent a range of plausible management strategies simulated future landscapes resulting from physical and human drivers were compared both on a county wide scale and within individual communities using a set of metrics related to development property risk and public good the alternative future scenarios explored here were intended as bounds within which researchers stakeholders and policy makers can build shared problem understandings foster agreement around certain desirable and undesirable future outcomes explore trade offs and analyze policy options under different future climates for example tradeoffs must be considered when utilizing riprap revetments to reduce the risk of erosion hazards this analysis indicates that while these structures halt the impacts of erosion to backshore infrastructure they may simultaneously reduce beach accessibility through the modification of beach morphology and a coincident increase of total water levels and can substantially increase flooding hazards if the crest elevation of the structures is limited so as not to negatively impact the viewshed the approach described here can help coastal resource managers consider climate change adaptation and mitigation options by incorporating a greater understanding of the risks of sea level rise and other climate impacts under a range of management options methods outlined here to characterize the magnitude uncertainty and spatial variability of coastal flooding and erosion as well as potential changes in property exposure to these hazards provide insight on changes in hazard exposure over time while no alternative future presented in this analysis is presumed to forecast the future landscape in tillamook county or the range of futures allows comparative analysis of a suite of management solutions and their estimated costs in order to evaluate their effectiveness with respect to the changing coastal climate and to facilitate a dialog surrounding climate change adaptation planning towards resilience in this hazard prone region furthermore this approach can assist in the balancing of community development with long term sustainability and resilience in a manner that is feasible flexible and transferable among many growing coastal communities acknowledgements this

online data online data appendix a supplementary data supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j envsoft 2018 07 022 appendix a model sensitivity to parameters related to human decision making to determine the usefulness of the model under uncertain policy parameterization the landscape metrics described above were used to evaluate model sensitivity to various policy triggers for each parameter used in the model a minimum and maximum value was simulated in addition to the baseline under a medium impact climate scenario baseline or best guess values were determined predominately based upon conversations with stakeholders or using historic current values when available all population parameters were based on the current distribution of people across the tillamook county landscape parameter minima and maxima were intended to capture the possible range of the parameter in order to address the uncertainty within many of the parameters in lieu of a full monte carlo analysis the model was considered to be sensitive to a policy or socioeconomic parameter if the value of a metric i e buildings impacted by flooding differed from the baseline policy scenario value by more than 10 under a medium impact climate scenario of particular interest was how each of the policy parameters impacted exposure to erosion and flooding hazards under the status quo policy scenario fig 11 the only parameter to which the number of buildings impacted by erosion was sensitive to was development preference near the coastline figure left a larger growth rate near the coast increased the population at risk of erosion hazards the lack of sensitivity in metrics related to erosion indicates that the triggers for policies related to bps were fairly robust buildings impacted by flooding indicated higher sensitivity to policy parameters fig 13 right for instance both the frequency of maintenance and construction height of bps impacted the exposure to flooding hazards at varying magnitudes throughout the century height of bps construction was most important early in the century when twls were lower on average due to the combined effects of slr wave climate and geomorphology during this period the heights of new bps or elevated bps were more sensitive to whether the design was specified based on either the average yearly maximum twl or the greatest of the recent yearly maximum twls furthermore the sensitivity of the model to policy parameters was asymmetric raising one parameter may have no effect whereas lowering that same parameter may significantly impact a metric this was true with the policy parameters related to allocation of growth fig 11 example of sensitivity analysis for the status quo policy scenario for policy parameters included in two policies 1 determine urban community growth boundaries u cgb in accordance with present day policy and 2 maintain current bps and allow more bps to be built on eligible lots the number of buildings impacted by flooding left and erosion right per year averaged over the decade prior to 2040 2060 and 2100 blue indicates the minimum parameter value and red indicates the maximum parameter value the model was considered sensitive to the policy parameter if the metric was altered by more than 10 fig 11 time series of buildings impacted by hazards were also used to evaluate sensitivity over time under the hybrid policy scenario fig 12 flooding metrics were only sensitive to the frequency of flooding trigger required to first relocate the building to the safest location within the taxlot or parcel and following further impacts by flooding in the new location to relocate that building outside of the coastal hazard zone through an easement fig 12 left because the metrics shown in fig 12 were so sensitive to the frequency of hazard exposure the ability to model the force and depth of inundation events would be an improvement upon the current flooding trigger both flooding and erosion metrics were found to be sensitive to the frequency of flooding impacts required prior to relocation of buildings conversion into easements however this sensitivity was again asymmetric with greater sensitivity to raising the threshold for relocation and movement of population and buildings outside of the hazard zone fig 12 sensitivity of the number of buildings impacted by flooding left and number of buildings impacted by erosion right to the frequency of flooding and erosion impacts under the hybrid policy scenario and medium impact climate scenario the dashed lines surrounding the baseline metric value indicate the range of the metric using the minimum higher dashed line and maximum lower dashed line estimate in the figure on the left the green line is hardly visible as the variability caused by that trigger is minimal fig 12 in total 16 policies were modeled using 25 different policy parameters 11 of which were considered significant using the aforementioned threshold in general there were four categories of sensitive parameters including those related to bps characteristics beach nourishment frequency and cost criteria for easements and population allocation in this application the model is insensitive to policies focused on restricting new development because the projected county growth rate in the county was relatively slow a full discussion of model sensitivity can be found in mills 2015

that occur when algal or cyanobacterial populations impact water quality and result in negative environmental or health consequences smayda 1997 cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohab occur worldwide and have been documented across the united states loftin et al 2016 u s states frequently issue health advisories or close recreational areas due to potential risks from cyanohab exposure graham et al 2009 cyanohabs may produce toxins and cause nuisance odors hypoxia unappealing surface scums undesirable finished drinking water increased drinking water treatment costs and economic and infrastructure costs such as loss of revenue from recreation and businesses that rely on appealing or potable water dodds et al 2009 steffensen 2008 new tools are needed to facilitate the development of reliable and cost effective monitoring programs at lake watershed state regional and national scales 1 2 management need many u s states experience challenges in developing cyanohab monitoring programs because of the need to cover large geographic areas with insufficient resources a single management agency often oversees numerous isolated lakes scattered across a large landscape water quality monitoring efforts also are constrained by the availability of personnel and limited financial resources presenting managers with a serious challenge in prioritizing water quality sampling regimes to best monitor dispersed waterbodies water quality managers need access to timely and consistent data to protect the designated and beneficial uses of water satellites can provide such data although satellite data has been available for a number of years historically few management decisions have been based on satellite information because data dissemination to water quality managers has been limited to either photographs or file formatted products that require specialized training to process images and interpret data managers would substantially benefit from software that reduces the barrier of accessing satellite data to facilitate better public and environmental health protection of water bodies timely and effective distribution of satellite derived data is necessary to provide warnings within days and seasonal assessments in the same calendar year managers responding to the immediate impacts of cyanohabs need timely useful and cost effective delivery of information from the satellite data schaeffer et al 2013 satellite remote sensing technology provides an ability to assess cyanohab abundance for spatially resolvable inland recreational and public water supplies using algal pigments as surrogates for hab and cyanohab abundance at sufficient spatial temporal resolution to detect changes in particular the european space agency copernicus program provides a new series of sentinel 3 ocean and land colour instruments berger et al 2012 donlon et al 2012 at 300 meter m pixel resolution suited for detecting cyanohab abundance changes frequency extent magnitude and duration in larger lakes clark et al 2017 urquhart et al 2017 1 3 current software status a number of ecological forecast software tools already exist related to harmful algal blooms and chlorophyll a that serve as a proxy for eutrophication status and phytoplankton biomass examples include forecasting with combined sonde mooring data and an artificial neural network coad et al 2014 varying the chlorophyll a to phytoplankton biomass ratio in a ce qual w2 water quality model sadeghian et al 2018 fuzzy logic models for algal bloom forecasts kim et al 2014 applying markov chain monte carlo bayesian modelling to understand nutrient and zooplankton controls on cyanobacteria malve et al 2007 integrated models to capture land use nutrient budgets meteorological and hydrological data to forecast cyanobacteria concentrations to inform adaptive management practices norton et al 2012 and a windows based software ecotaihu model integrates water quality measures and satellite data to predict cyanobacteria in lake taihu zhang et al 2013 however none of these existing software platforms provide the ability to visualize satellite derived water quality data directly or view time series of satellite data to inform decision making two primary scientific software packages traditionally are used for satellite data processing and analysis related to water quality satellite missions the u s software package is the national aeronautics and space administration nasa sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs data analysis system seadas baith et al 2001 an open source and free software package seadas is a comprehensive software package for the processing display analysis and quality control of a wide array of satellite data while the primary focus of seadas has historically been ocean color data it is applicable to other satellite based earth science data analyses such as inland and coastal water quality data the european software package is the sentinel application platform snap available from the european space agency snap also is an open source platform and focuses on the exploitation of earth observation data both software packages are desktop computer based and require some scientific knowledge in the field of ocean color remote sensing as well as sufficient computer hardware to handle the satellite images and processing capabilities in addition computer code language expertise typically in java or python is beneficial to batch process large numbers of satellite files these software packages produce derived water quality products such as cyanohab abundance however the software to date is not developed for repeated intuitive and rapid assessment of inland waters for cyanohab monitoring by a diverse variety of water quality managers and stakeholders therefore alternative software solutions are necessary to reduce the data access limitations and to reduce required management programmatic support schaeffer et al 2013 for satellite derived data on cyanohabs 1 4 mobile device application solution unlike previous software packages a mobile device application app would reduce the need for scientific expertise in ocean color interpretation and hardware requirements associated with the use of satellite data an app would provide intuitive ability through a graphical user interface gui to scan water bodies for changes in cyanohab abundance without expertise in computer programming or computer languages georeferenced data would allow managers to monitor their particular water bodies of interest without having to filter through numerous satellite images of water bodies not associated with their region managers could set query thresholds to identify if cyanohab abundance exceeds a certain limit in addition by using advanced alert systems an app would allow passive reception of data instead of active acquisition minimizing the amount of time commitment on behalf of the manager managers would benefit from multiple methods of notification through a mobile phone app that could for example change the colors of map pins based on previously set threshold levels in addition remote sensing data traditionally are provided as files covering an entire region with data for a particular moment in time an app would allow managers to select a single location of interest to quickly visualize the quantified cyanohab abundance value and a scaling capability would provide larger ecosystem context the ability to quickly query a single pixel location and obtain a time series of information has not been readily available for non technical users and is only now being addressed through time sensitive data formats such as data rods grant and gallaher 2015 teng et al 2016 with a mobile phone app in addition to obtaining a current cyanohab abundance value users would also obtain a time series of historical cyanohab values for the location of interest providing temporal context a software design allowing for a 70 30 contribution blend between scientist and managers which has previously been successful in the food industry ariely 2010 is an attempt to maximize ownership of the satellite data scientists provide 70 of data handling including processing geophysical product development basic assessment capabilities and delivery managers are responsible for about 30 of the information associated with their existing efforts such as setting thresholds identifying site locations and making decisions to take additional action based on available data this effort focuses on the development of a mobile platform data delivery app because mobile data access and mobile devices are more ubiquitous and already outpacing sales of traditional desktop computers globally more than 84 of the population lives in areas with mobile 3g or better data access ict 2016 with 75 smart phone adoption in north america accessing 4g and eventually 5g gsm association 2016b global smart phone and mobile data access is expected to reach 70 of the world population by 2020 gsm association 2016a we demonstrate the use of the cyanobacteria assessment network cyan app which uses information from the european space agency sentinel 3 satellite ocean and land colour imagers olci to create a cost effective timely and intuitive satellite data delivery system accessible through android 4 1 and above smartphones the seadas software package produces derived water quality products such as cyanohab abundance that are the processing backbone of the cyan app 2 materials and methods 2 1 copernicus sentinel 3 satellite ocean and land colour instruments full resolution 300 m at nadir the point directly below the satellite on the earth surface scenes from the european space agency s olci were obtained for the contiguous united states conus starting in 2016 standard olci level 1b data are archived at the nasa ocean color website https oceandata sci gsfc nasa gov the data were processed using the nasa standard ocean color satellite seadas processing software package version 7 4 baith et al 2001 and the shuttle radar topography mission srtm gc land mask carroll et al 2009 images were processed to albers equal area projection with nearest neighbor interpolation spectral albedo ρs λ was generated by removing rayleigh reflectances and molecular absorption from the top of atmosphere signal measured by the satellite clouds were masked using a spectral albedo threshold algorithm that accounts for turbid water to eliminate misidentification of pixels with bright reflectances resulting from intense blooms the ρs estimates were used to calculate the cyanobacteria index ci from the spectral shape algorithm centered on 681 nanometers nm ci ss 681 wynne et al 2008 and routinely used in lake erie stumpf et al 2016 the olci ci output for each image then was converted to cyanohab abundance in cells per milliliter cells ml 1 following wynne et al 2010 where cyanohab abundance 1 0 108 ci field validation of the ci algorithm was previously demonstrated clark et al 2017 lunetta et al 2015 tomlinson et al 2016 clark et al 2017 reported correspondence across the spectrum of cyanohab abundance ranges spanning 10 000 to 1 million cells ml mean absolute percentage error mape 28 6 coefficient of determination r2 0 95 satellite derived values below 109 000 cells ml and above 1 000 000 cells ml had correspondence of above 80 with in situ samples collected within 7 days of a satellite match up while the ci algorithm had lower correspondence performance between 109 000 and 1 000 000 cells ml this was expected due to the lack of validation data in this concentration range and the large temporal range for coincident satellite match ups lunetta et al 2015 the categorization of satellite derived ci values based on threshold levels as described below would further reduce the impact on algorithm error and uncertainties weekly 7 day composite images were created by retaining the maximum value detected for each pixel within the time period the use of a 7 day composite minimizes the impacts of cloud cover and maximizes the frequency of available data based on a typical work week to guide management decisions 2 2 thresholds cell counts and microcystin concentrations are commonly used to evaluate potential health risk and many states have customized thresholds based on additional information gathered locally graham et al 2009 for example oklahoma and massachusetts developed state specific guidelines to establish protective levels oklahoma issues warnings to lake users if cell counts exceed 100 000 cells ml 1 and microcystin concentrations exceed 20 μg l 1 massachusetts has established guidelines for issuing an advisory against contact with water when cell counts exceed 70 000 cells ml 1 or microcystin concentrations exceed 14 μg l 1 the world health organization who has a three level guideline approach which describes concentrations of the ubiquitous photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial cell abundance cells ml 1 to determine the level of associated risk to support a warning or closure who provides estimates of microcystin that could correspond to the cell abundance at each guideline level the u s environmental protection agency also has the drinking water health advisory for cyanobacteria microcystins toxin u s epa 2015 satellite observations cannot detect toxins stumpf et al 2016 but can quantify cyanohab abundance kutser 2009 cyanohab abundance is perhaps better suited for assessing nationwide risks due to limitations related to toxin monitoring clark et al 2017 therefore the cyan app allows for thresholds to be set based on user preferences of cyanohab abundance in cells ml 1 2 3 state advisor

drinking water intakes clark et al 2017 to be marked with color coded pins fig 3 a clark et al 2017 previously developed a method for quantifying resolvable lakes given a satellite sensor spatial resolution at nadir any water pixel adjacent to the land mask should be used with caution due to the potential for mixed land water pixels and land adjacency effects processing methods are being periodically updated to improve detection of invalid pixels national hydrography dataset plus version 2 0 nhdplusv2 lake polygons mckay et al 2012 with at least 3 valid water pixels were included as a resolvable waterbody in this study table s1 the pin color codes correspond to threshold levels selected by the end user from a swipe tab using sliding bars fig 3b the geographic coordinates tab permits end users to input specific latitude and longitude coordinates for locations such as monitoring stations recreational locations and public surface drinking water intakes users may mark locations on a base map remove locations view current cyanohab data and recent changes in abundance for marked locations select locations for comparison review and set category thresholds and view and clear notifications the notification tab permits administrators to send messages to all end users such as notices for software updates new data uploads acknowledgement of software bugs and information on events of national significance 4 2 case 2 locations locations are stored in a list for quick and easy comparison to visualize the current cyanohab abundance value and the change from the previously reported time step fig 4 a the user can visualize latitude and longitude coordinates of locations location names cyanohab values and recent changes selecting a listed location allows the user to view the marker pin on the map the satellite data origin and imagery thumbnails the end user first encounters the satellite images after selecting my location and clicking on the desired location within the list fig 4b the end user may select any satellite file that contains their locations of interest to view the entire satellite tile fig 5 a the cyan app allows the satellite tile to be downloaded to the mobile device as a png file for record keeping or for quick viewing in the app for spatial information the imagery subtab allows a user to filter the image list by satellite instrument filter the image list by date and select image s for overlay users can overlay images on the base map adjust the opacity of overlays and pan or zoom within image s the chart subtab permits users to view a time series plot of selected locations with supported time frames 4 3 case 3 comparison the comparison tab of the cyan app allows end users to temporally view changes in cyanohab abundance across multiple locations of interest for an annual rolling time period fig 5b this analysis requires selecting two or more locations for comparison as described under case 1 the user is

26321,cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohab cause human and ecological health problems in lakes worldwide the timely distribution of satellite derived cyanohab data is necessary for adaptive water quality management and for targeted deployment of water quality monitoring resources software platforms that permit timely useful and cost effective delivery of information from satellites are required to help managers respond to cyanohabs the cyanobacteria assessment network cyan mobile device application app uses data from the european space agency copernicus sentinel 3 satellite ocean and land colour instrument olci in near real time to make initial water quality assessments and quickly alert managers to potential problems and emerging threats related to cyanobacteria app functionality and satellite data were validated with 25 state health advisories issued in 2017 the cyan app provides water quality managers with a user friendly platform that reduces the complexities associated with accessing satellite data to allow fast efficient initial assessments across lakes keywords satellite water quality mobile device application harmful algal bloom cyanobacteria software

available to us departments of health and departments of environment state agencies upon request no cost 1 introduction 1 1 human and ecological health problems from cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms water quality is a critical consideration in determining water resource availability for human consumption aquatic life and recreation u s epa 2013 harmful algal blooms are environmental events that occur when algal or cyanobacterial populations impact water quality and result in negative environmental or health consequences smayda 1997 cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohab occur worldwide and have been documented across the united states loftin et al 2016 u s states frequently issue health advisories or close recreational areas due to potential risks from cyanohab exposure graham et al 2009 cyanohabs may produce toxins and cause nuisance odors hypoxia unappealing surface scums undesirable finished drinking water increased drinking water treatment costs and economic and infrastructure costs such as loss of revenue from recreation and businesses that rely on appealing or potable water dodds et al 2009 steffensen 2008 new tools are needed to facilitate the development of reliable and cost effective monitoring programs at lake watershed state regional and national scales 1 2 management need many u s states experience challenges in developing cyanohab monitoring programs because of the need to cover large geographic areas with insufficient resources a single management agency often oversees numerous isolated lakes scattered across a large landscape water quality monitoring efforts also are constrained by the availability of personnel and limited financial resources presenting managers with a serious challenge in prioritizing water quality sampling regimes to best monitor dispersed waterbodies water quality managers need access to timely and consistent data to protect the designated and beneficial uses of water satellites can provide such data although satellite data has been available for a number of years historically few management decisions have been based on satellite information because data dissemination to water quality managers has been limited to either photographs or file formatted products that require specialized training to process images and interpret data managers would substantially benefit from software that reduces the barrier of accessing satellite data to facilitate better public and environmental health protection of water bodies timely and effective distribution of satellite derived data is necessary to provide warnings within days and seasonal assessments in the same calendar year managers responding to the immediate impacts of cyanohabs need timely useful and cost effective delivery of information from the satellite data schaeffer et al 2013 satellite remote sensing technology provides an ability to assess cyanohab abundance for spatially resolvable inland recreational and public water supplies using algal pigments as surrogates for hab and cyanohab abundance at sufficient spatial temporal resolution to detect changes in particular the european space agency copernicus program provides a new series of sentinel 3 ocean and land colour instruments berger et al 2012 donlon et al 2012 at 300 meter m pixel resolution suited for detecting cyanohab abundance changes frequency extent magnitude and duration in larger lakes clark et al 2017 urquhart et al 2017 1 3 current software status a number of ecological forecast software tools already exist related to harmful algal blooms and chlorophyll a that serve as a proxy for eutrophication status and phytoplankton biomass examples include forecasting with combined sonde mooring data and an artificial neural network coad et al 2014 varying the chlorophyll a to phytoplankton biomass ratio in a ce qual w2 water quality model sadeghian et al 2018 fuzzy logic models for algal bloom forecasts kim et al 2014 applying markov chain monte carlo bayesian modelling to understand nutrient and zooplankton controls on cyanobacteria malve et al 2007 integrated models to capture land use nutrient budgets meteorological and hydrological data to forecast cyanobacteria concentrations to inform adaptive management practices norton et al 2012 and a windows based software ecotaihu model integrates water quality measures and satellite data to predict cyanobacteria in lake taihu zhang et al 2013 however none of these existing software platforms provide the ability to visualize satellite derived water quality data directly or view time series of satellite data to inform decision making two primary scientific software packages traditionally are used for satellite data processing and analysis related to water quality satellite missions the u s software package is the national aeronautics and space administration nasa sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs data analysis system seadas baith et al 2001 an open source and free software package seadas is a comprehensive software package for the processing display analysis and quality control of a wide array of satellite data while the primary focus of seadas has historically been ocean color data it is applicable to other satellite based earth science data analyses such as inland and coastal water quality data the european software package is the sentinel application platform snap available from the european space agency snap also is an open source platform and focuses on the exploitation of earth observation data both software packages are desktop computer based and require some scientific knowledge in the field of ocean color remote sensing as well as sufficient computer hardware to handle the satellite images and processing capabilities in addition computer code language expertise typically in java or python is beneficial to batch process large numbers of satellite files these software packages produce derived water quality products such as cyanohab abundance however the software to date is not developed for repeated intuitive and rapid assessment of inland waters for cyanohab monitoring by a diverse variety of water quality managers and stakeholders therefore alternative software solutions are necessary to reduce the data access limitations and to reduce required management programmatic support schaeffer et al 2013 for satellite derived data on cyanohabs 1 4 mobile device application solution unlike previous software packages a mobile device application app would reduce the need for scientific expertise in ocean color interpretation and hardware requirements associated with the use of satellite data an app would provide intuitive ability through a graphical user interface gui to scan water bodies for changes in cyanohab abundance without expertise in computer programming or computer languages georeferenced data would allow managers to monitor their particular water bodies of interest without having to filter through numerous satellite images of water bodies not associated with their region managers could set query thresholds to identify if cyanohab abundance exceeds a certain limit in addition by using advanced alert systems an app would allow passive reception of data instead of active acquisition minimizing the amount of time commitment on behalf of the manager managers would benefit from multiple methods of notification through a mobile phone app that could for example change the colors of map pins based on previously set threshold levels in addition remote sensing data traditionally are provided as files covering an entire region with data for a particular moment in time an app would allow managers to select a single location of interest to quickly visualize the quantified cyanohab abundance value and a scaling capability would provide larger ecosystem context the ability to quickly query a single pixel location and obtain a time series of information has not been readily available for non technical users and is only now being addressed through time sensitive data formats such as data rods grant and gallaher 2015 teng et al 2016 with a mobile phone app in addition to obtaining a current cyanohab abundance value users would also obtain a time series of historical cyanohab values for the location of interest providing temporal context a software design allowing for a 70 30 contribution blend between scientist and managers which has previously been successful in the food industry ariely 2010 is an attempt to maximize ownership of the satellite data scientists provide 70 of data handling including processing geophysical product development basic assessment capabilities and delivery managers are responsible for about 30 of the information associated with their existing efforts such as setting thresholds identifying site locations and making decisions to take additional action based on available data this effort focuses on the development of a mobile platform data delivery app because mobile data access and mobile devices are more ubiquitous and already outpacing sales of traditional desktop computers globally more than 84 of the population lives in areas with mobile 3g or better data access ict 2016 with 75 smart phone adoption in north america accessing 4g and eventually 5g gsm association 2016b global smart phone and mobile data access is expected to reach 70 of the world population by 2020 gsm association 2016a we demonstrate the use of the cyanobacteria assessment network cyan app which uses information from the european space agency sentinel 3 satellite ocean and land colour imagers olci to create a cost effective timely and intuitive satellite data delivery system accessible through android 4 1 and above smartphones the seadas software package produces derived water quality products such as cyanohab abundance that are the processing backbone of the cyan app 2 materials and methods 2 1 copernicus sentinel 3 satellite ocean and land colour instruments full resolution 300 m at nadir the point directly below the satellite on the earth surface scenes from the european space agency s olci were obtained for the contiguous united states conus starting in 2016 standard olci level 1b data are archived at the nasa ocean color website https oceandata sci gsfc nasa gov the data were processed using the nasa standard ocean color satellite seadas processing software package version 7 4 baith et al 2001 and the shuttle radar topography mission srtm gc land mask carroll et al 2009 images were processed to albers equal area projection with nearest neighbor interpolation spectral albedo ρs λ was generated by removing rayleigh reflectances and molecular absorption from the top of atmosphere signal measured by the satellite clouds were masked using a spectral albedo threshold algorithm that accounts for turbid water to eliminate misidentification of pixels with bright reflectances resulting from intense blooms the ρs estimates were used to calculate the cyanobacteria index ci from the spectral shape algorithm centered on 681 nanometers nm ci ss 681 wynne et al 2008 and routinely used in lake erie stumpf et al 2016 the olci ci output for each image then was converted to cyanohab abundance in cells per milliliter cells ml 1 following wynne et al 2010 where cyanohab abundance 1 0 108 ci field validation of the ci algorithm was previously demonstrated clark et al 2017 lunetta et al 2015 tomlinson et al 2016 clark et al 2017 reported correspondence across the spectrum of cyanohab abundance ranges spanning 10 000 to 1 million cells ml mean absolute percentage error mape 28 6 coefficient of determination r2 0 95 satellite derived values below 109 000 cells ml and above 1 000 000 cells ml had correspondence of above 80 with in situ samples collected within 7 days of a satellite match up while the ci algorithm had lower correspondence performance between 109 000 and 1 000 000 cells ml this was expected due to the lack of validation data in this concentration range and the large temporal range for coincident satellite match ups lunetta et al 2015 the categorization of satellite derived ci values based on threshold levels as described below would further reduce the impact on algorithm error and uncertainties weekly 7 day composite images were created by retaining the maximum value detected for each pixel within the time period the use of a 7 day composite minimizes the impacts of cloud cover and maximizes the frequency of available data based on a typical work week to guide management decisions 2 2 thresholds cell counts and microcystin concentrations are commonly used to evaluate potential health risk and many states have customized thresholds based on additional information gathered locally graham et al 2009 for example oklahoma and massachusetts developed state specific guidelines to establish protective levels oklahoma issues warnings to lake users if cell counts exceed 100 000 cells ml 1 and microcystin concentrations exceed 20 μg l 1 massachusetts has established guidelines for issuing an advisory against contact with water when cell counts exceed 70 000 cells ml 1 or microcystin concentrations exceed 14 μg l 1 the world health organization who has a three level guideline approach which describes concentrations of the ubiquitous photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial cell abundance cells ml 1 to determine the level of associated risk to support a warning or closure who provides estimates of microcystin that could correspond to the cell abundance at each guideline level the u s environmental protection agency also has the drinking water health advisory for cyanobacteria microcystins toxin u s epa 2015 satellite observations cannot detect toxins stumpf et al 2016 but can quantify cyanohab abundance kutser 2009 cyanohab abundance is perhaps better suited for assessing nationwide risks due to limitations related to toxin monitoring clark et al 2017 therefore the cyan app allows for thresholds to be set based on user preferences of cyanohab abundance in cells ml 1 2 3 state advisor

drinking water intakes clark et al 2017 to be marked with color coded pins fig 3 a clark et al 2017 previously developed a method for quantifying resolvable lakes given a satellite sensor spatial resolution at nadir any water pixel adjacent to the land mask should be used with caution due to the potential for mixed land water pixels and land adjacency effects processing methods are being periodically updated to improve detection of invalid pixels national hydrography dataset plus version 2 0 nhdplusv2 lake polygons mckay et al 2012 with at least 3 valid water pixels were included as a resolvable waterbody in this study table s1 the pin color codes correspond to threshold levels selected by the end user from a swipe tab using sliding bars fig 3b the geographic coordinates tab permits end users to input specific latitude and longitude coordinates for locations such as monitoring stations recreational locations and public surface drinking water intakes users may mark

introduction historical failures to control pollution sources have generated a legacy of contaminated sites near industrial areas throughout the world sediments frequently act as sinks for such contamination particularly when the constituents exhibit affinity for solids there are few economically viable options for management of contaminated sediments in situ management which includes monitored natural recovery mnr in situ treatment with sorptive or reactive materials and in situ containment via placement of a capping layer represent some of the most cost effective approaches mnr is a remedy that uses known naturally occurring processes to contain eliminate or reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of contaminants in sediment generally mnr involves contaminant source control evaluation of potential attenuation mechanisms and long term monitoring to confirm the performance in situ treatment normally involves the incorporation of a sorbent such as biochar or activated carbon directly into the sediment layer to reduce bioavailability but other sorbents or reagents encouraging contaminant transformation have been proposed in situ capping refers to the placement of a subaqueous covering of clean material over contaminated sediment that provides new substrate and buries the contaminants below the biologically active zone the cover material may include a homogeneous medium such as sands or sediments but may also include amendments to aid containment or degradation of the contaminants each of these remedies seeks to reduce the availability or mobility of the contaminants over the long term and full performance can rarely be assessed with short term monitoring a modeling tool capable of simulating the availability mobility and transformation of the contaminant is needed to predict whether the long term performance criteria may be achieved such a tool can also be used to predict short term performance that can be directly compared to post remedy monitoring recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of sand caps to mitigate environmental risks associated with sediments provided the depth exceeds that of bioturbation by benthic organisms and the amount of groundwater upwelling is not substantial lampert 2010 lampert et al 2011 2013 reible et al 2006 thomas et al 2014 with substantial upwelling amended caps or in situ treatment with sorptive materials such as organoclay sharma et al 2009 reible et al 2007 2008 biochar or activated carbon lin et al 2014 and apatites peld et al 2004 have been employed to improve the efficacy of the remedy activated carbon can be effective for hydrophobic organic compounds such as pahs and pcbs and certain metals such as mercury sometimes the carbon may be placed within a capping material such as sand or within a geotextile to aid retention of the relatively light material clay layers have been proposed to decrease pore water advection and the associated contaminant transport reible et al 2006 although this can lead to accumulation of upwelling water and microbially produced gas yuan et al 1995 benthic communities that contain bacteria with specific reductase enzymatic functions have been proposed if the environmental conditions are feasible for community growth himmelheber et al 2008 hyun et al 2006 johnson et al 2010 zero valent iron as a capping material has also been proposed for treating nitroaromatics chromium lead ddt and related compounds agrawal and tratnyek 1996 sayles et al 1997 wang et al 2011 reible et al 2014 yan and reible 2015 demonstrated the potential of electrode enhanced capping using electrodes in combination with natural degradation of phenanthrene as well as an increase in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah degrading genes in the benthic community surrounding the electrodes wang et al 2014 developed a bio reactive cap membrane comprised of polysulfone granular activated carbon and immobilized microorganisms ps gac to remove nitrobenzene from sediment the results indicated that more than 70 of the nitrobenzene present in the sediment was removed using the ps gac membrane cap meric et al 2014 experimented with reactive core mats rcms and found that the geotextile filtering layers provided advantageous filtering for low advective fluxes to capture cocs while the reactive core in between the geotextile layers provides good sorption of cocs during high advective fluxes red soil rich in iron aluminum and oxygen was used by xia et al 2016 to control the release of nitrogen and phosphorous from sediment to the water body and effectively increased the water standard by decreasing the chances of algal blooms the metallic oxides enhanced the adsorption of the nutrients the appropriate design approach for sites where sediment contamination requires remedial action depends on successful modeling of the long term behavior of contaminants site specific conditions and desired remediation goals based upon water body uses water standards and habitat restoration reible et al 2014 govern the capping design and must be established when employing a cap or in situ treatment it is vital to choose the appropriate materials to meet remediation goals and to do so in an economical manner remediation goals may be a concentration at the sediment water interface a flux through the surface layers and into the overlying water or a porewater concentration which seeks to directly control the most available and most mobile fraction of contaminants materials that might be employed vary greatly in contaminant fate and transport properties mathematical models of the fate and transport of contaminants provide critical insight into the expected long term behavior of various alternatives that guide remedial action and design contaminant transport models often treat sediment processes relatively simply with exchange coefficients to and between one or more layers of sediment e g to provide a boundary condition for water column models or assume linear behavior to allow analytical solutions that can be readily computed lampert 2010 reible et al 2014 lampert and reible 2009 however activated carbon amendments and or black carbon in sediments exhibit non linear and sometimes kinetically limited sorption yang et al 2012 hong and luthy 2008 murphy et al 2006 werner et al 2006 to address these and other limitations and more realistically describe surficial sediment processes the capsim model was developed key features of capsim include the ability to simulate multiple layers of materials including mixtures of inert material and sorbents advection diffusion dispersion processes bioturbation or mixing associated with benthic macroorganisms resulting in transport of both solid particles and pore water groundwater upwelling and tidal or other oscillating flows sediment consolidation and deposition i e moving domain transient or equilibrium linear or nonlinear sorption exchange at the sediment water interface and dynamics of multiple species with linked reactions in sediments the model can be used to simulate the contaminant transport and release from an unremediated sediment simulate natural recovery of sediments or predict the effectiveness of in situ treatment or capping 2 model features and software design capsim accounts for multiple layers of varying properties and allows the user to input specific properties of the material or use typical values from a database of characteristics for different materials the thickness of layers can be varied to describe arbitrary variations in conditions in sediment or to determine the most economical solution for a given set of design criteria the model incorporates traditional porous media transport processes including advection diffusion dispersion reaction and sorption but also includes the capability to simulate processes specific to the near surface sediment including deposition consolidation bioturbation and exchange with the overlying water as summarized in table 1 2 1 governing equations and key processes the sediment with any potential cap or in situ treatment is conceptualized as a one dimensional stratified system composed of multiple layers with various physical and chemical properties the top and the bottom of the system are in contact with the overlying water body and the underlying sediment respectively all layers are simulated as saturated porous media with the solid particles as immobile except in the bioturbation zone near the surface where particles can be moved by the activities of benthic organisms matisoff 1995 and when sediment continuously deposits to the surface dissolved organic carbon doc which can preferentially absorb hydrophobic organic contaminants is treated as a third phase besides the water and the sediment solids this phase can contribute to the total porewater burden of these contaminants the contaminants are distributed to all three phases and transported within the layer and across the interface between layers the mass conservation equation for the one dimensional multi layered multi species porous media system is given in equation 1 1 m ε m ϕ m c n 1 ρ doc i k doc n t ρ b m ϕ m q m n t f n z m ε m ϕ m l a l n rxn l i the mass loading of the nth contaminant in mobile phase consists of the free molecular concentration c n and its doc associated concentration which is calculated by the doc concentration in the ith layer ρ doc i and the porewater doc partitioning coefficient k doc n burkhard 2000 the generation or consumption of the nth contaminant by reactions in porewater is summarized as l a l n rxn l i where rxn l i is the reaction rate of the lth reaction in the ith layer and a l n is the stoichiometric coefficient of the nth chemical in the lth reaction the porewater concentrations are continuous through layers while the doc concentration and the reaction terms are assumed to be limited in the defined layer ε m and ρ b m are the porosity and bulk density of the mth material the porosities and the bulk densities of solid mixtures in the system are assumed to be the linear sums of the individual solid components properties weighted by their volumetric fractions ϕ m if the property of the mixture is known to be different the mixture can be defined with those properties ϕ m is treated as a constant parameter in each layer except in the bioturbation zone near the surface where it becomes a continuous temporal spatial variable governed by equation 5 the relationship between the individual solid concentrations q m n and the porewater concentration c n is described by equilibrium isotherms linear or nonlinear or nonequilibrium kinetics in sediments the time scale of transport processes is often much longer than the time required for the local reversible sorption desorption reactions allowing the assumption of local equilibrium if local equilibrium is applied the solid phase concentrations of nth contaminant in mth solid material q m n can be expressed as an explicit function of pore water concentrations c n using appropriate sorption isotherms in table 2 15 however sorption desorption of some organic compounds such as hocs could be slow particularly on strongly sorbing phases or solids with a microporous structure such as activated carbon and the local equilibrium assumption may not valid yang et al 2012 pignatello and xing 1996 accardi dey and gschwend 2002 lick and rapaka 1996 the behavior of such contaminants in sediments is often described by a one compartment model with sorption kinetic coefficients k sorp m n that represents the rate of the sorption desorption process ghosh et al 2001 a solid material that is a mixture of various compartments can be modeled as materials exhibiting various kinetic and equilibrium sorption properties competition between sorption processes can be simulated by modeling reactions between sorbed and desorbed phases the total solid mass within a differential element is the sum of the contaminant mass in various material components the vertical flux f n in equation 2 is driven by four potential transport processes molecular diffusion hydrodynamic dispersion advection and bioturbation the effective diffusion coefficient d n i of the nth contaminant is water diffusivity corrected for tortuosity and porosity of the diffusion pathway in porous media millington and quirk 1961 boudreau 1997 the diffusion flux of doc and the associated contaminants is neglected due to its high molecular weight relative to the freely dissolved fraction and the assumption of uniform doc concentration within a layer hydrodynamic dispersion and advection describe the transport of contaminants forced externally by groundwater flow hydrodynamic dispersion is modeled as proportional to groundwater velocity the proportionality constant the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient α i is a measure of the length scale of heterogeneities in the system or determined empirically through a tracer study reible et al 2014 in the absence of site specific information a conservative estimate for the dispersion impact would be to scale the dispersion coefficient with the cap thickness such as 10 of the cap thickness clarke et al 1993 2 f n d n i c n z α i u c n 1 ρ doc i k doc n z uc n 1 ρ doc i k doc n f bio n the advection term with darcy velocity u combines the flow forced by groundwater upwelling pore water expression due to consolidation of a sediment or cap layer and periodic movements due to tides or periodic flood drainage flows the degree of potential consolidation should be evaluated based on consolidation testing consolidation is modeled as an increased groundwater upwelling that decreases exponentially over time as the sediment bed reaches equilibrium the consolidation induced flow is calculated based on a user supplied estimate of maximum consolidation and the time required for the consolidation to achieve 90 of the maximum consolidation to estimate a consolidation rate kcon periodic groundwater flow velocity potential associated with tidal regions is modeled as a sinusoid function versus time v max is the maximum velocity and t c is the period for a full tidal cycle or other periodic flow moore 1999 moore et al 2002 taniguchi 2002 equation 3 represents the collective advection term used in the modeling platform 3 u v darcy v con 0 e k con t v oscillation sin 2 πt t c bioturbation from the activities of the benthic organisms near the surface 5 15 cm causes mixing of both the porewater and solids the bioturbation is commonly characterized as an expected depth and mixing intensity boudreau 1997 boudreau and jørgensen 2001 one common modeling approach is to assume the mixing process is random and the bioturbation flux is a fickian diffusion process for both the free molecular and the solid associated contaminant as shown in equations 4 and 5 the bioturbation coefficients and the depth can be derived using soild mixing measurements thoms et al 1995 4 f bio n d bio p m ρ b m ϕ m q m n z d bio pw c n 1 ρ doc i k doc n z 5 ϕ m t d bio p 2 ϕ m z 2 a depth dependent gaussian function correction can also be used to model the biodiffusion coefficient as shown in equation 6 the gaussian rms width σ represents the depth where the bioturbation strength drops to approximately 60 of maximum with this model bioturbation rates decrease with distance from the benthic interface which may be more representative of the natural environment 6 d bio p d bio p 0 exp z 2 2 σ 2 d bio pw d bio pw 0 exp z 2 2 σ 2 deposition of solid particles from the overlying water to the top of the existing sediment or capping layers creates a top layer of temporally variable thickness the deposition layer normally consists of clean sediment and serves as a natural capping layer since it separates the overlying water body from the contaminated sediments and reduces the transport rate of contaminants to the overlying water body the deposition of sediment on the top is modeled by a special layer with increasing thickness over time to simulate the accumulation of solid materials 2 2 initial and boundary conditions at the interface of two layers the porewater concentrations c n and the fluxes f n i are equal for mass continuity the solid material fractions ϕ m and the contaminant solid concentrations q m n i are discontinuous due to the immobility of solid particles except in the cases with bioturbation where the benthic organism activities mix the solid materials as well as porewater 7 c n z h i i 1 c n z h i i 1 f n z h i i 1 f n z h i i 1 the boundary between the sediments and the overlying water body is described by classic boundary layer theory where the flux across the boundary is proportional to the difference between the surface porewater concentration and the overlying water concentration as described by equation 8 37 8 f n k bl n c n c n w where k bl n is the mass transfer coefficient that defines the transport of mass through the sediment water interface or benthic boundary layer boudreau and jorgensen 2001 the coefficient can be evaluated using previously developed correlations with stream characteristics reible et al 2014 when the turbulence in the overlying water is intense the mass transfer through the boundary layer is rapid and c n can be assumed to be fixed to the concentration in the overlying water c n w a well mixed water body with potential water flushing can also be simulated with a separate mass balance model and is described in the supplemental information two types of conditions are available in the model for the bottom boundary fixed concentration and flux matching as described by equations 9 and 10 respectively zero flux from below is a special case of the flux matching condition the fixed concentration condition blue line in fig 1 represents an infinite pollution source with a given concentration beneath the simulation domain while the flux matching condition red broken line models a constant advective flux at the bottom boundary danckwerts 1953 or a zero flux red solid line in the zero flux case with groundwater upwelling the diffusive flux is negative to balance the upward advective flux 9 fixed concentration c n z h c b n 10 flux matching f n z h uc b n the initial distribution of contaminants is assumed to be uniform or linear in each layer a more complicated initial profile simply requires definition of additional layers for contaminants and solids without the assumption of local equilibrium the initial solid concentrations q init m n i are also required by the system uniform initial concentration 11 c n i t 0 c init n i q m n i t 0 q init m n i linear variation in concentration 12 c n i t 0 z h i h i c init top n i c init bot n i c init top n i 2 3 numerical solution the finite difference method fdm is used here to solve the governing equations and auxiliary conditions both an implicit method and the crank nicholson method are implemented the constitutive equations with non linear terms such as freundlich sorption isotherm or higher order kinetic reactions are solved at each time step by newton s method the deposition of sediment on the top is modeled by a special layer with growing number of grids to imitate the accumulation of solid materials to avoid discontinuities in concentration due to the growing deposition layers the simulated results are averaged over the time span associated with that growth for contaminants performing kinetic sorption in solids the boundary conditions 7 to 10 have to be treated by a finite volume boundary to allow the dynamics in the surface layer to be modeled and to ensure conservation of the solid phase at the boundary grid as described in more detail in the supplemental information 2 4 software capsim is written entirely using the python programming language van rossum and others 2007 with key third party modules including numeric python numpy for matrix and array calculations walt et al 2011 scientific python scipy for statistical analysis jones et al 2001 the math plotting library matplotlib for visualization hunter 2007 the graphical user interface is constructed using python s built in extensions to the tcl tk library lundh 1999 grayson 2000 python and each of the extension modules used in capsim are fully open source which facilities collaborations and extension of the tools to new applications python is an interpreted high level programming language and thus it has been widely used for the development of environmental models for scientific and engineering applications lampert and wu 2015 swain et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 palacios et al 2013 capsim can be run directly from the python interpreter or installed as a compiled executable program 2 5 logic structure for user interaction the developed executable program obtains the system parameters and properties transport and reaction coefficients and numerical simulation setups by a series of input windows a database including the information of common environmental emerging contaminants and remediation solid materials from the literature mackay 1997 hawker and connell 1988 walters and luthy 1984 mcdonoughet al 2007 azhar 2015 is provided the coefficients and properties in the database file can be further edited and updated by users to incorporate new information the software can also be used to execute batch files which facilitates a series of simulations sequentially from a user defined text value txt file this feature is especially useful for sensitivity analysis of key design parameters for the cap the simulation cases with input information are stored in input files and can be reloaded back to the system or shared to other users the simulated results including porewater concentrations fluxes solid concentrations water concentrations solid material fractions are available in the form of the temporal or spatial plots or in comma separated values csv files see fig 2 3 example application a test case was developed to illustrate the features of the modeling platform most contaminated sites possess a variety of contaminants of concern that influence a remediation design as well as model parameters that vary in different situations the following examples illustrate the application of the model for various contaminants of concern and common conditions 3 1 mercury and methylmercury mercury hg and methylmercury mehg are typical redox sensitive contaminants in the sediment environment mehg is the major toxic form of hg that accumulates in fish and leads to exposure to humans through the food chain morel et al 1998 kraepiel et al 2003 kudo and miyahara 1991 the methylation of hg to mehg and demethylation of mehg back to inorganic hg is commonly modeled with a pair of coupled first order reactions with reaction coefficients specified according to the local redox conditions the redox profile in the following case is simplified to two extreme regions an aerobic zone near the benthic surface and an anaerobic zone underlying the methylation is assumed to only occur in the anaerobic sediment layer and the demethylation occurs uniformly in the sediment the demethylation rate coefficient in this example is 0 005 yr 1 hintelmann et al 2000 and the methylation rate coefficient is estimated to be 0 4 yr 1 from mesocosm experiments bireta 2015 in the test case a 30 cm sediment layer with an initial hg concentration of 3 mg kg has been capped by a 2 cm activated carbon layer and 15 cm sand layer the top 5 cm of the sand layer is assumed to be affected by bioturbation of a uniform strength at d bio pw 0 50 cm 2 yr and d bio p 0 1 cm 2 yr table 3 summarizes the key model inputs for the simulation the mehg concentrations simulated by capsim in the base case were verified with results from comsol a commercial numerical simulation tool as shown in fig 3 a the activated carbon sand capping layers slowed down the upward transport of the mehg generated in the deeper layer the potential impact from a monthly periodic groundwater discharge t c 0 08 yr or a daily tidal groundwater discharge t c 0 0014 yr is shown in fig 3 b the instantaneous top flux of total hg solid line varied by 2 orders as the result of the periodic change of groundwater flow the averaged flux dashed line increased 5 orders of magnitude over the baseline flux with a strong groundwater discharge 600 cm yr in the case with a strong tidal impact 0 6 cm day yim and mohsen 1992 the averaged flux of hg at benthic surface dotted line increased to 1 7 μg cm 2 yr 3 2 phenanthrene phenanthrene is a hydrophobic contaminant that sorbs onto high carbon content materials the phenanthrene sorption in sand and sediments were normalized to the organic fraction of the sorbing phases with a logk oc 4 57 and its sorption in activated carbon was modeled with a freundlich isotherm q 1 03 10 7 c 0 44 walters and luthy 1984 the sediment system of the mercury example was used with the exception that layer 2 was composed of pure sand or a 0 1 by weight activated carbon sand mixture the phenanthrene porewater concentrations in the sediment layer and at the bottom were fixed at 100 μg kg the overlying water was assumed to be a well mixed lake with a benthic transfer coefficient k bl 0 00273 cm hr and a constant zero water concentration the fate and transport of phenanthrene in the sediment and the capping layer were simulated over 50 years the baseline result in fig 4 a with linear sorption was verified with an analytical solution shen and reible 2015 fig 4 b shows the possible impacts from the kinetic sorption of activated carbon in the 2 cm activated carbon sand layer or the aerobic biodegradation in the top two layers with an increasing kinetic rate coefficient the partitioning of phenanthrene in porewater and activated carbon moves toward equilibrium and the profile converges to the equilibrium case profile the concentration of phenanthrene in the capping layer is reduced significantly by the aerobic biodegradation with a first order rate constant 0 12 day 1 proposed by yuan et al 2001 fig 4 c and d show the impacts from a sediment deposition layer to the benthic surface concentrations the mass released to the overlying water body drops to effectively 0 with as little as a 0 02 cm yr deposition rate to the top of the cap the impact from the bioturbation driven distribution of sorbents to the migration of contaminants is shown in fig 4 e a solid particle bioturbation d bio p 0 3 cm 2 yr with a gaussian rms width σ 7 5 cm in equation 6 mixes the ac with both the sand from upper layer and the contaminated sediment in the lower layer and causes a substantial increase in porewater concentration at the surface capsim is conveniently structured to allow multiple simulations including monte carlo analysis with random variations of selected parameters a monte carlo analysis on the bioturbation strength and depth was performed by 100 simulations with random choices of diffusion coefficient from 1 to 5 cm 2 yr and the gaussian rms width σ from 5 cm to 10 cm the mean water sediment surface concentration at 50 years is slightly lower than the case with mean bioturbation coefficient and gaussian rms width fig 4 f 4 recent case studies with capsim the unique features of the capsim model have been applied for assessment and remediation of a variety of contaminated sites since its development including the willamette river in portland oregon a e c o m 2016 the industri plex superfund site near woburn ma haley and aldrich 2014 manistique harbor and river superfund site michigan azhar 2015 and the lower passaic river superfund site near newark new jersey ch2mhill 2013 a brief overview of the characteristics of these sites and the model application are highlighted here to illustrate the features of the software 4 1 portland harbor superfund site capsim was used in a remediation design for river mile 13 1 in the lower willamette river near the downtown reach area of portland or a e c o m 2016 the existing sediment consisted primarily of silty sand and fine gravel and it was found to contain unacceptably high levels of lead polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs dioxins furans and pahs capsim was used to design an isolation layer between the contaminated sediment and biological receptors the steady state maximum contaminant concentration in a sand isolation geotextile bioturbation layer matrix along with the transient contaminant concentration model after cap instillation were used as design metrics three caps were used for parts of the site requiring different levels of remediation the first area used a cap comprised solely of clean sand this cap was estimated to provide isolation for 400 years with a thickness of 1 5 m the second used a thick unamended sand cap that was estimated to provide chemical contaminant isolation for more than 200 years the thick unamended area purpose was to meet slope stability requirements so its thickness varied from 1 5 feet to 9 feet the final area was capped using a layer of clean sand amended with 10 by weight activated carbon based on designs in capsim of a thickness of 12 inches the amended area was estimated to provide isolation for more than 500 years 4 2 industri plex superfund site the industri plex superfund site is a former chemical and glue manufacturing facility near woburn ma haley and aldrich 2014 elevated concentrations of benzene were found in the sediment of four hide piles in the lower south pond of the site between 2011 and 2014 dredging was used to remove contaminated soil that was disposed of in an off site facility dredging was determined to be the most prudent removal method because there was very little benzene migration within the sediments and groundwater due to small groundwater flux values in the area afterward the sediment elevations would be restored for the upland edge of the site a geotextile layer an aquagate pac layer a wetland soil layer and an erosion control blanket were to be used to replenish the sediment levels and cap the breakthrough of the remaining benzene the aquagate pac layer consists of large particles to allow free water flow along with an activated carbon coating to sorb any contaminant the lower south pond area was capped and restored using a geotextile layer a wetland soil layer and an erosion control blanket capsim was used to simulate contaminant migration through the cap layer for each area within the site the model system was simulated with no bioturbation no consolidation of the underlying sediment no additional sediment deposition on top of the cap and a constant concentration boundary condition of contaminant at the underlying sediment a conservative modeling approach was used that excluded the biodegradation of benzene although degradation is expected to occur the parameters from the remedial design report were used to construct a capsim model and simulate benzene migration through the system fig 5 shows a plot using a depth of 30 cm of wetland soil and 7 5 cm of aquablok pac along with a concentration profile at a depth of 5 cm the design team was able to alter the aquablok pac depth in additional simulations to identify the design to meet containment performance requirements and minimize expenses 4 3 manistique harbor and river superfund site the in situ adsorptive potential of different cap layers for the manistique harbor and river superfund site michigan were analyzed using capsim azhar 2015 pcb contaminant migration rates were compared within sediment without any sorption amendments in situ amendments and conventional cap designs sand only with the gac and organoclay amendments mercury arsenic chromium copper pcbs and pahs benzene chlorobenzene naphthalene were all contaminants studied in combination with various sorbents to determine the most effective sorbent materials for each contaminant after using capsim to simulate a cap with no sediment amendments it was estimated that pcb 52 would take more than 100 years to deplete from the surface layer and would reach a steady state flux at the surface of 440 μg m2 year due to diffusion and an upwelling rate of 1 cm day and 157 μg m2 year at a diffusion dominated upwelling rate of 1 cm yr pcb 18 takes less time than pcb 52 to deplete from the surface layer while pcb 101 takes longer three simulations of organophilic clay omc were conducted including the in situ application of omc a 1 cm thick omc mat and an amended sand cap with a thickness of 30 cm containing omc in the first and third simulations 0 8 lb ft2 of omc were added in the overlaying sediment and sand respectively the omc simulations were modeled assuming a linear sorption isotherm reible et al 2008 the gac simulations tested the efficacy of gac as a sorbent for pcb 18 52 and 101 the simulations were the same as the omc simulations but with gac 0 4 lb ft2 in place of omc the gac sorption was modeled using the freundlich isotherm capsim results for gac sorption of pcb 52 with 10 cm of sediment are shown below the 1 cm mat of gac simulation and 30 cm of sand mixed with omc results were excluded because regardless of upwelling rate capsim predicted a surface breakthrough time of more than 1000 years for each case azhar 2015 4 4 lower passaic river superfund site the lower passaic river is the location of a former alkali manufacturing facility that contains elevated concentrations of 2 3 7 8 tcdd dioxins furans pcbs pcb 52 pahs phenanthrene mercury and other chemicals ch2mhill 2013 hicks and collins 2017 a proposed remedy involves dredging of the most highly contaminated sediment transport to an off site facility for further treatment a cap would then be placed over the remaining sediment along with a geotextile layer and an armor cap to decrease erosion of the cap and increase its lifetime capsim was employed to predict the transport of the previously mentioned contaminants through the active cap placed on the newly dredged surface sediment the cap used for each simulation was a mixture of 25 aquagate pac and 75 sand to ensure that breakthrough of each contaminant was greater than 100 years the geotextile layer placed between the active layer and sand was a nonwoven 100 plastic filter fabric and the armor layer was determined to need a thickness of 12 inches and a d50 stone size of 4 5 inches the design criteria only specified that the remediation must meet a breakthrough of at least 100 years but the cap efficacy provides more than 250 years of contaminant isolation table 4 and fig 6 show the properties of the layers and results with pcb 52 transport 5 summary assessment and remediation of contaminated sediments requires predictive models of the evolution of future contaminant levels under a variety of different scenarios a new open source software tool capsim has been developed that incorporates classical transport processes and importantly unique sediment transport processes including bioturbation deposition and consolidation the software contains a graphical user interface to expedite the application for new users but it can also be run in batch mode for sensitivity analysis or monte carlo simulations a database of key parameter values for important compounds and empirical relationships to estimate other parameters is incorporated into the software to facilitate its application to new systems capsim has been applied for assessment and remediation of a variety of contaminants in different locations throughout the united states the software provides an approach for rapid assessment of the feasibility of remediation designs for contaminated sediments software availability the capsim source code is freely

subaqueous covering of clean material over contaminated sediment that provides new substrate and buries the contaminants below the biologically active zone the cover material may include a homogeneous medium such as sands or sediments but may also include amendments to aid containment or degradation of the contaminants each of these remedies seeks to reduce the availability or mobility of the contaminants over the long term and full performance can rarely be assessed with short term monitoring a modeling tool capable of simulating the availability mobility and transformation of the contaminant is needed to predict whether the long term performance criteria may be achieved such a tool can also be used to predict short term performance that can be directly compared to post remedy monitoring recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of sand caps to mitigate environmental risks associated with sediments provided the depth exceeds that of bioturbation by benthic organisms and the amount of groundwater upwelling is not substantial lampert 2010 lampert et al 2011 2013 reible et al 2006 thomas et al 2014 with substantial upwelling amended caps or in situ treatment with sorptive materials such as organoclay sharma et al 2009 reible et al 2007 2008 biochar or activated carbon lin et al 2014 and apatites peld et al 2004 have been employed to improve the efficacy of the remedy activated carbon can be effective for hydrophobic organic compounds such as pahs and pcbs and certain metals such as mercury sometimes the carbon may be placed within a capping material such as sand or within a geotextile to aid retention of the relatively light material clay layers have been proposed to decrease pore water advection and the associated contaminant transport reible et al 2006 although this can lead to accumulation of upwelling water and microbially produced gas yuan et al 1995 benthic communities that contain bacteria with specific reductase enzymatic functions have been proposed if the environmental conditions are feasible for community growth himmelheber et al 2008 hyun et al 2006 johnson et al 2010 zero valent iron as a capping material has also been proposed for treating nitroaromatics chromium lead ddt and related compounds agrawal and tratnyek 1996 sayles et al 1997 wang et al 2011 reible et al 2014 yan and reible 2015 demonstrated the potential of electrode enhanced capping using electrodes in combination with natural degradation of phenanthrene as well as an increase in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah degrading genes in the benthic community surrounding the electrodes wang et al 2014 developed a bio reactive cap membrane comprised of polysulfone granular activated carbon and immobilized microorganisms ps gac to remove nitrobenzene from sediment the results indicated that more than 70 of the nitrobenzene present in the sediment was removed using the ps gac membrane cap meric et al 2014 experimented with reactive core mats rcms and found that the geotextile filtering layers provided advantageous filtering for low advective fluxes to capture cocs while the reactive core in between the geotextile layers provides good sorption of cocs during high advective fluxes red soil rich in iron aluminum and oxygen was used by xia et al 2016 to control the release of nitrogen and phosphorous from sediment to the water body and effectively increased the water standard by decreasing the chances of algal blooms the metallic oxides enhanced the adsorption of the nutrients the appropriate design approach for sites where sediment contamination requires remedial action depends on successful modeling of the long term behavior of contaminants site specific conditions and desired remediation goals based upon water body uses water standards and habitat restoration reible et al 2014 govern the capping design and must be established when employing a cap or in situ treatment it is vital to choose the appropriate materials to meet remediation goals and to do so in an economical manner remediation goals may be a concentration at the sediment water interface a flux through the surface layers and into the overlying water or a porewater concentration which seeks to directly control the most available and most mobile fraction of contaminants materials that might be employed vary greatly in contaminant fate and transport properties mathematical models of the fate and transport of contaminants provide critical insight into the expected long term behavior of various alternatives that guide remedial action and design contaminant transport models often treat sediment processes relatively simply with exchange coefficients to and between one or more layers of sediment e g to provide a boundary condition for water column models or assume linear behavior to allow analytical solutions that can be readily computed lampert 2010 reible et al 2014 lampert and reible 2009 however activated carbon amendments and or black carbon in sediments exhibit non linear and sometimes kinetically limited sorption yang et al 2012 hong and luthy 2008 murphy et al 2006 werner et al 2006 to address these and other limitations and more realistically describe surficial sediment processes the capsim model was developed key features of capsim include the ability to simulate multiple layers of materials including mixtures of inert material and sorbents advection diffusion dispersion processes bioturbation or mixing associated with benthic macroorganisms resulting in transport of both solid particles and pore water groundwater upwelling and tidal or other oscillating flows sediment consolidation and deposition i e moving domain transient or equilibrium linear or nonlinear sorption exchange at the sediment water interface and dynamics of multiple species with linked reactions in sediments the model can be used to simulate the contaminant transport and release from an unremediated sediment simulate natural recovery of sediments or predict the effectiveness of in situ treatment or capping 2 model features and software design capsim accounts for multiple layers of varying properties and allows the user to input specific properties of the material or use typical values from a database of characteristics for different materials the thickness of layers can be varied to describe arbitrary variations in conditions in sediment or to determine the most economical solution for a given set of design criteria the model incorporates traditional porous media transport processes including advection diffusion dispersion reaction and sorption but also includes the capability to simulate processes specific to the near surface sediment including deposition consolidation bioturbation and exchange with the overlying water as summarized in table 1 2 1 governing equations and key processes the sediment with any potential cap or in situ treatment is conceptualized as a one dimensional stratified system composed of multiple layers with various physical and chemical properties the top and the bottom of the system are in contact with the overlying water body and the underlying sediment respectively all layers are simulated as saturated porous media with the solid particles as immobile except in the bioturbation zone near the surface where particles can be moved by the activities of benthic organisms matisoff 1995 and when sediment continuously deposits to the surface dissolved organic carbon doc which can preferentially absorb hydrophobic organic contaminants is treated as a third phase besides the water and the sediment solids this phase can contribute to the total porewater burden of these contaminants the contaminants are distributed to all three phases and transported within the layer and across the interface between layers the mass conservation equation for the one dimensional multi layered multi species porous media system is given in equation 1 1 m ε m ϕ m c n 1 ρ doc i k doc n t ρ b m ϕ m q m n t f n z m ε m ϕ m l a l n rxn l i the mass loading of the nth contaminant in mobile phase consists of the free molecular concentration c n and its doc associated concentration which is calculated by the doc concentration in the ith layer ρ doc i and the porewater doc partitioning coefficient k doc n burkhard 2000 the generation or consumption of the nth contaminant by reactions in porewater is summarized as l a l n rxn l i where rxn l i is the reaction rate of the lth reaction in the ith layer and a l n is the stoichiometric coefficient of the nth chemical in the lth reaction the porewater concentrations are continuous through layers while the doc concentration and the reaction terms are assumed to be limited in the defined layer ε m and ρ b m are the porosity and bulk density of the mth material the porosities and the bulk densities of solid mixtures in the system are assumed to be the linear sums of the individual solid components properties weighted by their volumetric fractions ϕ m if the property of the mixture is known to be different the mixture can be defined with those properties ϕ m is treated as a constant parameter in each layer except in the bioturbation zone near the surface where it becomes a continuous temporal spatial variable governed by equation 5 the relationship between the individual solid concentrations q m n and the porewater concentration c n is described by equilibrium isotherms linear or nonlinear or nonequilibrium kinetics in sediments the time scale of transport processes is often much longer than the time required for the local reversible sorption desorption reactions allowing the assumption of local equilibrium if local equilibrium is applied the solid phase concentrations of nth contaminant in mth solid material q m n can be expressed as an explicit function of pore water concentrations c n using appropriate sorption isotherms in table 2 15 however sorption desorption of some organic compounds such as hocs could be slow particularly on strongly sorbing phases or solids with a microporous structure such as activated carbon and the local equilibrium assumption may not valid yang et al 2012 pignatello and xing 1996 accardi dey and gschwend 2002 lick and rapaka 1996 the behavior of such contaminants in sediments is often described by a one compartment model with sorption kinetic coefficients k sorp m n that represents the rate of the sorption desorption process ghosh et al 2001 a solid material that is a mixture of various compartments can be modeled as materials exhibiting various kinetic and equilibrium sorption properties competition between sorption processes can be simulated by modeling reactions between sorbed and desorbed phases the total solid mass within a differential element is the sum of the contaminant mass in various material components the vertical flux f n in equation 2 is driven by four potential transport processes molecular diffusion hydrodynamic dispersion advection and bioturbation the effective diffusion coefficient d n i of the nth contaminant is water diffusivity corrected for tortuosity and porosity of the diffusion pathway in porous media millington and quirk 1961 boudreau 1997 the diffusion flux of doc and the associated contaminants is neglected due to its high molecular weight relative to the freely dissolved fraction and the assumption of uniform doc concentration within a layer hydrodynamic dispersion and advection describe the transport of contaminants forced externally by groundwater flow hydrodynamic dispersion is modeled as proportional to groundwater velocity the proportionality constant the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient α i is a measure of the length scale of heterogeneities in the system or determined empirically through a tracer study reible et al 2014 in the absence of site specific information a conservative estimate for the dispersion impact would be to scale the dispersion coefficient with the cap thickness such as 10 of the cap thickness clarke et al 1993 2 f n d n i c n z α i u c n 1 ρ doc i k doc n z uc n 1 ρ doc i k doc n f bio n the advection term with darcy velocity u combines the flow forced by groundwater upwelling pore water expression due to consolidation of a sediment or cap layer and periodic movements due to tides or periodic flood drainage flows the degree of potential consolidation should be evaluated based on consolidation testing consolidation is modeled as an increased groundwater upwelling that decreases exponentially over time as the sediment bed reaches equilibrium the consolidation induced flow is calculated based on a user supplied estimate of maximum consolidation and the time required for the consolidation to achieve 90 of the maximum consolidation to estimate a consolidation rate kcon periodic groundwater flow velocity potential associated with tidal regions is modeled as a sinusoid function versus time v max is the maximum velocity and t c is the period for a full tidal cycle or other periodic flow moore 1999 moore et al 2002 taniguchi 2002 equation 3 represents the collective advection term used in the modeling platform 3 u v darcy v con 0 e k con t v oscillation sin 2 πt t c bioturbation from the activities of the benthic organisms near the surface 5 15 cm causes mixing of both the porewater and solids the bioturbation is commonly characterized as an expected depth and mixing intensity boudreau 1997 boudreau and jørgensen 2001 one common modeling approach is to assume the mixing process is random and the bioturbation flux is a fickian diffusion process for both the free molecular and the solid associated contaminant as shown in equations 4 and 5 the bioturbation coefficients and the depth can be derived using soild mixing measurements thoms et al 1995 4 f bio n d bio p m ρ b m ϕ m q m n z d bio pw c n 1 ρ doc i k doc n z 5 ϕ m t d bio p 2 ϕ m z 2 a depth dependent gaussian function correction can also be used to model the biodiffusion coefficient as shown in equation 6 the gaussian rms width σ represents the depth where the bioturbation strength drops to approximately 60 of maximum with this model bioturbation rates decrease with distance from the benthic interface which may be more representative of the natural environment 6 d bio p d bio p 0 exp z 2 2 σ 2 d bio pw d bio pw 0 exp z 2 2 σ 2 deposition of solid particles from the overlying water to the top of the existing sediment or capping layers creates a top layer of temporally variable thickness the deposition layer normally consists of clean sediment and serves as a natural capping layer since it separates the overlying water body from the contaminated sediments and reduces the transport rate of contaminants to the overlying water body the deposition of sediment on the top is modeled by a special layer with increasing thickness over time to simulate the accumulation of solid materials 2 2 initial and boundary conditions at the interface of two layers the porewater concentrations c n and the fluxes f n i are equal for mass continuity the solid material fractions ϕ m and the contaminant solid concentrations q m n i are discontinuous due to the immobility of solid particles except in the cases with bioturbation where the benthic organism activities mix the solid materials as well as porewater 7 c n z h i i 1 c n z h i i 1 f n z h i i 1 f n z h i i 1 the boundary between the sediments and the overlying water body is described by classic boundary layer theory where the flux across the boundary is proportional to the difference between the surface porewater concentration and the overlying water concentration as described by equation 8 37 8 f n k bl n c n c n w where k bl n is the mass transfer coefficient that defines the transport of mass through the sediment water interface or benthic boundary layer boudreau and jorgensen 2001 the coefficient can be evaluated using previously developed correlations with stream characteristics reible et al 2014 when the turbulence in the overlying water is intense the mass transfer through the boundary layer is rapid and c n can be assumed to be fixed to the concentration in the overlying water c n w a well mixed water body with potential water flushing can also be simulated with a separate mass balance model and is described in the supplemental information two types of conditions are available in the model for the bottom boundary fixed concentration and flux matching as described by equations 9 and 10 respectively zero flux from below is a special case of the flux matching condition the fixed concentration condition blue line in fig 1 represents an infinite pollution source with a given concentration beneath the simulation domain while the flux matching condition red broken line models a constant advective flux at the bottom boundary danckwerts 1953 or a zero flux red solid line in the zero flux case with groundwater upwelling the diffusive flux is negative to balance the upward advective flux 9 fixed concentration c n z h c b n 10 flux matching f n z h uc b n the initial distribution of contaminants is assumed to be uniform or linear in each layer a more complicated initial profile simply requires definition of additional layers for contaminants and solids without the assumption of local equilibrium the initial solid concentrations q init m n i are also required by the system uniform initial concentration 11 c n i t 0 c init n i q m n i t 0 q init m n i linear variation in concentration 12 c n i t 0 z h i h i c init top n i c init bot n i c init top n i 2 3 numerical solution the finite difference method fdm is used here to solve the governing equations and auxiliary conditions both an implicit method and the crank nicholson method are implemented the constitutive equations with non linear terms such as freundlich sorption isotherm or higher order kinetic reactions are solved at each time step by newton s method the deposition of sediment on the top is modeled by a special layer with growing number of grids to imitate the accumulation of solid materials to avoid discontinuities in concentration due to the growing deposition layers the simulated results are averaged over the time span associated with that growth for contaminants performing kinetic sorption in solids the boundary conditions 7 to 10 have to be treated by a finite volume boundary to allow the dynamics in the surface layer to be modeled and to ensure conservation of the solid phase at the boundary grid as described in more detail in the supplemental information 2 4 software capsim is written entirely using the python programming language van rossum and others 2007 with key third party modules including numeric python numpy for matrix and array calculations walt et al 2011 scientific python scipy for statistical analysis jones et al 2001 the math plotting library matplotlib for visualization hunter 2007 the graphical user interface is constructed using python s built in extensions to the tcl tk library lundh 1999 grayson 2000 python and each of the extension modules used in capsim are fully open source which facilities collaborations and extension of the tools to new applications python is an interpreted high level programming language and thus it has been widely used for the development of environmental models for scientific and engineering applications lampert and wu 2015 swain et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 palacios et al 2013 capsim can be run directly from the python interpreter or installed as a compiled executable program 2 5 logic structure for user interaction the developed executable program obtains the system parameters and properties transport and reaction coefficients and numerical simulation setups by a series of input windows a database including the information of common environmental emerging contaminants and remediation solid materials from the literature mackay 1997 hawker and connell 1988 walters and luthy 1984 mcdonoughet al 2007 azhar 2015 is provided the coefficients and properties in the database file can be further edited and updated by users to incorporate new information the software can also be used to execute batch files which facilitates a series of simulations sequentially from a user defined text value txt file this feature is especially useful for sensitivity analysis of key design parameters for the cap the simulation cases with input information are stored in input files and can be reloaded back to the system or shared to other users the simulated results including porewater concentrations fluxes solid concentrations water concentrations solid material fractions are available in the form of the temporal or spatial plots or in comma separated values csv files see fig 2 3 example application a test case was developed to illustrate the features of the modeling platform most contaminated sites possess a variety of contaminants of concern that influence a remediation design as well as model parameters that vary in different situations the following examples illustrate the application of the model for various contaminants of concern and common conditions 3 1 mercury and methylmercury mercury hg and methylmercury mehg are typical redox sensitive contaminants in the sediment environment mehg is the major toxic form of hg that accumulates in fish and leads to exposure to humans through the food chain morel et al 1998 kraepiel et al 2003 kudo and miyahara 1991 the methylation of hg to mehg and demethylation of mehg back to inorganic hg is commonly modeled with a pair of coupled first order reactions with reaction coefficients specified according to the local redox conditions the redox profile in the following case is simplified to two extreme regions an aerobic zone near the benthic surface and an anaerobic zone underlying the methylation is assumed to only occur in the anaerobic sediment layer and the demethylation occurs uniformly in the sediment the demethylation rate coefficient in this example is 0 005 yr 1 hintelmann et al 2000 and the methylation rate coefficient is estimated to be 0 4 yr 1 from mesocosm experiments bireta 2015 in the test case a 30 cm sediment layer with an initial hg concentration of 3 mg kg has been capped by a 2 cm activated carbon layer and 15 cm sand layer the top 5 cm of the sand layer is assumed to be affected by bioturbation of a uniform strength at d bio pw 0 50 cm 2 yr and d bio p 0 1 cm 2 yr table 3 summarizes the key model inputs for the simulation the mehg concentrations simulated by capsim in the base case were verified with results from comsol a commercial numerical simulation tool as shown in fig 3 a the activated carbon sand capping layers slowed down the upward transport of the mehg generated in the deeper layer the potential impact from a monthly periodic groundwater discharge t c 0 08 yr or a daily tidal groundwater discharge t c 0 0014 yr is shown in fig 3 b the instantaneous top flux of total hg solid line varied by 2 orders as the result of the periodic change of groundwater flow the averaged flux dashed line increased 5 orders of magnitude over the baseline flux with a strong groundwater discharge 600 cm yr in the case with a strong tidal impact 0 6 cm day yim and mohsen 1992 the averaged flux of hg at benthic surface dotted line increased to 1 7 μg cm 2 yr 3 2 phenanthrene phenanthrene is a hydrophobic contaminant that sorbs onto high carbon content materials the phenanthrene sorption in sand and sediments were normalized to the organic fraction of the sorbing phases with a logk oc 4 57 and its sorption in activated carbon was modeled with a freundlich isotherm q 1 03 10 7 c 0 44 walters and luthy 1984 the sediment system of the mercury example was used with the exception that layer 2 was composed of pure sand or a 0 1 by weight activated carbon sand mixture the phenanthrene porewater concentrations in the sediment layer and at the bottom were fixed at 100 μg kg the overlying water was assumed to be a well mixed lake with a benthic transfer coefficient k bl 0 00273 cm hr and a constant zero water concentration the fate and transport of phenanthrene in the sediment and the capping layer were simulated over 50 years the baseline result in fig 4 a with linear sorption was verified with an analytical solution shen and reible 2015 fig 4 b shows the possible impacts from the kinetic sorption of activated carbon in the 2 cm activated carbon sand layer or the aerobic biodegradation in the top two layers with an increasing kinetic rate coefficient the partitioning of phenanthrene in porewater and activated carbon moves toward equilibrium and the profile converges to the equilibrium case profile the concentration of phenanthrene in the capping layer is reduced significantly by the aerobic biodegradation with a first order rate constant 0 12 day 1 proposed by yuan et al 2001 fig 4 c and d show the impacts from a sediment deposition layer to the benthic surface concentrations the mass released to the overlying water body drops to effectively 0 with as little as a 0 02 cm yr deposition rate to the top of the cap the impact from the bioturbation driven distribution of sorbents to the migration of contaminants is shown in fig 4 e a solid particle bioturbation d bio p 0 3 cm 2 yr with a gaussian rms width σ 7 5 cm in equation 6 mixes the ac with both the sand from upper layer and the contaminated sediment in the lower layer and causes a substantial increase in porewater concentration at the surface capsim is conveniently structured to allow multiple simulations including monte carlo analysis with random variations of selected parameters a monte carlo analysis on the bioturbation strength and depth was performed by 100 simulations with random choices of diffusion coefficient from 1 to 5 cm 2 yr and the gaussian rms width σ from 5 cm to 10 cm the mean water sediment surface concentration at 50 years is slightly lower than the case with mean bioturbation coefficient and gaussian rms width fig 4 f 4 recent case studies with capsim the unique features of the capsim model have been applied for assessment and remediation of a variety of contaminated sites since its development including the willamette river in portland oregon a e c o m 2016 the industri plex superfund site near woburn ma haley and aldrich 2014 manistique harbor and river superfund site michigan azhar 2015 and the lower passaic river superfund site near newark new jersey ch2mhill 2013 a brief overview of the characteristics of these sites and the model application are highlighted here to illustrate the features of the software 4 1 portland harbor superfund site capsim was used in a remediation design for river mile 13 1 in the lower willamette river near the downtown reach area of portland or a e c o m 2016 the existing sediment consisted primarily of silty sand and fine gravel and it was found to contain unacceptably high levels of lead polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs dioxins furans and pahs capsim was used to design an isolation layer between the contaminated sediment and biological receptors the steady state maximum contaminant concentration in a sand isolation geotextile bioturbation layer matrix along with the transient contaminant concentration model after cap instillation were used as design metrics three caps were used for parts of the site requiring different levels of remediation the first area used a cap comprised solely of clean sand this cap was estimated to provide isolation for 400 years with a thickness of 1 5 m the second used a thick unamended sand cap that was estimated to provide chemical contaminant isolation for more than 200 years the thick unamended area purpose was to meet slope stability requirements so its thickness varied from 1 5 feet to 9 feet the final area was capped using a layer of clean sand amended with 10 by weight activated carbon based on designs in capsim of a thickness of 12 inches the amended area was estimated to provide isolation for more than 500 years 4 2 industri plex superfund site the industri plex superfund site is a former chemical and glue manufacturing facility near woburn ma haley and aldrich 2014 elevated concentrations of benzene were found in the sediment of four hide piles in the lower south pond of the site between 2011 and 2014 dredging was used to remove contaminated soil that was disposed of in an off site facility dredging was determined to be the most prudent removal method because there was very little benzene migration within the sediments and groundwater due to small groundwater flux values in the area afterward the sediment elevations would be restored for the upland edge of the site a geotextile layer an aquagate pac layer a wetland soil layer and an erosion control blanket were to be used to replenish the sediment levels and cap the breakthrough of the remaining benzene the aquagate pac layer consists of large particles to allow free water flow along with an activated carbon coating to sorb any contaminant the lower south pond area was capped and restored using a geotextile layer a wetland soil layer and an erosion control blanket capsim was used to simulate contaminant migration through the cap layer for each area within the site the model system was simulated with no bioturbation no consolidation of the underlying sediment no additional sediment deposition on top of the cap and a constant concentration boundary condition of contaminant at the underlying sediment a conservative modeling approach was used that excluded the biodegradation of benzene although degradation is expected to occur the parameters from the remedial design report were used to construct a capsim model and simulate benzene migration through the system fig 5 shows a plot using a depth of 30 cm of wetland soil and 7 5 cm of aquablok pac along with a concentration profile at a depth of 5 cm the design team was able to alter the aquablok pac depth in additional simulations to identify the design to meet containment performance requirements and minimize expenses 4 3 manistique harbor and river superfund site the in situ adsorptive potential of different cap layers for the manistique harbor and river superfund site michigan were analyzed using capsim azhar 2015 pcb contaminant migration rates were compared within sediment without any sorption amendments in situ amendments and conventional cap designs sand only with the gac and organoclay amendments mercury arsenic chromium copper pcbs and pahs benzene chlorobenzene naphthalene were all contaminants studied in combination with various sorbents to determine the most effective sorbent materials for each contaminant after using capsim to simulate a cap with no sediment amendments it was estimated that pcb 52 would take more than 100 years to deplete from the surface layer and would reach a steady state flux at the surface of 440 μg m2 year due to diffusion and an upwelling rate of 1 cm day and 157 μg m2 year at a diffusion dominated upwelling rate of 1 cm yr pcb 18 takes less time than pcb 52 to deplete from the surface layer while pcb 101 takes longer three simulations of organophilic clay omc were conducted including the in situ application of omc a 1 cm thick omc mat and an amended sand cap with a thickness of 30 cm containing omc in the first and third simulations 0 8 lb ft2 of omc were added in the overlaying sediment and sand respectively the omc simulations were modeled assuming a linear sorption isotherm reible et al 2008 the gac simulations tested the efficacy of gac as a sorbent for pcb 18 52 and 101 the simulations were the same as the omc simulations but with gac 0 4 lb ft2 in place of omc the gac sorption was modeled using the freundlich isotherm capsim results for gac sorption of pcb 52 with 10 cm of sediment are shown below the 1 cm mat of gac simulation and 30 cm of sand mixed with omc results were excluded because regardless of upwelling rate capsim predicted a surface breakthrough time of more than 1000 years for each case azhar 2015 4 4 lower passaic river superfund site the lower passaic river is the location of a former alkali manufacturing facility that contains elevated concentrations of 2 3 7 8 tcdd dioxins furans pcbs pcb 52 pahs phenanthrene mercury and other chemicals ch2mhill 2013 hicks and collins 2017 a proposed remedy involves dredging of the most highly contaminated sediment transport to an off site facility for further treatment a cap would then be placed over the remaining sediment along with a geotextile layer and an armor cap to decrease erosion of the cap and increase its lifetime capsim was employed to predict the transport of the previously mentioned contaminants through the active cap placed on the newly dredged surface sediment the cap used for each simulation was a mixture of 25 aquagate pac and 75 sand to ensure that breakthrough of each contaminant was greater than 100 years the geotextile layer placed between the active layer and sand was a nonwoven 100 plastic filter fabric and the armor layer was determined to need a thickness of 12 inches and a d50 stone size of 4 5 inches the design criteria only specified that the remediation must meet a breakthrough of at least 100 years but the cap efficacy provides more than 250 years of contaminant isolation table 4 and fig 6 show the properties of the layers and results with pcb 52 transport 5 summary assessment and remediation of contaminated sediments requires predictive models of the evolution of future contaminant levels under a variety of different scenarios a new open source software tool capsim has been developed that incorporates classical transport processes and importantly unique sediment transport processes including bioturbation deposition and consolidation the software contains a graphical user interface to expedite the application for new users but it can also be run in batch mode for sensitivity analysis or monte carlo simulations a database of key parameter values for important compounds and empirical relationships to estimate other parameters is incorporated into the software to facilitate its application to new systems capsim has been applied for assessment and remediation of a variety of contaminants in different locations throughout the united states the software provides an approach for rapid assessment of the feasibility of remediation designs for contaminated sediments software availability the capsim source code is freely

26323,the objective of this study was to combine a catchment model with a one dimensional lake water quality model to simulate the trophic state of a eutrophic shallow lake in response to nutrient load reductions and climate change the catchment and lake models gave satisfactory performance in simulating observed data indicating that the key processes that affect nutrient loads and lake trophic status were adequately represented simulating removal of nutrients by reducing fertiliser applied to farmland or irrigated wastewater had minor effects on nutrient concentrations in the lake but simulations using a projected climate for 2090 showed a major impact on nutrients and water quality this overarching effect indicated that polymictic lakes may be particularly vulnerable to eutrophication associated with climate change due to increased internal nutrient loading which will lead to a biological response of increased algal biomass while changes in external loads will have lesser relative impact keywords catchment modelling lake modelling nutrient reductions climate change lake eutrophication software the catchment modelling used soil and water assessment tool swat2012

introduction increased nutrient loads from agricultural and municipal wastewater sources have dramatically reduced the ecological quality of receiving waterbodies in many lake catchments foote et al 2015 hussain et al 2002 in many catchments actions are underway to address point and diffuse sources of nutrient pollution as mandated by environmental regulation and community concerns regarding water quality scavia et al 2014 hamilton et al 2016 examples of such actions include the diversion of wastewater discharges oecd 2001 krebs 2008 changes to farming practices and agricultural land use abell et al 2011 or the use of a range of geo engineering techniques e g spears et al 2013 including the application of alum aluminium sulphate to lake inflows smith et al 2016 in addition to the management changes described above changes in climate are predicted to affect the hydrological cycle and thus also modify nutrient transformation and transport processes in terrestrial and aquatic environments for example an increase in total phosphorus tp loads of 3 3 16 5 in danish streams in the next century was predicted by jeppesen et al 2009 mostly in response to increased precipitation in winter a climate induced increase in the loss of total nitrogen tn from a small mediterranean catchment 30 km2 in slovenia was predicted by glavan et al 2015 who applied six climate scenarios for three future periods 2030s 2060s 2090s their modelled changes in tn loads 2061 2090 ranged from 5 3 to 80 2 mostly in response to increasing precipitation on the contrary other studies have indicated that nutrient loading for the catchment may actually go down with climate warming primarily because warmer air temperatures increase evaporation resulting in less runoff robertson et al 2016 projected decreases in total annual streamflow 1 8 average ranging from 21 2 to 8 9 and tp loads 3 1 average ranging from 21 2 to 8 9 for the lake michigan basin by 2045 2065 in consideration of the projected variability in total annual precipitation 5 1 average ranging from 5 1 to 16 7 and average annual air temperature 2 6 c average ranging from 2 1 to 4 0 c climate change also directly influences lake water temperature and stratification which may in turn modify in lake nutrient dynamics arnell et al 2015 a modelling study of three new zealand lakes trolle et al 2011 showed that the effect on water quality of a mid range climate warming projection for 2100 would equate to increasing external nutrient loads by 25 50 similarly hamilton et al 2012 showed negative effects of future climate on lake water quality including increased trophic state and frequency of cyanobacteria blooms climate change could also affect the transport and processing of nutrients in lake catchments as well as processes within receiving waters some of these processes may be synergistic whereby increased catchment nutrient loads interact with higher water temperatures to stimulate growth of bloom forming cyanobacteria hamilton et al 2016 few studies have connected climate catchment and lake models to provide ecosystem scale assessments of hydrological and water quality responses to climate change and changes in catchment nutrient loads general circulation models gcms downscaled by pattern scaling methods santer et al 1990 provide future climate scenarios at a regional scale tebaldi and arblaster 2014 herger et al 2015 and have been applied to examine impacts on freshwater resources todd et al 2011 and terrestrial processes huntingford et al 2010 the main assumption underlying the pattern scaling method is that the local response of a climate variable is linearly related to the global mean temperature change mitchell 2003 this theory has some limitations in projecting future extreme events lustenberger et al 2014 and the spatial variability of climate data tebaldi and arblaster 2014 to overcome these limitations ensemble simulations using multiple gcms are recommended for the assessment of climate change impacts murphy et al 2007 lopez et al 2014 to assess temporal responses of receiving environments to catchment inputs studies have been undertaken that link outputs from a catchment

is a nationally iconic water body and plays a significant role in recreation and tourism at national scale however eutrophication has increased due to intensification of catchment land use hamilton et al 2012 the original dominant land cover of lake rotorua catchment was indigenous forest but has been replaced by pastoral land since the first european settlement in the 1880s mueller et al 2015 by 1978 pastoral land had become the dominant land cover 52 9 in the lake rotorua catchment followed by indigenous forest 30 6 and exotic forest 8 3 environment bay of plenty 1997 land cover in the lake rotorua catchment remained relatively stable from 1978 to 1996 with only 1 of pastoral land and 5 5 of indigenous forest converted into exotic forest environment bay of plenty 1997 the dominant soil types in the lake rotorua catchment are volcanic and pumice soils with low clay contents and low bulk density environment bay of plenty 2010 approximately 43 of land in the catchment has a slope of 0 to 8 but there are steeper areas of land 15 in the outer catchment of slope 26 there is a gradient of rainfall from 1 2 m y 1 in the east and near the lake to 2 5 m y 1 in the hilly western area of the catchment available at http www rotorualakes co nz rotorua urban wastewater was discharged to lake rotorua until 1991 after which time forest blocks in one lake sub catchment puarenga have been irrigated with treated municipal wastewater resource consent conditions for wastewater disposal to the forest blocks restrict tn and tp wastewater losses to the receiving stream to 30 t yr 1 and 3 t yr 1 respectively previous assessments of nutrient losses have indicated some non compliance with the tn consent limit and there is some indication of an increase in tp loading to the receiving stream since 2002 me et al 2017 these increases may be caused by a number of factors including the application rate of wastewater increases in the nutrient load from non irrigated areas within the catchment forest operations not associated with wastewater irrigation and altered rainfall patterns the puarenga stream sub catchment is also representative of typical land cover soil type and slope of the entire lake rotorua catchment and the puarenga stream contributes 16 of total nutrient loads to lake rotorua abell et al 2015 the swat2012 model was used in this study to simulate discharge and nutrient loads from the puarenga stream the second largest surface inflow to lake rotorua under current land use practices including treated wastewater irrigation and climate to provide a reference condition the model was only set up for the puarenga stream catchment because the information required for model setup for other lake sub catchments was limited and one of the major objectives was to examine the effects of treated wastewater irrigation specific to the puarenga stream on lake water quality and to assess how a suite of scenarios of nutrient reductions and climate change might affect nutrient loads in the puarenga stream using swat2012 rev629 and water quality in lake rotorua using dyresm caedym version 4 0 coupling of these two models i e output from swat2012 as input for dyresm caedym to simulate common variables was used in this study to better understand the potential for synergistic or antagonistic interactions between regional climate change and nutrient load reductions in the puarenga stream catchment to influence water quality in lake rotorua 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and measured data lake rotorua is located in the north island of new zealand fig 1 and has a warm temperate climate annual mean precipitation at 280 m asl is 1252 mm air temperature 12 6 c relative humidity 81 short wave radiation 170 w m 2 and wind speed 3 6 m s 1 at 10 m above the water surface based on the period july 2006 june 2010 the predominant wind directions are south west and north east annual mean values of the aforementioned meteorological variables were derived from records at kaituna rain gauge and rotorua airport automatic weather station fig 1 national climatic database available at http cliflo niwa co nz lake rotorua surface area 80 8 km2 mean depth 10 8 m is a polymictic temperate lake which receives inflow from nine major surface streams and nine smaller surface streams fig 1 hoare 1980 the only surface outflow mean annual discharge 18 5 m3 s 1 is the ōhau channel fig 1 hoare 1980 the residence time of lake rotorua is 1 5 years surface water temperature at 0 5 m in lake rotorua ranges from 10 c to 22 c for 2006 2010 abell et al 2015 the regional management authority bay of plenty regional council boprc has assigned a target trophic level index tli for lake rotorua of 4 2 the tli is commonly used in new zealand to quantify trophic state and integrates annual mean values of four variables secchi disc depth a measure of transparency and concentrations of chl a tp and tn burns et al 1999 the target value of 4 2 for lake rotorua corresponds to a eutrophic status i e between 4 and 5 and is based on historical data for around 1970 when the lake was deemed to have acceptable water quality scholes 2011 alum dosing of two inflows has been used to reduce tp in lake rotorua and correspondingly the tli smith et al 2016 the first dosing station commenced operation in the utuhina stream in june 2006 and the second dosing commenced in the puarenga stream in january 2010 fig 1 the sampling site for the utuhina stream is downstream of the dosing station and therefore the effects of alum dosing are implicit in the monitoring data of the utuhina stream i e the measured concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus reflect the reductions caused by alum dosing upstream which first commenced in the utuhina stream in june 2006 a second dosing plant was implemented in the puarenga stream in january 2010 with the sampling site for the puarenga stream upstream of the dosing station measured data for lake rotorua during january 2008 june 2010 were used for dyresm caedym baseline simulations therefore concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus in the puarenga stream would not have reflected alum effects in the lake model for the period from january 2010 to june 2010 but likely had minimal impact on simulation output water temperatures and concentrations of phosphate po4 p ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n tp

upstream of lake rotorua fig 1 by boprc measurements at the fri stream gauge were considered representative of the contribution of the puarenga stream catchment to lake rotorua discharge data were collected by boprc at 15 min intervals for the period 2005 through 2010 annual mean 2 2 m3 s 1 discharge records of the puarenga stream during 1998 2004 were intermittent because the fri stream gauge was closed in mid 1997 and reopened late in 2004 environment bay of plenty 2007 measured data for the puarenga stream before june 2010 were used for the swat2012 model baseline simulation as the fri

organic nitrogen orgn tp and tn were measured monthly in the puarenga stream scholes 2011 daily surface inflow and nutrient concentrations of eight other major inflows of lake rotorua were measured and nine minor inflows were estimated by abell et al 2015 see table 1 for the same period as the puarenga stream based on these data the puarenga stream contributes 16 5 of total inflow volume 15 6 of tp load and 16 2 of tn load to lake rotorua table 1 the locations of contributing catchments are shown in fig 1 2 2 model configuration key swat input data requirements included a digital elevation

home land use classifications obtained from new zealand land cover database version 2 which relates to the year 2002 and management schedules obtained from boprc for key land uses i e pasture fertilisation wastewater irrigation and timber harvesting the source of irrigation was specified in the model as outside of the catchment reflecting that the treated wastewater was sourced from the wider area e g rather than abstracted from surface water in the puarenga sub catchment daily wastewater irrigation was configured for each block by defining separate irrigation and fertilisation management schedules to define the input of water and nutrients respectively to the model the required daily irrigation depths were based on daily irrigation volumes for each block nutrients in the irrigated wastewater were assigned a daily composition configured from monthly mean concentrations measured in 7 day composite samples of the irrigated wastewater configuration of forest harvest operations was based on annual harvesting data provided by forestry managers each block was assumed to be mature at the start of the modelling period harvesting of each block was configured as a clear fell operation that took one year to complete during which time no irrigation was carried out alison lowe rotorua lakes council pers comm only one to three forested blocks were harvested at a time consistent with records the delineation of the puarenga stream catchment me et al 2015 included ten sub catchments fig 1 and 622 hydrological response units hrus the swat2012 rev629 code was used which includes modifications to hourly simulations of ss loads in stream nutrient applications in management practice and some unit corrections in soil nutrient cycling calculations further details of code modifications are outlined in me 2017 the swat2012 model was not set up for eight other major catchments or nine minor catchments because the information required for model setup was limited and a key objective of the study was to examine the effects of treated wastewater irrigation specific to the puarenga stream on lake water quality instead other inflow input data were configured using either measurements or values derived from abell et al 2015 see table 1 the dyresm caedym model version 4 0 was used to simulate hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in lake rotorua key forcing data were climate bathymetry inflow volume and nutrient concentrations and outflow volume the nine major inflows were classified into surface water dominated or groundwater dominated based on the variability of daily inflow water temperature catchments where mainstem water temperatures ranged 25 of their multi year daily mean water temperature were defined as surface water dominated and the remainder as groundwater dominated see table 1 the remaining nine minor streams were represented as a single inflow representing the residual term of the lake water balance used in dyresm caedym a lake water balance to estimate additional residual inflow was calculated after the method described in hamilton et al 2012 the inflow from minor streams was assumed to be predominantly surface waters outflow via the ōhau channel represented in the lake model was based on daily mean discharge measurements provided by the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa 2 3 model calibration and validation simulation results were generated at daily intervals from swat2012 for the four hydrological year baseline period from july 2006 to june 2010 the calibration period was july 2006 to june 2009 and the validation period was july 2009 to june 2010 this period coincided with when alum dosing started in june 2006 smith et al 2016 and the stream gauge repositioning in july 2010 one year was used for the swat2012 model warm up and its simulations from july 2006 were used to drive dyresm caedym the lake model warm up was from june 2006 to december 2007 corresponding to the 1 5 year lake residence time and a transition period of water quality first responding to alum dosing the calibration period for the dyresm caedym model was january 2008 to june 2009 and the validation period was july 2009 to june 2010 initial values of state variables required for the setup of both models were based on observed monitoring data that were measured close to the start date of the simulation period parameter values for the lake model dyresm caedym were based on previous applications of the model for lake rotorua with subsequent adjustments of parameters for nutrient release rates from the bottom sediment burger et al 2008 and particulate organic matter size and density to increase sedimentation rates to account for the in lake effects of alum dosing hamilton et al 2012 abell et al 2015 minor adjustments were made based on one at a time oat calibration morris 1991 using the mean values of measurements collected at the two lake sampling sites see subsection 2 1 for the swat2012 model values of those parameters representative of the catchment physical characteristics were derived from measurements or literature while the remainders were assigned by manual calibration within literature specified limits the oat routine was applied to examine parameter sensitivity and calibrate the parameter values within carefully selected ranges for each simulated variable q ss orgp drp orgn nh4 n and no3 n based on measurements collected at the fri stream gauge fig 1 one parameter set was used for the whole puarenga stream catchment for the swat2012 application daily mean values of 15 min discharge measurements see subsection 2 1 were used to calibrate swat parameters to simulate daily mean discharge in the puarenga stream measured nutrient and ss concentrations from monthly samples were converted to loads based on total discharge volume on the corresponding day the measured monthly loads were then used to calibrate parameters by comparing with the simulations of nutrient loads from swat2012 on that sampling day daily mean simulated discharge and nutrient concentrations for puarenga stream were used to evaluate the catchment model performance and then provide inputs to the lake model dyresm caedym inflow volume and nutrient concentrations for eight other major inflows and nine minor inflows of lake rotorua used in dyresm caedym were based on the measured or estimated hydrologic and water quality data in abell et al 2015 daily simulated concentrations from dyresm caedym were compared with monthly mean values measured in the lake on that sampling day and then used to evaluate the lake model performance a modified tli3 a three variable tli that excludes secchi depth was compared with model output because secchi depth is not explicitly estimated by dyresm caedym the tli target of 4 2 for lake rotorua is equivalent to a tli3 value of 4 32 hamilton et al 2015 for both the catchment model swat2012 and lake model dyresm caedym model outputs from the warm up period were not further considered for model evaluation model goodness of fit between simulated outputs and observations was initially assessed graphically and then quantified using four commonly used model evaluation statistics moriasi et al 2007 pearson product moment correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and percent

farmland 26 where treated municipal wastewater and fertilizer have been applied respectively nutrient inputs to the puarenga stream catchment from treated municipal wastewater irrigation irr and fertiliser applied on pastoral land pas were assigned separately in the swat2012 model four nutrient scenarios were compared 1 the current reference scenario with both nutrient sources s1 irr1pas1 2 pasture fertilisation only s2 irr0pas1 3 wastewater irrigation only s3 irr1pas0 and 4 no nutrient applications s4 irr0pas0 nutrient loadings from other catchments remained unchanged i e simulations of different nutrient application scenarios were only undertaken for the puarenga stream catchment the effects of nutrient reduction scenarios s2 s4 on loads from the puarenga stream catchment and the water quality of lake rotorua both surface and bottom waters were analysed by calculating the percentage change relative to the reference scenario s1 simulation 2 4 2 future climate projection future climate projections were determined with simclim a software package used for generating regional scenarios of future climate yin et al 2013 the scenarios are based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 the rcp8 5 scenario was chosen because it is representative of the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions as a result of a higher increasing trend of population growth and a lower rate of technology development van vuuren et al 2011 this therefore provides for a precautionary approach when predicting environmental impacts the rcp8 5 scenario corresponds to climate change equivalent to a short wave radiation increase of 8 5 w m 2 in 2100 due to increased levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions van vuuren et al 2011 amongst the 40 gcms presented in simclim 22 simulate all of the climate variables yin et al 2013 required as input by swat and dyresm caedym appendix 2 a pattern scaling method santer et al 1990 in simclim produces regional change factors that were used in this study according to the simclim 2013 data manual yin et al 2013 climate change perturbations were downscaled to regional scale using linear functions of the global annual mean temperature change using a method described in mitchell 2003 monthly median change factors touma et al 2015 derived from the downscaled climate projections fig 2 were used in the present climate data by adding to air temperature or by applying as a multiplicative factor to the other climate variables future changes in wind speed were not considered in this study because there is high uncertainty about relative change based on gcms the current climate hereafter cc0 was represented by the period from july 2005 to june 2010 swat baseline simulations used a subset of this period from july 2006 to june 2010 and dyresm caedym used january 2008 to june 2010 regional projections of global mean temperature change were derived for the period 2090 2099 the projected future climate of 2090 shows that precipitation will be higher from january to august mid summer to late winter and lower from september to december early spring to early summer with annual mean air temperature increases of 2 7 c see fig 2 the 2090 climate data represented by adding direct addition to baseline air temperature or applying a multiplicative factor to baselines of other climate variables were input to the swat2012 model to predict future hereafter cc1 nutrient loadings from the puarenga stream catchment under the four scenarios of nutrient application s1 s4 the future 2090 climate responses of puarenga stream to the lake examined the changes relative to reference scenario s1 irr1pas1 simulations monthly changes relative to scenario s2 irr0pas1 with no wastewater irrigation simulations were applied to the observed loads in other streams for consideration of the future climate impact on the lake hereafter cc2 climate change interactions with s2 irr0pas1 were considered because 1 other streams catchments did not have treated wastewater application and 2 the rotorua district council has made a decision to cease irrigation to the whakarewarewa forest by 2019 for surface water dominated catchments see subsection 2 2 the temperatures of major stream inflows were increased based on the increases predicted for the puarenga stream for groundwater dominated catchments stream water temperatures were increased by adding 88 of the projected increase in air temperature based on kurylyk et al 2013 3 results 3 1 calibration and model performance 3 1 1 swat2012 model of the puarenga stream catchment optimised parameter values for the swat2012 model are presented in appendix 3 for the whole puarenga stream catchment differences in some parameter values from previous swat2009 model runs in me et al 2015 reflected the modified swat2012 source code used in this study three parameter values were adjusted beyond the swat default range appendix 3 1 the number of days for groundwater delay gw delay 2 the phosphorus percolation coefficient pperco and 3 benthic sediment release rate for nh4 n in the stream reach at 20 c rs3 the parameter gw delay groundwater delay days was set to 1825 days five years for the waipa stream sub catchment which was the value of mean groundwater residence time reported in rutherford et al 2009 this value was set as five years because in stream nitrate concentrations appeared to reach a new equilibrium five years after treated wastewater was spray irrigated within the waipa stream sub catchment in 1991 which would be consistent with nitrate transport times in shallow groundwater rutherford et al 2009 recently morgenstern et al 2015 re examined the mean groundwater residence times for the wider puarenga stream catchment which has a more complex groundwater system and reported a mean value of c 40 years the parameter pperco phosphorus percolation coefficient was adjusted because the puarenga stream catchment outside of the irrigation area has pumice soils with moderate p adsorption capacity 50 60 and the wastewater spray blocks drained by the waipa stream have allophanic soil with high p adsorption capacity 85 95 see subsection 2 1 the parameter value for rs3 sediment release rate for in stream nh4 n 50 mg m 2 d 1 was based on gabriele et al 2013 who investigated headwater streams from an austrian catchment where there is intensive agriculture and the stream channel is rich in organic material gabriele et al 2013 estimated rs3 in the range 24 48 mg m 2 d 1 so our value reflected high nh4 n inputs and may have been reflective of some geothermal source inputs to the puarenga stream simulations of discharge from the puarenga stream catchment showed high correspondence with measured values fig 3 a discharge peaks during high rainfall events were reasonably well simulated by the swat2012 model although a few peaks were underestimated discharge after high rainfall events was overestimated in particular during winter overall the swat2012 model overestimated discharge by 3 9 during calibration july 2006 june 2009 and 14 4 during validation july 2009 june 2010 but with high values of r 0 8 p 0 001 table 2 the range of concentrations of ss simulated by swat2012 was smaller than that of measured data from the puarenga stream catchment fig 3b simulated and measured ss concentrations were positively correlated during calibration r 0 45 p 0 05 but negative during validation r 0 23 p 0 05 table 2 base flow ss concentrations were generally overestimated and several peaks of ss concentrations were underestimated contributing to an underestimate of ss concentrations of 4 3 during calibration and an overestimate of 5 3 during validation the correlations between simulated and measured ss load were positive during calibration r 0 52 p 0 01 and validation r 0 30 p 0 05 with an underestimate of 3 9 during calibration and an overestimate of 17 2 during validation table 2 concentrations of p species were generally not simulated accurately for the puarenga stream catchment fig 3c e the correlations were weak for both orgp and drp during calibration r

during calibration and 0 3 during validation with poor correlation statistics r 0 05 p 0 05 for calibration r 0 17 p 0 05 for validation table 2 however simulated and measured orgp and tp loads were positively correlated during calibration r 0 48 p 0 05 for orgp r 0 59 p 0 001 for tp and validation r 0 89 p 0 001 for both table 2 reflecting the major impact of discharge on loads correlations between simulated and measured drp loads were weak during calibration r 0 12 p 0 05 and validation r 0 22 p 0 05 table 2 the simulated concentrations of n species from the puarenga stream catchment showed high seasonal variability fig 3f i with concentrations typically higher during the drier periods of summer and autumn and lower during the wetter periods of winter and spring simulations of orgn concentrations were generally within the range of measured data fig 3f although several measured peaks were underestimated during calibration pbias 0 5 while base flow concentrations were overestimated during validation pbias 19 8 table 2 the correlations between simulated and measured orgn concentrations were positive during calibration r 0 47 p 0 05 and validation r 0 75 p 0 01 table 2 by contrast correlations between simulated and measured nh4 n concentrations were negative with underestimates of 12 8 during calibration r 0 47 p 0 05 and 15 during validation r 0 31 p 0 05 table 2 simulations of no3 n and tn concentrations were strongly correlated with measurements during calibration r 0 40 p 0 05 and validation r 0 67 p 0 05 although no3 n and tn concentrations were underestimated by 10 see pbias in table 2 catchment loads of no3 n and tn were generally underestimated during calibration 9 3 for no3 n 9 1 for tn and overestimated during validation 4 9 for no3 n 7 6 for tn table 2 higher r values for simulations of no3 n and tn loads during calibration r 0 52 p 0 01 and validation r 0 93 p 0 001 were again indicative of the importance of discharge 3 1 2 dyresm caedym model of lake rotorua most dyresm caedym parameter values used in this study were taken from the latest modelling study of lake rotorua in abell et al 2015 but two were adjusted to better fit observed data the adjusted parameters included the maximum denitrification rate coefficient altered from 0 8 to 0 5 d 1 and release rate of nh4 n from the sediment altered from 0 2 to 0 3 g m 2 d 1 a summary of key parameter values that were optimised by manual calibration in both abell et al 2015 and this study is shown in table 3 in surface waters of lake rotorua 0 6 m deep variations in nutrient concentrations were generally well reproduced by dyresm caedym including increases in winter and decreases in summer for po4 p identical to the variable drp simulated by swat nh4 n and no3 n fig 4 a e and g simulations of po4 p and nh4 n showed low or negative r values during calibration january 2008 june 2009 and validation july 2009 june 2010 and tended to be overestimated pbias 38 1 during validation table 4 however the modelled tp concentrations showed reasonable agreement with the observations during calibration r 0 63 p 0 01 and validation r 0 79 p 0 01 although concentrations were slightly underestimated by 12 1 during calibration and 16 5 during validation table 4 a highly positive correlation r 0 74 p 0 01 between simulated and observed concentrations of no3 n was found during validation although values were overestimated pbias 72 3 table 4 simulated tn concentrations also showed good agreement with observations during both calibration r 0 73 p 0 01 and validation r

r 0 38 p 0 05 and chl a concentrations tended to be underestimated during calibration pbias 24 1 and validation pbias 10 8 table 4 the mean tli3 value was 4 54 for july 2009 to june 2010 based on the measured concentrations of chl a tp and tn in surface waters of lake rotorua compared to 4 47 based on the dyresm caedym simulation under baseline conditions of both wastewater irrigation and pasture fertilisation table 5 at 19 m depth bottom simulated nutrient concentrations showed large variations with peaks corresponding either to periods of hypoxia in the hypolimnion during stratified periods or intervening isothermal periods depending on the analyte fig 4 however the dyresm caedym model simulations showed only modest statistical performance with most of the measured nutrient concentrations range in r values of 0 38 to 0 37 during calibration and validation table 4 simulated concentrations of po4 p and nh4 n in bottom waters were highest during summer thermal stratification fig 4b f which coincided with the period of occasional hypolimnetic anoxia a positive correlation r 0 37 p 0 05 between simulated and observed concentrations of no3 n pbias 3 4 was found during validation table 4 the highest simulated concentrations of no3 n occurred in winter when the water column was continuously well mixed fig 4h when the water column was stratified for periods of up to several days both modelled and observed tp at 19 m depth predominantly comprised po4 p fig 4b d and tn predominantly comprised nh4 n fig 4f j modelled tp concentrations showed poor agreement with the observations r 0 19 p 0 05 during calibration and were underestimated by 29 0 table 4 model performance for lake bottom do concentrations fig 4l and lake surface and bottom water temperatures fig 4m and n was very good showing high r values during calibration and validation r 0 99 p 0 01 table 4 concentrations of do in bottom waters of lake rotorua were slightly underestimated by 10 8 during calibration and 13 0 during validation see pbias in table 4 simulated surface and bottom water temperatures showed low bias 3 during both calibration and validation table 4 measurements at monthly intervals and simulated concentrations on corresponding days in the surface and bottom waters of lake rotorua under the current climate cc0 during calibration january 2008 june 2009 and validation july 2009 june 2010 are also compared in fig 5 showing larger variances in the measured data than the simulated results 3 2 catchment and lake scenarios current climate under the reference scenario s1 irr1pas1 corresponding to current climate 65 t yr 1 of p was applied to the puarenga catchment from july 2006 to june 2010 61 5 40 t yr 1 as pastoral fertiliser and 38 5 25 t yr 1 as irrigated wastewater table 6 as part of these applications 180 t yr 1 of n was also applied 70 6 127 t yr 1 as pastoral fertiliser and 29 4 53 t yr 1 as irrigated wastewater table 6 mean tp and tn loads at the fri stream gauge for the four years of the swat simulation july 2006 june 2010 baseline period varied among the four nutrient application scenarios relative to the current climate condition cc0 for s1 irr1pas1 the tp load at the fri stream gauge was 4 3 t yr 1 table 6 indicating that 93 4 of the 65 t yr 1 applied to land from wastewater irrigation and pasture fertilisation was attenuated and therefore not exported downstream during that period the application of pastoral fertiliser alone s2 irr0pas1 resulted in an in stream tp load of 3 7 t yr 1 table 6 a reduction of 14 0 from the simulations under s1 irr1pas1 the scenario comprising only wastewater irrigation s3 irr1pas0 resulted in an annual tp load of 2 9 t yr 1 table 6 a 32 6 reduction from simulations of tp under s1 irr1pas1 simulations with no nutrient application s4 irr0pas0 reduced the in stream annual tp load by 39 5 2 6 t yr 1 table 6 from the load under s1 irr1pas1 the mean simulated in stream tn load at the fri stream gauge over the four year simulation for s1 irr1pas1 was 62 9 t yr 1 table 6 representing an attenuation of 65 1 of the tn load applied from wastewater irrigation and pasture fertilisation s1 irr1pas1 53 and 127 t yr 1 respectively the applications of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 s4 irr0pas0 resulted in a four year annual mean in stream tn load of 46 7 31 8 and 15 6 t yr 1 respectively table 6 these three scenarios represent respective reductions of 25 8 49 4 and 75 2 table 6 relative to simulations under the reference scenario s1 irr1pas1 for the dyresm caedym simulations of 2 5 years january 2008 june 2010 baseline period annual mean concentrations of tp and tn in the surface and bottom waters and chl a in surface waters are similar for the different nutrient application scenarios s1 s4 under current climate cc0 see fig 5 as well as the mean tli3 value see table 5 annual mean tp concentrations at the lake surface under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 were slightly reduced by 2 4 2 4 and 3 5 table 6 respectively compared with the annual mean 0 0254 mg l 1 under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 annual mean tp concentration at the lake bottom under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 declined slightly by 4 7 4 4 and 6 9 table 6 respectively compared with the value of 0 0275 mg l 1 at the lake bottom under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 annual mean tn concentrations at the lake surface under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 declined slightly by 2 7 4 1 and 5 7 table 6 respectively compared with 0 0368 mg l 1 at the lake surface under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 annual mean tn concentrations at the lake bottom under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 also declined slightly by 5 3 6 3 and 9 4 table 6 respectively compared with 0 0394 mg l 1 at the lake bottom under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 annual mean chl a concentration at the lake surface under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 declined slightly by 3 2 2 8 and 4 1 table 6 respectively compared with 14 178 μg l 1 at the lake surface under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 decreases in nutrient loads in the puarenga stream under scenario s4 irr0pas0 gave reductions in total external loads from the whole rotorua catchment of only 6 2 for tp and 11 3 for tn given that the changes were only made to 15 6 of tp load and 16 2 of tn load contributing to lake rotorua large changes in water quality of the whole lake would not be expected i e 84 of the tp and tn input remained unchanged 3 3 catchment and lake scenarios 2090 climate two climate change scenarios were simulated to predict changes to lake trophic state in response to a projected future climate of 2090 the first considered the effects of 2090 climate forcing on discharge and nutrient loadings from the catchment but simulated the lake with meteorological input data from a current 2006 10 climate the second used 2090 climate data as input to both the catchment and the lake models this study design was intended to isolate the impact on lake water quality of projected future climate effects on catchment processes e g altered discharge and nutrient fluxes from projected future climate effects directly on the lake e g increased phytoplankton growth rates due to elevated temperature for the 2090 climate impact on the catchment only cc1 and on both catchment and lake cc2 scenario s2 irr0pas1 was applied for other streams and on the lake see details in subsection 2 4 2 3 3 1 effects of climate change on catchment discharge suspended solids and nutrient loads for the projected future climate of 2090 ipcc 2013 annual mean precipitation and solar radiation are projected to increase by 2 8 and 1 4 respectively humidity to decrease by 0 6 and air temperature to increase by 2 7 c for precipitation the largest increase will be in the month of march and the largest decrease will be in october relative to the scenario s2 irr0pas1 for each sub catchment discharge and ss loads increased by 4 6 and 3 8 respectively under the 2090 climate scenario table 7 nutrient loads increased with the exception of no3 n and tn the largest load increases were 14 4 for nh4 n load followed by 6 for drp orgp tp and 5 8 for orgn the largest load decrease was 13 4 for no3 n which was mostly responsible for a decrease in tn load by 7 6 a 2090 climate generally resulted in large increases in discharge suspended solids and nutrients from january to april and small increases from may to september table 7 increases were greatest in march 11 1 for discharge 11 5 for ss load 15 3 for orgp 10 4 for tp and 14 3 for orgn for dissolved nutrient species loads decreases of no3 n were greatest in september 28 and increases of drp 7 5 and nh4 n 15 7 were greatest in july relative to the scenario s2 irr0pas1 the 2090 climate scenario i e 2090 climate applied to the catchment model but current climate applied to the lake model cc1 was predicted with dyresm caedym to cause relatively minor changes in lake rotorua water quality see tables 5 and 7 periods of lake thermal stratification indicated by the number of days with changes in surface and bottom water temperatures δt greater than 0 5 c losordo and piedrahita 1991 under current climate cc0 were similar to the periods of thermal stratification under 2090 climate applied only to the catchment cc1 see table 5 minimal changes were also found to the number of days with do concentrations in bottom waters 2 mg l 1 i e a threshold for depletion of do stuber et al 1982 and the number of days with chl a concentrations in surface waters 15 μg l 1 i e a threshold for cold water fisheries mcghee 1983 under cc0 and cc1 for the catchment table 5 under the 2090 climate scenario cc1 annual mean tn concentration decreased by 3 0 in lake surface waters and 2 3 in bottom waters table 7 with the largest monthly decrease in surface waters in september 5 6 and in bottom waters in january 6 3 small increases were predicted in annual mean tp concentrations in the lake surface 0 2 and bottom 0 9 waters small increases 1 9 were predicted in annual mean chl a concentrations in the lake surface by 2090 table 7 relative to the scenario s2 irr0pas1 applying the climate change scenario cc1 to the catchment model but not the lake model yielded a negligible change in the mean tli3 value table 5 3 3 2 effects of climate change on catchment and lake water quality under the projected future climate of 2090 annual mean evaporation is predicted by the lake model to increase by 10 6 table 8 for the surface water catchment annual mean inflow water temperature simulated by the swat2012 model increases by 2 c for the groundwater recharge catchment inflow water temperature increases by 2 4 c quantified by 88 of the projected increase in air temperature kurylyk et al 2013 generally the largest increases in water temperatures for surface water and groundwater were from january to april table 8 relative to the scenario s2 irr0pas1 more frequent and longer periods of thermal stratification were simulated by dyresm caedym for lake rotorua in 2090 see table 5 indicated by the number of days with δt 0 5 c increasing from 294 under cc0 to 345 under cc2 the number of days with do concentrations in bottom waters 2 mg l 1 was predicted to increase 2 4 fold from 58 under cc0 to 141 under cc2 while the number of days with chl a concentrations in surface waters 15 μg l 1 was predicted to increase 1 5 fold from 291 under cc0 to 446 under cc2 applying the combined catchment lake model simulations using forcing data for a projected 2090 climate gave an increase in annual mean tp tn and chl a concentrations in lake surface waters of 45 9 44 5 and 44 9 respectively table 8 compared with concentrations under the current climate cc0 the largest increase was in march for tp 57 5 and february for tn 56 9 in lake surface waters for chl a in surface waters the largest increase was in january 109 and the smallest increase was in july 4 2 for bottom waters tp and tn concentrations increased by 56 4 and 56 8 respectively table 8 the largest increase occurred in february for tp 141 1 and tn 152 0 in bottom waters the 2090 climate scenario applied to the catchment and the lake model gave a substantial increase in the mean tli3 value from 4 46 current climate to 4 88 table 5 fig 5 shows the major changes in annual mean concentrations of tp and tn in the surface and bottom waters and chl a in surface waters of lake rotorua between the 2090 climate on the catchment only cc1 and on both the catchment and lake cc2 4 discussion this study integrated catchment discharge and nutrient concentrations from the swat2012 model with the lake water quality model dyresm caedym yielding a quantitative assessment of the effects of land management practices and future climate change on trophic state of a nationally iconic lake in new zealand simulation of a range of nutrient load and climate scenarios using a factorial study design allowed the relative effects of land management and projected climate change to be examined further the effects of projected climate change on lake water quality were then examined to isolate the effects due to catchment processes from those due to in lake processes the results show that the effects on lake water quality due to major changes to nutrient loading in one sub catchment are minor relative to the effects due to changes to in lake processes associated with projected climate change 4 1 model performance and sensitivity the improved swat2012 model performed better than swat2009 see me et al 2015 for simulating concentrations of tn and tp in the puarenga stream for the validation period discharge and loads of tp and tn from the puarenga stream catchment simulated using the swat2012 model generally showed positive correlations r 0 88 p 0 001 with the measured data but less so for in stream concentrations of tn r 0 78 p 0 01 and tp r 0 17 p 0 05 overestimates of discharge in puarenga stream during high rainfall in winter could be due to overestimates of lateral flow contributions cartwright et al 2014 the relatively high value of parameter slope steepness hru slp assigned as 0 1 equal to 5 7 slope based on the average dem slope and applied over the entire catchment in this study may have resulted in overestimates of lateral flow contributions from shallow aquifers to stream channels ward et al 2012 periods of elevated discharge are also important because they correspond to increased nutrient mobilisation and erosive processes operating at the landscape scale abell et al 2013 poor model performance for simulations of drp and tp concentrations could be partly related to the swat2012 soil p parameters which are lumped for the catchment such as psp p availability index phoskd soil p partitioning coefficient and pperco soil p percolation coefficient arnold et al 2013 ideally parameter values should also be optimised to reflect episodic events zhang et al 2015 dry and wet periods and relevant irrigation regimes such as in the forestry harvested area in this study it is possible therefore that the values of these parameters do not accurately represent p transport on the landscape following rainfall seasonal variations in concentrations of n species from the puarenga stream catchment were well simulated by swat2012 higher simulated concentrations of nh4 n occurred in summer likely due to the increased temperature in this season which enhances rates of organic mineralisation processes hien et al 2016 the underestimation of nh4 n concentrations in winter could have also resulted from overestimates of discharge in puarenga stream during high rainfall in winter i e dilution higher concentrations of no3 n simulated in winter reflect the higher leaching rates of no3 n when the soils become saturated following high rainfall resulting in high rates of leaching to the stream simulated no3 n concentrations were lower than observed values in summer probably because of the inability of swat to adequately replicate the relative increase in no3 enriched groundwater flow to the channel bain et al 2012 this highlights the importance of enhancing swat performance by improving the representation of interactions between the groundwater aquifer and river channel which represents a critical area for nutrient dynamics guzman et al 2015 the lake model dyresm caedym predictions for surface waters showed strong seasonality that was similar to the measured data with high positive correlations between measured and simulated tp and tn concentrations polymictic temperate lakes mix intermittently during the summer stratified period in response to wind kourzeneva et al 2012 and this was both observed and simulated in this study brief spikes of po4 p and nh4 n concentrations observed in lake surface waters in summer were well simulated due to the ability of the model to capture wind driven lake turnover events the accumulated nutrients and increased temperature during this period concurrently accelerated phytoplankton growth with simulated surface concentrations of chl a a proxy for phytoplankton biomass generally highest in summer however poor model performance for simulating chl a concentrations may be due to inadequate representation of the ecology of key phytoplankton guilds also spatial variations in surface chlorophyll a concentrations can be particularly large in lake rotorua allan et al 2011 and therefore there is large sampling error when comparing spot measurements from central lake sites with horizontally averaged predictions from a 1 d model in general dyresm caedym reproduced the temporary stratification and deoxygenation events that lead to release of po4 p and nh4 n from the bottom sediments hamilton et al 2004 burger et al 2007a the annual maximum of po4 p no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in surface waters was both observed and simulated during winter which could be attributed to higher rainfall during this season transporting more nutrients into the lake abell et al 2013 as well as lower nutrient uptake rates associated with lower temperature and reduced light availability 4 2 reducing nutrient loads to the puarenga stream catchment nutrient loads to the puarenga stream decreased under the different nutrient load reduction scenarios under the scenario of wastewater removal s2 irr0pas1 the reduction 38 5 in the applied tp load was larger than the reduction 14 0 in in stream tp load this finding could be explained by the high soil p adsorption rate psp was set to 0 6 mean value derived from beets et al 2013 loads of tn in the farmland applied fertiliser were 2 4 times higher than those associated with the applied wastewater and consequently simulations of in stream annual tn loads under the scenario s2 irr0pas1 were 1 5 times higher than those under the scenario of farmland applied fertiliser removal s3 irr1pas0 the difference indicates there is also some loss of n between where it is applied and the stream which may be attributed to processes such as plant uptake and export of n in production as well as denitrification this is supported by the modelled outputs showing 1 the reduction 82 3 of plant uptake of n in the puarenga stream catchment under the scenario of farmland applied fertiliser removal s3 irr1pas0 was larger than the reduction 5 1 under the scenario of wastewater removal s2 irr0pas1 2 the reduction 80 1 of nitrate nitrogen yield in lateral flow under the scenario of farmland applied fertiliser removal s3 irr1pas0 was larger than the reduction 14 8 under the scenario of wastewater removal s2 irr0pas1 and 3 the reduction 80 5 of n from denitrification under the scenario of farmland applied fertiliser removal s3 irr1pas0 was larger than the reduction 14 3 under the scenario of wastewater removal s2 irr0pas1 without any anthropogenic nutrient loadings s4 irr0pas0 there was a moderate reduction of in stream annual tp load 39 5 and a large reduction of in stream annual tn load 75 2 the difference between n and p may be attributed to the high soil p adsorption rate psp 0 6 resulting in a legacy of p see sharpley et al 2014 being retained in the catchment soils by contrast the relatively rapid leaching of n reflects the mobile nature of this nutrient zogg et al 2000 with high n percolation rate assigned in the swat model nperco 0 05 the scenario without any anthropogenic nutrient loadings from the puarenga stream catchment i e s4 irr0pas0 was predicted to cause minimal improvement to lake water quality simulated nutrient reductions in the puarenga stream catchment are a minor fraction of total catchment nutrient load to lake rotorua and tp and tn loads remain largely unchanged in the short term the benefits from external nutrient load reductions may be difficult to decipher unless they are large in magnitude relative to internal loading for shallow polymictic lake rotorua periods of thermal stratification of sufficient duration to generate hypoxia lead to large nutrient releases to bottom waters burger et al 2007a and are interspersed with mixing events that make these nutrients available to support phytoplankton production in euphotic waters 4 3 climate change impacts on catchment and lake predictions from the combined climate catchment model indicate that there would be increases in discharge and loads of ss and especially particulate n and p mostly from january to april for a 2090 climate this could be explained by the elevated rates of soil erosion and mobilisation of particulate p and n associated with increased frequency of intense rainfall events which generate quick flow decreases in simulated discharge during october reflect small projected declines in precipitation during the austral spring overall the modelled increase in mean stream discharge 4 6 in response to the projected increase in precipitation 2 8 for a 2090 climate will reflect the soil topography and land cover in the puarenga stream catchment which has mostly pumice soils moderate slope 5 7 and extensive areas of forest 47 our approach of applying modelled changes for the puarenga stream catchment to other sub catchments was appropriate to provide a synoptic assessment although the precise response of stream discharge to changes in precipitation will vary somewhat in other sub catchments in general discharge may increase to a greater extent in sub catchments with higher proportions of pasture however this will depend on other factors such as the dominance of groundwater contributions and catchment slope elevated soil temperature and in stream water temperature in 2090 would increase decomposition and mineralisation of organic matter which could then increase drp and nh4 n loads hien et al 2016 predicted that nh4 n loads would increase in almost all months of the year in response to projected future climate warming an effect that they attributed to organic mineralisation processes large decreases in no3 n load occurred in september and october under projected climate change which corresponded to a period of decreased precipitation in these months loads of no3 n also decreased from january to august 2090 during a period of increased precipitation indicating that elevated soil temperature due to warming would increase plant uptake and denitrification processes causing a decrease in no3 n loads and leaching from the catchment this is consistent with n simulation results in arheimer et al 2012 who modeled climate change impacts on riverine nutrient loads to the baltic sea they similarly predicted decreased no3 n losses associated with climate change which they attributed to plant uptake and denitrification processes donnelly et al 2011 predicted that tn load from the vistula river catchment poland 325 km2 63 agricultural land use would decrease by 4 under increased temperature due to global warming in the puarenga stream catchment 47 of the land use is exotic pinus radiata forest and therefore plant uptake could play the primary role in reducing tn loads from the catchment tn loads decreased 7 6 under the 2090 climate in our study for 10 catchments areas 4 36 41 91 km2 in the north of denmark with similar rainfall to our study area predicted increases in tp loads ranged from 3 3 to 16 5 by 2100 jeppesen et al 2009 increases in tp load 6 predicted for the puarenga stream catchment in 2090 were small compared to values given by jeppesen et al 2009 and may reflect high soil p adsorption in soils of this catchment beets et al 2013 and correspondingly high p adsorption rate 0 6 in the model the contrasting response of catchment tn and tp loads to projected climate change likely reflects the relatively rapid mobilisation of n through leaching while p is mostly retained in the soils under the 2090 climate applied to the catchment only there was a decrease 3 0 in annual mean tn concentration in lake surface waters but an increase 1 9 in annual mean chl a concentrations highlighting the potential that redox dynamics of n in the bottom waters could be changed by the decreased external no3 n load burger et al 2008 for shallow polymictic lake rotorua increased water temperatures in 2090 with frequent and longer periods of summer thermal stratification and bottom water deoxygenation are consistent with previous models of this lake özkundakci et al 2012 and lakes elsewhere e g wilhelm and adrian 2008 the stratification deoxygenation effect was well predicted by dyresm caedym under baseline conditions an increase in temperature will also enhance the mineralisation of organic matter as well as causing higher rates of sediment nutrient release e g nh4 n and po4 p from bottom sediments adrian et al 2009 these two inorganic nutrient species nh4 n and po4 p have been found by burger et al 2008 to be the dominant source of increases in n and p concentrations in surface waters of lake rotorua when there are mixing events following extended stratification periods during summer burger et al 2008 also found that nutrients released from the bottom sediments contributed a major source of nutrients that was comparable with external loading increasing water temperature in 2090 caused stronger summer stratification and higher concentrations of tp and tn from january to april in particular following the release from bottom sediments nutrients i e nh4 n and po4 p which are readily assimilated by phytoplankton burger et al 2008 accumulate in bottom waters and accelerate phytoplankton growth when subsequently mixed through the water column hamilton et al 2012 concurrently increased water temperature directly stimulates growth of phytoplankton as demonstrated by the result that concentrations of chl a a proxy for phytoplankton biomass in lake surface waters were simulated to increase from january to march with increased temperature under a 2090 climate compared with the baseline climate catchment tn loadings dominated by no3 n decreased by 7 6 while lake surface tn concentrations dominated by nh4 n increased by 44 5 under a 2090 climate highlighting that careful consideration of the different forms of nitrogen is required to better understand responses to climate change increases in external nutrient loads and increasing temperature in a future climate are likely to act synergistically to negatively impact lake water quality e g komatsu et al 2007 although external nitrogen load from the puarenga stream catchment was predicted in this study to decline moderately by 7 6 with future climate warming of 2090 tn concentrations were much higher for the lake 40 implying that the effects of increased temperatures caused by climate change on phytoplankton physiology lake stratification and nutrient cycling that are described above can have a major influence on trophic status in this eutrophic polymictic lake in addition to overall increased productivity increased temperatures could lead to increased dominance of cyanobacteria and greater frequency of harmful algal blooms e g carey et al 2012 although changes to phytoplankton assemblages were not analysed in this study due to paucity of phytoplankton taxonomy data for validation trolle et al 2011 modelled mean chl a concentrations dominated by chlorophytes and diatoms in a shallow and eutrophic lake lake ellesmere canterbury south island using dyresm caedym and found that chlorophytes increasingly dominated diatoms with water temperature increases in eutrophic lake rotoehu maximum depth 13 m in the bay of plenty region near lake rotorua trolle et al 2011 found that under a warmer climate cyanophytes increased substantially in summer months and diatoms increased in winter months lower diatom biomass was also predicted during future warmer climates by mooij et al 2007 who examined the impacts of increasing water temperature on a shallow lake in europe using the pclake model these studies indicate that different groups of phytoplankton will respond differently to n and p enrichment as well as climate change variations in internal nutrient loads may also influence the succession of phytoplankton as noted for lake rotorua by burger et al 2007b the predictions of water quality in lake surface waters with climate change have some degree of uncertainty because future changes in wind speed were not considered in this study water column stratification is highly sensitive to this variable adrian et al 2009 complex temporal and spatial variability in precipitation and temperature projections critically depends on the greenhouse gas forcing among a variety of ipcc models and represents a source of uncertainty in the predictions of lake water quality since we do not know the precise trajectory of future greenhouse gas emissions giorgi 2010 furthermore long term variability of bottom sediment composition was not considered in dyresm caedym simulations in this study rather fixed sediment release rate parameters were included in the model with rates adjusted within model simulations according to overlying water temperature and do ӧzkundakci et al 2012 provide an empirical approach to modify the sediment composition boundary conditions of lake rotorua that could be applied in future studies nonetheless these uncertainties are not expected to change the key conclusion that climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in the trophic state of lake rotorua unless more stringent nutrient control measures are adopted 5 conclusions the improved hourly routing catchment model swat2012 rev629 was combined with the lake model dyresm caedym to predict the response of polymictic eutrophic lake rotorua to a projected 2090 climate and reductions in nutrient loads from a major sub catchment the puarenga stream from wastewater irrigated forest and farmland simulated nutrient loads in the other sub catchments to the lake were based on current measured loads the lake model results showed that large reductions to nutrient loads in the puarenga stream yielded relatively small improvements in lake water quality this reflects that despite being a major sub catchment the puarenga stream catchment still only contributes 16 of total nutrient loads to lake rotorua lake water quality effects caused by direct climate change impacts to in lake processes were much larger than those caused by indirect climate change impacts to the catchment processes further the overall adverse effects of projected climate change on lake water quality were large and outweighed the effects of nutrient load reductions in one sub catchment this finding reflected that lake rotorua is polymictic with large nutrient stores in benthic sediments consequently projected increased water temperatures in 2090 will cause more extended periods i e a few weeks of thermal stratification in summer which will increase the duration of hypoxic conditions in bottom waters and exacerbate internal nutrient loading in the short term i e months to a few years such changes to internal lake nutrient dynamics i e sediment water exchanges in conjunction with increased phytoplankton growth rates caused by warmer temperatures would affect water quality considerably more than changes to external nutrient loading from the catchment thus climate change is expected to confound actions to improve water quality by managing external nutrient loads acknowledgements this research was supported through the bay of plenty regional council grant for a chair in lake restoration and management at the

26323,the objective of this study was to combine a catchment model with a one dimensional lake water quality model to simulate the trophic state of a eutrophic shallow lake in response to nutrient load reductions and climate change the catchment and lake models gave satisfactory performance in simulating observed data indicating that the key processes that affect nutrient loads and lake trophic status were adequately represented simulating removal of nutrients by reducing fertiliser applied to farmland or irrigated wastewater had minor effects on nutrient concentrations in the lake but simulations using a projected climate for 2090 showed a major impact on nutrients and water quality this overarching effect indicated that polymictic lakes may be particularly vulnerable to eutrophication associated with climate change due to increased internal nutrient loading which will lead to a biological response of increased algal biomass while changes in external loads will have lesser relative impact keywords catchment modelling lake modelling nutrient reductions climate change lake eutrophication software the catchment modelling used soil and water assessment tool swat2012

introduction increased nutrient loads from agricultural and municipal wastewater sources have dramatically reduced the ecological quality of receiving waterbodies in many lake catchments foote et al 2015 hussain et al 2002 in many catchments actions are underway to address point and diffuse sources of nutrient pollution as mandated by environmental regulation and community concerns regarding water quality scavia et al 2014 hamilton et al 2016 examples of such actions include the diversion of wastewater discharges oecd 2001 krebs 2008 changes to farming practices and agricultural land use abell et al 2011 or the use of a range of geo engineering techniques e g spears et al 2013 including the application of alum aluminium sulphate to lake inflows smith et al 2016 in addition to the management changes described above changes in climate are predicted to affect the hydrological cycle and thus also modify nutrient transformation and transport processes in terrestrial and aquatic environments for example an increase in total phosphorus tp loads of 3 3 16 5 in danish streams in the next century was predicted by jeppesen et al 2009 mostly in response to increased precipitation in winter a climate induced increase in the loss of total nitrogen tn from a small mediterranean catchment 30 km2 in slovenia was predicted by glavan et al 2015 who applied six climate scenarios for three future periods 2030s 2060s 2090s their modelled changes in tn loads 2061 2090 ranged from 5 3 to 80 2 mostly in response to increasing precipitation on the contrary other studies have indicated that nutrient loading for the catchment may actually go down with climate warming primarily because warmer air temperatures increase evaporation resulting in less runoff robertson et al 2016 projected decreases in total annual streamflow 1 8 average ranging from 21 2 to 8 9 and tp loads 3 1 average ranging from 21 2 to 8 9 for the lake michigan basin by 2045 2065 in consideration of the projected variability in total annual precipitation 5 1 average ranging from 5 1 to 16 7 and average annual air temperature 2 6 c average ranging from 2 1 to 4 0 c climate change also directly influences lake water temperature and stratification which may in turn modify in lake nutrient dynamics arnell et al 2015 a modelling study of three new zealand lakes trolle et al 2011 showed that the effect on water quality of a mid range climate warming projection for 2100 would equate to increasing external nutrient loads by 25 50 similarly hamilton et al 2012 showed negative effects of future climate on lake water quality including increased trophic state and frequency of cyanobacteria blooms climate change could also affect the transport and processing of nutrients in lake catchments as well as processes within receiving waters some of these processes may be synergistic whereby increased catchment nutrient loads interact with higher water temperatures to stimulate growth of bloom forming cyanobacteria hamilton et al 2016 few studies have connected climate catchment and lake models to provide ecosystem scale assessments of hydrological and water quality responses to climate change and changes in catchment nutrient loads general circulation models gcms downscaled by pattern scaling methods santer et al 1990 provide future climate scenarios at a regional scale tebaldi and arblaster 2014 herger et al 2015 and have been applied to examine impacts on freshwater resources todd et al 2011 and terrestrial processes huntingford et al 2010 the main assumption underlying the pattern scaling method is that the local response of a climate variable is linearly related to the global mean temperature change mitchell 2003 this theory has some limitations in projecting future extreme events lustenberger et al 2014 and the spatial variability of climate data tebaldi and arblaster 2014 to overcome these limitations ensemble simulations using multiple gcms are recommended for the assessment of climate change impacts murphy et al 2007 lopez et al 2014 to assess temporal responses of receiving environments to catchment inputs studies have been undertaken that link outputs from a catchment

trends in lake surface water temperature water column thermal gradients and dynamics of phosphorus and phytoplankton lake rotorua located in the bay of plenty region of the north island of new zealand is a nationally iconic water body and plays a significant role in recreation and tourism at national scale however eutrophication has increased due to intensification of catchment land use hamilton et al 2012 the original dominant land cover of lake rotorua catchment was indigenous forest but has been replaced by pastoral land since the first european settlement in the 1880s mueller et al 2015 by 1978 pastoral land had become the dominant land cover 52 9 in the lake rotorua catchment followed by indigenous forest 30 6 and exotic forest 8 3 environment bay of plenty 1997 land cover in the lake rotorua catchment remained relatively stable from 1978 to 1996 with only 1 of pastoral land and 5 5 of indigenous forest converted into exotic forest environment bay of plenty 1997 the dominant soil types in the lake rotorua catchment are volcanic and pumice soils with low clay contents and low bulk density environment bay of plenty 2010 approximately 43 of land in the catchment has a slope of 0 to 8 but there are steeper areas of land 15 in the outer catchment of slope 26 there is a gradient of rainfall from 1 2 m y 1 in the east and near the lake to 2 5 m y 1 in the hilly western area of the catchment available at http www rotorualakes co nz rotorua urban wastewater was discharged to lake rotorua until 1991 after which time forest blocks in one lake sub catchment puarenga have been irrigated with treated municipal wastewater resource consent conditions for wastewater disposal to the forest blocks restrict tn and tp wastewater losses to the receiving stream to 30 t yr 1 and 3 t yr 1 respectively previous assessments of nutrient losses have indicated some non compliance with the tn consent limit and there is some indication of an increase in tp loading to the receiving stream since 2002 me et al 2017 these increases may be caused by a number of factors including the application rate of wastewater increases in the nutrient load from non irrigated areas within the catchment forest operations not associated with wastewater irrigation and altered rainfall patterns the puarenga stream sub catchment is also representative of typical land cover soil type and slope of the entire lake rotorua catchment and the puarenga stream contributes 16 of total nutrient loads to lake rotorua abell et al 2015 the swat2012 model was used in this study to simulate discharge and nutrient loads from the puarenga stream the second largest surface inflow to lake rotorua under current land use practices including treated wastewater irrigation and climate to provide a reference condition the model was only set up for the puarenga stream catchment because the information required for model setup for other lake sub catchments was limited and one of the major objectives was to examine the effects of treated wastewater irrigation specific to the puarenga stream on lake water quality and to assess how a suite of scenarios of nutrient reductions and climate change might affect nutrient loads in the puarenga stream using swat2012 rev629 and water quality in lake rotorua using dyresm caedym version 4 0 coupling of these two models i e output from swat2012 as input for dyresm caedym to simulate common variables was used in this study to better understand the potential for synergistic or antagonistic interactions between regional climate change and nutrient load reductions in the puarenga stream catchment to influence water quality in lake rotorua 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and measured data lake rotorua is located in the north island of new zealand fig 1 and has a warm temperate climate annual mean precipitation at 280 m asl is 1252 mm air temperature 12 6 c relative humidity 81 short wave radiation 170 w m 2 and wind speed 3 6 m s 1 at 10 m above the water surface based on the period july 2006 june 2010 the predominant wind directions are south west and north east annual mean values of the aforementioned meteorological variables were derived from records at kaituna rain gauge and rotorua airport automatic weather station fig 1 national climatic database available at http cliflo niwa co nz lake rotorua surface area 80 8 km2 mean depth 10 8 m is a polymictic temperate lake which receives inflow from nine major surface streams and nine smaller surface streams fig 1 hoare 1980 the only surface outflow mean annual discharge 18 5 m3 s 1 is the ōhau channel fig 1 hoare 1980 the residence time of lake rotorua is 1 5 years surface water temperature at 0 5 m in lake rotorua ranges from 10 c to 22 c for 2006 2010 abell et al 2015 the regional management authority bay of plenty regional council boprc has assigned a target trophic level index tli for lake rotorua of 4 2 the tli is commonly used in new zealand to quantify trophic state and integrates annual mean values of four variables secchi disc depth a measure of transparency and concentrations of chl a tp and tn burns et al 1999 the target value of 4 2 for lake rotorua corresponds to a eutrophic status i e between 4 and 5 and is based on historical data for around 1970 when the lake was deemed to have acceptable water quality scholes 2011 alum dosing of two inflows has been used to reduce tp in lake rotorua and correspondingly the tli smith et al 2016 the first dosing station commenced operation in the utuhina stream in june 2006 and the second dosing commenced in the puarenga stream in january 2010 fig 1 the sampling site for the utuhina stream is downstream of the dosing station and therefore the effects of alum dosing are implicit in the monitoring data of the utuhina stream i e the measured concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus reflect the reductions caused by alum dosing upstream which first commenced in the utuhina stream in june 2006 a second dosing plant was implemented in the puarenga stream in january 2010 with the sampling site for the puarenga stream upstream of the dosing station measured data for lake rotorua during january 2008 june 2010 were used for dyresm caedym baseline simulations therefore concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus in the puarenga stream would not have reflected alum effects in the lake model for the period from january 2010 to june 2010 but likely had minimal impact on simulation output water temperatures and concentrations of phosphate po4 p ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n tp tn dissolved oxygen do and chl a are monitored monthly at two depths integrated 0 6 m and 19 m in lake rotorua by boprc the puarenga stream is the second largest surface inflow to lake rotorua and drains a catchment of 77 km2 fig 1 the puarenga stream subcatchment catchment elevation is from 280 m asl where it enters lake rotorua to 761 m asl it is moderately steep mean slope 9 or 5 7 and the predominant land uses are exotic pinus radiata forest 47 and pastoral farmland 26 new zealand land cover database version 2 there are two substantive cold water springs waipa spring and hemo spring

upstream of lake rotorua fig 1 by boprc measurements at the fri stream gauge were considered representative of the contribution of the puarenga stream catchment to lake rotorua discharge data were collected by boprc at 15 min intervals for the period 2005 through 2010 annual mean 2 2 m3 s 1 discharge records of the puarenga stream during 1998 2004 were intermittent because the fri stream gauge was closed in mid 1997 and reopened late in 2004 environment bay of plenty 2007 measured data for the puarenga stream before june 2010 were used for the swat2012 model baseline simulation as the fri

organic nitrogen orgn tp and tn were measured monthly in the puarenga stream scholes 2011 daily surface inflow and nutrient concentrations of eight other major inflows of lake rotorua were measured and nine minor inflows were estimated by abell et al 2015 see table 1 for the same period as the puarenga stream based on these data the puarenga stream contributes 16 5 of total inflow volume 15 6 of tp load and 16 2 of tn load to lake rotorua table 1 the locations of contributing catchments are shown in fig 1 2 2 model configuration key swat input data requirements included a digital elevation model dem elevation range 283 761 m 25 m horizontal resolution obtained from boprc meteorological records from rotorua airport weather station rainfall data from the kaituna and red stag rain gauges records of two cold water springs and one geothermal spring flow rates and nutrient concentrations in spring discharges which were configured as point sources a stream digital map obtained from boprc

home land use classifications obtained from new zealand land cover database version 2 which relates to the year 2002 and management schedules obtained from boprc for key land uses i e pasture fertilisation wastewater irrigation and timber harvesting the source of irrigation was specified in the model as outside of the catchment reflecting that the treated wastewater was sourced from the wider area e g rather than abstracted from surface water in the puarenga sub catchment daily wastewater irrigation was configured for each block by defining separate irrigation and fertilisation management schedules to define the input of water and nutrients respectively to the model the required daily irrigation depths were based on daily irrigation volumes for each block nutrients in the irrigated wastewater were assigned a daily composition configured from monthly mean concentrations measured in 7 day composite samples of the irrigated wastewater configuration of forest harvest operations was based on annual harvesting data provided by forestry managers each block was assumed to be mature at the start of the modelling period harvesting of each block was configured as a clear fell operation that took one year to complete during which time no irrigation was carried out alison lowe rotorua lakes council pers comm only one to three forested blocks were harvested at a time consistent with records the delineation of the puarenga stream catchment me et al 2015 included ten sub catchments fig 1 and 622 hydrological response units hrus the swat2012 rev629 code was used which includes modifications to hourly simulations of ss loads in stream nutrient applications in management practice and some unit corrections in soil nutrient cycling calculations further details of code modifications are outlined in me 2017 the swat2012 model was not set up for eight other major catchments or nine minor catchments because the information required for model setup was limited and a key objective of the study was to examine the effects of treated wastewater irrigation specific to the puarenga stream on lake water quality instead other inflow input data were configured using either measurements or values derived from abell et al 2015 see table 1 the dyresm caedym model version 4 0 was used to simulate hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in lake rotorua key forcing data were climate bathymetry inflow volume and nutrient concentrations and outflow volume the nine major inflows were classified into surface water dominated or groundwater dominated based on the variability of daily inflow water temperature catchments where mainstem water temperatures ranged 25 of their multi year daily mean water temperature were defined as surface water dominated and the remainder as groundwater dominated see table 1 the remaining nine minor streams were represented as a single inflow representing the residual term of the lake water balance used in dyresm caedym a lake water balance to estimate additional residual inflow was calculated after the method described in hamilton et al 2012 the inflow from minor streams was assumed to be predominantly surface waters outflow via the ōhau channel represented in the lake model was based on daily mean discharge measurements provided by the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa 2 3 model calibration and validation simulation results were generated at daily intervals from swat2012 for the four hydrological year baseline period from july 2006 to june 2010 the calibration period was july 2006 to june 2009 and the validation period was july 2009 to june 2010 this period coincided with when alum dosing started in june 2006 smith et al 2016 and the stream gauge repositioning in july 2010 one year was used for the swat2012 model warm up and its simulations from july 2006 were used to drive dyresm caedym the lake model warm up was from june 2006 to december 2007 corresponding to the 1 5 year lake residence time and a transition period of water quality first responding to alum dosing the calibration period for the dyresm caedym model was january 2008 to june 2009 and the validation period was july 2009 to june 2010 initial values of state variables required for the setup of both models were based on observed monitoring data that were measured close to the start date of the simulation period parameter values for the lake model dyresm caedym were based on previous applications of the model for lake rotorua with subsequent adjustments of parameters for nutrient release rates from the bottom sediment burger et al 2008 and particulate organic matter size and density to increase sedimentation rates to account for the in lake effects of alum dosing hamilton et al 2012 abell et al 2015 minor adjustments were made based on one at a time oat calibration morris 1991 using the mean values of measurements collected at the two lake sampling sites see subsection 2 1 for the swat2012 model values of those parameters representative of the catchment physical characteristics were derived from measurements or literature while the remainders were assigned by manual calibration within literature specified limits the oat routine was applied to examine parameter sensitivity and calibrate the parameter values within carefully selected ranges for each simulated variable q ss orgp drp orgn nh4 n and no3 n based on measurements collected at the fri stream gauge fig 1 one parameter set was used for the whole puarenga stream catchment for the swat2012 application daily mean values of 15 min discharge measurements see subsection 2 1 were used to calibrate swat parameters to simulate daily mean discharge in the puarenga stream measured nutrient and ss concentrations from monthly samples were converted to loads based on total discharge volume on the corresponding day the measured monthly loads were then used to calibrate parameters by comparing with the simulations of nutrient loads from swat2012 on that sampling day daily mean simulated discharge and nutrient concentrations for puarenga stream were used to evaluate the catchment model performance and then provide inputs to the lake model dyresm caedym inflow volume and nutrient concentrations for eight other major inflows and nine minor inflows of lake rotorua used in dyresm caedym were based on the measured or estimated hydrologic and water quality data in abell et al 2015 daily simulated concentrations from dyresm caedym were compared with monthly mean values measured in the lake on that sampling day and then used to evaluate the lake model performance a modified tli3 a three variable tli that excludes secchi depth was compared with model output because secchi depth is not explicitly estimated by dyresm caedym the tli target of 4 2 for lake rotorua is equivalent to a tli3 value of 4 32 hamilton et al 2015 for both the catchment model swat2012 and lake model dyresm caedym model outputs from the warm up period were not further considered for model evaluation model goodness of fit between simulated outputs and observations was initially assessed graphically and then quantified using four commonly used model evaluation statistics moriasi et al 2007 pearson product moment correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and percent

farmland 26 where treated municipal wastewater and fertilizer have been applied respectively nutrient inputs to the puarenga stream catchment from treated municipal wastewater irrigation irr and fertiliser applied on pastoral land pas were assigned separately in the swat2012 model four nutrient scenarios were compared 1 the current reference scenario with both nutrient sources s1 irr1pas1 2 pasture fertilisation only s2 irr0pas1 3 wastewater irrigation only s3 irr1pas0 and 4 no nutrient applications s4 irr0pas0 nutrient loadings from other catchments remained unchanged i e simulations of different nutrient application scenarios were only undertaken for the puarenga stream catchment the effects of nutrient reduction scenarios s2 s4 on loads from the puarenga stream catchment and the water quality of lake rotorua both surface and bottom waters were analysed by calculating the percentage change relative to the reference scenario s1 simulation 2 4 2 future climate projection future climate projections were determined with simclim a software package used for generating regional scenarios of future climate yin et al 2013 the scenarios are based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 the rcp8 5 scenario was chosen because it is representative of the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions as a result of a higher increasing trend of population growth and a lower rate of technology development van vuuren et al 2011 this therefore provides for a precautionary approach when predicting environmental impacts the rcp8 5 scenario corresponds to climate change equivalent to a short wave radiation increase of 8 5 w m 2 in 2100 due to increased levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions van vuuren et al 2011 amongst the 40 gcms presented in simclim 22 simulate all of the climate variables yin et al 2013 required as input by swat and dyresm caedym appendix 2 a pattern scaling method santer et al 1990 in simclim produces regional change factors that were used in this study according to the simclim 2013 data manual yin et al 2013 climate change perturbations were downscaled to regional scale using linear functions of the global annual mean temperature change using a method described in mitchell 2003 monthly median change factors touma et al 2015 derived from the downscaled climate projections fig 2 were used in the present climate data by adding to air temperature or by applying as a multiplicative factor to the other climate variables future changes in wind speed were not considered in this study because there is high uncertainty about relative change based on gcms the current climate hereafter cc0 was represented by the period from july 2005 to june 2010 swat baseline simulations used a subset of this period from july 2006 to june 2010 and dyresm caedym used january 2008 to june 2010 regional projections of global mean temperature change were derived for the period 2090 2099 the projected future climate of 2090 shows that precipitation will be higher from january to august mid summer to late winter and lower from september to december early spring to early summer with annual mean air temperature increases of 2 7 c see fig 2 the 2090 climate data represented by adding direct addition to baseline air temperature or applying a multiplicative factor to baselines of other climate variables were input to the swat2012 model to predict future hereafter cc1 nutrient loadings from the puarenga stream catchment under the four scenarios of nutrient application s1 s4 the future 2090 climate responses of puarenga stream to the lake examined the changes relative to reference scenario s1 irr1pas1 simulations monthly changes relative to scenario s2 irr0pas1 with no wastewater irrigation simulations were applied to the observed loads in other streams for consideration of the future climate impact on the lake hereafter cc2 climate change interactions with s2 irr0pas1 were considered because 1 other streams catchments did not have treated wastewater application and 2 the rotorua district council has made a decision to cease irrigation to the whakarewarewa forest by 2019 for surface water dominated catchments see subsection 2 2 the temperatures of major stream inflows were increased based on the increases predicted for the puarenga stream for groundwater dominated catchments stream water temperatures were increased by adding 88 of the projected increase in air temperature based on kurylyk et al 2013 3 results 3 1 calibration and model

this value was set as five years because in stream nitrate concentrations appeared to reach a new equilibrium five years after treated wastewater was spray irrigated within the waipa stream sub catchment in 1991 which would be consistent with nitrate transport times in shallow groundwater rutherford et al 2009 recently morgenstern et al 2015 re examined the mean groundwater residence times for the wider puarenga stream catchment which has a more complex groundwater system and reported a mean value of c 40 years the parameter pperco phosphorus percolation coefficient was adjusted because the puarenga stream catchment outside of the irrigation area has pumice soils with moderate p adsorption capacity 50 60 and the wastewater spray blocks drained by the waipa stream have allophanic soil with high p adsorption capacity 85 95 see subsection 2 1 the parameter value for rs3 sediment release rate for in stream nh4 n 50 mg m 2 d 1 was based on gabriele et al 2013 who investigated headwater streams from an austrian catchment where there is intensive agriculture and the stream channel is rich in organic material gabriele et al 2013 estimated rs3 in the range 24 48 mg m 2 d 1 so our value reflected high nh4 n inputs and may have been reflective of some geothermal source inputs to the puarenga stream simulations of discharge from the puarenga stream catchment showed high correspondence with measured values fig 3 a discharge peaks during high rainfall events were reasonably well simulated by the swat2012 model although a few peaks were underestimated discharge after high rainfall events was overestimated in particular during winter overall the swat2012 model overestimated discharge by 3 9 during calibration july 2006 june 2009 and 14 4 during validation july 2009 june 2010 but with high values of r 0 8 p 0 001 table 2 the range of concentrations of ss simulated by swat2012 was smaller than that of measured data from the puarenga stream catchment fig 3b simulated and measured ss concentrations were positively correlated during calibration r 0 45 p 0 05 but negative during validation r 0 23 p 0 05 table 2 base flow ss concentrations were generally overestimated and several peaks of ss concentrations were underestimated contributing to an underestimate of ss concentrations of 4 3 during calibration and an overestimate of 5 3 during validation the correlations between simulated and measured ss load were positive during calibration r 0 52 p 0 01 and validation r 0 30 p 0 05 with an underestimate of 3 9 during calibration and an overestimate of 17 2 during validation table 2 concentrations of p species were generally not simulated accurately for the puarenga stream catchment fig 3c e the correlations were weak for both orgp and drp during calibration r

showed high seasonal variability fig 3f i with concentrations typically higher during the drier periods of summer and autumn and lower during the wetter periods of winter and spring simulations of orgn concentrations were generally within the range of measured data fig 3f although several measured peaks were underestimated during calibration pbias 0 5 while base flow concentrations were overestimated during validation pbias 19 8 table 2 the correlations between simulated and measured orgn concentrations were positive during calibration r 0 47 p 0 05 and validation r 0 75 p 0 01 table

simulations of no3 n and tn concentrations were strongly correlated with measurements during calibration r 0 40 p 0 05 and validation r 0 67 p 0 05 although no3 n and tn concentrations were underestimated by 10 see pbias in table 2 catchment loads of no3 n and tn were generally underestimated during calibration 9 3 for no3 n 9 1 for tn and overestimated during validation 4 9 for no3 n 7 6 for tn table 2 higher r values for simulations of no3 n and tn loads during calibration r 0 52 p 0 01 and validation r 0 93 p 0 001 were again indicative of the importance of discharge 3 1 2 dyresm caedym model of lake rotorua most dyresm caedym parameter values used in this study were taken from the latest modelling study of lake rotorua in abell et al 2015 but two were adjusted to better fit observed data the adjusted parameters included the maximum denitrification rate coefficient altered from 0 8 to 0 5 d 1 and release rate of nh4 n from the sediment altered from 0 2 to 0 3 g m 2 d 1 a summary of key parameter values that were optimised by manual calibration in both abell et al 2015 and this study is shown in table 3 in surface waters of lake rotorua 0 6 m deep variations in nutrient concentrations were generally well reproduced by dyresm caedym including increases in winter and decreases in summer for po4 p identical to the variable drp simulated by swat nh4 n and no3 n fig 4 a e and g simulations of po4 p and nh4 n showed low or negative r values during calibration january 2008 june 2009 and validation july 2009 june 2010 and tended to be overestimated pbias 38 1 during validation table 4 however the modelled tp concentrations showed reasonable agreement with the observations during calibration r 0 63 p 0 01 and validation r 0 79 p 0 01 although concentrations were slightly underestimated by 12 1 during calibration and 16 5 during validation table 4 a highly positive correlation r 0 74 p 0 01 between simulated and observed concentrations of no3 n was found during validation although values were overestimated pbias 72 3 table 4 simulated tn concentrations also showed good agreement with observations during both calibration r 0 73 p 0 01 and validation r

measured concentrations of chl a tp and tn in surface waters of lake rotorua compared to 4 47 based on the dyresm caedym simulation under baseline conditions of both wastewater irrigation and pasture fertilisation table 5 at 19 m depth bottom simulated nutrient concentrations showed large variations with peaks corresponding either to periods of hypoxia in the hypolimnion during stratified periods or intervening isothermal periods depending on the analyte fig 4 however the dyresm caedym model simulations showed only modest statistical performance with most of the measured nutrient concentrations range in r values of 0 38 to 0 37 during calibration and validation table 4 simulated concentrations of po4 p and nh4 n in bottom waters were highest during summer thermal stratification fig 4b f which coincided with the period of occasional hypolimnetic anoxia a positive correlation r 0 37 p 0 05 between simulated and observed concentrations of no3 n pbias 3 4 was found during validation table 4 the highest simulated concentrations of no3 n occurred in winter when the water column was continuously well mixed fig 4h when the water column was stratified for periods of up to several days both modelled and observed tp at 19 m depth predominantly comprised po4 p fig 4b d and tn predominantly comprised nh4 n fig 4f j modelled tp concentrations showed poor

by 10 8 during calibration and 13 0 during validation see pbias in table 4 simulated surface and bottom water temperatures showed low bias 3 during both calibration and validation table 4 measurements at monthly intervals and simulated concentrations on corresponding days in the surface and bottom waters of lake rotorua under the current climate cc0 during calibration january 2008 june 2009 and validation july 2009 june 2010 are also compared in fig 5 showing larger variances in the measured data than the simulated results 3 2 catchment and lake scenarios current climate under the reference scenario s1 irr1pas1 corresponding to current climate 65 t yr 1 of p was applied to the puarenga catchment from july 2006 to june 2010 61 5 40 t yr 1 as pastoral fertiliser and 38 5 25 t yr 1 as irrigated wastewater table 6 as part of these applications 180 t yr 1 of n was also applied 70 6 127 t yr 1 as pastoral fertiliser and 29 4 53 t yr 1 as irrigated wastewater table 6 mean tp and tn loads at the fri stream gauge for the four years of the swat simulation july 2006 june 2010 baseline period varied among the four nutrient application scenarios relative to the current climate condition cc0 for s1 irr1pas1 the tp load at the fri stream gauge was 4 3 t yr 1 table 6 indicating that 93 4 of the 65 t yr 1 applied to land from wastewater irrigation and pasture fertilisation was attenuated and therefore not exported downstream during that period the application of pastoral fertiliser alone s2 irr0pas1 resulted in an in stream tp load of 3 7 t yr 1 table 6 a reduction of 14 0 from the simulations under s1 irr1pas1 the scenario comprising only wastewater irrigation s3 irr1pas0 resulted in an annual tp load of 2 9 t yr 1 table 6 a 32 6 reduction from simulations of tp under s1 irr1pas1 simulations with no nutrient application s4 irr0pas0 reduced the in stream annual tp load by 39 5 2 6 t yr 1 table 6 from the load under s1 irr1pas1 the mean simulated in stream tn load at the fri stream gauge over the four year simulation for s1 irr1pas1 was 62 9 t yr 1 table 6 representing an attenuation of 65 1 of the tn load applied from wastewater irrigation and pasture fertilisation s1 irr1pas1 53 and 127 t yr 1 respectively the applications of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 s4 irr0pas0 resulted in a four year annual mean in stream tn load of 46 7 31 8 and 15 6 t yr 1 respectively table 6 these three scenarios represent respective reductions of 25 8 49 4 and 75 2 table 6 relative to simulations under the reference scenario s1 irr1pas1 for the dyresm caedym simulations of 2 5 years january 2008 june 2010 baseline period annual mean concentrations of tp and tn in the surface and bottom waters and chl a in surface waters are similar for the different nutrient application scenarios s1 s4 under current climate cc0 see fig 5 as well as the mean tli3 value see table 5 annual mean tp concentrations at the lake surface under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 were slightly reduced by 2 4 2 4 and 3 5 table 6 respectively compared with the annual mean 0 0254 mg l 1 under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 annual mean tp concentration at the lake bottom under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 declined slightly by 4 7 4 4 and 6 9 table 6 respectively compared with the value of 0 0275 mg l 1 at the lake bottom under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 annual mean tn concentrations at the lake surface under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 declined slightly by 2 7 4 1 and 5 7 table 6 respectively compared with 0 0368 mg l 1 at the lake surface under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 annual mean tn concentrations at the lake bottom under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 also declined slightly by 5 3 6 3 and 9 4 table 6 respectively compared with 0 0394 mg l 1 at the lake bottom under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 annual mean chl a concentration at the lake surface under the catchment scenarios of s2 irr0pas1 s3 irr1pas0 and s4 irr0pas0 declined slightly by 3 2 2 8 and 4 1 table 6 respectively compared with 14 178 μg l 1 at the lake surface under s1 irr1pas1 table 6 decreases in nutrient loads in the puarenga stream under scenario s4 irr0pas0 gave reductions in total external loads from the whole rotorua catchment of only 6 2 for tp and 11 3 for tn given that the changes were only made to 15 6 of tp load and 16 2 of tn load contributing to lake rotorua large changes in water quality of the whole lake would not be expected i e 84 of the tp and tn input remained unchanged 3 3 catchment and lake scenarios 2090 climate two climate change scenarios were simulated to predict changes to lake trophic state in response to a projected future climate of 2090 the first considered the effects of 2090 climate forcing on discharge and nutrient loadings from the catchment but simulated the lake with meteorological input data from a current 2006 10 climate the second used 2090 climate data as input to both the catchment and the lake models this study design was intended to isolate the impact on lake water quality of projected future climate effects on catchment processes e g altered discharge and nutrient fluxes from projected future climate effects directly on the lake e g increased phytoplankton growth rates due to elevated temperature for the 2090 climate impact on the catchment only cc1 and on both catchment and lake cc2 scenario s2 irr0pas1 was applied for other streams and on the lake see details in subsection 2 4 2 3 3 1 effects of climate change on catchment discharge suspended solids and nutrient loads for the projected future climate of 2090 ipcc 2013 annual mean precipitation and solar radiation are projected to increase by 2 8 and 1 4 respectively humidity to decrease by 0 6 and air temperature to increase by 2 7 c for precipitation the largest increase will be in the month of march and the largest decrease will be in october relative to the scenario s2 irr0pas1 for each sub catchment discharge and ss loads increased by 4 6 and 3 8 respectively under the 2090 climate scenario table 7 nutrient loads increased with the exception of no3 n and tn the largest load increases were 14 4 for nh4 n load followed by 6 for drp orgp tp and 5 8 for orgn the largest load decrease was 13 4 for no3 n which was mostly responsible for a decrease in tn load by 7 6 a 2090 climate generally resulted in large increases in discharge suspended solids and nutrients from january to april and small increases from may to september table 7 increases were greatest in march 11 1 for discharge 11 5 for ss load 15 3 for orgp 10 4 for tp and 14 3 for orgn for dissolved nutrient species loads decreases of no3 n were greatest in september 28 and increases of drp 7 5 and nh4 n 15 7 were greatest in july relative to the scenario s2 irr0pas1 the 2090 climate scenario i e 2090 climate applied to the catchment model but current climate applied to the lake model cc1 was predicted with dyresm caedym to cause relatively minor changes in lake rotorua water quality see tables 5 and 7 periods of lake thermal stratification indicated by the number of days with changes in surface and bottom water temperatures δt greater than 0 5 c losordo and piedrahita 1991 under current climate cc0 were similar to the periods of thermal stratification under 2090 climate applied only to the catchment cc1 see table 5 minimal changes were also found to the number of days with do concentrations in bottom waters 2 mg l 1 i e a threshold for depletion of do stuber et al 1982 and the number of days with chl a concentrations in surface waters 15 μg l 1 i e a threshold for cold water fisheries mcghee 1983 under cc0 and cc1 for the catchment table 5 under the 2090 climate scenario cc1 annual mean tn concentration decreased by 3 0 in lake surface waters and 2 3 in bottom waters table 7 with the largest monthly decrease in surface waters in september 5 6 and in bottom waters in january 6 3 small increases were predicted in annual mean tp concentrations in the lake surface 0 2 and bottom 0 9 waters small increases 1 9 were predicted in annual mean chl a concentrations in the lake surface by 2090 table 7 relative to the scenario s2 irr0pas1 applying the climate change scenario cc1 to the catchment model but not the lake model yielded a negligible change in the mean tli3 value table 5 3 3 2 effects of climate change on catchment and lake water quality under the projected future climate of 2090 annual mean evaporation is predicted by the lake model to increase by 10 6 table 8 for the surface water catchment annual mean inflow water temperature simulated by the swat2012 model increases by 2 c for the groundwater recharge catchment inflow water temperature increases by 2 4 c quantified by 88 of the projected increase in air temperature kurylyk et al 2013 generally the largest increases in water temperatures for surface water and groundwater were from january to april table 8 relative to the scenario s2 irr0pas1 more frequent and longer periods of thermal stratification were simulated by dyresm caedym for lake rotorua in 2090 see table 5 indicated by the number of days with δt 0 5 c increasing from 294 under cc0 to 345 under cc2 the number of days with do concentrations in bottom waters 2 mg l 1 was predicted to increase 2 4 fold from 58 under cc0 to 141 under cc2 while the number of days with chl a concentrations in surface waters 15 μg l 1 was predicted to increase 1 5 fold from 291 under cc0 to 446 under cc2 applying the combined catchment lake model simulations using forcing data for a projected 2090 climate gave an increase in annual mean tp tn and chl a concentrations in lake surface waters of 45 9 44 5 and 44 9 respectively table 8 compared with concentrations under the current climate cc0 the largest increase was in march for tp 57 5 and february for tn 56 9 in lake surface waters for chl a in surface waters the largest increase was in january 109 and the smallest increase was in july 4 2 for bottom waters tp and tn concentrations increased by 56 4 and 56 8 respectively table 8 the largest increase occurred in february for tp 141 1 and tn 152 0 in bottom waters the 2090 climate scenario applied to the catchment and the lake model gave a substantial increase in the mean tli3 value from 4 46 current climate to 4 88 table 5 fig 5 shows the major changes in annual mean concentrations of tp and tn in the surface and bottom waters and chl a in surface waters of lake rotorua between the 2090 climate on the catchment only cc1 and on both the catchment and lake cc2 4 discussion this study integrated catchment discharge and nutrient concentrations from the swat2012 model with the lake water quality model dyresm caedym yielding a quantitative assessment of the effects of land management practices and future climate change on trophic state of a nationally iconic lake in new zealand simulation of a range of nutrient load and climate scenarios using a factorial study design allowed the relative effects of land management and projected climate change to be examined further the effects of projected climate change on lake water quality were then examined to isolate the effects due to catchment processes from those due to in lake processes the results show that the effects on lake water quality due to major changes to nutrient loading in one sub catchment are minor relative to the effects due to changes to in lake processes associated with projected climate change 4 1 model performance and sensitivity the improved swat2012 model performed better than swat2009 see me et al 2015 for simulating concentrations of tn and tp in the puarenga stream for the validation period discharge and loads of tp and tn from the puarenga stream catchment simulated using the swat2012 model generally showed positive correlations r 0 88 p 0 001 with the measured data but less so for in stream concentrations of tn r 0 78 p 0 01 and tp r 0 17 p 0 05 overestimates of discharge in puarenga stream during high rainfall in winter could be due to overestimates of lateral flow contributions cartwright et al 2014 the relatively high value of parameter slope steepness hru slp assigned as 0 1 equal to 5 7 slope based on the average dem slope and applied over the entire catchment in this study may have resulted in overestimates of lateral flow contributions from shallow aquifers to stream channels ward et al 2012 periods of elevated discharge are also important because they correspond to increased nutrient mobilisation and erosive processes operating at the landscape scale abell et al 2013 poor model performance for simulations of drp and tp concentrations could be partly related to the swat2012 soil p parameters which are lumped for the catchment such as psp p availability index phoskd soil p partitioning coefficient and pperco soil p percolation coefficient arnold et al 2013 ideally parameter values should also be optimised to reflect episodic events zhang et al 2015 dry and wet periods and relevant irrigation regimes such as in the forestry harvested area in this study it is possible therefore that the values of these parameters do not accurately represent p transport on the landscape following rainfall seasonal variations in concentrations of n species from the puarenga stream catchment were well simulated by swat2012 higher simulated concentrations of nh4 n occurred in summer likely due to the increased temperature in this season which enhances rates of organic mineralisation processes hien et al 2016 the underestimation of nh4 n concentrations in winter could have also resulted from overestimates of discharge in puarenga stream during high rainfall in winter i e dilution higher concentrations of no3 n simulated in winter reflect the higher leaching rates of no3 n when the soils become saturated following high rainfall resulting in high rates of leaching to the stream simulated no3 n concentrations were lower than observed values in summer probably because of the inability of swat to adequately replicate the relative increase in no3 enriched groundwater flow to the channel bain et al 2012 this highlights the importance of enhancing swat performance by improving the representation of interactions between the groundwater aquifer and river channel which represents a critical area for nutrient dynamics guzman et al 2015 the lake model dyresm caedym predictions for surface waters showed strong seasonality that was similar to the measured data with high positive correlations between measured and simulated tp and tn concentrations polymictic temperate lakes mix intermittently during the summer stratified period in response to wind kourzeneva et al 2012 and this was both observed and simulated in this study brief spikes of po4 p and nh4 n concentrations observed in lake surface waters in summer were well simulated due to the ability of the model to capture wind driven lake turnover events the accumulated nutrients and increased temperature during this period concurrently accelerated phytoplankton growth with simulated surface concentrations of chl a a proxy for phytoplankton biomass generally highest in summer however poor model performance for simulating chl a concentrations may be due to inadequate representation of the ecology of key phytoplankton guilds also spatial variations in surface chlorophyll a concentrations can be particularly large in lake rotorua allan et al 2011 and therefore there is large sampling error when comparing spot measurements from central lake sites with horizontally averaged predictions from a 1 d model in general dyresm caedym reproduced the temporary stratification and deoxygenation events that lead to release of po4 p and nh4 n from the bottom sediments hamilton et al 2004 burger et al 2007a the annual maximum of po4 p no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in surface waters was both observed and simulated during winter which could be attributed to higher rainfall during this season transporting more nutrients into the lake abell et al 2013 as well as lower nutrient uptake rates associated with lower temperature and reduced light availability 4 2 reducing nutrient loads to the puarenga stream catchment nutrient loads to the puarenga stream decreased under the different nutrient load reduction scenarios under the scenario of wastewater removal s2 irr0pas1 the reduction 38 5 in the applied tp load was larger than the reduction 14 0 in in stream tp load this finding could be explained by the high soil p adsorption rate psp was set to 0 6 mean value derived from beets et al 2013 loads of tn in the farmland applied fertiliser were 2 4 times higher than those associated with the applied wastewater and consequently simulations of in stream annual tn loads under the scenario s2 irr0pas1 were 1 5 times higher than those under the scenario of farmland applied fertiliser removal s3 irr1pas0 the difference indicates there is also some loss of n between where it is applied and the stream which may be attributed to processes such as plant uptake and export of n in production as well as denitrification this is supported by the modelled outputs showing 1 the reduction 82 3 of plant uptake of n in the puarenga stream catchment under the scenario of farmland applied fertiliser removal s3 irr1pas0 was larger than the reduction 5 1 under the scenario of wastewater removal s2 irr0pas1 2 the reduction 80 1 of nitrate nitrogen yield in lateral flow under the scenario of farmland applied fertiliser removal s3 irr1pas0 was larger than the reduction 14 8 under the scenario of wastewater removal s2 irr0pas1 and 3 the reduction 80 5 of n from denitrification under the scenario of farmland applied fertiliser removal s3 irr1pas0 was larger than the reduction 14 3 under the scenario of wastewater removal s2 irr0pas1 without any anthropogenic nutrient loadings s4 irr0pas0 there was a moderate reduction of in stream annual tp load 39 5 and a large reduction of in stream annual tn load 75 2 the difference between n and p may be attributed to the high soil p adsorption rate psp 0 6 resulting in a legacy of p see sharpley et al 2014 being retained in the catchment soils by contrast the relatively rapid leaching of n reflects the mobile nature of this nutrient zogg et al 2000 with high n percolation rate assigned in the swat model nperco 0 05 the scenario without any anthropogenic nutrient loadings from the puarenga stream catchment i e s4 irr0pas0 was predicted to cause minimal improvement to lake water quality simulated nutrient reductions in the puarenga stream catchment are a minor fraction of total catchment nutrient load to lake rotorua and tp and tn loads remain largely unchanged in the short term the benefits from external nutrient load reductions may be difficult to decipher unless they are large in magnitude relative to internal loading for shallow polymictic lake rotorua periods of thermal stratification of sufficient duration to generate hypoxia lead to large nutrient releases to bottom waters burger et al 2007a and are interspersed with mixing events that make these nutrients available to support phytoplankton production in euphotic waters 4 3 climate change impacts on catchment and lake predictions from the combined climate catchment model indicate that there would be increases in discharge and loads of ss and especially particulate n and p mostly from january to april for a 2090 climate this could be explained by the elevated rates of soil erosion and mobilisation of particulate p and n associated with increased frequency of intense rainfall events which generate quick flow decreases in simulated discharge during october reflect small projected declines in precipitation during the austral spring overall the modelled increase in mean stream discharge 4 6 in response to the projected increase in precipitation 2 8 for a 2090 climate will reflect the soil topography and land cover in the puarenga stream catchment which has mostly pumice soils moderate slope 5 7 and extensive areas of forest 47 our approach of applying modelled changes for the puarenga stream catchment to other sub catchments was appropriate to provide a synoptic assessment although the precise response of stream discharge to changes in precipitation will vary somewhat in other sub catchments in general discharge may increase to a greater extent in sub catchments with higher proportions of pasture however this will depend on other factors such as the dominance of groundwater contributions and catchment slope elevated soil temperature and in stream water temperature in 2090 would increase decomposition and mineralisation of organic matter which could then increase drp and nh4 n loads hien et al 2016 predicted that nh4 n loads would increase in almost all months of the year in response to projected future climate warming an effect that they attributed to organic mineralisation processes large decreases in no3 n load occurred in september and october under projected climate change which corresponded to a period of decreased precipitation in these months loads of no3 n also decreased from january to august 2090 during a period of increased precipitation indicating that elevated soil temperature due to warming would increase plant uptake and denitrification processes causing a decrease in no3 n loads and leaching from the catchment this is consistent with n simulation results in arheimer et al 2012 who modeled climate change impacts on riverine nutrient loads to the baltic sea they similarly predicted decreased no3 n losses associated with climate change which they attributed to plant uptake and denitrification processes donnelly et al 2011 predicted that tn load from the vistula river catchment poland 325 km2 63 agricultural land use would decrease by 4 under increased temperature due to global warming in the puarenga stream catchment 47 of the land use is exotic pinus radiata forest and therefore plant uptake could play the primary role in reducing tn loads from the catchment tn loads decreased 7 6 under the 2090 climate in our study for 10 catchments areas 4 36 41 91 km2 in the north of denmark with similar rainfall to our study area predicted increases in tp loads ranged from 3 3 to 16 5 by 2100 jeppesen et al 2009 increases in tp load 6 predicted for the puarenga stream catchment in 2090 were small compared to values given by jeppesen et al 2009 and may reflect high soil p adsorption in soils of this catchment beets et al 2013 and correspondingly high p adsorption rate 0 6 in the model the contrasting response of catchment tn and tp loads to projected climate change likely reflects the relatively rapid mobilisation of n through leaching while p is mostly retained in the soils under the 2090 climate applied to the catchment only there was a decrease 3 0 in annual mean tn concentration in lake surface waters but an increase 1 9 in annual mean chl a concentrations highlighting the potential that redox dynamics of n in the bottom waters could be changed by the decreased external no3 n load burger et al 2008 for shallow polymictic lake rotorua increased water temperatures in 2090 with frequent and longer periods of summer thermal stratification and bottom water deoxygenation are consistent with previous models of this lake özkundakci et al 2012 and lakes elsewhere e g wilhelm and adrian 2008 the stratification deoxygenation effect was well predicted by dyresm caedym under baseline conditions an increase in temperature will also enhance the mineralisation of organic matter as well as causing higher rates of sediment nutrient release e g nh4 n and po4 p from bottom sediments adrian et al 2009 these two inorganic nutrient species nh4 n and po4 p have been found by burger et al 2008 to be the dominant source of increases in n and p concentrations in surface waters of lake rotorua when there are mixing events following extended stratification periods during summer burger et al 2008 also found that nutrients released from the bottom sediments contributed a major source of nutrients that was comparable with external loading increasing water temperature in 2090 caused stronger summer stratification and higher concentrations of tp and tn from january to april in particular following the release from bottom sediments nutrients i e nh4 n and po4 p which are readily assimilated by phytoplankton burger et al 2008 accumulate in bottom waters and accelerate phytoplankton growth when subsequently mixed through the water column hamilton et al 2012 concurrently increased water temperature directly stimulates growth of phytoplankton as demonstrated by the result that concentrations of chl a a proxy for phytoplankton biomass in lake surface waters were simulated to increase from january to march with increased temperature under a 2090 climate compared with the baseline climate catchment tn loadings dominated by no3 n decreased by 7 6 while lake surface tn concentrations dominated by nh4 n increased by 44 5 under a 2090 climate highlighting that careful consideration of the different forms of nitrogen is required to better understand responses to climate change increases in external nutrient loads and increasing temperature in a future climate are likely to act synergistically to negatively impact lake water quality e g komatsu et al 2007 although external nitrogen load from the puarenga stream catchment was predicted in this study to decline moderately by 7 6 with future climate warming of 2090 tn concentrations were much higher for the lake 40 implying that the effects of increased temperatures caused by climate change on phytoplankton physiology lake stratification and nutrient cycling that are described above can have a major influence on trophic status in this eutrophic polymictic lake in addition to overall increased productivity increased temperatures could lead to increased dominance of cyanobacteria and greater frequency of harmful algal blooms e g carey et al 2012 although changes to phytoplankton assemblages were not analysed in this study due to paucity of phytoplankton taxonomy data for validation trolle et al 2011 modelled mean chl a concentrations dominated by chlorophytes and diatoms in a shallow and eutrophic lake lake ellesmere canterbury south island using dyresm caedym and found that chlorophytes increasingly dominated diatoms with water temperature increases in eutrophic lake rotoehu maximum depth 13 m in the bay of plenty region near lake rotorua trolle et al 2011 found that under a warmer climate cyanophytes increased substantially in summer months and diatoms increased in winter months lower diatom biomass was also predicted during future warmer climates by mooij et al 2007 who examined the impacts of increasing water temperature on a shallow lake in europe using the pclake model these studies indicate that different groups of phytoplankton will respond differently to n and p enrichment as well as climate change variations in internal nutrient loads may also influence the succession of phytoplankton as noted for lake rotorua by burger et al 2007b the predictions of water quality in lake surface waters with climate change have some degree of uncertainty because future changes in wind speed were not considered in this study water column stratification is highly sensitive to this variable adrian et al 2009 complex temporal and spatial variability in precipitation and temperature projections critically depends on the greenhouse gas forcing among a variety of ipcc models and represents a source of uncertainty in the predictions of lake water quality since we do not know the precise trajectory of future greenhouse gas emissions giorgi 2010 furthermore long term variability of bottom sediment composition was not considered in dyresm caedym simulations in this study rather fixed sediment release rate parameters were included in the model with rates adjusted within model simulations according to overlying water temperature and do ӧzkundakci et al 2012 provide an empirical approach to modify the sediment composition boundary conditions of lake rotorua that could be applied in future studies nonetheless these uncertainties are not expected to change the key conclusion that climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in the trophic state of lake rotorua unless more stringent nutrient control measures are adopted 5 conclusions the improved hourly routing catchment model swat2012 rev629 was combined with the lake model dyresm caedym to predict the response of polymictic eutrophic lake rotorua to a projected 2090 climate and reductions in nutrient loads from a major sub catchment the puarenga stream from wastewater irrigated forest and farmland simulated nutrient loads in the other sub catchments to the lake were based on current measured loads the lake model results showed that large reductions to nutrient loads in the puarenga stream yielded relatively small improvements in lake water quality this reflects that despite being a major sub catchment the puarenga stream catchment still only contributes 16 of total nutrient loads to lake rotorua lake water quality effects caused by direct climate change impacts to in lake processes were much larger than those caused by indirect climate change impacts to the catchment processes further the overall adverse effects of projected climate change on lake water quality were large and outweighed the effects of nutrient load reductions in one sub catchment this finding reflected that lake rotorua is polymictic with large nutrient stores in benthic sediments consequently projected increased water temperatures in 2090 will cause more extended periods i e a few weeks of thermal stratification in summer which will increase the duration of hypoxic conditions in bottom waters and exacerbate internal nutrient loading in the short term i e months to a few years such changes to internal lake nutrient dynamics i e sediment water exchanges in conjunction with increased phytoplankton growth rates caused by warmer temperatures would affect water quality considerably more than changes to external nutrient loading from the catchment thus climate change is expected to confound actions to improve water quality by managing external nutrient loads acknowledgements this research was supported through the bay of plenty regional council grant for a chair in lake restoration and management at the

26324,surface water floods swfs do not only increasingly threaten cities but also affect rural areas so far little research has been dedicated to the prediction of swfs in rural environments although in practice the process is already being considered in deterministic flood hazard assessments to test the validity of such assessments we select four raster based models with differing complexity and evaluate whether they reliably predict inundated areas by swf in rural areas the uncalibrated models are first applied to four artificial surfaces and second to eight case studies covering manifold geographical and meteorological settings for the case studies the models prediction skills are assessed based on inundated areas inferred from various sources the models performance is rather low for all case studies which highlights the necessity for calibration and or validation of such models moreover the case studies provide more general conclusions concerning the modeling of swfs in rural

increasing over the past decades in absolute terms thieken et al 2007 kron et al 2012 grahn and nyberg 2017 mostly driven by societal development e g cutter and emrich 2005 but possibly exacerbated by climate change falconer et al 2009 barredo 2009 kundzewicz et al 2014 in particular the frequency and the intensity of heavy rainfall is expected to increase in many places in the future kundzewicz et al 2014 this has drawn growing attention to surface water floods swfs which are caused by intense rainfall that cannot be drained altogether by means of natural and or artificial drainage systems stem from surcharged sewers channels culverted watercourses or groundwater springs and consequently result in ponded water and overland flow hankin et al 2008 falconer et al 2009 with a particular high percentage of impermeable areas cities are particularly prone to swfs as exemplified by recent devastating flood events affecting urbanized areas in western europe such as hull uk pitt 2008 coulthard and frostick 2010 copenhangen dk haghighatafshar et al 2014 amsterdam nl gaitan et al 2016 spekkers et al 2017 or münster de spekkers et al 2017 cities in developing countries are even more severely impacted as examples from southeast asia chan et al 2012 hénonin et al 2013 or africa di baldassarre et al 2010 kundzewicz et al 2014 illustrate not surprisingly a lot of research is dedicated to urban areas in terms of modeling swfs e g maksivomić et al 2009 chen et al 2012 sampson et al 2013 de almeida et al 2016 flood loss estimation e g merz et al 2010 jongman et al 2012 van ootegem et al 2015 as well as flood risk assessment and management e g kaźmierczak and cavan 2011 blanc et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 löwe et al 2017 in contrast relatively little research has been dedicated to rural areas in spite the fact that such areas are highly exposed to flooding as examples from the european alps point out fuchs et al 2015 2017 röthlisberger et al 2017 at the same time these areas are not only affected by fluvial floods but similarly by swfs bernet et al 2017 moreover overland flow generated on rural or peri urban areas may be transferred into urbanized areas and thereby contribute to the adverse effects of swfs within the urban environment as well andrieu et al 2004 yu and coulthard 2015 thus scientific studies regarding the link between swfs and assets at risk in rural areas are generally lacking in contrast the topic of how to prepare for and manage swfs has been discussed outside of academia bernet et al 2017 this has led to a wide range of manuals and guidelines regarding swf hazard assessment risk management and awareness raising at the point scale e g egli 2007 rüttimann and egli 2010 as well as on communal and regional scales e g castro et al 2008 dwa 2013 lubw 2016 cepri 2014 therein the focus lies generally on the built environment and thus the rural areas are considered as well in practice the tools used for swf hazard assessments consist mainly of single deterministic simulations with two dimensional 2d flood inundation models cf meon et al 2009 tyrna and hochschild 2010 kipfer et al 2015 tyrna et al 2017 this circumstance has certainly been influenced by the heavily increasing availability of high resolution digital elevation models dems driven by advancing data collection techniques wechsler 2007 fewtrell et al 2008 sampson et al 2012 chen et al 2012 neal et al 2012 dottori et al 2013 de almeida et al 2016 savage et al 2016a at the same time the applicability of hydrodynamic flood inundation models to finer resolutions has been supported by increasing computational power fewtrell et al 2008 hunter et al 2008 dottori et al 2013 savage et al 2016b however the exploitation of high resolution dems is still limited by computational constraints chen et al 2012 sampson et al 2012 de almeida et al 2016 savage et al 2016a b tyrna et al 2017 thus rather simple flood inundation models are applied in practice for swf hazard assessments as they usually encompass large areas in general a compromise is inevitable when applying a model balancing spatial resolution model complexity and computational efficiency horritt and bates 2001 cook and merwade 2009 fewtrell et al 2008 2011 sampson et al 2012 neal et al 2012 dottori et al 2013 savage et al 2016a b at the same time it is not obvious how the specific choice influences the models performance moreover recent studies have pointed out that the uncertainty associated with flood inundation models fed with high resolution dems are more complex than previously thought abily et al 2016 savage et al 2016b meanwhile the models extreme precisions may provoke overconfidence in their results which could ultimately lead to wrong decisions in flood risk management dottori et al 2013 savage et al 2016a wrong decisions can usually be prevented by rigorously evaluating the applied models e g jakeman et al 2006 bennett et al 2013 however appropriate data are crucial for this task yet there is an eminent lack of observational data blanc et al 2012 neal et al 2012 spekkers et al 2014 yu and coulthard 2015 gaitan et al 2016 rözer et al 2016 which impairs the applicability of such deterministic modeling approaches even more so for swfs in rural areas where the lack of observational data is particularly pronounced yu and coulthard 2015 in practice however the lack of observational data does not appear to prevent the use of single deterministic simulations for swf hazard assessments on the contrary examples of overland flow predictions in urban peri urban and rural areas indicate that it rather leads to the renouncement of model calibration and or validation cf meon et al 2009 tyrna and hochschild 2010 kipfer et al 2015 tyrna et al 2017 such approaches are employed to produce large scale swf hazard maps as the examples of kipfer et al 2015 and tyrna et al 2017 indicate in practice these maps are then being used to identify potentially affected assets such as buildings infrastructure agricultural fields etc thus the question arises whether the deterministic tools reportedly used today in hazard assessments e g for compiling swf maps are fit for their purpose of predicting areas exposed to swf under various conditions in particular it is unclear how well such a modeling approach performs if such tools are not conditioned and or evaluated due to a lack of observational data using this starting point the main goal of this study is to evaluate whether uncalibrated and unvalidated 2d models can reliably predict the extent of swfs in rural environments on which basis potentially exposed assets can be identified for instance based on this evaluation we are able to draw conclusions about the suitability of this modeling approach for assessing the extent of swfs as well as for modeling swfs in rural areas in general for that matter we directly explore the models predictive skills by comparing their outputs teng et al 2017 in the style of other studies benchmarking 2d models e g fewtrell et al 2011 neal et al 2012 néelz and pender 2013 we apply the models to artificial and real world test cases as a first exercise we apply the selected models to four artificial surfaces inspired by zhou and liu 2002 in this highly controlled and simplified environment the models can easily be compared and inherent model characteristics are revealed in a second exercise the models are applied to real world case studies to mimic the commonly used approach in practical swf hazard assessments we apply similar uncalibrated 2d models with varying complexity thereafter we quantitatively assess the models predictive skills regarding the flooded area using common binary pattern performance measures bennett et al 2013 as there are no data about flow depths flow velocities or flow dynamics available we only compare the simulated with the observed swf extents for that matter we have reconstructed inundated areas based on various observational data sources the seven study sites encompass various topographies slopes land use etc while each of the eight case studies is associated with either relatively heavy or weak rainfall respectively thus for the purpose of this study we relax the definition of swfs and include not only events triggered by heavy rainfall bot also events associated with weak rainfall all events have in common that overland flow was produced which led or could have led to damages to the built and unbuilt environment along the flow paths as per definition the inundations did not originate from overtopping watercourses but are directly triggered by effective rainfall cf bernet et al 2017 for a discussion of related terms 2 materials and methods 2 1 models in this study we test three raster based 2d hydrodynamic flood inundation models i e flo 2d floodarea and r sim water the models have been selected such that different levels of model complexity are covered following neal et al 2012 from the wealth of available 2d hydrodynamic models cf teng et al 2017 we chose floodarea and r sim water since they have reportedly been used in the field of flood hazard assessment covering large areas including rural environments cf kipfer et al 2015 tyrna et al 2017 flo 2d was selected as it is a hydro inundation model using a term from yu and coulthard 2015 describing models that consider hydrological processes and overland flow routing at the same time moreover it has the most complex flow routing scheme among the selected models finally the model selection was complemented by a flow accumulation algorithm i e the multiple flow direction mfd algorithm introduced by freeman 1991 such flow algorithms have manifold applications due to their striking simplicity cf lópez vicente et al 2014 alder et al 2015 an overview of the models features is provided by table 1 2 1 1 flo 2d flo 2d is a distributed physically based flood inundation model o brian 2009 among the selected models it is the most sophisticated one as it makes use of the full dynamic wave approximation o brian 2009 flo 2d has various modules which can be switched on or off if desired it incorporates an infiltration module with various available methods whereas the green ampt ga method based on green and ampt 1911 is the most sophisticated one 2 1 2 floodarea floodarea is a simplified hydrodynamic flood inundation model that is fully integrated into a geographic information system gis i e arcgis by esri with the main purpose of calculating areas affected by floods geomer 2016 the model cannot directly account for losses such as interception and infiltration thus these losses have to considered by reducing the corresponding rainfall input cf table 1 and sect 2 3 5 2 1 3 r sim water the hydrodynamic model r sim water simulates overland flow with a path sampling method which is implemented as a module in the open source gis software grass mitasova et al 2004 neteler et al 2012 similar to floodarea r sim water cannot directly account for losses such as interception and infiltration moreover unsteady rainfall cannot be modeled cf table 1 and sect 2 3 5 2 1 4 mfd mfd is a multiple flow direction algorithm that assesses the flow paths based solely on a digital elevation model dem quinn et al 1991 we use the algorithm implemented in the open source system for automated geoscientific analyses saga conrad et al 2015 among the selected models mfd is the simplest approach that does not route any water but instead assesses each cell s relative catchment area consequently the model does not predict any flow depths and velocities cf table 1 but assesses a static characteristic of the topography i e the distributed flow accumulation areas note that prior to applying mfd to real world case studies sinks and pits of the respective dem were filled as discussed by wechsler 2007 for that matter we used the algorithm by planchon and darboux 2002 with a value of 0 01 for the minimal slope 2 2 artificial surfaces to assess the performance of flow routing algorithms zhou and liu 2002 defined four different mathematical surfaces and compared the calculated specific catchment area with the theoretically true values the application of such algorithms on smooth artificial surfaces reveals distinct patterns and characteristics reflecting the algorithm s differing mathematical formulations cf zhou and liu 2002 seibert and mcglynn 2007 pilesjö and hasan 2014 we adapt this approach to flood inundation modeling even without a theoretically true value the adaptation of this approach to swf modeling reveals inherent model characteristics that might not be apparent otherwise therefore as a first exercise we apply the selected models to four artificial surfaces i e to a plane eq 1 a concave eq 2 a convex eq 3 and to a combined concave convex surface eq 4 we compiled corresponding raster dems of 250 by 250 cells and a resolution of 2 m the elevations of the plane are given by 1 z a x b y c where a 0 051 b 0 141 c 0 for a prescribed slope of s 15 and an aspect of a 160 0 x 250 0 y 250 the concave surface is defined as 2 x 2 a y 2 b z 2 c 1 z 0 where a 998 b 748 5 c 191 5 250 x 0 and 0 y 250 the convex surface is given by 3 x 2 a y 2 b z 2 c 1 z 0 where a 998 b 748 5 c 191 5 0 x 250 250 y 0 finally the combined concave convex surface is defined as 4 x 2 a y 2 b z c z 0 where a 998 b 748 5 c 191 5 250 x 0 and 250 y 0 the artificial surfaces are further manipulated two rows of the corresponding dems are incised by a minimum of 0 3 m in order to represents a 4 m wide street crossing the surfaces from west to east this incision enables to test and visualize the influence of structures in the landscape that can have major effects on overland flow paths the top views of the four artificial surfaces are shown in fig 1 for the artificial surfaces a rain event lasting 1 h with an intensity of 50 mmh 1 was simulated infiltration and interception losses were not considered a manning s roughness coefficient of n 0 24 sm 1 3 was chosen for all artificial surfaces which corresponds to the value recommended for dense grass by mccuen 2016 a value of n 0 012 sm 1 3 is chosen for the incised streets which corresponds to the recommended value for asphalt mccuen 2016 2 3 real world case studies we elaborated eight real world case studies at seven study sites i e at one study site two different events were observed the case studies characteristics are summarized in tables 2 and 3 while their respective location is shown in fig 2 in the following we introduce the delineation of the study perimeters the gathered input data the consideration of hydrological losses the reconstruction of overland flow paths as well as the assessment of the model performance in terms of hydrological losses we account for infiltration and interception losses but neglect evaporation as contributions of the latter are generally particularly low cf yu and coulthard 2015 furthermore we assume that the influence of the sewer system on the flood extent is negligible on the one hand the fractions of built up area are tiny in comparison to the rural areas for all case studies on the other hand the field observations indicated that the sewer systems were often either blocked e g by eroded material branches leaves hail etc or surcharged thus in this study the interactions between overland flow and the sewer systems are neglected as assumed similarly by e g fewtrell et al 2011 or kipfer et al 2012 2 3 1 domains in order to delineate the study perimeter for each case study the area is considered within which documented observations regarding overland flow paths are available the corresponding study perimeters were obtained by delineating the smallest respective watershed that still encompassed the reconstructed flow paths thereafter these perimeters were buffered by at least 50 m to obtain a simulation domain that extends over the watershed s boundary this ensures that the simulations boundary effects within the study perimeters remain negligible thus three different domains are differentiated for each case study observation domain d obs within which all documented overland flow paths were reconstructed watershed domain d wsd representing the smallest watershed that contains the observation perimeter the model results were cropped to this area simulation domain d sim representing the buffered watershed domain within which the simulations were carried out 2 3 2 primary input data the main input for all four models is a dem fig 3 we used the dem swissalti3d as of 2013 with a regular grid size of 2 by 2 m provided by the swiss federal office of topography swisstopo 2017a although there are dems available with finer resolutions for some of the study sites we used the aforementioned product as it is homogeneous and available for whole switzerland as r sim water and mfd do not offer a direct option to integrate flow barriers such as buildings cf table 1 the corresponding dem was modified all cells whose centroids were covered by a building were elevated by at least 10 m the land use was assessed between july 2014 and june 2016 as the land use was observed shortly after each event that falls into this period i e e3a e3b e4 e6 and e7 cf tables 2 and 3 the corresponding land use represent the conditions during these events in contrast the land use of the remaining case studies were assessed roughly three years after the date of occurrence or more although there is a slight time shift we assumed that the mapped land use is representative for the respective case study as major land use changes are not expected at these study sites within the respective period firstly the land use including buildings streets fields etc was digitized using orthophotos from the product swissimage swisstopo 2017b secondly the land use was adjusted and verified based on field observations the surface roughness values were obtained by linking the land use with literature tables i e with the comprehensive collection from mccuen 2016 as indicated in fig 3 the corresponding values are listed in table 4 the hourly rainfall rate was extracted from the product combiprecip provided by the federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss 2014 the product combines radar and rain gauge measurements by means of a co kriging with external drift e g sideris et al 2014 panziera et al 2016 it has a spatial resolution of 1 by 1 km a temporal resolution of 1 h and is available from 2005 onwards meteoswiss 2014 as the case study sites are small each study perimeter is covered by just a few cells to reduce the influence of single cells that might contain outliers the raster cells covering each perimeter were buffered by one cell thereafter the mean of these cells were calculated for each time step next the triggering rainfall events were extracted from the rainfall records by considering a minimum inter event time of t m i n 6 h and a minimum intensity threshold of i m i n 0 1 mmh 1 which are in line with common literature values e g dunkerley 2008 consequently at the beginning of each event the rain intensity had been 0 1 mmh 1 for at least six consecutive time steps of 1 h each analogous at the end of the event it did not rain for at least 6 h with an intensity 0 1 mmh 1 2 3 3 infiltration out of all four models only flo 2d allows the user to account for infiltration directly while it cannot be modeled explicitly by floodarea and r sim water whereas mfd is not dependent on rainfall altogether table 1 therefore the following approach was chosen the full potential of flo 2d was exploited by using the integrated ga infiltration module to feed the other two models with similar input as recommended by neal et al 2012 the ga method was implemented in r r core team 2016 therewith spatially and temporally variable cumulative infiltration rates were calculated based on these values effective rainfall rates were obtained that were used as model inputs for floodarea and r sim water sect 2 3 5 hereafter the implementation and parametrization of the ga method are briefly outlined based on green and ampt 1911 the cumulative infiltration f t mm at time t h can be expressed as 5 f t k t ψδθ f t ψδθ 1 whereas k is the hydraulic conductivity mmh 1 ψ the wetting front soil suction head mm δθ θ f θ i the difference between the final and initial soil moisture content thereby an important assumption is that the water is ponded at the surface from the beginning of the steady rainfall as this is generally not the case mein and larson 1973 extended the ga infiltration method to account for the time until water starts to pond t t p at which time the cumulative infiltration depth equals the cumulative rainfall accordingly the cumulative infiltration for steady rainfall after ponding time i e t t p is given by 6 f t k t t p f p ψδθ f t ψδθ 1 whereas t p denotes the ponding time h and f p f t the cumulative infiltration mm at ponding time t t p we then implemented the ga method following chu 1978 who expanded the method for unsteady rainfall events the interested reader may refer to chu 1978 who provides a detailed derivation and applied examples of the method the required ga infiltration parameters were obtained as follows we estimated each study site s dominant soil texture based on expert knowledge except for the case studies e4 and e6 for which soil maps including soil texture classes were available we estimated the hydraulic conductivity k the wetting front soil suction head ψ and the effective porosity n e using published regression parameter values from the comprehensive study by rawls et al 1983 furthermore it is assumed that the soils were saturated to a degree of s i 30 50 or 80 before each event under dry normal or wet conditions respectively each respective condition was set according to the observed antecedent rainfall cf tables 2 and 3 the change in soil moisture content was then estimated by δθ n e s f s i while assuming that the soil s saturation after the event was s f 100 2 3 4 interception canopy storage capacity depends on various factors and roughly amounts 1 mm e g ward and robinson 2000 thus the depletion of this storage is tiny in comparison to the total rainfall volumes of the corresponding case studies cf tables 2 and 3 moreover as the values of different land cover types are within the same order of magnitude we simply considered a bulk interception loss of 1 mm in flo 2d this loss volume could be entered as a model parameter for floodarea and r sim water we deducted the interception losses s mm from the total rainfall p t t mm to obtain a net rainfall p n t mm that reached the ground as follows 7 p n t 0 p t t s p t t s p t t s 2 3 5 effective rainfall infiltration cannot be modeled directly by floodarea and r sim water cf sect 2 3 3 thus to account for infiltration and interception losses we computed effective rainfall rates which were then used as model inputs the effective rainfall is given by 8 p e t p n t 1 m f t whereas p e is the cumulative effective rainfall mm p n is the net rainfall that considers an initial interception loss mm cf eq 7 m is the imperviousness factor cf table 4 and f t is the cumulative infiltration mm sect 2 3 3 note that an imperviousness factor can be set directly in flo 2d s ga infiltration module for each individual cell o brian 2009 however for floodarea and r sim water the imperviousness factors as specified in table 4 were considered during the assessment of cell and time specific effective rainfall rates in floodarea spatial variable rainfall can be modeled by providing weighting factors geomer 2016 which can be thought of as runoff coefficients relating the hyetograph to cell specific effective rainfall obviously these coefficients are changing over time and space they are defined as c i j t p e i j t p t t the spatially variable rainfall can then be modeled by creating a raster with cell values c i j t for each time step t the simulations can then be stopped after each time step and restarted with the runoff coefficients of the next time step this procedure was automated with batch scripts for r sim water this procedure is not straightforward as the simulations cannot be restarted based on results from a previous time step therefore we chose the time step with the highest effective rainfall rate and ran the model with only this single spatially variable rainfall field 2 3 6 reconstruction of overland flow paths data sources that possibly indicate past swfs include insurance claim records disaster databases reports and recollections from affected people bernet et al 2017 and references therein however for recent events it is usually possible to reconstruct flow paths of swfs based on their traces in the field as exemplified by fig 4 particularly in rural environments overland flow usually leaves notable traces such as erosion marks deposited sediments and flattened vegetation for the purpose of this study we have reconstructed discernible swf traces based on field observations following the events of the case studies e3a e3b e4 e6 and e7 whereas for the remaining case studies i e e1 and e2 the inundated areas were reconstructed based on external sources table 5 summarizes the source for the flow path reconstructions along with associated limitations as well as a qualitative confidence level of the data quality irrespective of the data source the flow paths were reconstructed and spatially localized using standard gis software the field assessment were then digitally stored all overland flow traces and paths were considered as being wet to assess the performance of the models these areas were compared to the model outputs as outlined in the following section 2 3 7 model performance across various disciplines map comparisons are a standard procedure to assess and compare model performances e g kuhnert et al 2005 foody 2007 bennett et al 2013 however there is not a single best method for this task on the contrary many tools including both quantitative as well as qualitative methods are recognized as being appropriate for this purpose kuhnert et al 2005 bennett et al 2013 thus the model performance assessment have to be adapted to the models objectives as well as to the characteristics of the available data since the task is inherently case specific bennett et al 2013 along these lines we compared the model outcomes and observations visually as well as quantitatively in terms of the latter we used common binary pattern performance measures based on the contingency table table 6 which are widely being used for the comparison of simulated and observed flood extents e g aronica et al 2002 schumann et al 2009 stephens et al 2014 zischg et al 2018 however more recently stephens et al 2014 pointed out that these performance measures are all subjected to a varying degree of bias which should be considered in subsequent conclusions as we are using different measures conjunctively in this study and are more interested in the broader picture the influence of this circumstance on our conclusions is negligible the binary pattern performance measures are based on the assessment whether a cell was observed and or simulated as wet or dry all cells covered by an observed flow paths are considered as wet for the simulation results this information was inferred from the simulated maximum flow depths h f m by applying an arbitrary threshold h t m thus cells with a maximum flow depth below the threshold h f h t are considered to be dry while all other cells h f h t are considered to be wet we tested different threshold values and compared the performance of all models applied to all case studies using the observations as the reference based on these results we empirically chose a value of h t 0 02 m as this threshold value maximized the performance of all models note that this threshold value is case specific and thus might be different for other models observational data resolutions etc in the following we compare the models results with observations in addition to a comparison of the models among each other the comparisons of the models with observations are constrained to the observation perimeter d obs while the model comparison among each other is carried out within the whole watershed d wsd cf sect 2 3 1 for the quantitative model comparison we used the following binary pattern performance measures e g aronica et al 2002 pappenberger et al 2007 bennett et al 2013 which are based on the contingency table table 6 9 bias m 1 a b a c m 1 0 ideally m 1 1 10 critical

referred to as threat score or f 2 statistic in the literature e g bennett et al 2013 stephens et al 2014 3 results 3 1 artificial surfaces despite the lack of a baseline applying the models to the selected artificial surfaces reveals interesting characteristics fig 5 first and foremost the incised street represents a prominent topographical structure that has a significant influence on the flow pattern the street acts like a channel which can collect incoming water and can be overtopped if the channel is full or if the incoming water is not sufficiently deflected whether the street is overtopped or not is discernible by the amount of dry cells directly to the south of the incised street i e cells with a flow depth or flow accumulation below the flow threshold dark red cells in fig 5 for each artificial surface the pattern of these dry cells varies significantly among the models in contrast the pattern of dry cells north of the street is more similar among the models for all but the convex surface as discussed later thus the street has a major influence on the distribution of dry and wet cells respectively in more detail r sim water does not predict a deflection of the water crossing the street on any surface quite the opposite is true for the flow accumulation calculated by mfd for all but the combined concave convex surface the street poses a complete or nearly complete flow barrier flo 2d and floodarea on the other hand show a more differentiated picture as water is overtopping where ever the flow depths are exceeding the street s incision this is most apparent on the concave surface where floodarea predicts a significant overtopping of the street s eastern end unlike the other models thus in this modeling exercise the user s choice of a model does not only heavily influence the pattern of dry and wet cells south of the street but also the corresponding flow paths the results of the hydrodynamic models do not only deviate substantially south of the street but also on the street itself for each artificial surface flo 2d consistently predicts the highest flow depths on the street floodarea s results exhibit flow depths that lie mostly between the minimal values estimated by r sim water and the high values predicted by flo 2d however as mentioned before a striking difference of floodarea compared to flo 2d is the overtopping of the street s incision at the eastern side of the concave surface compared to the other hydrodynamic models r sim water predicts by far the lowest flow depths on the street for all surfaces in fact the flow depths on the street predicted by r sim water are below the wet dry threshold of 0 02 m for all surfaces thus the flow patterns south of the street are heavily influenced of how the models predict the flow over this topographical structure however the flow patterns are also dependent on how the models simulate flow over the four different topographical forms specifically the flow patterns on the convex surface of each single model is strikingly different from the other ones which is reflected by the particularly low csi values indicated in fig 5 also the flow patterns in the northern half of the combined concave convex surface seem to deviate slightly more among the models than the produced patterns on the plane and the concave surface respectively this could be explained by the fact that the northern half of the concave convex surface is characterized by convex forms that produce particularly different results among the models lastly the flow pattern produced by floodarea on the concave surface is characterized by striking flow paths floodarea produces also sharp edged flow paths on the convex and the concave convex surface however not as pronounced as on the concave surface these flow patterns stem from the limitation of flow directions to 16 fixed angles by floodarea s flow routing scheme which is described in e g tyrna et al 2017 3 2 real world case studies the performance of the models applied to each case study is depicted in fig 6 the obtained csi eq 10 values are rather low and indicate that overall all models have a low performance for all case studies the respective maximal csi of each model lies between 0 318 and 0 344 which stem from the case study e2 for the same case study the models produce the highest hit rates eq 11 ranging between 0 566 and 0 788 save a few exceptions the hit rates are well below a value of 0 5 in all other case studies the bias is the fraction of simulated number of wet cells compared to the observed number of wet cells eq 9 thus a bias greater than one indicates an overestimation of the wet cells by the model whereas a bias below one shows the opposite as presented in fig 6 all models overestimate the number of reconstructed wet cells for some case studies but heavily underestimate them for others as depicted in fig 6 the bias is correlated with the false alarm rates eq 12 for each case study models with a lower bias are also associated with a lower false alarm rate and vice versa the lowest absolute values are produced for the simulations with strong underestimations bias 1 0 this can be expected since a particularly low bias value means that the number of modeled wet cells is much smaller than the observed number of wet cells in this case even if all modeled wet cells were misses the false alarm rate would still be small since the number of correct negatives is constantly high for all models hence following eq 12 a low false alarm rate results overall we have identified three main issues limiting the models performances i e observational data of differing quality insufficiently represented topographical structures and biased predictions of effective rainfall in the following we illustrate each of these issues with examples from the corresponding case studies the particularly low performance of all models applied to case study e1 can mainly be attributed to poor observational data namely the derivation of observed wet cells are based on an external map jordi kolb ag 2008 therein areas with ponded water as well as water on the streets are mapped while overland flow paths in the agricultural fields are not indicated table 5 thus the observations only capture areas that are small compared to the whole area that must have been inundated as depicted by fig 7 as a consequence the wet cells are overestimated the false alarm rates are high and the csi values are low for all models moreover the map by jordi kolb ag 2008 does not provide any ancillary information such as the applied mapping methods therefore the map turns out to be an unsuitable source of information for the purpose of validating the models applying the models to artificial surfaces has highlighted that topographical structures such as streets can have major effects on the produced flow paths sect 3 1 how the models are predicting flow on streets in real world case studies and how this influences the prediction of subsequent flow paths can best be shown with results from the case study e2 all models perform best in this case study as indicated by fig 6 the csi values are similarly high for all models whereas the other scores vary slightly more for instance flo 2d produces the highest hit rate however at the expense of the highest false alarm rate and the highest overestimation in contrast r sim water exhibits the smallest bias and false alarm rate however at the expense of a smaller hit rate depending on the situation one or the other configuration might be more desirable the visual comparison confirms that all four models produce plausible results as an example for the simulation results the maximal flow depth predicted by flo 2d are depicted in fig 8 based on the similar performance of all four models the case study e2 is best suited for comparing the simulated flow paths in more detail namely in most of the other case studies the models are associated with a greater range of bias values i e the number of wet cells varies more among the models which impairs the attribution of model differences fig 9 illustrates the model comparison of the observed and simulated wet cells as categorized according to the contingency table table 6 according to all models water mainly accumulates in the thalweg i e the path of lowest elevations along the hillslope cf figs 8 and 9 thereby the observed wet cells are captured well by all models except mfd which is not able the predict the ponding water towards the outlet of the observation domain the main differences between the other models are that flo 2d is overestimating the wet cells along the thalweg more than floodarea which in turn overestimates the wet cells to a larger degree than r sim water this is reflected by the respective bias values indicated in fig 9 overall the models have difficulties predicting the water flowing on the streets foremost the streets in the upper part of the domain were inundated but were not simulated as such which is reflected by the numerous misses in this area red cells fig 9 compared to the other models flo 2d predicts the observed wet street cells better this behavior could be expected based on the results from the models applied to artificial surfaces since flo 2d predicted consistently larger flow depths on the street than the other models sect 3 1 along the same lines r sim water predicts the lowest number of wet street cells which is also supported by the findings of the artificial modeling exercise interestingly all models predict roughly the same places where water overtops the street s confinement and joins the main flow path in the thalweg only one of these paths in the central part of the domain is predicted by floodarea and flo 2d while the path is not indicated by r sim water and mfd east thereof a flow path could be observed that is not simulated by any model overall this exemplifies that although the behavior may differ slightly between the models on a cell by cell basis they all produce quite similar flow paths on a broader scale or similarly fail to identify them as outlined introductorily accurate predictions of effective rainfall are crucial for increased model performances in addition to high quality observational data and well represented topographical structures if a model predicts too little runoff it usually leads to an underestimation of wet cells and consequently to a rather low performance this issue is nicely exemplified by the case studies e3a and e3b observed at the same study site cf table 1 as shown in fig 6 the number of wet cells are underestimated by all models in the first event e3a in particular floodarea and r sim water predict a much lower number of wet cells than the number of wet cells inferred from the observations consequently the performance of these two models is particularly low for this case study the performances are more balanced for the second observed event e3b however similarly to the case study e2 flo 2d produces the highest hit rate but also the highest false alarm rate owed to the overestimated number of wet cells although both case studies were triggered by thunderstorms the rainfall intensities of e3a are moderate and the event spans 13 h while e3b is associated with short and intense rainfall that is typical for thunderstorms cf table 2 thus we can observe that the hydrodynamic models i e all except mfd generally underestimate the number of wet cells for the case studies with low rainfall intensities namely the said models exhibit an underestimation of the observed wet cells for the case studies e3a e5 e6 and e7 as depicted in fig 6 this hints at the fact that the simulation of wet cells is less sensitive for case studies driven by intensive rainfall in contrast the mechanisms that lead to overland flow during the case studies with low rainfall intensities are much more complex and badly captured by the chosen modeling approach of this study the model mfd is inherently different from the other three hydrodynamic models it is not an event based model but assesses a static property of a catchment based solely on the dem i e the relative catchment area sect 2 1 4 applied to the considered case studies mfd performs similarly or even better than the other models this is most pronounced in the case study e6 further illustrated in fig 10 as highlighted by fig 10 the number of wet cells predicted by floodarea is particularly low for the case study e6 within the observation domain which is reflected by the performance measures low values fig 10b although the flow paths in the middle of the observation domain are vaguely indicated it is apparent that too little effective rainfall is predicted which leads to the exhibited underestimation of wet cells in contrast the flow paths predicted by mfd are a function of the respective catchment area of each cell irrespective of the rainfall thereby the two flow paths in the middle of the observation domain are covered notably the flow path at the western border of the observation domain is shifted slightly westwards in comparison to the observations this behavior can be attributed to the specific land management of the corresponding patato field i e furrows parallel to the slope which promotes flow at western border of this field the observed flow path at the eastern border of the observation domain is not captured by any model moreover it should be noted that the flow over the bare potato field led to erosion as depicted in fig 4a which in turn may have a significant influence on the flow patterns however such effects cannot be captured with this study s modeling approach since in most case studies the observations only cover a rather small part of the whole simulated catchment cf d obs and d wsd in tables 2 and 3 and the observations are associated with a varying degree of confidence cf table 5 we additionally compare the model results within the whole simulation domain with each other independent of the observation data by using the more sophisticated models as the reference we can assess the capability of the simpler models to reproduce results of the more complex models as fig 11 indicates floodarea as well as mfd reproduce the results stemming from flo 2d rather well at the same time the false alarm rates are particularly low however we also recognize that floodarea generally underestimates the wet cells in comparison to flo 2d r sim water slightly underestimates the wet cells in comparison to floodarea however the underestimation is limited to a small range indicating that the underestimation is similar in all case studies in addition to the comparison of the models among themselves the first row and column of fig 11 also depicts the model performance in relation to the observations namely it also displays the results shown in fig 6 in a different way whereby the overall performance is better visualized thus it depicts that the csi of every model is rather low as discussed before moreover it visualizes that the csi of the model mfd and flo 2d is very similar as well as the one of floodarea and r sim water but at a lower level moreover it visualizes the stronger tendency of floodarea and r sim water to underestimate the wet cells compared to flo 2d in comparison mfd is by far the least biased of all the models 4 discussions in this study we have followed the procedure employed in practice by current hazard assessments to produce swf hazard maps which are based on uncalibrated single deterministic simulations cf meon et al 2009 tyrna and hochschild 2010 kipfer et al 2015 tyrna et al 2017 the results from the models applied to artificial surfaces and eight real world case studies suggest that the models performance might be increased if the model were properly calibrated for instance the model exercise on artificial surfaces cf sect 3 1 exemplified the need to calibrate the surface roughness namely flo 2d predicts rather high flow depths on the incised street while r sim water predicts flow depth that are even below the chosen flow threshold of 0 02 m simulations with altered roughness values indicated that r sim water is rather sensitive to the street s chosen roughness value similarly the flow depths on the street predicted by floodarea are generally below those predicted by flo 2d a calibration of the roughness value could also improve the match between flo 2d and floodarea this circumstance is also exhibited by applying the models in real world case studies whereby floodarea and r sim water predict lower flow depths on streets cf fig 9 and sect 3 2 the results from applying the models to a broad range of different settings indicate that the models performance would still vary significantly even if the models were calibrated namely all models perform similarly well in the case study e2 cf fig 6 whereas properly calibrated models might perform even better yet it is clear that a calibration could not bring the models performances to a similar level in all case studies on the one hand this indicates that calibration and or validation based on one single case study might be misleading thus using various case studies covering a wide range of settings provides a more holistic picture of the models performance on the other hand it also indicates that the models are not capable of capturing all relevant processes under diverse circumstances in fact the results show that the hydrodynamic models tend to significantly underestimate the number of wet cells for the case studies associated with weak rainfall cf figs 6 and 10 thus the models do not predict sufficient runoff as compared to the observations driven by an underestimation of the effective rainfall more specifically the results indicate that the considered infiltration assessment methods cf sect 2 3 5 are not capturing the governing processes well namely saturation excess overland flow cannot be modeled by the applied methods although this runoff generation mechanism is likely crucial for swfs triggered by weak rainfall although swfs are usually associated by heavy rainfall as mentioned before results from bernet et al 2017 indicate that long lasting events with weak rainfall cause similar damage to buildings as short events with heavy rainfall thus a model should be able to capture events characterized by heavy as well as weak rainfall to be suitable to reliably simulate swfs in rural areas along these lines the two events observed at the same study site i e case study e3a and e3b exemplify that swfs can be triggered by heavier and weaker rainfall at the same location cf table 2 moreover the case studies exemplify that the flow paths are not a static function of the topography but are dependent on soil characteristics land use land management in addition to the rainfall input of course along these lines ferreira et al 2015 highlighted for instance that runoff generation mechanism are spatially and temporally highly variable certainly there are established and emerging methods that could represent the runoff generation processes better e g schmocker fackel et al 2007 antonetti et al 2016 steinbrich et al 2016 however the consideration of such spatially highly variable processes are often impaired by the lack of appropriate data thus for a better representation of the runoff generation processes corresponding data are required for the presented case studies such data were unavailable as well as time consuming and costly to collect the representation of topographical structures by the dem is another aspect which significantly influences the models predictions e g sampson et al 2012 de almeida et al 2016 as indicated by the model exercise on artificial surfaces the models react sensitively on structures such as streets sect 3 1 moreover applying the models to real world case studies have pinpointed that the influence of such structures on the simulation results are governed more by the representation of such structures by the respective dem than the choice of the model by the user this is in line with findings stemming from more formal model comparisons for instance from the benchmark study of urban flood models by fewtrell et al 2011 this issue is illustrated by fig 9 which indicates that the models predict the streets overtopping at the same locations while numerous of these flow paths could not be observed in reality thus this behavior suggests that the streets confinements are not represented accurately enough by the dem supported by the fact that the rural environment of the case study e2 is characterized by single lane streets with width in the same order as the dem s resolution in consequence the channelizing effect of overland flow on streets is rather poorly captured by the models confronted with the same issue kipfer et al 2012 proposed to incise all streets by a fixed depth however this measure most likely incapacitate the model to correctly reproduce the street s overtopping thus a more common solution is to use a dem with a finer resolution if available wechsler 2007 dottori et al 2013 generally small scale structures such as narrow streets are certainly better represented by a dem with finer resolutions wechsler 2007 fewtrell et al 2011 de almeida et al 2016 nevertheless as has been pointed out before finer resolutions might also lead to inadequate confidence in the extremely precise model outputs dottori et al 2013 along these lines it is crucial to note that the dem itself is an imperfect representation of the reality irrespective of its resolution wechsler 2007 abily et al 2016 just as dems with coarser resolutions topographical models with finer resolutions are not flawless either and contain artifacts which may cause false results as illustrated in fig 7 therefore the dem needs to receive particular attention i e it needs to be carefully pre and post processed in order to represent realistic flow paths as other studies have highlighted as well hankin et al 2008 hunter et al 2008 tyrna et al 2017 the models may produce distinctly different results under certain circumstances as highlighted by the models applied to the convex artificial surface characterized by diverging flow patterns fig 5 however in real world applications such forms are likely less important in comparison to plane and concave slopes as exemplified by the case study e2 characterized by concave topography cf fig 8 on such slopes the models exhibit better model agreement fig 5 thus in real world applications the model choice seems to play an inferior role compared to the previously discussed issues including the appropriate representation of effective rainfall and topographical structures in other words the model choice is generally not the most important factor determining whether the observed inundation area can be predicted well by the corresponding model at least for events associated with heavy rainfall however it should be noted that this statement might be different for the prediction of flow depths and or flow velocities as mentioned before the hydrodynamic models i e flo 2d floodarea and r sim water generally predict the number of wet cells less reliably for case studies associated with weak rainfall an exception is the flow algorithm mfd which produces the least biased results for all case studies fig 11 at the downside the algorithm cannot consider ponding or backwater as exemplified by the model s distinct underestimation of the inundated area towards the outlet of the study site e2 fig 9 mfd thus mfd can be used for approximating the extent of inundated areas but not for predicting flow depths flow velocities and flow dynamics in general lastly the model performance is also highly dependent on the used data therefore it is crucial to account for the uncertainties introduced by the input data for instance by carrying out a sensitivity analysis e g pianosi et al 2016 at the same time the uncertainties need to be considered which stem from the observational data that are used to condition and or evaluate the models for instance if the observational data are a bad representation of the models simulated quantity the performance of the models are inevitably low as exemplified by the case study e1 fig 7 and sect 3 2 yet as mentioned before there is little high quality observational data available which exhibit appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions suitable for model calibration and or validation e g hunter et al 2008 blanc et al 2012 neal et al 2012 yu and coulthard 2015 consequently in this study it was necessary to exploit different data sources including external maps eye witnesses photographs and videos mapped flood traces based on field visits partly supported by aerial photographs cf table 5 and fig 4 yet the mapped quantity is not the same for each source while the exploited photographs and videos represent a snapshot of the flow pattern at a certain instant during the respective swf reconstructions based on flood marks are constrained to areas where the flood has left discernible traces for instance overland flow with few suspended particles might not leave identifiable traces in consequence this likely leads to an underestimation of the actual inundated area accordingly we assigned this data source with a lower medium confidence level as indicated in table 5 despite the increased confidence level for overland flow reconstructed from photographs and videos a similar bias might apply to this data source as well namely a bias is introduced if the picture is not taken at the instant of the maximal flood extent therefore just as the simulation outputs the observational data should be regarded as uncertain bennett et al 2013 stephens et al 2014 savage et al 2016a thus the representation of the observations and simulations as a crisp representation of the reality might be inappropriate to address this issue pappenberger et al 2007 applied a fuzzy set approach to measure the performance based on uncertain observational data thereby slight shifts between observed and simulated wet cells could be accounted for for simulated wet cells it is straightforward to obtain a confidence level that a particular cell is wet by considering the simulated flow depths pappenberger et al 2007 in contrast this is not trivial for the observational data used in this study namely ancillary data would be necessary for instance flood traces mapped in the field could be categorized according to the respective confidence that the corresponding area was in fact inundated in case only the flood extent is of interest for instance when identifying potentially flooded assets choosing a simple over a hydrodynamic model might be advantageous as exemplified by the real world case studies the extent of swfs can be predicted similarly well with mfd as with the considered hydrodynamic models while the associated computational demand is much smaller consequently mfd could be applied to larger areas while exploiting the increasing availability of high resolution dems moreover there are other simple conceptual models as termed by teng et al 2017 which may overcome some of the limitations of mfd such as the incapability to simulate ponding water potential candidates include for instance the rapid flood spreading method rfsm as described by l homme et al 2008 or the model called hand height above the nearest drainage as introduced by nobre et al 2011 such approaches could be applied to almost any scale and area teng et al 2017 which could make them interesting candidates for regional or even continental hazard assessments regarding swfs moreover such models are predestined to be used in probabilistic modeling approaches e g merwade et al 2008 aronica et al 2012 savage et al 2016a thus the applicability of a probabilistic modeling approach in relation to swfs in rural areas should be investigated in the future as well 5 conclusions and outlook the main aim of this study was to test a swf hazard assessment approach that is currently employed in practice and is based on single simulations with uncalibrated and or unvalidated flood inundation models for that matter we applied four uncalibrated raster based models to four characteristic artificial surfaces and eight real world case studies the models application to the artificial surfaces exemplified that the flow patterns are heavily disturbed by streets insofar as the prediction of inundated areas downslope of such structures are significantly influenced thus there are large differences of how each model predicts these flow disturbances moreover the modeling exercise has indicated that the models disagree most about the prediction of flow on the convex surface the performance of the models applied to real world case studies was assessed qualitatively as well as quantitatively in relation to inundated areas inferred from different sources in summary the performance of the selected grid based models indicates that they are not yet suited to be employed in an uncalibrated mode to reliably and deterministically predict inundated areas caused by swfs in rural areas mainly the models performances are impaired by biased predictions of effective rainfall and insufficient representation of topographical structures to improve the prediction of swf hazards various approaches seem prospective first of all the deterministic modeling approach could be improved by incorporating a better prediction of the complex runoff generation mechanisms under various conditions moreover the representation of topographical structures could be improved by considering dems with finer resolutions alternatively irregular meshes and corresponding models could be used for a better representation of structures such as streets at the same time this study indicates that the models calibration and or their results validation is imperative for this task the uncertainties of the observations should be considered which may vary significantly depending on the source and quality of the observations in general the quantification and communication of the models associated uncertainties are crucial as the models extremely precise outputs have indeed the potential to provoke overconfidence in their results which may lead to inappropriate decisions in flood risk management dottori et al 2013 a different way forward would be to exploit simple conceptual models such as mfd within the context of this study mfd performed similarly well than the hydrodynamic models thus similar conceptual models could be tested which overcome some of the limitations of mfd while providing similar results the computational effort of such simple models is by far the least such approaches are therefore also interesting for the application to large areas for instance in the context of regional national or even continental swf hazard assessments yet due to lower computational constraints even the topographical data with the finest available resolutions might be exploited moreover such models could be applied in a probabilistic simulation framework which could potentially better handle the lack of observational data in comparison to the current deterministic approaches finally this study highlighted once more that observational data are crucial irrespective of the chosen way forward thus a standardized method to document and report swfs in rural and urban areas is required and should be developed at the same time systematic observations should be put in place to lie the ground for future research which is certainly necessary

26324,surface water floods swfs do not only increasingly threaten cities but also affect rural areas so far little research has been dedicated to the prediction of swfs in rural environments although in practice the process is already being considered in deterministic flood hazard assessments to test the validity of such assessments we select four raster based models with differing complexity and evaluate whether they reliably predict inundated areas by swf in rural areas the uncalibrated models are first applied to four artificial surfaces and second to eight case studies covering manifold geographical and meteorological settings for the case studies the models prediction skills are assessed based on inundated areas inferred from various sources the models performance is rather low for all case studies which highlights the necessity for calibration and or validation of such models moreover the case studies provide more general conclusions concerning the modeling of swfs in rural

increasing over the past decades in absolute terms thieken et al 2007 kron et al 2012 grahn and nyberg 2017 mostly driven by societal development e g cutter and emrich 2005 but possibly exacerbated by climate change falconer et al 2009 barredo 2009 kundzewicz et al 2014 in particular the frequency and the intensity of heavy rainfall is expected to increase in many places in the future kundzewicz et al 2014 this has drawn growing attention to surface water floods swfs which are caused by intense rainfall that cannot be drained altogether by means of natural and or artificial drainage systems stem from surcharged sewers channels culverted watercourses or groundwater springs and consequently result in ponded water and overland flow hankin et al 2008 falconer et al 2009 with a particular high percentage of impermeable areas cities are particularly prone to swfs as exemplified by recent devastating flood events affecting urbanized areas in western europe such as hull uk pitt 2008 coulthard and frostick 2010 copenhangen dk haghighatafshar et al 2014 amsterdam nl gaitan et al 2016 spekkers et al 2017 or münster de spekkers et al 2017 cities in developing countries are even more severely impacted as examples from southeast asia chan et al 2012 hénonin et al 2013 or africa di baldassarre et al 2010 kundzewicz et al 2014 illustrate not surprisingly a lot of research is dedicated to urban areas in terms of modeling swfs e g maksivomić et al 2009 chen et al 2012 sampson et al 2013 de almeida et al 2016 flood loss estimation e g merz et al 2010 jongman et al 2012 van ootegem et al 2015 as well as flood risk assessment and management e g kaźmierczak and cavan 2011 blanc et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 löwe et al 2017 in contrast relatively little research has been dedicated to rural areas in spite the fact that such areas are highly exposed to flooding as examples from the european alps point out fuchs et al 2015 2017 röthlisberger et al 2017 at the same time these areas are not only affected by fluvial floods but similarly by swfs bernet et al 2017 moreover overland flow generated on rural or peri urban areas may be transferred into urbanized areas and thereby contribute to the adverse effects of swfs within the urban environment as well andrieu et al 2004 yu and coulthard 2015 thus scientific studies regarding the link between swfs and assets at risk in rural areas are generally lacking in contrast the topic of how to prepare for and manage swfs has been discussed outside of academia bernet et al 2017 this has led to a wide range of manuals and guidelines regarding swf hazard assessment risk management and awareness raising at the point scale e g egli 2007 rüttimann and egli 2010 as well as on communal and regional scales e g castro et al 2008 dwa 2013 lubw 2016 cepri 2014 therein the focus lies generally on the built environment and thus the rural areas are considered as well in practice the tools used for swf hazard assessments consist mainly of single deterministic simulations with two dimensional 2d flood inundation models cf meon et al 2009 tyrna and hochschild 2010 kipfer et al 2015 tyrna et al 2017 this circumstance has certainly been influenced by the heavily increasing availability of high resolution digital elevation models dems driven by advancing data collection techniques wechsler 2007 fewtrell et al 2008 sampson et al 2012 chen et al 2012 neal et al 2012 dottori et al 2013 de almeida et al 2016 savage et al 2016a at the same time the applicability of hydrodynamic flood inundation models to finer resolutions has been supported by increasing computational power fewtrell et al 2008 hunter et al 2008 dottori et al 2013 savage et al 2016b however the exploitation of high resolution dems is still limited by computational constraints chen et al 2012 sampson et al 2012 de almeida et al 2016 savage et al 2016a b tyrna et al 2017 thus rather simple flood inundation models are applied in practice for swf hazard assessments as they usually encompass large areas in general a compromise is inevitable when applying a model balancing spatial resolution model complexity and computational efficiency horritt and bates 2001 cook and merwade 2009 fewtrell et al 2008 2011 sampson et al 2012 neal et al 2012 dottori et al 2013 savage et al 2016a b at the same time it is not obvious how the specific choice influences the models performance moreover recent studies have pointed out that the uncertainty associated with flood inundation models fed with high resolution dems are more complex than previously thought abily et al 2016 savage et al 2016b meanwhile the models extreme precisions may provoke overconfidence in their results which could ultimately lead to wrong decisions in flood risk management dottori et al 2013 savage et al 2016a wrong decisions can usually be prevented by rigorously evaluating the applied models e g jakeman et al 2006 bennett et al 2013 however appropriate data are crucial for this task yet there is an eminent lack of observational data blanc et al 2012 neal et al 2012 spekkers et al 2014 yu and coulthard 2015 gaitan et al 2016 rözer et al 2016 which impairs the applicability of such deterministic modeling approaches even more so for swfs in rural areas where the lack of observational data is particularly pronounced yu and coulthard 2015 in practice however the lack of observational data does not appear to prevent the use of single deterministic simulations for swf hazard assessments on the contrary examples of overland flow predictions in urban peri urban and rural areas indicate that it rather leads to the renouncement of model calibration and or validation cf meon et al 2009 tyrna and hochschild 2010 kipfer et al 2015 tyrna et al 2017 such approaches are employed to produce large scale swf hazard maps as the examples of kipfer et al 2015 and tyrna et al 2017 indicate in practice these maps are then being used to identify potentially affected assets such as buildings infrastructure agricultural fields etc thus the question arises whether the deterministic tools reportedly used today in hazard assessments e g for compiling swf maps are fit for their purpose of predicting areas exposed to swf under various conditions in particular it is unclear how well such a modeling approach performs if such tools are not conditioned and or evaluated due to a lack of observational data using this starting point the main goal of this study is to evaluate whether uncalibrated and unvalidated 2d models can reliably predict the extent of swfs in rural environments on which basis potentially exposed assets can be identified for instance based on this evaluation we are able to draw conclusions about the suitability of this modeling approach for assessing the extent of swfs as well as for modeling swfs in rural areas in general for that matter we directly explore the models predictive skills by comparing their outputs teng et al 2017 in the style of other studies benchmarking 2d models e g fewtrell et al 2011 neal et al 2012 néelz and pender 2013 we apply the models to artificial and real world test cases as a first exercise we apply the selected models to four artificial surfaces inspired by zhou and liu 2002 in this highly controlled and simplified environment the models can easily be compared and inherent model characteristics are revealed in a second exercise the models are applied to real world case studies to mimic the commonly used approach in practical swf hazard assessments we apply similar uncalibrated 2d models with varying complexity thereafter we quantitatively assess the models predictive skills regarding the flooded area using common binary pattern performance measures bennett et al 2013 as there are no data about flow depths flow velocities or flow dynamics available we only compare the simulated with the observed swf extents for that matter we have reconstructed inundated areas based on various observational data sources the seven study sites encompass various topographies slopes land use etc while each of the eight case studies is associated with either relatively heavy or weak rainfall respectively thus for the purpose of this study we relax the definition of swfs and include not only events triggered by heavy rainfall bot also events associated with weak rainfall all events have in common that overland flow was produced which led or could have led to damages to the built and unbuilt environment along the flow paths as per definition the inundations did not originate from overtopping watercourses but are directly triggered by effective rainfall cf bernet et al 2017 for a discussion of related terms 2 materials and methods 2 1 models in this study we test three raster based 2d hydrodynamic flood inundation models i e flo 2d floodarea and r sim water the models have been selected such that different levels of model complexity are covered following neal et al 2012 from the wealth of available 2d hydrodynamic models cf teng et al 2017 we chose floodarea and r sim water since they have reportedly been used in the field of flood hazard assessment covering large areas including rural environments cf kipfer et al 2015 tyrna et al 2017 flo 2d was selected as it is a hydro inundation model using a term from yu and coulthard 2015 describing models that consider hydrological processes and overland flow routing at the same time moreover it has the most complex flow routing scheme among the selected models finally the model selection was complemented by a flow accumulation algorithm i e the multiple flow direction mfd algorithm introduced by freeman 1991 such flow algorithms have manifold applications due to their striking simplicity cf lópez vicente et al 2014 alder et al 2015 an overview of the models features is provided by table 1 2 1 1 flo 2d flo 2d is a distributed physically based flood inundation model o brian 2009 among the selected models it is the most sophisticated one as it makes use of the full dynamic wave approximation o brian 2009 flo 2d has various modules which can be switched on or off if desired it incorporates an infiltration module with various available methods whereas the green ampt ga method based on green and ampt 1911 is the most sophisticated one 2 1 2 floodarea floodarea is a simplified hydrodynamic flood inundation model that is fully integrated into a geographic information system gis i e arcgis by esri with the main purpose of calculating areas affected by floods geomer 2016 the model cannot directly account for losses such as interception and infiltration thus these losses have to considered by reducing the corresponding rainfall input cf table 1 and sect 2 3 5 2 1 3 r sim water the hydrodynamic model r sim water simulates overland flow with a path sampling method which is implemented as a module in the open source gis software grass mitasova et al 2004 neteler et al 2012 similar to floodarea r sim water cannot directly account for losses such as interception and infiltration moreover unsteady rainfall cannot be modeled cf table 1 and sect 2 3 5 2 1 4 mfd mfd is a multiple flow direction algorithm that assesses the flow paths based solely on a digital elevation model dem quinn et al 1991 we use the algorithm implemented in the open source system for automated geoscientific analyses saga conrad et al 2015 among the selected models mfd is the simplest approach that does not route any water but instead assesses each cell s relative catchment area consequently the model does not predict any flow depths and velocities cf table 1 but assesses a static characteristic of the topography i e the distributed flow accumulation areas note that prior to applying mfd to real world case studies sinks and pits of the respective dem were filled as discussed by wechsler 2007 for that matter we used the algorithm by planchon and darboux 2002 with a value of 0 01 for the minimal slope 2 2 artificial surfaces to assess the performance of flow routing algorithms zhou and liu 2002 defined four different mathematical surfaces and compared the calculated specific catchment area with the theoretically true values the application of such algorithms on smooth artificial surfaces reveals distinct patterns and characteristics reflecting the algorithm s differing mathematical formulations cf zhou and liu 2002 seibert and mcglynn 2007 pilesjö and hasan 2014 we adapt this approach to flood inundation modeling even without a theoretically true value the adaptation of this approach to swf modeling reveals inherent model characteristics that might not be apparent otherwise therefore as a first exercise we apply the selected models to four artificial surfaces i e to a plane eq 1 a concave eq 2 a convex eq 3 and to a combined concave convex surface eq 4 we compiled corresponding raster dems of 250 by 250 cells and a resolution of 2 m the elevations of the plane are given by 1 z a x b y c where a 0 051 b 0 141 c 0 for a prescribed slope of s 15 and an aspect of a 160 0 x 250 0 y 250 the concave surface is defined as 2 x 2 a y 2 b z 2 c 1 z 0 where a 998 b 748 5 c 191 5 250 x 0 and 0 y 250 the convex surface is given by 3 x 2 a y 2 b z 2 c 1 z 0 where a 998 b 748 5 c 191 5 0 x 250 250 y 0 finally the combined concave convex surface is defined as 4 x 2 a y 2 b z c z 0 where a 998 b 748 5 c 191 5 250 x 0 and 250 y 0 the artificial surfaces are further manipulated two rows of the corresponding dems are incised by a minimum of 0 3 m in order to represents a 4 m wide street crossing the surfaces from west to east this incision enables to test and visualize the influence of structures in the landscape that can have major effects on overland flow paths the top views of the four artificial surfaces are shown in fig 1 for the artificial surfaces a rain event lasting 1 h with an intensity of 50 mmh 1 was simulated infiltration and interception losses were not considered a manning s roughness coefficient of n 0 24 sm 1 3 was chosen for all artificial surfaces which corresponds to the value recommended for dense grass by mccuen 2016 a value of n 0 012 sm 1 3 is chosen for the incised streets which corresponds to the recommended value for asphalt mccuen 2016 2 3 real world case studies we elaborated eight real world case studies at seven study sites i e at one study site two different events were observed the case studies characteristics are summarized in tables 2 and 3 while their respective location is shown in fig 2 in the following we introduce the delineation of the study perimeters the gathered input data the consideration of hydrological losses the reconstruction of overland flow paths as well as the assessment of the model performance in terms of hydrological losses we account for infiltration and interception losses but neglect evaporation as contributions of the latter are generally particularly low cf yu and coulthard 2015 furthermore we assume that the influence of the sewer system on the flood extent is negligible on the one hand the fractions of built up area are tiny in comparison to the rural areas for all case studies on the other hand the field observations indicated that the sewer systems were often either blocked e g by eroded material branches leaves hail etc or surcharged thus in this study the interactions between overland flow and the sewer systems are neglected as assumed similarly by e g fewtrell et al 2011 or kipfer et al 2012 2 3 1 domains in order to delineate the study perimeter for each case study the area is considered within which documented observations regarding overland flow paths are available the corresponding study perimeters were obtained by delineating the smallest respective watershed that still encompassed the reconstructed flow paths thereafter these perimeters were buffered by at least 50 m to obtain a simulation domain that extends over the watershed s boundary this ensures that the simulations boundary effects within the study perimeters remain negligible thus three different domains are differentiated for each case study observation domain d obs within which all documented overland flow paths were reconstructed watershed domain d wsd representing the smallest watershed that contains the observation perimeter the model results were cropped to this area simulation domain d sim representing the buffered watershed domain within which the simulations were carried out 2 3 2 primary input data the main input for all four models is a dem fig 3 we used the dem swissalti3d as of 2013 with a regular grid size of 2 by 2 m provided by the swiss federal office of topography swisstopo 2017a although there are dems available with finer resolutions for some of the study sites we used the aforementioned product as it is homogeneous and available for whole switzerland as r sim water and mfd do not offer a direct option to integrate flow barriers such as buildings cf table 1 the corresponding dem was modified all cells whose centroids were covered by a building were elevated by at least 10 m the land use was assessed between july 2014 and june 2016 as the land use was observed shortly after each event that falls into this period i e e3a e3b e4 e6 and e7 cf tables 2 and 3 the corresponding land use represent the conditions during these events in contrast the land use of the remaining case studies were assessed roughly three years after the date of occurrence or more although there is a slight time shift we assumed that the mapped land use is representative for the respective case study as major land use changes are not expected at these study sites within the respective period firstly the land use including buildings streets fields etc was digitized using orthophotos from the product swissimage swisstopo 2017b secondly the land use was adjusted and verified based on field observations the surface roughness values were obtained by linking the land use with literature tables i e with the comprehensive collection from mccuen 2016 as indicated in fig 3 the corresponding values are listed in table 4 the hourly rainfall rate was extracted from the product combiprecip provided by the federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss 2014 the product combines radar and rain gauge measurements by means of a co kriging with external drift e g sideris et al 2014 panziera et al 2016 it has a spatial resolution of 1 by 1 km a temporal resolution of 1 h and is available from 2005 onwards meteoswiss 2014 as the case study sites are small each study perimeter is covered by just a few cells to reduce the influence of single cells that might contain outliers the raster cells covering each perimeter were buffered by one cell thereafter the mean of these cells were calculated for each time step next the triggering rainfall events were extracted from the rainfall records by considering a minimum inter event time of t m i n 6 h and a minimum intensity threshold of i m i n 0 1 mmh 1 which are in line with common literature values e g dunkerley 2008 consequently at the beginning of each event the rain intensity had been 0 1 mmh 1 for at least six consecutive time steps of 1 h each analogous at the end of the event it did not rain for at least 6 h with an intensity 0 1 mmh 1 2 3 3 infiltration out of all four models only flo 2d allows the user to account for infiltration directly while it cannot be modeled explicitly by floodarea and r sim water whereas mfd is not dependent on rainfall altogether table 1 therefore the following approach was chosen the full potential of flo 2d was exploited by using the integrated ga infiltration module to feed the other two models with similar input as recommended by neal et al 2012 the ga method was implemented in r r core team 2016 therewith spatially and temporally variable cumulative infiltration rates were calculated based on these values effective rainfall rates were obtained that were used as model inputs for floodarea and r sim water sect 2 3 5 hereafter the implementation and parametrization of the ga method are briefly outlined based on green and ampt 1911 the cumulative infiltration f t mm at time t h can be expressed as 5 f t k t ψδθ f t ψδθ 1 whereas k is the hydraulic conductivity mmh 1 ψ the wetting front soil suction head mm δθ θ f θ i the difference between the final and initial soil moisture content thereby an important assumption is that the water is ponded at the surface from the beginning of the steady rainfall as this is generally not the case mein and larson 1973 extended the ga infiltration method to account for the time until water starts to pond t t p at which time the cumulative infiltration depth equals the cumulative rainfall accordingly the cumulative infiltration for steady rainfall after ponding time i e t t p is given by 6 f t k t t p f p ψδθ f t ψδθ 1 whereas t p denotes the ponding time h and f p f t the cumulative infiltration mm at ponding time t t p we then implemented the ga method following chu 1978 who expanded the method for unsteady rainfall events the interested reader may refer to chu 1978 who provides a detailed derivation and applied examples of the method the required ga infiltration parameters were obtained as follows we estimated each study site s dominant soil texture based on expert knowledge except for the case studies e4 and e6 for which soil maps including soil texture classes were available we estimated the hydraulic conductivity k the wetting front soil suction head ψ and the effective porosity n e using published regression parameter values from the comprehensive study by rawls et al 1983 furthermore it is assumed that the soils were saturated to a degree of s i 30 50 or 80 before each event under dry normal or wet conditions respectively each respective condition was set according to the observed antecedent rainfall cf tables 2 and 3 the change in soil moisture content was then estimated by δθ n e s f s i while assuming that the soil s saturation after the event was s f 100 2 3 4 interception canopy storage capacity depends on various factors and roughly amounts 1 mm e g ward and robinson 2000 thus the depletion of this storage is tiny in comparison to the total rainfall volumes of the corresponding case studies cf tables 2 and 3 moreover as the values of different land cover types are within the same order of magnitude we simply considered a bulk interception loss of 1 mm in flo 2d this loss volume could be entered as a model parameter for floodarea and r sim water we deducted the interception losses s mm from the total rainfall p t t mm to obtain a net rainfall p n t mm that reached the ground as follows 7 p n t 0 p t t s p t t s p t t s 2 3 5 effective rainfall infiltration cannot be modeled directly by floodarea and r sim water cf sect 2 3 3 thus to account for infiltration and interception losses we computed effective rainfall rates which were then used as model inputs the effective rainfall is given by 8 p e t p n t 1 m f t whereas p e is the cumulative effective rainfall mm p n is the net rainfall that considers an initial interception loss mm cf eq 7 m is the imperviousness factor cf table 4 and f t is the cumulative infiltration mm sect 2 3 3 note that an imperviousness factor can be set directly in flo 2d s ga infiltration module for each individual cell o brian 2009 however for floodarea and r sim water the imperviousness factors as specified in table 4 were considered during the assessment of cell and time specific effective rainfall rates in floodarea spatial variable rainfall can be modeled by providing weighting factors geomer 2016 which can be thought of as runoff coefficients relating the hyetograph to cell specific effective rainfall obviously these coefficients are changing over time and space they are defined as c i j t p e i j t p t t the spatially variable rainfall can then be modeled by creating a raster with cell values c i j t for each time step t the simulations can then be stopped after each time step and restarted with the runoff coefficients of the next time step this procedure was automated with batch scripts for r sim water this procedure is not straightforward as the simulations cannot be restarted based on results from a previous time step therefore we chose the time step with the highest effective rainfall rate and ran the model with only this single spatially variable rainfall field 2 3 6 reconstruction of overland flow paths data sources that possibly indicate past swfs include insurance claim records disaster databases reports and recollections from affected people bernet et al 2017 and references therein however for recent events it is usually possible to reconstruct flow paths of swfs based on their traces in the field as exemplified by fig 4 particularly in rural environments overland flow usually leaves notable traces such as erosion marks deposited sediments and flattened vegetation for the purpose of this study we have reconstructed discernible swf traces based on field observations following the events of the case studies e3a e3b e4 e6 and e7 whereas for the remaining case studies i e e1 and e2 the inundated areas were reconstructed based on external sources table 5 summarizes the source for the flow path reconstructions along with associated limitations as well as a qualitative confidence level of the data quality irrespective of the data source the flow paths were reconstructed and spatially localized using standard gis software the field assessment were then digitally stored all overland flow traces and paths were considered as being wet to assess the performance of the models these areas were compared to the model outputs as outlined in the following section 2 3 7 model performance across various disciplines map comparisons are a standard procedure to assess and compare model performances e g kuhnert et al 2005 foody 2007 bennett et al 2013 however there is not a single best method for this task on the contrary many tools including both quantitative as well as qualitative methods are recognized as being appropriate for this purpose kuhnert et al 2005 bennett et al 2013 thus the model performance assessment have to be adapted to the models objectives as well as to the characteristics of the available data since the task is inherently case specific bennett et al 2013 along these lines we compared the model outcomes and observations visually as well as quantitatively in terms of the latter we used common binary pattern performance measures based on the contingency table table 6 which are widely being used for the comparison of simulated and observed flood extents e g aronica et al 2002 schumann et al 2009 stephens et al 2014 zischg et al 2018 however more recently stephens et al 2014 pointed out that these performance measures are all subjected to a varying degree of bias which should be considered in subsequent conclusions as we are using different measures conjunctively in this study and are more interested in the broader picture the influence of this circumstance on our conclusions is negligible the binary pattern performance measures are based on the assessment whether a cell was observed and or simulated as wet or dry all cells covered by an observed flow paths are considered as wet for the simulation results this information was inferred from the simulated maximum flow depths h f m by applying an arbitrary threshold h t m thus cells with a maximum flow depth below the threshold h f h t are considered to be dry while all other cells h f h t are considered to be wet we tested different threshold values and compared the performance of all models applied to all case studies using the observations as the reference based on these results we empirically chose a value of h t 0 02 m as this threshold value maximized the performance of all models note that this threshold value is case specific and thus might be different for other models observational data resolutions etc in the following we compare the models results with observations in addition to a comparison of the models among each other the comparisons of the models with observations are constrained to the observation perimeter d obs while the model comparison among each other is carried out within the whole watershed d wsd cf sect 2 3 1 for the quantitative model comparison we used the following binary pattern performance measures e g aronica et al 2002 pappenberger et al 2007 bennett et al 2013 which are based on the contingency table table 6 9 bias m 1 a b a c m 1 0 ideally m 1 1 10 critical

referred to as threat score or f 2 statistic in the literature e g bennett et al 2013 stephens et al 2014 3 results 3 1 artificial surfaces despite the lack of a baseline applying the models to the selected artificial surfaces reveals interesting characteristics fig 5 first and foremost the incised street represents a prominent topographical structure that has a significant influence on the flow pattern the street acts like a channel which can collect incoming water and can be overtopped if the channel is full or if the incoming water is not sufficiently deflected whether the street is overtopped or not is discernible by the amount of dry cells directly to the south of the incised street i e cells with a flow depth or flow accumulation below the flow threshold dark red cells in fig 5 for each artificial surface the pattern of these dry cells varies significantly among the models in contrast the pattern of dry cells north of the street is more similar among the models for all but the convex surface as discussed later thus the street has a major influence on the distribution of dry and wet cells respectively in more detail r sim water does not predict a deflection of the water crossing the street on any surface quite the opposite is true for the flow accumulation calculated by mfd for all but the combined concave convex surface the street poses a complete or nearly complete flow barrier flo 2d and floodarea on the other hand show a more differentiated picture as water is overtopping where ever the flow depths are exceeding the street s incision this is most apparent on the concave surface where floodarea predicts a significant overtopping of the street s eastern end unlike the other models thus in this modeling exercise the user s choice of a model does not only heavily influence the pattern of dry and wet cells south of the street but also the corresponding flow paths the results of the hydrodynamic models do not only deviate substantially south of the street but also on the street itself for each artificial surface flo 2d consistently predicts the highest flow depths on the street floodarea s results exhibit flow depths that lie mostly between the minimal values estimated by r sim water and the high values predicted by flo 2d however as mentioned before a striking difference of floodarea compared to flo 2d is the overtopping of the street s incision at the eastern side of the concave surface compared to the other hydrodynamic models r sim water predicts by far the lowest flow depths on the street for all surfaces in fact the flow depths on the street predicted by r sim water are below the wet dry threshold of 0 02 m for all surfaces thus the flow patterns south of the street are heavily influenced of how the models predict the flow over this topographical structure however the flow patterns are also dependent on how the models simulate flow over the four different topographical forms specifically the flow patterns on the convex surface of each single model is strikingly different from the other ones which is reflected by the particularly low csi values indicated in fig 5 also the flow patterns in the northern half of the combined concave convex surface seem to deviate slightly more among the models than the produced patterns on the plane and the concave surface respectively this could be explained by the fact that the northern half of the concave convex surface is characterized by convex forms that produce particularly different results among the models lastly the flow pattern produced by floodarea on the concave surface is characterized by striking flow paths floodarea produces also sharp edged flow paths on the convex and the concave convex surface however not as pronounced as on the concave surface these flow patterns stem from the limitation of flow directions to 16 fixed angles by floodarea s flow routing scheme which is described in e g tyrna et al 2017 3 2 real world case studies the performance of the models applied to each case study is depicted in fig 6 the obtained csi eq 10 values are rather low and indicate that overall all models have a low performance for all case studies the respective maximal csi of each model lies between 0 318 and 0 344 which stem from the case study e2 for the same case study the models produce the highest hit rates eq 11 ranging between 0 566 and 0 788 save a few exceptions the hit rates are well below a value of 0 5 in all other case studies the bias is the fraction of simulated number of wet cells compared to the observed number of wet cells eq 9 thus a bias greater than one indicates an overestimation of the wet cells by the model whereas a bias below one shows the opposite as presented in fig 6 all models overestimate the number of reconstructed wet cells for some case studies but heavily underestimate them for others as depicted in fig 6 the bias is correlated with the false alarm rates eq 12 for each case study models with a lower bias are also associated with a lower false alarm rate and vice versa the lowest absolute values are produced for the simulations with strong underestimations bias 1 0 this can be expected since a particularly low bias value means that the number of modeled wet cells is much smaller than the observed number of wet cells in this case even if all modeled wet cells were misses the false alarm rate would still be small since the number of correct negatives is constantly high for all models hence following eq 12 a low false alarm rate results overall we have identified three main issues limiting the models performances i e observational data of differing quality insufficiently represented topographical structures and biased predictions of effective rainfall in the following we illustrate each of these issues with examples from the corresponding case studies the particularly low performance of all models applied to case study e1 can mainly be attributed to poor observational data namely the derivation of observed wet cells are based on an external map jordi kolb ag 2008 therein areas with ponded water as well as water on the streets are mapped while overland flow paths in the agricultural fields are not indicated table 5 thus the observations only capture areas that are small compared to the whole area that must have been inundated as depicted by fig 7 as a consequence the wet cells are overestimated the false alarm rates are high and the csi values are low for all models moreover the map by jordi kolb ag 2008 does not provide any ancillary information such as the applied mapping methods therefore the map turns out to be an unsuitable source of information for the purpose of validating the models applying the models to artificial surfaces has highlighted that topographical structures such as streets can have major effects on the produced flow paths sect 3 1 how the models are predicting flow on streets in real world case studies and how this influences the prediction of subsequent flow paths can best be shown with results from the case study e2 all models perform best in this case study as indicated by fig 6 the csi values are similarly high for all models whereas the other scores vary slightly more for instance flo 2d produces the highest hit rate however at the expense of the highest false alarm rate and the highest overestimation in contrast r sim water exhibits the smallest bias and false alarm rate however at the expense of a smaller hit rate depending on the situation one or the other configuration might be more desirable the visual comparison confirms that all four models produce plausible results as an example for the simulation results the maximal flow depth predicted by flo 2d are depicted in fig 8 based on the similar performance of all four models the case study e2 is best suited for comparing the simulated flow paths in more detail namely in most of the other case studies the models are associated with a greater range of bias values i e the number of wet cells varies more among the models which impairs the attribution of model differences fig 9 illustrates the model comparison of the observed and simulated wet cells as categorized according to the contingency table table 6 according to all models water mainly accumulates in the thalweg i e the path of lowest elevations along the hillslope cf figs 8 and 9 thereby the observed wet cells are captured well by all models except mfd which is not able the predict the ponding water towards the outlet of the observation domain the main differences between the other models are that flo 2d is overestimating the wet cells along the thalweg more than floodarea which in turn overestimates the wet cells to a larger degree than r sim water this is reflected by the respective bias values indicated in fig 9 overall the models have difficulties predicting the water flowing on the streets foremost the streets in the upper part of the domain were inundated but were not simulated as such which is reflected by the numerous misses in this area red cells fig 9 compared to the other models flo 2d predicts the observed wet street cells better this behavior could be expected based on the results from the models applied to artificial surfaces since flo 2d predicted consistently larger flow depths on the street than the other models sect 3 1 along the same lines r sim water predicts the lowest number of wet street cells which is also supported by the findings of the artificial modeling exercise interestingly all models predict roughly the same places where water overtops the street s confinement and joins the main flow path in the thalweg only one of these paths in the central part of the domain is predicted by floodarea and flo 2d while the path is not indicated by r sim water and mfd east thereof a flow path could be observed that is not simulated by any model overall this exemplifies that although the behavior may differ slightly between the models on a cell by cell basis they all produce quite similar flow paths on a broader scale or similarly fail to identify them as outlined introductorily accurate predictions of effective rainfall are crucial for increased model performances in addition to high quality observational data and well represented topographical structures if a model predicts too little runoff it usually leads to an underestimation of wet cells and consequently to a rather low performance this issue is nicely exemplified by the case studies e3a and e3b observed at the same study site cf table 1 as shown in fig 6 the number of wet cells are underestimated by all models in the first event e3a in particular floodarea and r sim water predict a much lower number of wet cells than the number of wet cells inferred from the observations consequently the performance of these two models is particularly low for this case study the performances are more balanced for the second observed event e3b however similarly to the case study e2 flo 2d produces the highest hit rate but also the highest false alarm rate owed to the overestimated number of wet cells although both case studies were triggered by thunderstorms the rainfall intensities of e3a are moderate and the event spans 13 h while e3b is associated with short and intense rainfall that is typical for thunderstorms cf table 2 thus we can observe that the hydrodynamic models i e all except mfd generally underestimate the number of wet cells for the case studies with low rainfall intensities namely the said models exhibit an underestimation of the observed wet cells for the case studies e3a e5 e6 and e7 as depicted in fig 6 this hints at the fact that the simulation of wet cells is less sensitive for case studies driven by intensive rainfall in contrast the mechanisms that lead to overland flow during the case studies with low rainfall intensities are much more complex and badly captured by the chosen modeling approach of this study the model mfd is inherently different from the other three hydrodynamic models it is not an event based model but assesses a static property of a catchment based solely on the dem i e the relative catchment area sect 2 1 4 applied to the considered case studies mfd performs similarly or even better than the other models this is most pronounced in the case study e6 further illustrated in fig 10 as highlighted by fig 10 the number of wet cells predicted by floodarea is particularly low for the case study e6 within the observation domain which is reflected by the performance measures low values fig 10b although the flow paths in the middle of the observation domain are vaguely indicated it is apparent that too little effective rainfall is predicted which leads to the exhibited underestimation of wet cells in contrast the flow paths predicted by mfd are a function of the respective catchment area of each cell irrespective of the rainfall thereby the two flow paths in the middle of the observation domain are covered notably the flow path at the western border of the observation domain is shifted slightly westwards in comparison to the observations this behavior can be attributed to the specific land management of the corresponding patato field i e furrows parallel to the slope which promotes flow at western border of this field the observed flow path at the eastern border of the observation domain is not captured by any model moreover it should be noted that the flow over the bare potato field led to erosion as depicted in fig 4a which in turn may have a significant influence on the flow patterns however such effects cannot be captured with this study s modeling approach since in most case studies the observations only cover a rather small part of the whole simulated catchment cf d obs and d wsd in tables 2 and 3 and the observations are associated with a varying degree of confidence cf table 5 we additionally compare the model results within the whole simulation domain with each other independent of the observation data by using the more sophisticated models as the reference we can assess the capability of the simpler models to reproduce results of the more complex models as fig 11 indicates floodarea as well as mfd reproduce the results stemming from flo 2d rather well at the same time the false alarm rates are particularly low however we also recognize that floodarea generally underestimates the wet cells in comparison to flo 2d r sim water slightly underestimates the wet cells in comparison to floodarea however the underestimation is limited to a small range indicating that the underestimation is similar in all case studies in addition to the comparison of the models among themselves the first row and column of fig 11 also depicts the model performance in relation to the observations namely it also displays the results shown in fig 6 in a different way whereby the overall performance is better visualized thus it depicts that the csi of every model is rather low as discussed before moreover it visualizes that the csi of the model mfd and flo 2d is very similar as well as the one of floodarea and r sim water but at a lower level moreover it visualizes the stronger tendency of floodarea and r sim water to underestimate the wet cells compared to flo 2d in comparison mfd is by far the least biased of all the models 4 discussions in this study we have followed the procedure employed in practice by current hazard assessments to produce swf hazard maps which are based on uncalibrated single deterministic simulations cf meon et al 2009 tyrna and hochschild 2010 kipfer et al 2015 tyrna et al 2017 the results from the models applied to artificial surfaces and eight real world case studies suggest that the models performance might be increased if the model were properly calibrated for instance the model exercise on artificial surfaces cf sect 3 1 exemplified the need to calibrate the surface roughness namely flo 2d predicts rather high flow depths on the incised street while r sim water predicts flow depth that are even below the chosen flow threshold of 0 02 m simulations with altered roughness values indicated that r sim water is rather sensitive to the street s chosen roughness value similarly the flow depths on the street predicted by floodarea are generally below those predicted by flo 2d a calibration of the roughness value could also improve the match between flo 2d and floodarea this circumstance is also exhibited by applying the models in real world case studies whereby floodarea and r sim water predict lower flow depths on streets cf fig 9 and sect 3 2 the results from applying the models to a broad range of different settings indicate that the models performance would still vary significantly even if the models were calibrated namely all models perform similarly well in the case study e2 cf fig 6 whereas properly calibrated models might perform even better yet it is clear that a calibration could not bring the models performances to a similar level in all case studies on the one hand this indicates that calibration and or validation based on one single case study might be misleading thus using various case studies covering a wide range of settings provides a more holistic picture of the models performance on the other hand it also indicates that the models are not capable of capturing all relevant processes under diverse circumstances in fact the results show that the hydrodynamic models tend to significantly underestimate the number of wet cells for the case studies associated with weak rainfall cf figs 6 and 10 thus the models do not predict sufficient runoff as compared to the observations driven by an underestimation of the effective rainfall more specifically the results indicate that the considered infiltration assessment methods cf sect 2 3 5 are not capturing the governing processes well namely saturation excess overland flow cannot be modeled by the applied methods although this runoff generation mechanism is likely crucial for swfs triggered by weak rainfall although swfs are usually associated by heavy rainfall as mentioned before results from bernet et al 2017 indicate that long lasting events with weak rainfall cause similar damage to buildings as short events with heavy rainfall thus a model should be able to capture events characterized by heavy as well as weak rainfall to be suitable to reliably simulate swfs in rural areas along these lines the two events observed at the same study site i e case study e3a and e3b exemplify that swfs can be triggered by heavier and weaker rainfall at the same location cf table 2 moreover the case studies exemplify that the flow paths are not a static function of the topography but are dependent on soil characteristics land use land management in addition to the rainfall input of course along these lines ferreira et al 2015 highlighted for instance that runoff generation mechanism are spatially and temporally highly variable certainly there are established and emerging methods that could represent the runoff generation processes better e g schmocker fackel et al 2007 antonetti et al 2016 steinbrich et al 2016 however the consideration of such spatially highly variable processes are often impaired by the lack of appropriate data thus for a better representation of the runoff generation processes corresponding data are required for the presented case studies such data were unavailable as well as time consuming and costly to collect the representation of topographical structures by the dem is another aspect which significantly influences the models predictions e g sampson et al 2012 de almeida et al 2016 as indicated by the model exercise on artificial surfaces the models react sensitively on structures such as streets sect 3 1 moreover applying the models to real world case studies have pinpointed that the influence of such structures on the simulation results are governed more by the representation of such structures by the respective dem than the choice of the model by the user this is in line with findings stemming from more formal model comparisons for instance from the benchmark study of urban flood models by fewtrell et al 2011 this issue is illustrated by fig 9 which indicates that the models predict the streets overtopping at the same locations while numerous of these flow paths could not be observed in reality thus this behavior suggests that the streets confinements are not represented accurately enough by the dem supported by the fact that the rural environment of the case study e2 is characterized by single lane streets with width in the same order as the dem s resolution in consequence the channelizing effect of overland flow on streets is rather poorly captured by the models confronted with the same issue kipfer et al 2012 proposed to incise all streets by a fixed depth however this measure most likely incapacitate the model to correctly reproduce the street s overtopping thus a more common solution is to use a dem with a finer resolution if available wechsler 2007 dottori et al 2013 generally small scale structures such as narrow streets are certainly better represented by a dem with finer resolutions wechsler 2007 fewtrell et al 2011 de almeida et al 2016 nevertheless as has been pointed out before finer resolutions might also lead to inadequate confidence in the extremely precise model outputs dottori et al 2013 along these lines it is crucial to note that the dem itself is an imperfect representation of the reality irrespective of its resolution wechsler 2007 abily et al 2016 just as dems with coarser resolutions topographical models with finer resolutions are not flawless either and contain artifacts which may cause false results as illustrated in fig 7 therefore the dem needs to receive particular attention i e it needs to be carefully pre and post processed in order to represent realistic flow paths as other studies have highlighted as well hankin et al 2008 hunter et al 2008 tyrna et al 2017 the models may produce distinctly different results under certain circumstances as highlighted by the models applied to the convex artificial surface characterized by diverging flow patterns fig 5 however in real world applications such forms are likely less important in comparison to plane and concave slopes as exemplified by the case study e2 characterized by concave topography cf fig 8 on such slopes the models exhibit better model agreement fig 5 thus in real world applications the model choice seems to play an inferior role compared to the previously discussed issues including the appropriate representation of effective rainfall and topographical structures in other words the model choice is generally not the most important factor determining whether the observed inundation area can be predicted well by the corresponding model at least for events associated with heavy rainfall however it should be noted that this statement might be different for the prediction of flow depths and or flow velocities as mentioned before the hydrodynamic models i e flo 2d floodarea and r sim water generally predict the number of wet cells less reliably for case studies associated with weak rainfall an exception is the flow algorithm mfd which produces the least biased results for all case studies fig 11 at the downside the algorithm cannot consider ponding or backwater as exemplified by the model s distinct underestimation of the inundated area towards the outlet of the study site e2 fig 9 mfd thus mfd can be used for approximating the extent of inundated areas but not for predicting flow depths flow velocities and flow dynamics in general lastly the model performance is also highly dependent on the used data therefore it is crucial to account for the uncertainties introduced by the input data for instance by carrying out a sensitivity analysis e g pianosi et al 2016 at the same time the uncertainties need to be considered which stem from the observational data that are used to condition and or evaluate the models for instance if the observational data are a bad representation of the models simulated quantity the performance of the models are inevitably low as exemplified by the case study e1 fig 7 and sect 3 2 yet as mentioned before there is little high quality observational data available which exhibit appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions suitable for model calibration and or validation e g hunter et al 2008 blanc et al 2012 neal et al 2012 yu and coulthard 2015 consequently in this study it was necessary to exploit different data sources including external maps eye witnesses photographs and videos mapped flood traces based on field visits partly supported by aerial photographs cf table 5 and fig 4 yet the mapped quantity is not the same for each source while the exploited photographs and videos represent a snapshot of the flow pattern at a certain instant during the respective swf reconstructions based on flood marks are constrained to areas where the flood has left discernible traces for instance overland flow with few suspended particles might not leave identifiable traces in consequence this likely leads to an underestimation of the actual inundated area accordingly we assigned this data source with a lower medium confidence level as indicated in table 5 despite the increased confidence level for overland flow reconstructed from photographs and videos a similar bias might apply to this data source as well namely a bias is introduced if the picture is not taken at the instant of the maximal flood extent therefore just as the simulation outputs the observational data should be regarded as uncertain bennett et al 2013 stephens et al 2014 savage et al 2016a thus the representation of the observations and simulations as a crisp representation of the reality might be inappropriate to address this issue pappenberger et al 2007 applied a fuzzy set approach to measure the performance based on uncertain observational data thereby slight shifts between observed and simulated wet cells could be accounted for for simulated wet cells it is straightforward to obtain a confidence level that a particular cell is wet by considering the simulated flow depths pappenberger et al 2007 in contrast this is not trivial for the observational data used in this study namely ancillary data would be necessary for instance flood traces mapped in the field could be categorized according to the respective confidence that the corresponding area was in fact inundated in case only the flood extent is of interest for instance when identifying potentially flooded assets choosing a simple over a hydrodynamic model might be advantageous as exemplified by the real world case studies the extent of swfs can be predicted similarly well with mfd as with the considered hydrodynamic models while the associated computational demand is much smaller consequently mfd could be applied to larger areas while exploiting the increasing availability of high resolution dems moreover there are other simple conceptual models as termed by teng et al 2017 which may overcome some of the limitations of mfd such as the incapability to simulate ponding water potential candidates include for instance the rapid flood spreading method rfsm as described by l homme et al 2008 or the model called hand height above the nearest drainage as introduced by nobre et al 2011 such approaches could be applied to almost any scale and area teng et al 2017 which could make them interesting candidates for regional or even continental hazard assessments regarding swfs moreover such models are predestined to be used in probabilistic modeling approaches e g merwade et al 2008 aronica et al 2012 savage et al 2016a thus the applicability of a probabilistic modeling approach in relation to swfs in rural areas should be investigated in the future as well 5 conclusions and outlook the main aim of this study was to test a swf hazard assessment approach that is currently employed in practice and is based on single simulations with uncalibrated and or unvalidated flood inundation models for that matter we applied four uncalibrated raster based models to four characteristic artificial surfaces and eight real world case studies the models application to the artificial surfaces exemplified that the flow patterns are heavily disturbed by streets insofar as the prediction of inundated areas downslope of such structures are significantly influenced thus there are large differences of how each model predicts these flow disturbances moreover the modeling exercise has indicated that the models disagree most about the prediction of flow on the convex surface the performance of the models applied to real world case studies was assessed qualitatively as well as quantitatively in relation to inundated areas inferred from different sources in summary the performance of the selected grid based models indicates that they are not yet suited to be employed in an uncalibrated mode to reliably and deterministically predict inundated areas caused by swfs in rural areas mainly the models performances are impaired by biased predictions of effective rainfall and insufficient representation of topographical structures to improve the prediction of swf hazards various approaches seem prospective first of all the deterministic modeling approach could be improved by incorporating a better prediction of the complex runoff generation mechanisms under various conditions moreover the representation of topographical structures could be improved by considering dems with finer resolutions alternatively irregular meshes and corresponding models could be used for a better representation of structures such as streets at the same time this study indicates that the models calibration and or their results validation is imperative for this task the uncertainties of the observations should be considered which may vary significantly depending on the source and quality of the observations in general the quantification and communication of the models associated uncertainties are crucial as the models extremely precise outputs have indeed the potential to provoke overconfidence in their results which may lead to inappropriate decisions in flood risk management dottori et al 2013 a different way forward would be to exploit simple conceptual models such as mfd within the context of this study mfd performed similarly well than the hydrodynamic models thus similar conceptual models could be tested which overcome some of the limitations of mfd while providing similar results the computational effort of such simple models is by far the least such approaches are therefore also interesting for the application to large areas for instance in the context of regional national or even continental swf hazard assessments yet due to lower computational constraints even the topographical data with the finest available resolutions might be exploited moreover such models could be applied in a probabilistic simulation framework which could potentially better handle the lack of observational data in comparison to the current deterministic approaches finally this study highlighted once more that observational data are crucial irrespective of the chosen way forward thus a standardized method to document and report swfs in rural and urban areas is required and should be developed at the same time systematic observations should be put in place to lie the ground for future research which is certainly necessary
