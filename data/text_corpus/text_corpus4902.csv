24510,lobesia botrana is a quarantine pest from argentina and other countries in the world it causes damage to the vine in its different growth stages leading to losses in wine production to develop pest control strategies based on knowledge of the moth different mathematical models can be found in specific literature to predict its biological cycle establish its relationship with environmental variables describe the voltinism of the pest among others based on the proposed models it is possible to establish a minimum temperature threshold considering the development of the moth and the number of degrees days dd that must be accumulated for there to be a change of stage many of these models are empirical they are limited because they do not consider some variables such as growth and mortality rates also they lack a conceptual basis this makes that professionals or institutions interested in the development of decision support systems dss may not use them this also prevents them from being easily extrapolated to other regions of the world in this work a semi physical model based on first principles fpbsm is proposed to describe how the different growth stages of the vine moth change quantitatively throughout its normal development time under controlled and specific laboratory conditions for the cuyo region in argentina the proposed model based on a white box structure

importance for the area in argentina the moth causes damage to the vine in its different phenological states torres vila 1995 this is clearly seen in the destruction of berries and blooms decreasing the quantity and quality of the harvest and causing berry rot moreover this plague also indirectly damages the grapes several fungi associated with l botrana produces rot that causes a bad smell and taste to the wine burgardt et al 2011 da silvaa et al 2013 for this region of argentina cuyo region the quality service senasa specifically declared a phytosanitary alert which urges the mandatory

grape moth different mathematical models based on biological and climatic information have been proposed in the literature it has been proved that the insect s speed of development is mostly influenced by the following environmental variables temperature relative humidity and photoperiod torres vila 1995 in this sense temperature is the most significant meteorological variable since it not only affects its development rate in the initial stages but also the longevity of adults in addition to this it regulates oocyte development and egg production in the female reaching a maximum at around 22 c torres vila et al 1996 marco 2001 the first model to predict this biological cycle for a cluster moth in the french region of midi pyrenees was proposed by touzeau 1981 this model was based on the concept of degree days dd and the thermal integral the former permits to establish a minimum moth development threshold of 10 c whereas the thermal integral is defined as the number of dd that should be accumulated for the occurrence of a given event such as hatching moltings pupation or adult emergency marco 2001 touzeau s model was widely used with two main limitations i its dependence on the local environmental conditions and ii the absence of some important characteristics of the moth development process such as growth rates mortality associated with each stage and other environmental variables marco 2001 many researchers considered this model and adapted it for specific conditions among them gutierrez et al 2012 presented a pbdm model for the geographic distribution and relative abundance of the moth in california in this work it was also reported a vine model for the evaluation of its interaction with the moth for different moth s growth stages another interesting contribution was presented by dagatti and becerra 2015 with a model adjusted to predict the moth behavior in a vineyard in the argentinean region of mendoza for the seasons 2012 to 2014 also for this same region the authors of burgardt et al 2011 introduce an identification model to characterize the voltinism and local dispersal in a farm obtained data was then compared with the original touzeau s model for europe for different events hatching moltings pupation or adult emergency during the moth biological cycle establishing the differences between the degree days necessary for the stage changes and the degree days predicted by the touzeau s model the differences found are closely related to the particular environmental conditions of each region there is also a report for a touzeau simplified model performed by armendáriz et al 2007 for the important vineyard region of castilla y leon in spain this paper quantified the maximum population of three generations of the moth and compared the dates of appearance with those indicated by the touzeau s model a surplus of dd was reported resulting in a significant time lag between real and predicted data in 2007 armendáriz et al 2007 employed a simplification of touzeau s model comparing data on the incidence of european grape moth l botrana in vineyards of the denomination of origin do arribes de castilla y león spain in their work they quantified the maximum population of the three generations of the moth and compared the accumulated degree days for the flight peaks with different models reported in the literature in most cases there were significant differences in dd between those reported by the cited models and those that were found in the field all of them explained by the climate conditions of each region this highlights the need for mathematical models that are easily extrapolated to different regions of the world more recently the appearance of a significant number of studies related to the l botrana description and growth process control highlights the importance of this issue and emphasizes the need for further research in 2019 heit et al 2019 introduced a mathematical model to describe the voltinism number of generations of l botrana in mendoza argentina later this same year iltis et al 2020 proposed a feasible alternative to pbdm from an ecological point of view but based on constant and unrealistic thermal regimes the authors show a comparison for the adult performance of lb between the current fluctuating regime cfr and the future fluctuating regime ffr the authors concluded that their findings could contribute to improve the reliability of pbdm predictions about the population dynamics of l botrana then in the work of castex et al 2020 a novel phenological model is proposed to describe the voltinism of lb to predict their critical stages of development and then use this information to determine suitable containment actions another interesting approach was given by rossini et al 2020a with their computational tool based on a population dynamics model intended to allow interaction between the final user and the simulation interface this was done in a two stage process in the first one life tables were generated under laboratory conditions then this model was simulated and validated with field data the same authors contrasted the behavior of two different mathematical models for the lb life cycle description in rossini et al 2020b one based on the von foerster equation vfe and the other one based on the distributed delay model ddm this work discusses the differences related to the different age concepts chronological or physiological between these two well known models specifically it is remarked that despite the ddm models being more adequate to describe the life cycle of these insects they have an h parameter which lacks biological meaning this fact complicates the model adjustment and increases the need of experimental data to estimate it finally the authors combined the advantages of both models obtaining a new model that estimates the insect development for different constant temperature conditions in the research by lessio and alma 2021 it is shown a wide view of the l botrana modeling and other plagues that affect the vine development this review highlights the lack of a conceptual basis the black box models have as a consequence wine growers winemakers technical support professionals phytosanitary services and other affected parties related to the decision support system dss may not use them this work presents a semi physical model based on first principles fpbsm to quantitatively describe the different stages of l botrana on its normal development time for laboratory controlled conditions and the environmental conditions of the cuyo region in argentina the proposed mathematical model mainly differs from the reported ones in its conceptual simplicity the interpretation of its parameters and the associated simplicity by its calculus and adjustment the obtained model is composed of four ordinary differential equations odes and 34 functional and structural parameters thirty of these 34 have physic or biological meaning this work is organized as follows section 2 the proposed mathematical model is shown following a proposal found in the literature alvarez et al 2009 section 3 introduces the analysis of the results obtained by the comparison against experimental data finally section 4 is intended to draw conclusions about the model and the future work 2 fpbsm of the growth for l botrana in the cuyo region of argentina this section reports the development of an fpbsm of the growth process of l botrana under specific laboratory conditions for argentina s region of cuyo the chosen methodology is alvarez et al 2009 and as can be seen from fig 1 consists of ten steps this model is based on the knowledge of the l botrana biological cycle 2 1 lobesia botrana process description and model objective lobesia botrana is a complete metamorphosis insect meaning that its life cycle consists of four stages egg larva pupa and adult urretabizkaya et al 2010 as shown in fig 2 in its first stage the female lays her eggs in flowers fruits or rachis of the vine the embryo inside the egg takes its food from the medium in which it is found it goes through a five eggs instars development process until total development is achieved blackhead in this stage the 37 4 3 of the eggs laid by the female die herrera et al 2016 larvae emerge after three to seven days and after having reached approximately 66 dd they pierce the fruit of the vine and feed on it larvae can consume their weight several times and obtain their food from the environment in which they are housed the larval stage has five instars that are limited by the size of its cuticle which results in cuticle changes called molt temperature is the variable that mostly affects the biological cycle of l botrana the larval growth takes place in the temperatures ranging 10 c t 30 c c values outside this range are unfavorable also for the other stages the mortality of the larvae with a single molt is 26 34 4 6 but this value drops to 1 2 0 5 when the second molt is completed herrera et al 2016 after 1315 days and having reached approximately 170 dd the larval stage is completed and the pupa or chrysalis stage begins pupae remain immobile and do not feed on anything the state of diapause is maintained until the environmental conditions suitable humidity and temperature values that favor the moth growth are met mortality is 1 2 1 1 in this stage after 520 days and having reached approximately 204 dd the butterfly emerges herrera et al 2016 the adult may require 23 h to make his first flight and one day to reproduce and thus begin a new life cycle the adult feeds on the nectar of the flowers or the juice of the ripe fruits and lives for about 8 days this cycle is repeated three or more times per year depending on the climate conditions and the temperature values in dd which regulate the transitions between stages bearing the above mentioned in mind the mathematical model seeks to describe how the different stages of l botrana quantitatively change in the normal times of insect development under controlled laboratory conditions 2 2 modeling hypothesis and level of detail the model considers the macroscopic view of each larva stage as part of a whole and not the physiological processes that occur within the insect intending to provide an analogy between insect development and the microorganism growth process the model includes insect growth rates measured mortality rates interactions with environmental parameters and controlled culture medium conditions the following laboratory conditions are considered 1 temperature is controlled at 15 c 20 c and 25 c 2 humidity remains in the range between 30 and 50 3 the artificial diet is similar to natural nutrients 4 the photoperiod is fixed at 16 8 l d 5 mortality rates represent natural death predators were neglected 6 growth process is batch since it starts from a known number of eggs then no eggs larvae or pupae are extracted or aggregated during the growth process 2 3 process systems definition a process system ps is a system in which physical chemical processes of special interest for the modeler occur hangos and cameron 2001 pss are represented by a flow chart including clear boundaries between inputs and outputs furthermore each moth growth stage is a ps as can be seen in fig 3 concerning fig 3 the first ps p s i represents the eggs stage which gives the growth of the embryo inside the egg based on the initial number of eggs it delivers the number of living eggs that will become larvae e l and the number of dead eggs e d p s i i represents the larvae stage the larval growth moths is based on the number of live eggs e l as input stream from the previous stage it delivers the number of live l l and dead l d larvae to p s i i in this manner p s i i i represents the pupae stage which indicates the pupa development based on the number of live larvae l l while it delivers the number of live p l and dead p d pupae finally the fourth p s i v represents the adults stage where the adult is released from inside the pupa based on the number of living pupae p l and delivers the number of live a l and dead a d adults as output currents 2 4 application of the conservation principle a total mass balance was applied for each process system as follows 2 4 1 s d e p i eggs stage 1 d e l t d t k e t e l t e d t where k e t is the egg growth rate e l t is the number of live eggs and e d t is the number of dead eggs 2 4 2 s d e p i i larvae stage 2 d l l t d t k l t e l t l d t where k l t is the larval growth rate l l t is the number of live larvae and l d t is the number of dead larvae 2 4 3 s d e p i i i pupae stage 3 d p l t d t k p t l l t p d t where k p t is the pupa growth rate p l t is the number of live pupae and p d t is the number of dead pupae 2 4 4 s d e p i v adults stage 4 d a l t d t k a t p l t a d t where k a t is the adult growth rate a l t is the number of live adults and a d t is the number of dead adults 2 5 basic structure of the model every equation obtained from eq 1 to 4 are relevant for the model due to the important information they provide they constitute the pbsm fundamental structure 2 6 variables structural parameters and structural constants according to lema perez et al 2019 unknown terms and variables must be differentiated because not all unknowns are constituted as variables following this line also lema perez et al 2019 defines the structural parameters as unknowns of the basic model structure the summary of structural variables and parameters are presented in table 1 2 7 constitutive and assessment equations in this step structural parameters are replaced by constitutive equations which permit to obtain relevant process information and to incorporate important variables such as unbalanced variables in step 2 4 according to hangos and cameron 2001 constitutive equations emerge from the need to define or calculate structural parameters that appear from conservation balances and these are usually algebraic equations each resulting parameter can be replaced by a constitutive and valuation equation a constant value from the literature or it can be defined from the data lema perez et al 2019 all possibilities are subjected to the model level of detail the process knowledge and the information available from the literature computation of the growth rates for each stage is based on the monod structure monod 1949 which relates growth rate with limiting factors thereof to achieve this aim the considered common growth limiting factor to all stages is temperature which constitutive equation is provided by the touzeau equation presented in touzeau 1981 finally the constitutive equations corresponding to mortality rates are based on a mortality constants a known value and the number of eggs larvae pupae or live adults at each stage constitutive equations that allow calculation of the insect growth rates are shown in table 2 whereas table 3 shows the model s parameters and constants summary 2 8 degrees of freedom analysis this step evaluates whether it is possible to provide a numerical solution for the proposed model this happens when the number of unknowns model variables and parameters is the same as the number of equations or the model degree of freedom is null the model dofs analysis is presented in table 4 where var are the variables sp are the structural parameters fp are functional parameters and dof is the model dofs 2 9 computational model construction the model was programmed in matlab and differential equations were solved with euler s numerical method 2 10 model validation model validation will be discussed in section 3 however details on the origin of the experimental data used for the validation of the proposed mathematical model will be given in this section 2 10 1 lb mass breeding experiment a practical method for the breeding of l botrana under laboratory conditions was reported by m e herrera and coworkers in armendáriz et al 2007 these experiments provided useful data to validate the mathematical model proposed in this paper the experiments were carried out in the cuyo region argentina and the specimens used for the breeding stock were obtained from clusters infested with lobesia botrana in the wine region of cruz de piedra locality in maipú mendoza argentina breeding was carried out in a chamber under controlled conditions of light temperature and humidity already described in section 2 2 for the breeding of l botrana an artificial diet proposed by ferreira et al 2003 was considered the preparation obtained was placed inside a container with a previously sterilized hermetic lid the adults of l botrana were placed in a reproduction chamber pvc bottle provided with a waterer for moth feeding once the oviposition was given the pieces of pvc containing eggs were cut and embedded in the vessel containing the artificial diet previously described on which a reticulate was drawn so that the emerging larvae were located in said indentations once the pupa state was reached the chrysalis was transferred to a sterilized sealed lid container where adults emerged to start a new cycle three experiments were carried out for each of the temperatures considered 15 c 20 c y 25 c relevant data was obtained from the growth process of l botrana such as the number of days per stage mortality rates by stage threshold temperatures for growth by stage among others fig 4 shows the growth curves of lobesia botrana under laboratory conditions at the given temperatures figure a corresponds to the experiments performed at 15 2 c figure b corresponds to the experiments performed at 20 2 c and figure c corresponds to the experiments performed at 25 2 c it can be observed that the moth growth process at 15 2 c does not get to the adult stage for this temperature a mortality rate of 57 in the egg state avoids the egg reaching the adult stage which survival rate is null in the case of the experiments carried out at 20 2 c a lower mortality rate is observed in the egg stage 0 reaching the adult state with a survival rate of 20 finally for the experiment carried out at 25 2 c a mortality rate in the egg stage of 0 is observed reaching the adult stage with a survival rate of 30 3 results and discussion this section initially shows the mathematical model simulation results and then its comparison against the experimental data obtained in section 2 10 1 validation results are presented for three available temperatures 15 20 25 2 c and for two of the three available experiments r 1 and r 3 additionally the rmse errors are included for each model simulation with respect to the experimental data notice that some parameters vary according to the temperatures t m a x and t m i n as mentioned in section 2 7 therefore tables 5 7 and 9 show the numerical values corresponding to each temperature it is important to mention that constants k e d k l d k p d and k a d are associated with a mortality profile depending on the larval stage instead of a constant value moreover this larval stage also depends on temperature these profiles are presented in 6 8 and 10 they were obtained from the analysis of the r 2 experimental dataset for each temperature and therefore model validation was performed only with r 1 and r 3 datasets 3 1 validation at 15 c 2 c fig 5 shows the comparison results between the model response and the l botrana growth data under laboratory conditions at 15 c 2 c for this temperature the available dataset consists of 80 points in correspondence to the 80 days of growth following in the laboratory table 6 reports the resulting model rmse errors for each state against the experimental datasets r 1 and r 3 it is worth noting that the proposed mathematical model reflects the moth s inability to complete its life cycle under unfavorable conditions for the egg stage e l the model output exhibits a satisfactory fit to the experimental data at each repetition corresponding mean errors are small with values between 1 8496 eggs to 1 8788 eggs as shown in table 6 in the larva l l stage it can be observed a proper model following the trend given by the experimental data r 1 and r 3 it can be seen that the pupa stage has the weakest fit to the experimental data this can be attributed to the lack of modeling of the diapause 3 2 validation at 20 c 2 c fig 7 shows the lobesia botrana growth curves in laboratory conditions at 20 c 2 c against the model response for this temperature the available dataset consists of 48 points in correspondence to the 48 days of growth in the laboratory table 8 reports the rmse errors resulting from contrasting the response of the proposed model with the curves corresponding to the experimental data for each of the states at a temperature of 20 c 2 c it is observed that the response of the model for the e l egg stage approximates each of the curves of the experimental data especially the one corresponding to the r 3 experiment however for the same experiment r 3 the response of the model for the larva l l stage has the highest reported error for this temperature it is observed in the graphics that the l l curve follows the trend of the experimental data the response of the model for the pupa p l stage approximates well the experimental data with errors of acceptable order finally the adult stage turns out to have a high error level considering the number of adults which survive however the experimental data for this stage does not prove to be very consistent among repetitions especially the r 3 experiment 3 3 validation at 25 2 c fig 9 shows the lobesia botrana growth curves in laboratory conditions at 25 2 c against the model response for this temperature the available dataset consists of 39 points in correspondence to the 39 days of growth in the laboratory table 10 reports the rmse errors resulting from contrasting the response of the proposed model with the curves corresponding to the experimental data for each of the states for the range 25 2 c we obtained the highest error values especially for the r 3 dataset the output for the egg stage performed well the same conclusions can be determined for the larva stage for the r 1 dataset but not for the r 3 the pupa stage errors are acceptable whereas the adult stage exposes high values for the number of surviving adults the approach obtained with the proposed model and the experimental verification can be observed in figs 5 7 and 9 for three experiments that represent the behavior of lb with different temperatures from the figures it can be inferred the acceptable performance between the prediction model and the real experimental data 4 conclusion this work presented a semi physical model based on first principles to describe the l botrana life cycle the model structure consists of a differential equation for each insect stage and of algebraic equations for some structural parameters that emerged from conservation balances see table 11 the revised models in the literature were neither adjusted for the cuyo region in argentina nor have the grade of detail of our proposal the relevance of this research is based on the need to predict the pest evolution in a specific place this model includes insect growth rates measured mortality rates and interactions with environment parameters for controlled growing conditions the modeling of the l botrana growth process was assumed as a batch process since it starts from a known number of eggs as an initial condition and it is impossible to aggregate or extract new eggs larvae or pupae as regards pest treatment this model contributes to the knowledge about this insect s development process in this region allowing the subsequent design of pest control strategies based on the obtained laboratory real data some process peculiarities were observed the availability of this data was essential to identify its main states and to adjust the mathematical model response since mortality changes substantially depending on the temperature a variable mortality rate for each stage was considered here this is different from many other models that are based on a single mortality rate moreover the strong relationship between temperature and mortality appears explicitly in the reported results at low temperatures the adult stage is not reached 100 mortality and then is value drops to 54 for eggs 37 for larvae and 30 for pupae respectively at higher temperatures the growth process accelerates lowering mortality rates to 26 in eggs and 6 in larvae in this same sense the need to treat mortality rates as mortality profiles emerges since they do not remain constant however it is important to remark that these mortality profiles would require some additional adjustments for modeling the growth of more than one generation finally it is possible to extend this mathematical model to include food as a new growth limiting factor in the pupal stage or to improve the model predictivity in such a was that it can include multiple insect generations nevertheless further complementary experiments are required to achieve this goal credit authorship contribution statement estefania aguirre zapata conceptualization

have as a consequence wine growers winemakers technical support professionals phytosanitary services and other affected parties related to the decision support system dss may not use them this work presents a semi physical model based on first principles fpbsm to quantitatively describe the different stages of l botrana on its normal development time for laboratory controlled conditions and the environmental conditions of the cuyo region in argentina the proposed mathematical model mainly differs from the reported ones in its conceptual simplicity the interpretation of its parameters and the associated simplicity by its calculus and adjustment the obtained model is composed of four ordinary differential equations odes and 34 functional and structural parameters thirty of these 34 have physic or biological meaning this work is organized as follows section 2 the proposed mathematical model is shown following a proposal found in the literature alvarez et al 2009 section 3 introduces the analysis of the results obtained by the comparison against experimental data finally section 4 is intended to draw conclusions about the model and the future work 2 fpbsm of the growth for l botrana in the cuyo region of argentina this section reports the development of an fpbsm of the growth process of l botrana under specific laboratory conditions for argentina s region of cuyo the chosen methodology is alvarez et al 2009 and as can be seen from fig 1 consists of ten steps this model is based on the knowledge of the l botrana biological cycle 2 1 lobesia botrana process description and model objective lobesia botrana is a complete metamorphosis insect meaning that its life cycle consists of four stages egg larva pupa and adult urretabizkaya et al 2010 as shown in fig 2 in its first stage the female lays her eggs in flowers fruits or rachis of the vine the embryo inside the egg takes its food from the medium in which it is found it goes through a five eggs instars development process until total development is achieved blackhead in this stage the 37 4 3 of the eggs laid by the female die herrera et al 2016 larvae emerge after three to seven days and after having reached approximately 66 dd they pierce the fruit of the vine and feed on it larvae can consume their weight several times and obtain their food from the environment in which they are housed the larval stage has five instars that are limited by the size of its cuticle which results in cuticle changes called molt temperature is the variable that mostly affects the biological cycle of l botrana the larval growth takes place in the temperatures ranging 10 c t 30 c c values outside this range are unfavorable also for the other stages the mortality of the larvae with a single molt is 26 34 4 6 but this value drops to 1 2 0 5 when the second molt is completed herrera et al 2016 after 1315 days and having reached approximately 170 dd the larval stage is completed and the pupa or chrysalis stage begins pupae remain immobile and do not feed on anything the state of diapause is maintained until the environmental conditions suitable humidity and temperature values that favor the moth growth are met mortality is 1 2 1 1 in this stage after 520 days and having reached approximately 204 dd the butterfly emerges herrera et al 2016 the adult may require 23 h to make his first flight and one day to reproduce and thus begin a new life cycle the adult feeds on the nectar of the flowers or the juice of the ripe fruits and lives for about 8 days this cycle is repeated three or more times per year depending on the climate conditions and the temperature values in dd which regulate the transitions between stages bearing the above mentioned in mind the mathematical model seeks to describe how the different stages of l botrana quantitatively change in the normal times of insect development under controlled laboratory conditions 2 2 modeling hypothesis and level of detail the model considers the macroscopic view of each larva stage as part of a whole and not the physiological processes that occur within the insect intending to provide an analogy between insect development and the microorganism growth process the model includes insect growth rates measured mortality rates interactions with environmental parameters and controlled culture medium conditions the following laboratory conditions are considered 1 temperature is controlled at 15 c 20 c and 25 c 2 humidity remains in the range between 30 and 50 3 the artificial diet is similar to natural nutrients 4 the photoperiod is fixed at 16 8 l d 5 mortality rates represent natural death predators were neglected 6 growth process is batch since it starts from a known number of eggs then no eggs larvae or pupae are extracted or aggregated during the growth process 2 3 process systems definition a process system ps is a system in which physical chemical processes of special interest for the modeler occur hangos and cameron 2001 pss are represented by a flow chart including clear boundaries between inputs and outputs furthermore each moth growth stage is a ps as can be seen in fig 3 concerning fig 3 the first ps p s i represents the eggs stage which gives the growth of the embryo inside the egg based on the initial number of eggs it delivers the number of living eggs that will become larvae e l and the number of dead eggs e d p s i i represents the larvae stage the larval growth moths is based on the number of live eggs e l as input stream from the previous stage it delivers the number of live l l and dead l d larvae to p s i i in this manner p s i i i represents the pupae stage which indicates the pupa development based on the number of live larvae l l while it delivers the number of live p l and dead p d pupae finally the fourth p s i v represents the adults stage where the adult is released from inside the pupa based on the number of living pupae p l and delivers the number of live a l and dead a d adults as output currents 2 4 application of the conservation principle a total mass balance was applied for each process system as follows 2 4 1 s d e p i eggs stage 1 d e l t d t k e t e l t e d t where k e t is the egg growth rate e l t is the number of live eggs and e d t is the number of dead eggs 2 4 2 s d e p i i larvae stage 2 d l l t d t k l t e l t l d t where k l t is the larval growth rate l l t is the number of live larvae and l d t is the number of dead larvae 2 4 3 s d e p i i i pupae stage 3 d p l t d t k p t l l t p d t where k p t is the pupa growth rate p l t is the number of live pupae and p d t is the number of dead pupae 2 4 4 s d e p i v adults stage 4 d a l t d t k a t p l t a d t where k a t is the adult growth rate a l t is the number of live adults and a d t is the number of dead adults 2 5 basic structure of the model every equation obtained from eq 1 to 4 are relevant for the model due to the important information they provide they constitute the pbsm fundamental structure 2 6 variables structural parameters and structural constants according to lema perez et al 2019 unknown terms and variables must be differentiated because not all unknowns are constituted as variables following this line also lema perez et al 2019 defines the structural parameters as unknowns of the basic model structure the summary of structural variables and parameters are presented in table 1 2 7 constitutive and assessment equations in this step structural parameters are replaced by constitutive equations which permit to obtain relevant process information and to incorporate important variables such as unbalanced variables in step 2 4 according to hangos and cameron 2001 constitutive equations emerge from the need to define or calculate structural parameters that appear from conservation balances and these are usually algebraic equations each resulting parameter can be replaced by a constitutive and valuation equation a constant value from the literature or it can be defined from the data lema perez et al 2019 all possibilities are subjected to the model level of detail the process knowledge and the information available from the literature computation of the growth rates for each stage is based on the monod structure monod 1949 which relates growth rate with limiting factors thereof to achieve this aim the considered common growth limiting factor to all stages is temperature which constitutive equation is provided by the touzeau equation presented in touzeau 1981 finally the constitutive equations corresponding to mortality rates are based on a mortality constants a known value and the number of eggs larvae pupae or live adults at each stage constitutive equations that allow calculation of the insect growth rates are shown in table 2 whereas table 3 shows the model s parameters and constants summary 2 8 degrees of freedom analysis this step evaluates whether it is possible to provide a numerical solution for the proposed model this happens when the number of unknowns model variables and parameters is the same as the number of equations or the model degree of freedom is null the model dofs analysis is presented in table 4 where var are the variables sp are the structural parameters fp are functional parameters and dof is the model dofs 2 9 computational model construction the model was programmed in matlab and differential equations were solved with euler s numerical method 2 10 model validation model validation will be discussed in section 3 however details on the origin of the experimental data used for the validation of the proposed mathematical model will be given in this section 2 10 1 lb mass breeding experiment a practical method for the breeding of l botrana under laboratory conditions was reported by m e herrera and coworkers in armendáriz et al 2007 these experiments provided useful data to validate the mathematical model proposed in this paper the experiments were carried out in the cuyo region argentina and the specimens used for the breeding stock were obtained from clusters infested with lobesia botrana in the wine region of cruz de piedra locality in maipú mendoza argentina breeding was carried out in a chamber under controlled conditions of light temperature and humidity already described in section 2 2 for the breeding of l botrana an artificial diet proposed by ferreira et al 2003 was considered the preparation obtained was placed inside a container with a previously sterilized hermetic lid the adults of l botrana were placed in a reproduction chamber pvc bottle provided with a waterer for moth feeding once the oviposition was given the pieces of pvc containing eggs were cut and embedded in the vessel containing the artificial diet previously described on which a reticulate was drawn so that the emerging larvae were located in said indentations once the pupa state was reached the chrysalis was transferred to a sterilized sealed lid container where adults emerged to start a new cycle three experiments were carried out for each of the temperatures considered 15 c 20 c y 25 c relevant data was obtained from the growth process of l botrana such as the number of days per stage mortality rates by stage threshold temperatures for growth by stage among others fig 4 shows the growth curves of lobesia botrana under laboratory conditions at the given temperatures figure a corresponds to the experiments performed at 15 2 c figure b corresponds to the experiments performed at 20 2 c and figure c corresponds to the experiments performed at 25 2 c it can be observed that the moth growth process at 15 2 c does not get to the adult stage for this temperature a mortality rate of 57 in the egg state avoids the egg reaching the adult stage which survival rate is null in the case of the experiments carried out at 20 2 c a lower mortality rate is observed in the egg stage 0 reaching the adult state with a survival rate of 20 finally for the experiment carried out at 25 2 c a mortality rate in the egg stage of 0 is observed reaching the adult stage with a survival rate of 30 3 results and discussion this section initially shows the mathematical model simulation results and then its comparison against the experimental data obtained in section 2 10 1 validation results are presented for three available temperatures 15 20 25 2 c and for two of the three available experiments r 1 and r 3 additionally the rmse errors are included for each model simulation with respect to the experimental data notice that some parameters vary according to the temperatures t m a x and t m i n as mentioned in section 2 7 therefore tables 5 7 and 9 show the numerical values corresponding to each temperature it is important to mention that constants k e d k l d k p d and k a d are associated with a mortality profile depending on the larval stage instead of a constant value moreover this larval stage also depends on temperature these profiles are presented in 6 8 and 10 they were obtained from the analysis of the r 2 experimental dataset for each temperature and therefore model validation was performed only with r 1 and r 3 datasets 3 1 validation at 15 c 2 c fig 5 shows the comparison results between the model response and the l botrana growth data under laboratory conditions at 15 c 2 c for this temperature the available dataset consists of 80 points in correspondence to the 80 days of growth following in the laboratory table 6 reports the resulting model rmse errors for each state against the experimental datasets r 1 and r 3 it is worth noting that the proposed mathematical model reflects the moth s inability to complete its life cycle under unfavorable conditions for the egg stage e l the model output exhibits a satisfactory fit to the experimental data at each repetition corresponding mean errors are small with values between 1 8496 eggs to 1 8788 eggs as shown in table 6 in the larva l l stage it can be observed a proper model following the trend given by the experimental data r 1 and r 3 it can be seen that the pupa stage has the weakest fit to the experimental data this can be attributed to the lack of modeling of the diapause 3 2 validation at 20 c 2 c fig 7 shows the lobesia botrana growth curves in laboratory conditions at 20 c 2 c against the model response for this temperature the available dataset consists of 48 points in correspondence to the 48 days of growth in the laboratory table 8 reports the rmse errors resulting from contrasting the response of the proposed model with the curves corresponding to the experimental data for each of the states at a temperature of 20 c 2 c it is observed that the response of the model for the e l egg stage approximates each of the curves of the experimental data especially the one corresponding to the r 3 experiment however for the same experiment r 3 the response of the model for the larva l l stage has the highest reported error for this temperature it is observed in the graphics that the l l curve follows the trend of the experimental data the response of the model for the pupa p l stage approximates well the experimental data with errors of acceptable order finally the adult stage turns out to have a high error level considering the number of adults which survive however the experimental data for this stage does not prove to be very consistent among repetitions especially the r 3 experiment 3 3 validation at 25 2 c fig 9 shows the lobesia botrana growth curves in laboratory conditions at 25 2 c against the model response for this temperature the available dataset consists of 39 points in correspondence to the 39 days of growth in the laboratory table 10 reports the rmse errors resulting from contrasting the response of the proposed model with the curves corresponding to the experimental data for each of the states for the range 25 2 c we obtained the highest error values especially for the r 3 dataset the output for the egg stage performed well the same conclusions can be determined for the larva stage for the r 1 dataset but not for the r 3 the pupa stage errors are acceptable whereas the adult stage exposes high values for the number of surviving adults the approach obtained with the proposed model and the experimental verification can be observed in figs 5 7 and 9 for three experiments that represent the behavior of lb with different temperatures from the figures it can be inferred the acceptable performance between the prediction model and the real experimental data 4 conclusion this work presented a semi physical model based on first principles to describe the l botrana life cycle the model structure consists of a differential equation for each insect stage and of algebraic equations for some structural parameters that emerged from conservation balances see table 11 the revised models in the literature were neither adjusted for the cuyo region in argentina nor have the grade of detail of our proposal the relevance of this research is based on the need to predict the pest evolution in a specific place this model includes insect growth rates measured mortality rates and interactions with environment parameters for controlled growing conditions the modeling of the l botrana growth process was assumed as a batch process since it starts from a known number of eggs as an initial condition and it is impossible to aggregate or extract new eggs larvae or pupae as regards pest treatment this model contributes to the knowledge about this insect s development process in this region allowing the subsequent design of pest control strategies based on the obtained laboratory real data some process peculiarities were observed the availability of this data was essential to identify its main states and to adjust the mathematical model response since mortality changes substantially depending on the temperature a variable mortality rate for each stage was considered here this is different from many other models that are based on a single mortality rate moreover the strong relationship between temperature and mortality appears explicitly in the reported results at low temperatures the adult stage is not reached 100 mortality and then is value drops to 54 for eggs 37 for larvae and 30 for pupae respectively at higher temperatures the growth process accelerates lowering mortality rates to 26 in eggs and 6 in larvae in this same sense the need to treat mortality rates as mortality profiles emerges since they do not remain constant however it is important to remark that these mortality profiles would require some additional adjustments for modeling the growth of more than one generation finally it is possible to extend this mathematical model to include food as a new growth limiting factor in the pupal stage or to improve the model predictivity in such a was that it can include multiple insect generations nevertheless further complementary experiments are required to achieve this goal credit authorship contribution statement estefania aguirre zapata conceptualization

24511,studies that question important conceptual and methodological aspects of the field of ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling have cast doubts on whether it is possible to estimate the fundamental niche of a species using presence only data the main limitation in niche estimation is that presence data come from the realized niche which is only a subset of the fundamental niche most of the existing methods lack the ability to overcome this limitation and therefore fit niches that resemble the realized niche to obtain a more accurate estimate of the fundamental niche we propose using the geographic region that is accessible to a species based on its dispersal ability to determine a sampling distribution in environmental space from which we can quantify the likelihood of observing a particular environmental combination in a sample of presence points we incorporate this sampling distribution into a multivariate normal model i e a mahalanobis distance model by creating a weight function that modifies the probabilities of observing different environmental combinations in a sample of presences this modification accounts for the uneven availability of environmental conditions we show that the parameters of this weighted normal model can be approximated with a maximum likelihood estimation approach and then used to draw ellipsoids confidence regions that represent the fundamental niche of the species we illustrate the application of our model with two worked examples first we use presence data for an invasive species and an accessible area that includes only its native range to evaluate whether the fitted model predicts confirmed establishments of the species outside its native range second we use presence data for closely related species with known accessible areas to demonstrate how the different dispersal abilities of the species constrain a classic mahalanobis distance model overall we show that accounting for the distribution of environmental conditions that are accessible to a species indeed affects the estimation of the ellipsoids used to model its fundamental niche keywords realized niche environmental space presence data weighted distribution dispersal 1 introduction in recent years there has been substantial progress in the fields of ecological niche modeling enm and species distribution modeling sdm guisan et al 2013 however there is still debate about what aspects of the niche are estimated by these methods warren 2012 jiménez valverde et al 2008 lobo 2008 specifically conventional enm sdm approaches that are based on presence only data estimate objects that in the case of enm are between the realized and the fundamental niches peterson et al 2011 or in the case of sdm are between the actual and potential distributions of the species jiménez valverde et al 2008 here we propose a model to estimating fundamental niches that fits biologically realistic shapes and quantifies the availability of climates that are accessible for the species as a way to account for biased presence samples the distinction between the fundamental and the realized niche as proposed by hutchinson 1957 is essential to understand what kind of objects are being estimated by the different correlative statistical models used in enm sdm the fundamental niche of a species is the set of environmental conditions where in the absence of biotic interactions the population growth rate is positive peterson et al 2011 the realized niche is a subset of the fundamental niche that is determined by abiotic factors environmental conditions biotic factors and dispersal limitations soberón 2007 estimating the fundamental niche of a species is of particular importance when using the estimated niche to model species distributions at other times or in different regions such as when using enm sdm to predict the effects of climate change or the spread of invasive species tingley et al 2014 however determining the complete fundamental niche of a species is also substantially more difficult than estimating the realized niche it has being suggested that in principle we should not expect models to predict the fundamental niche unless some supplementary information on it allowing extrapolation beyond the realized niche is used to fit the models qiao et al 2018 in that sense some approaches have incorporated experimental data on the physiology of the species to their models as a source of information from unoccupied regions of the fundamental niche jiménez et al 2019 hoogenboom and connolly 2009 additionally booth 2017 has suggested that for well known tree species different types of occurrences beyond their natural distributions e g commercial forestry trials where competition is reduced can be used as supplementary information on the species climatic requirements the relationship between modeling niches and modeling geographic distributions is mediated by hutchinson s duality colwell and rangel 2009 which is the relationship between environmental and geographic spaces with the right resolution a discrete set of geographic coordinates can be made to have a one to one relationship with a discrete set of environmental vectors soberon and nakamura 2009 aspinall and lees 1994 this fundamental correspondence allows us to move back and forth between modeling niches and modeling geographic distributions as a consequence of hutchinson s duality colwell and rangel 2009 and because species presence data come only from areas currently occupied by a species a sample of presence records may not reflect all the environmental potentiality of a species jiménez valverde et al 2008 lobo 2008 therefore we should acknowledge that a correlative model based solely on presence data will be constrained by the imposed limitations of the set of environments where the species can be observed owens et al 2020 will probably approximate the realized niche soberon and nakamura 2009 failing to acknowledge and somehow include this constraint in a model leads to severe uncertainties and drawbacks when using this models to make predictions lobo 2016 species presence absence data are often spatially biased and noisy we work under the assumption that a cleaning and preparation process to resolve errors precedes the application of enm sdm methods several techniques have been developed for resolving some of the common types of problems in presence data chapman 2005 cobos et al 2018 such as a lack of accuracy in the reported coordinates nomenclatural and taxonomic errors and the presence of geographic or environmental outliers however other types of bias remain in presence data we focus on the implicit bias created when defining the relevant spatial region for a study selecting different study regions produces different sampling universes and the definition of the sampling region is an important part of the specification of a model here we explicitly define an m hypothesis to set the sampling universe as all the sites where we can observe the species as present barve et al 2011 under the biotic abiotic movement bam framework peterson et al 2011 the region m contains all the sites that a species is hypothesized to have been able to reach from some past time via dispersal and migration in geography g space m is usually a connected and continuous set i e a single polygon so we make use of the hutchinson s duality to perform practical computations this set is first converted into a discrete grid of coordinates and then the values for environmental variables at these coordinates are used to build its representation in environmental space e space because the fundamental niche is defined in e space it makes sense to represent our data m hypothesis and presences and models in e space there are two things that we need to consider regarding the relationship among m and the fundamental niche first not all sites in m have the environmental conditions needed to sustain viable populations and it is known that some sites inside m could be sink populations barve et al 2011 second hutchinson s duality permits the establishment of a one to one relationship between coordinates in g space and multidimensional vectors in e space but this relationship does not preserve distance nearby elements in g space are not necessarily nearby in e space and vice versa this creates a serious and mostly ignored problem uniform random sampling in g space does not imply uniform random sampling in e space if the goal of a niche model is to get estimate the fundamental niche using presence only data the empirical distribution of m in e space should therefore be incorporated in the statistical model to account for the uneven distribution of available sampling points in a previous contribution jiménez et al 2019 we proposed a bayesian argument for combining correlative techniques with information from physiological experiments to approximate to the fundamental niche of a species however in that work we disregarded the problem of heterogeneity of e space that is why here we consider that event of observing an environmental combination x r d where the species was recorded as present has a non uniform probability of being included in the sample in a typical random sampling scenario on the random variable x with a probability density function pdf f x θ the probability of selection is the same for each environmental combination regardless of the value of x the pdf at x is therefore f x θ in contrast under a biased sampling scenario on x the probability of selecting x is proportional to a predetermined weight function w x implying that the pdf at the observation x is no longer f x θ we propose a method of determining w x and the resulting pdf under biased sampling which we then use to estimate a species fundamental niche when f x θ is a multivariate normal density i e a density based on the exponential of the negative mahalanobis distance we illustrate the application of our proposed statistical model with two worked examples in the first example we estimate the fundamental niche of the asian giant hornet vespa mandarinia an invasive species recorded in europe there is a single report in this region and recently documented in the united states and canada wilson et al 2020 we first use presence records and an m hypothesis that only includes the native range east and south asia mainland southeast asia and far east russia of the hornet to fit a convex shape an ellipsoid as a model of the fundamental niche we then evaluate the fitted model using the presence records from the invaded regions in the second example we again use ellipsoids presence records and species specific m hypotheses to demonstrate how different m scenarios constrain a classic mahalanobis distance model clark et al 1993 farber and kadmon 2003 for different hummingbird species we identify m scenarios under which we expect the mahalanobis distance model to deviate from the fundamental niche and instead be closer to the realized niche of a species 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling approach our aim was to account for the structure of the environmental space when attempting to estimate a fundamental niche to address this problem we follow austin 2002 who suggested the inclusion of three major components in any modeling procedure in ecology 1 an ecological model that describes the ecological assumptions to be incorporated into the analysis and the ecological theory to be tested 2 a statistical model that includes the statistical theory and methods used and 3 a data model that accounts for how the data were collected or measured the ecological model described in the following section includes a detailed definition of the fundamental niche as a function of both fitness and the relationship between fitness and the combinations of environmental conditions in which a species has been observed the statistical model and the data model are addressed in subsequent sections 2 1 1 the ecological model relevant concepts in the study of the fundamental niche the fundamental niche of a species n f is the set of all environmental conditions that permit the species to exist hutchinson 1957 peterson et al 2011 let e r d be a d dimensional environmental space influencing fitness measured for example as the finite rate of increase in a demographic response function furthermore define a function λ x e r that relates each environmental combination x e to fitness pulliam 2000 jiménez et al 2019 if the fitness function has the right shape there is a value of fitness λ m i n that can be interpreted as minimum survivorship and defines the border of the fundamental niche jiménez et al 2019 etherington and omondiagbe 2019 in other words λ m i n is the threshold above which the fitness is high enough to support a population any combination of environmental values that results in a fitness lower than λ m i n is outside the fundamental niche n f x e λ x λ m i n notice that using this notation λ μ λ m a x assumptions about the shape of a species response to an environmental variable i e the shape of the fitness function are central to any predictive modeling effort austin 2002 soberón and peterson 2019 we assume that the contour surfaces of the fitness function λ and therefore the boundary of the fundamental niche is convex drake 2015 we specifically model these level surfaces using ellipsoids in multivariate space maguire 1973 brown 1984 jiménez et al 2019 because these surfaces are simple and manageable convex sets defined by 1 a vector μ that indicates the position of the optimal environmental conditions the center of the ellipsoid and 2 a covariance matrix σ that defines the size and orientation of the ellipsoid in e these two parameters can also be interpreted as the parameters of a multivariate normal density function f x μ σ in which the corresponding random variable x represents a combination environmental conditions in e where the species could be recorded as present jiménez et al 2019 these ellipsoids are also known as mahalanobis distance models farber and kadmon 2003 because the mahalanobis distance defined by μ and σ is equivalent to the quadratic form that defines f x μ σ ellipsoids representing the niche have been used to test the niche center hypothesis osorio olvera et al 2020 which predicts that the closer an environmental combination is to the vector μ the higher the suitability value associated with that combination and therefore the higher the abundance of the species there we transform fitness values λ x by calculating f x μ ˆ σ ˆ f μ ˆ μ ˆ σ ˆ where μ ˆ and σ ˆ are estimates of μ and σ respectively which produces a value between 0 and 1 that can be interpreted as a suitability index for the environmental combination x the central assumption here is that there is a monotonic transformation between λ x and f x μ σ in the sense that high values of fitness near λ m a x correspond to high suitability values near μ we can therefore work with the normal model to delimit the environmental requirements of a species and test the niche center hypothesis other central concepts in the study of the fundamental niche are the existing niche jackson and overpeck 2000 and the realized niche hutchinson 1957 which are each subsets of the fundamental niche the existing niche represents the existing climatic conditions in the study region and the realized niche represents the subset of the fundamental niche that a species occupies as a result of biotic interactions with other species we assume that the following relationships between three niche concepts the fundamental niche n f the existing niche n t m and the realized niche n r are fulfilled peterson et al 2011 peterson and soberón 2012 1 n f n f e t n t m n r t m these relationships are illustrated in fig 1 for a hypothetical species and constitute our ecological model in theory every environmental combination inside the fundamental niche ellipse is suitable for the species and if the species can reach a site with those environmental conditions it could persist there indefinitely in the absence of biotic factors such as predators however at a given time t only a discrete subset of the environmental combinations that can be mapped into e space exist in geographic space this subset constitutes the existing niche of the species note that this set of environmental combinations which are contiguous points in e space are divided across different regions when represented in geographic space some of the points are in north america purple points and others are in south america green points species have dispersal limitations that may prevent them from colonizing all the environments in their existing niche thus if a species is native to north america and is only able to reach the area shaded in orange henceforth m then i its realized niche will be a subset of purple points because they are suitable environments that the species has access to and ii the set of green points constitutes its potential niche because they are suitable environments that are not accessible to the species there is therefore only a discrete set of environmental combinations from the fundamental niche that is available to the species and we expect to observe higher abundances of the species in the environmental conditions that both exist and are close to the center of the fundamental niche ellipse 2 1 2 the statistical and data models two stage sampling given a sample of environmental conditions where the species has been observed as present d x 1 x n we propose a likelihood function for the parameters that describe the fundamental niche of the species θ μ σ suppose that the environmental space e is defined by d environmental variables i e d e r d and each point x i in e space has d coordinates if e were a uniform grid of points embedded in r d then the sample of conditions in which a species is present d could be considered to be a random sample of a multivariate normal variable with the density function 2 f x θ 2 π d 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 x μ t σ 1 x μ this density function could theoretically be used to define a likelihood function and estimate μ and σ this is unfortunately not the case for two main reasons first the environmental combinations that exist currently on the planet do not represent a uniform sample taken from the whole multivariate space e because huthinson s duality does not preserve distances if we take a uniform grid in geographic space and map it into environmental space the resulting cloud of points will be concentrated in select regions leaving other regions empty as seen in fig 1 second species occurrences can only come from e m or the set of environmental combinations associated with all the sites in the region that is accessible to the species m the irregular shape of e m induces a sampling bias such that the probability of recording the species as present in an environmental combination is no longer given directly by f x μ σ as these probabilities are affected by the availability of environmental conditions in e m to account for the sampling bias induced by e m suppose that when the event x x occurs i e when the species is recorded as present at a site with these environmental conditions the probability of observing it changes depending on the observed x we represent this probability by w x the set of observed environmental combinations d can therefore be considered as a random sample of the random variable x w with probability density function 3 f w x μ σ w x f x μ σ e w x where e w x w x f x μ σ d x note that f w is an example of a weighted density function in which e w x is the normalizing factor making the total probability function equal to unity patil and ord 1976 patil and rao 1978 lele and keim 2006 patil and rao 1978 call this normalizing factor the visibility factor which captures the idea that samples from e are not uniform the observed species presences can only come from e m the visible set of environmental combinations which may include regions in r d where the environmental combinations are abundant associated to high values of w x but even though the points inside these abundant regions might not be close to μ i e where f x μ σ is small the probability of observing the species in these points could be higher than the probability associated to other points closer to μ i e where f x μ σ is large that do not exist in e m they are not visible or whose weight w x is too small on the other hand eq 3 can also be described as the model resulting from a two stage sampling design that accounts for the random process under which an environmental combination x d is observed patil and rao 1978 suppose that nature produces a sample of size n of environmental conditions inside the fundamental niche with probabilities of being observed given by the density function f x μ σ this sample may contain any point in e because the species not only requires the right abiotic conditions to maintain a population but also needs specific biotic conditions and can only disperse to a finite set of sites the recorded sample will not include all the n observations instead only a subsample of size n n is selected by drawing observations from the original sample of size n with a probabilities proportional to w x without loss of generality let us illustrate this two stage sampling design using the fundamental niche described in the bidimensional environmental space shown in fig 1 suppose that a species fundamental niche is defined by a bivariate normal distribution with parameters 4 μ 1 0 38 1 85 σ 1 0 0412 0 0366 0 0366 0 075 the level curves of the corresponding density function f x μ 1 σ 1 are ellipses they are plotted in the left panel of fig 2 where the largest ellipse corresponds to the 99 confidence region in the first stage of the sampling process we generate a sample of size n 100 from within the fundamental niche and plot this sample on top of the ellipses as expected most of the environmental combinations in this sample are close to the center of the ellipses green points inside the ellipses plotted in the left panel of fig 2 the middle panel of fig 2 shows all the environmental combinations that exist inside the region that is accessible to the species e m which are indicated by purple and orange points in both fig 1 and fig 2 we identified the subset of points that both exist in e m and are inside the 99 confidence region of f x μ σ and colored them purple we then estimated the density function of the accessible environments h ˆ e m using a kernel method the resulting level curves of h ˆ e m correspond to the orange regions in the middle panel of fig 2 we used h ˆ e m to define the weights w x h ˆ x e m which were used in the second stage of the sampling process based on the assumption that not all the n 100 points from the original sample exist in e m the second sampling stage involved selecting a subsample of size n 25 from the first sample of n 100 environments from the fundamental niche the resulting sample d x 1 x n is shown in the right panel of fig 2 purple triangles note that if we use a simple likelihood approach based on the simulated sample to estimate the parameters μ 1 and σ 1 which is equivalent to fitting a mahalanobis distance model we recover a 99 confidence ellipse violet ellipse in the right panel of fig 2 that is smaller than the theoretical fundamental niche of our species largest green ellipse in the right panel of fig 2 more importantly the estimated center of this ellipse does not coincide with the optimal environmental conditions μ 1 therefore if we estimate the parameters that describe the fundamental niche of the species without accounting for the distribution of available environments we cannot claim that the model fully recovers the species fundamental niche moreover if we attempt to test the niche center hypothesis using an ellipse recovered from a mahalanobis distance model we will expect high abundances around an environmental combination that is not the true optimum with respect to the application of the two stage sampling method we assume that the sample of environmental combinations where the species of interest was observed as present d is a random sample of the random variable x w with a probability density function given by eq 3 we can therefore define the likelihood function of the parameters of interest θ μ σ as follows 5 l θ d i 1 n f w x θ i 1 n w x f x θ e w x where the function w x is approximated using all the environmental combinations accessible to the species along with a kernel density procedure and we obtain a monte carlo estimate for the expected value e w x which was defined as an integral see eq 3 note that the function w x does not depend on the parameters of interest and can be ignored when maximizing the log likelihood function furthermore because the analytical form of w x is unknown the analytical form of e w x is also unknown however we can sample environmental combinations from the availability distribution by randomly choosing sites inside m and extracting the values of the environmental variables at those sampled sites using this sample we can obtain monte carlo estimates of e w x for any fixed value of θ this method has been used before in the statistical modeling literature and is called the method of simulated maximum likelihood robert and casella 1999 lele and keim 2006 we can use this method to obtain a monte carlo estimate of the log likelihood function as follows 6 ℓ θ d i 1 n log f w x i θ i 1 n log f w x i θ log 1 k j 1 k f w x j θ where x j j 1 2 k is a random sample that was sampled with replacement from the distribution w x the size of this sample k must be large enough to ignore monte carlo error once this sample is generated we can apply standard optimization techniques to minimize the negative log likelihood function in eq 6 and obtain the maximum likelihood estimators μ ˆ and σ ˆ in summary our proposed modeling procedure uses a sample of occurrences for the species of interest together with polygons that represent the geographic areas accessible to the species inside these polygons we extract environmental values from sites chosen at random this is done with two different purposes 1 to estimate a kernel density used to define the weights in the likelihood function and 2 to obtain a monte carlo estimate of the log likelihood function once we have all the elements of the likelihood function we calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters μ ˆ and σ ˆ these estimated parameters will allow us to plot ellipses in e space that represent the border of the estimated fundamental niche in all the examples we show we plot the ellipses that correspond to the 99 confidence regions of the fitted multivariate normal distribution we compare these ellipses to the ones that correspond to the 99 confidence region of a standard mahalanobis distance model farber and kadmon 2003 with estimated parameters μ ˆ 0 1 n i 1 n x i and σ ˆ 0 1 n i 1 n x i μ ˆ 0 x i μ ˆ 0 t i e the maximum likelihood estimates under a multivariate normal model described in eq 2 we hypothesized that the two ellipses will be similar in cases where e m covers most of the fundamental niche of the species i e the overlap between these two sets is high and the distribution of points in e m is approximately uniform finally we project the resulting models back to geographic space once we have the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of interest θ ˆ we use the multivariate normal density function given in eq 2 to calculate a suitability index that can be plotted in g space as either a continuous value or a binary region defined by a threshold for interpretation purposes it is convenient to standardize this suitability index to the interval 0 1 which is easily done by dividing f x θ by its maximum value f μ ˆ θ ˆ 2 2 data using our method to approximate fundamental niches requires three types of data i species occurrence data which should go through a standard process of detecting and removing inaccurate records before being used see cobos et al 2018 for an example of this ii an m hypothesis or geographic polygon that encloses all the sites accessible to the species taking into consideration the dispersal ability of the species and natural geographic barriers and iii environmental layers cropped to the study area from which we can extract environmental data for the occurrences and for the sites inside m in the following sections we describe the datasets that we used to create our worked examples 2 2 1 occurrence data we selected seven species to illustrate the use of the statistical model that we present here the first species is the asian giant hornet vespa mandarinia matsuura and sakagami 1973 matsuura 1988 because v mandarinia is an invasive species using it in our model can provide valuable insight into whether the niche estimated by our model is a good approximation of a true fundamental niche in other words we test whether the estimated fundamental niche contains the locations that this species has been able to invade we also selected six species of hummingbirds for a separate analysis amazilia chionogaster threnetes ruckeri sephanoides sephanoides basilinna leucotis colibri thalassinus and calypte costae these species were used because detailed m hypotheses are available for them the occurrence data for v mandarinia was obtained from the global biodiversity information facility gbif database https www gbif org we downloaded 1944 occurrence records for gbif 2020 which after undergoing a standard cleaning procedure cobos et al 2018 were reduced to 170 presence records in the species native range and one presence record in europe to avoid introducing an extra source of bias anderson 2012 the cleaned dataset was spatially thinned by geographic distance at least 50 km away resulting in a final sample of 46 presence records that were used to fit the niche models see red points in fig 3 for the hummingbird species we used the cleaned occurrence records that were used by cooper and soberón 2018 which are available at https github com jacobccooper trochilidae and whose original source is also gbif cooper and soberón thoroughly revised and cleaned these presence records and eliminated misidentified individuals and synonyms they additionally defined the regions that were accessible to most of the extant hummingbird species and used those regions to fit species distribution models given the success of cooper and soberón at using these m hypothesis we believed their data provided a great opportunity to test our proposed model fig 4 shows the presence data of each hummingbird species the sample sizes range from 148 observations for a chionogaster to 926 presences for c costae we selected these six species because they occupy different regions of the americas from the southern united states to the patagonia given this wide geographic range we believed it would be interesting to compare the estimated niches of all the species in e space and evaluate how similar or different the optimal environmental conditions are among the different species although the different species are likely to occupy different regions of e space we suspected that their fundamental niches might share some environmental combinations niche overlap 2 2 2 m hypothesis in the case of v mandarinia we defined the area accessible to the species as a combination of buffers that represent the species dispersal ability and the elevation range where the species is known to occur 850 1900 m first we identified the region delineated by a buffer of 500 km around all occurrence records in the sample which accounts for the dispersal ability of the hornets matsuura and sakagami 1973 matsuura 1988 second we clipped this region with an elevation layer to remove regions at elevations higher than 1900 m the resulting polygon is outlined in blue in fig 3 note that this polygon includes some sites not on the continent however we only extracted the environmental values for inland sites within this blue m and did not considered oceanic regions for the hummingbird species we used the polygons generated by cooper and soberón 2018 polygons were hypothesized based on the known species occurrences topography ecoregions and estimated dispersal distances and where bounded by significant geographical barriers such as large rivers and mountains by doing so they took into account all the criteria that are know to yield more accurate models barve et al 2011 owens et al 2013 2020 saupe et al 2012 fig 4 shows the six polygons for the different species note that some species like t ruckeri occupy most of their accessible area fig 4 b whereas others like b leucotis and c costae occupy only a fraction of it in addition there is wide diversity in range sizes with s sephanoides having a more restricted range compared to c thalassinus given this geographic variation among species we were interested in making similar comparisons in e space 2 2 3 environmental variables the climatic layers used to create the models for each species came from the worldclim database hijmans et al 2005 which provides open access to bioclimatic layers built with monthly average measurements for the period 1970 2020 we used only two of the 19 variables available in this database annual mean temperature bio1 and annual precipitation bio12 both variables were recorded at 10 arcmin resolution we clipped each climatic layer using the polygons that correspond to the m hypotheses for each species these two climatic variables were selected because they are known to be biologically meaningful for both the asian hornet and the selected hummingbird species root 1988 specifically it has being documented that the wasps of the genus vespula have high endothermic capacity which benefits their thermoregulatory efficiency allowing them at the same time to survive to broad temperature ranges käfer et al 2012 furthermore other studies suggest that the queens of this genus prefer green environments such as agricultural and forested areas or parks kim et al 2020 whose presence is highly correlated with the amount of rainfall in the area furthermore in the case of the hummingbirds we wanted to compare their estimated niches because comparisons of estimated niches in e spaces with different axes and or dimensions are not possible we only looked at these two dimensions of their niches all analyses were performed in r version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 we used several existing packages for data preparation analysis and visualization ggplot2 wickham 2016 ks duong 2020 raster hijmans 2020 rgdal bivand et al 2020 rgeos bivand and rundel 2019 scales wickham and seidel 2020 sf pebesma 2018 we additionally created new functions that can be used to reproduce our examples and apply our methodology to other species these functions can be found at https github com laurajim nf model with m 3 results 3 1 estimated fundamental niche of vespa mandarinia we randomly sampled 10 000 sites inside the accessible native region of the asian giant hornet shown in fig 3 and extracted their environmental values e m so we could plot them in e space the resulting set e m is shown in fig 5 as a cloud of points in the background gray open circles we used this e m and the 46 presence records of v mandarinia red points in fig 5 to determine the log likelihood function eq 6 of the parameters that describes its fundamental niche under the weighted normal model θ μ σ we maximized this log likelihood function to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates mles μ ˆ and σ ˆ for comparison we also used the 46 presence records only to obtain mles using the mahalanobis distance model μ ˆ 0 and σ ˆ 0 the resulting mles for both models are given in table 1 and the corresponding 99 confidence regions are plotted in fig 5 the mles of μ the optimal environmental conditions estimated by both the weighted normal model and the mahalanobis distance model are highly similar purple and red squares in fig 5 however the models predicted different limits for the fundamental niche of v mandarinia specifically the estimated n f is larger under the mahalanobis distance model purple ellipse in fig 5 whereas the variance predicted by the weighted normal model for annual precipitation is smaller as shown in table 1 nevertheless both estimated ellipses contain 45 out of the 46 initial presence points and they contain all the records from the locations outside the native range of v mandarinia blue points in fig 5 the presences from the invaded regions are not close to the center of the ellipses but they are placed in a region of e m where the environmental combinations are well represented in g space we calculated a standardized suitability index for the asian giant hornet using the mles from the weighted normal model and eq 2 using this index we created a worldwide suitability map fig 6 to visually assess if there are regions where v mandarinia could theoretically establish based solely on the species environmental requirements as shown in fig 6 the pacific coast of the northern united states and southern canada where the species has already been confirmed has a low to moderate suitability index similarly most of europe has a low to moderate suitability particularly around the one site where the species was already recorded additional maps that are focused more closely on the west coast of north america europe and the native range of v mandarinia are provided in the supplementary material we also note that there are other regions within the americas that appear highly suitable for v mandarinia such as the eastern united states the mountain ranges of mexico and the andes and the brazilian and ethiopian highlands 3 2 estimated fundamental niches of hummingbird species in the case of the six hummingbird species that we chose for our analysis the accessible areas m and the presence records were in different regions of g space but also of e space the corresponding e m and presence points therefore occupied different regions see gray clouds of points in fig 7 using the m hypothesis and the presences we estimated the parameters μ and σ which describe the fundamental niche of each species using both the mahalanobis distance model and the weighted normal model the resulting mles for each species are given in table 2 unlike the v mandarinia example the weighted normal model predicted broader fundamental niches for most of the studied hummingbirds except for c thalassinus the estimated centers of the ellipses μ ˆ 0 and μ ˆ and their orientation with respect to the axes were similar for a chionogaster and b leucotis however there was a clear difference between the centers of the estimated ellipses for the t ruckeri s sephanoides c thalassinus and c costae for all the hummingbird species both the mahalanobis distance and the weighed normal models agreed on the sign of the covariance between the two environmental variables used to describe and compare the fundamental niches the estimated ellipses for s sephanoides were the most different with respect to the magnitude of the estimated covariance between the two environmental variables we additionally noted that with the exception of c thalassinus the ellipses obtained with the weighted normal model contained more presence points than the ellipses obtained from a simple mahalanobis distance model it is also worth noting that under the mahalanobis distance model the estimated optimum temperature for four of the six hummingbird species was between 16 and 18 degrees celsius see table 2 the mahalanobis distance model thus predicts that the species temperature optima are not substantially different among these species even though they differ in their precipitation optima however under the weighted normal model the estimated optimum temperatures were clearly different among all the species see fig 8 4 discussion the calibration region limits the presence of a species to a discrete set of environmental combinations and the probabilities of sampling different environments from this set are not uniform using kernel methods we modeled this non uniform e space and used the kernel as a weight function in a multivariate normal model which we then applied to estimating the fundamental niche of a species of interest our main result is that accounting for the shape of the e space defined by an m indeed affects the estimation of the ellipsoids we use to model fundamental niches we illustrated the application of our proposed method with first the asian giant hornet vespa mandarinia invasive to north america the ellipse fitted with our model which represents the border of the fundamental niche of v mandarinia contained the sites outside the species native range where the species has being reported see red dots in fig 5 moreover our results agree with other modeling exercises in predicting a low to moderate suitability for the pacific northwest coast of the united states and canada and over europe nuñez penichet et al 2021 norderud et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 alaniz et al 2021 moo llanes 2021 as well as on identifying a significant proportion of the east coast of the united states as an area of high concern fig 6 studies that have adopted maxent as their modeling framework often have to fit a large set of candidate models using different combinations of variables resampling techniques and parametrizations and apply different selection criteria to generate a final model all this to counteract for maxent s known tendency to fit arbitrarily complex models warren and seifert 2011 for example nuñez penichet et al 2021 fitted 4 560 maxent models using raw variables and 880 candidate models using pcs while moo llanes 2021 fitted candidate models using four different strategies of variable selection combined with 17 possible values for the regularization parameters and 29 possible combinations of five feature classes from maxent unlike these studies our modeling framework relied on having two biologically significant environmental variables for the species and a reasonable approximation of its accessible area to arrive to very similar conclusions and no parameter or variable tuning was needed beforehand in the second example our estimates of fundamental niches were used to test the hypothesis of niche conservatism among closely related species which is about the fundamental niche and predicts low niche differentiation between species over evolutionary time scales peterson et al 1999 we examined six hummingbird species that according to phylogenetic taxonomies belong to different major clades t ruckeri in the hermits phaethornithinae c thalassinus in the mangoes polytmini s sephanoides in the coquettes lophornithini c costae in the bees mellisugini a chianogaster and h leucotis in the emeralds trochilini the clades here were listed starting with the one having the oldest split and following the order in which the splitting continued mcguire et al 2009 hernández baños et al 2014 we compared the estimated fundamental niches ellipses of these six species with respect to the phylogenetic relationships among them and noted that t ruckeri which has the oldest split in the phylogeny had the most different estimated fundamental niche red ellipse in fig 8 among the six species on the other hand the other five species have fundamental niches that are more similar their optimal environmental conditions are close and their elliptical borders intersect significantly 4 1 future directions given that we use the distribution of e m to inform the model about the uneven availability of environmental combinations induced by m the delimitation of m is crucial however there is no unique way to delimit the accessible area of a species barve et al 2011 when outlining m we need to simultaneously consider several factors the natural history of the species its dispersal characteristics the geography of the landscape the time span relevant to the species presence and any environmental changes that occurred during that time span among other things although we do not favor any particular approach as the best method for estimating m we acknowledge that all those factors have an important role in determining its shape as a future work of this research project a thorough analysis comparing different approaches to outlining m and testing their effects in recovering the fundamental niche of a species under the proposed model is needed the presence of geographic sampling biases in primary biodiversity data and the implications of these biases e g decreasing model performance are broadly recognized kadmon et al 2004 meyer et al 2016 here we focused on one specific type of bias that affects the estimation of a fundamental niche however other types of sampling biases such as the accessibility of a site to observers may also affect the estimation of the fundamental niche in such cases we would still use a multivariate normal distribution to represent the hypothesis that the fundamental niche has a simple convex shape but we would modify the way we define the weights in the likelihood function eq 5 for example suppose we want to include the effects of two sources of bias that affect the presence of a species the bias induced by m and the differences in sampling intensity across the landscape due to differences in human accessibility i e accessibility bias if the sources of bias can be considered as independent we can calculate a single general sampling probability distribution to define w x as the product of two probabilities the probability of observing x considering the distribution of points in e m and the probability of observing x considering the accessibility bias we proposed using a kernel to estimate the former and zizka et al 2020 recently developed a method to quantify accessibility biases that could be used to determine the later several other generalizations of our method are possible for example information from physiological experiments could be included if we consider the bayesian approach proposed by jiménez et al 2019 to do so we need to transform the likelihood function eq 5 into a posterior distribution that uses the tolerance ranges obtained from physiological experiments to define the a priori distributions of the parameters μ and σ g 1 μ and g 2 σ respectively as follows 7 f p μ σ d l μ σ d g 1 μ g 2 σ where 8 l μ σ d i 1 n w x i f x i μ σ y e m w y f y μ σ and the function f μ σ is given by eq 3 jiménez et al 2019 also showed how to modify f μ σ to get asymmetrical confidence regions when species that are known to have asymmetrical response curves for the environmental variables under consideration furthermore both the likelihood and the bayesian approaches can be applied in cases where it makes sense to include more than two environmental variables in the delimitation of a species fundamental niche the disadvantage of making these modifications to our proposed model is that they increase the algebraic complexity of the model and the number of parameters to be estimated and more computational power is therefore needed to either maximize the likelihood function or simulate from the posterior distribution 5 conclusions in recent decades we have seen a significant increase in the availability of species presence data and software for ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling at the same time however we have seen a concomitant increase in the number of studies that question important conceptual and methodological aspects of enms austin 2002 jiménez valverde et al 2008 lobo 2008 godsoe 2010 for that reason we agree with jiménez valverde et al 2008 who concluded that the lack of a solid conceptual background endangers the advancement of the field the development and application of enm sdm should be rooted in a firm understanding of the technique s conceptual background we intended to lead by example in this work by explicitly relating the ecological theory to the statistical method that we developed to estimate the fundamental niche of a species it is universal practice in sdm and enm to use the environmental combinations observed at the occurrence sites to fit models if our objective is to use presence data to approximate the fundamental niche it is essential to acknowledge that species presence data come from the realized niche which implies that additional information is needed to determine the whole environmental potential of the species qiao et al 2018 in this study we emphasized that we must account for the sampling bias induced by the available e space in the region of interest we have therefore proposed defining the distribution of environments that are accessible to the species based on the dispersal ability of the species and geographic barriers to dispersal this is a definition of m the geographic area accessible to the species via dispersal sensu peterson et al 2011 but here we

24511,studies that question important conceptual and methodological aspects of the field of ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling have cast doubts on whether it is possible to estimate the fundamental niche of a species using presence only data the main limitation in niche estimation is that presence data come from the realized niche which is only a subset of the fundamental niche most of the existing methods lack the ability to overcome this limitation and therefore fit niches that resemble the realized niche to obtain a more accurate estimate of the fundamental niche we propose using the geographic region that is accessible to a species based on its dispersal ability to determine a sampling distribution in environmental space from which we can quantify the likelihood of observing a particular environmental combination in a sample of presence points we incorporate this sampling distribution into a multivariate normal model i e a mahalanobis distance model by creating a weight function that modifies the probabilities of observing different environmental combinations in a sample of presences this modification accounts for the uneven availability of environmental conditions we show that the parameters of this weighted normal model can be approximated with a maximum likelihood estimation approach and then used to draw ellipsoids confidence regions that represent the fundamental niche of the species we illustrate the application of our model with two worked examples first we use presence data for an invasive species and an accessible area that includes only its native range to evaluate whether the fitted model predicts confirmed establishments of the species outside its native range second we use presence data for closely related species with known accessible areas to demonstrate how the different dispersal abilities of the species constrain a classic mahalanobis distance model overall we show that accounting for the distribution of environmental conditions that are accessible to a species indeed affects the estimation of the ellipsoids used to model its fundamental niche keywords realized niche environmental space presence data weighted distribution dispersal 1 introduction in recent years there has been substantial progress in the fields of ecological niche modeling enm and species distribution modeling sdm guisan et al 2013 however there is still debate about what aspects of the niche are estimated by these methods warren 2012 jiménez valverde et al 2008 lobo 2008 specifically conventional enm sdm approaches that are based on presence only data estimate objects that in the case of enm are between the realized and the fundamental niches peterson et al 2011 or in the case of sdm are between the actual and potential distributions of the species jiménez valverde et al 2008 here we propose a model to estimating fundamental niches that fits biologically realistic shapes and quantifies the availability of climates that are accessible for the species as a way to account for biased presence samples the distinction between the fundamental and the realized niche as proposed by hutchinson 1957 is essential to understand what kind of objects are being estimated by the different correlative statistical models used in enm sdm the fundamental niche of a species is the set of environmental conditions where in the absence of biotic interactions the population growth rate is positive peterson et al 2011 the realized niche is a subset of the fundamental niche that is determined by abiotic factors environmental conditions biotic factors and dispersal limitations soberón 2007 estimating the fundamental niche of a species is of particular importance when using the estimated niche to model species distributions at other times or in different regions such as when using enm sdm to predict the effects of climate change or the spread of invasive species tingley et al 2014 however determining the complete fundamental niche of a species is also substantially more difficult than estimating the realized niche it has being suggested that in principle we should not expect models to predict the fundamental niche unless some supplementary information on it allowing extrapolation beyond the realized niche is used to fit the models qiao et al 2018 in that sense some approaches have incorporated experimental data on the physiology of the species to their models as a source of information from unoccupied regions of the fundamental niche jiménez et al 2019 hoogenboom and connolly 2009 additionally booth 2017 has suggested that for well known tree species different types of occurrences beyond their natural distributions e g commercial forestry trials where competition is reduced can be used as supplementary information on the species climatic requirements the relationship between modeling niches and modeling geographic distributions is mediated by hutchinson s duality colwell and rangel 2009 which is the relationship between environmental and geographic spaces with the right resolution a discrete set of geographic coordinates can be made to have a one to one relationship with a discrete set of environmental vectors soberon and nakamura 2009 aspinall and lees 1994 this fundamental correspondence allows us to move back and forth between modeling niches and modeling geographic distributions as a consequence of hutchinson s duality colwell and rangel 2009 and because species presence data come only from areas currently occupied by a species a sample of presence records may not reflect all the environmental potentiality of a species jiménez valverde et al 2008 lobo 2008 therefore we should acknowledge that a correlative model based solely on presence data will be constrained by the imposed limitations of the set of environments where the species can be observed owens et al 2020 will probably approximate the realized niche soberon and nakamura 2009 failing to acknowledge and somehow include this constraint in a model leads to severe uncertainties and drawbacks when using this models to make predictions lobo 2016 species presence absence data are often spatially biased and noisy we work under the assumption that a cleaning and preparation process to resolve errors precedes the application of enm sdm methods several techniques have been developed for resolving some of the common types of problems in presence data chapman 2005 cobos et al 2018 such as a lack of accuracy in the reported coordinates nomenclatural and taxonomic errors and the presence of geographic or environmental outliers however other types of bias remain in presence data we focus on the implicit bias created when defining the relevant spatial region for a study selecting different study regions produces different sampling universes and the definition of the sampling region is an important part of the specification of a model here we explicitly define an m hypothesis to set the sampling universe as all the sites where we can observe the species as present barve et al 2011 under the biotic abiotic movement bam framework peterson et al 2011 the region m contains all the sites that a species is hypothesized to have been able to reach from some past time via dispersal and migration in geography g space m is usually a connected and continuous set i e a single polygon so we make use of the hutchinson s duality to perform practical computations this set is first converted into a discrete grid of coordinates and then the values for environmental variables at these coordinates are used to build its representation in environmental space e space because the fundamental niche is defined in e space it makes sense to represent our data m hypothesis and presences and models in e space there are two things that we need to consider regarding the relationship among m and the fundamental niche first not all sites in m have the environmental conditions needed to sustain viable populations and it is known that some sites inside m could be sink populations barve et al 2011 second hutchinson s duality permits the establishment of a one to one relationship between coordinates in g space and multidimensional vectors in e space but this relationship does not preserve distance nearby elements in g space are not necessarily nearby in e space and vice versa this creates a serious and mostly ignored problem uniform random sampling in g space does not imply uniform random sampling in e space if the goal of a niche model is to get estimate the fundamental niche using presence only data the empirical distribution of m in e space should therefore be incorporated in the statistical model to account for the uneven distribution of available sampling points in a previous contribution jiménez et al 2019 we proposed a bayesian argument for combining correlative techniques with information from physiological experiments to approximate to the fundamental niche of a species however in that work we disregarded the problem of heterogeneity of e space that is why here we consider that event of observing an environmental combination x r d where the species was recorded as present has a non uniform probability of being included in the sample in a typical random sampling scenario on the random variable x with a probability density function pdf f x θ the probability of selection is the same for each environmental combination regardless of the value of x the pdf at x is therefore f x θ in contrast under a biased sampling scenario on x the probability of selecting x is proportional to a predetermined weight function w x implying that the pdf at the observation x is no longer f x θ we propose a method of determining w x and the resulting pdf under biased sampling which we then use to estimate a species fundamental niche when f x θ is a multivariate normal density i e a density based on the exponential of the negative mahalanobis distance we illustrate the application of our proposed statistical model with two worked examples in the first example we estimate the fundamental niche of the asian giant hornet vespa mandarinia an invasive species recorded in europe there is a single report in this region and recently documented in the united states and canada wilson et al 2020 we first use presence records and an m hypothesis that only includes the native range east and south asia mainland southeast asia and far east russia of the hornet to fit a convex shape an ellipsoid as a model of the fundamental niche we then evaluate the fitted model using the presence records from the invaded regions in the second example we again use ellipsoids presence records and species specific m hypotheses to demonstrate how different m scenarios constrain a classic mahalanobis distance model clark et al 1993 farber and kadmon 2003 for different hummingbird species we identify m scenarios under which we expect the mahalanobis distance model to deviate from the fundamental niche and instead be closer to the realized niche of a species 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling approach our aim was to account for the structure of the environmental space when attempting to estimate a fundamental niche to address this problem we follow austin 2002 who suggested the inclusion of three major components in any modeling procedure in ecology 1 an ecological model that describes the ecological assumptions to be incorporated into the analysis and the ecological theory to be tested 2 a statistical model that includes the statistical theory and methods used and 3 a data model that accounts for how the data were collected or measured the ecological model described in the following section includes a detailed definition of the fundamental niche as a function of both fitness and the relationship between fitness and the combinations of environmental conditions in which a species has been observed the statistical model and the data model are addressed in subsequent sections 2 1 1 the ecological model relevant concepts in the study of the fundamental niche the fundamental niche of a species n f is the set of all environmental conditions that permit the species to exist hutchinson 1957 peterson et al 2011 let e r d be a d dimensional environmental space influencing fitness measured for example as the finite rate of increase in a demographic response function furthermore define a function λ x e r that relates each environmental combination x e to fitness pulliam 2000 jiménez et al 2019 if the fitness function has the right shape there is a value of fitness λ m i n that can be interpreted as minimum survivorship and defines the border of the fundamental niche jiménez et al 2019 etherington and omondiagbe 2019 in other words λ m i n is the threshold above which the fitness is high enough to support a population any combination of environmental values that results in a fitness lower than λ m i n is outside the fundamental niche n f x e λ x λ m i n notice that using this notation λ μ λ m a x assumptions about the shape of a species response to an environmental variable i e the shape of the fitness function are central to any predictive modeling effort austin 2002 soberón and peterson 2019 we assume that the contour surfaces of the fitness function λ and therefore the boundary of the fundamental niche is convex drake 2015 we specifically model these level surfaces using ellipsoids in multivariate space maguire 1973 brown 1984 jiménez et al 2019 because these surfaces are simple and manageable convex sets defined by 1 a vector μ that indicates the position of the optimal environmental conditions the center of the ellipsoid and 2 a covariance matrix σ that defines the size and orientation of the ellipsoid in e these two parameters can also be interpreted as the parameters of a multivariate normal density function f x μ σ in which the corresponding random variable x represents a combination environmental conditions in e where the species could be recorded as present jiménez et al 2019 these ellipsoids are also known as mahalanobis distance models farber and kadmon 2003 because the mahalanobis distance defined by μ and σ is equivalent to the quadratic form that defines f x μ σ ellipsoids representing the niche have been used to test the niche center hypothesis osorio olvera et al 2020 which predicts that the closer an environmental combination is to the vector μ the higher the suitability value associated with that combination and therefore the higher the abundance of the species there we transform fitness values λ x by calculating f x μ ˆ σ ˆ f μ ˆ μ ˆ σ ˆ where μ ˆ and σ ˆ are estimates of μ and σ respectively which produces a value between 0 and 1 that can be interpreted as a suitability index for the environmental combination x the central assumption here is that there is a monotonic transformation between λ x and f x μ σ in the sense that high values of fitness near λ m a x correspond to high suitability values near μ we can therefore work with the normal model to delimit the environmental requirements of a species and test the niche center hypothesis other central concepts in the study of the fundamental niche are the existing niche jackson and overpeck 2000 and the realized niche hutchinson 1957 which are each subsets of the fundamental niche the existing niche represents the existing climatic conditions in the study region and the realized niche represents the subset of the fundamental niche that a species occupies as a result of biotic interactions with other species we assume that the following relationships between three niche concepts the fundamental niche n f the existing niche n t m and the realized niche n r are fulfilled peterson et al 2011 peterson and soberón 2012 1 n f n f e t n t m n r t m these relationships are illustrated in fig 1 for a hypothetical species and constitute our ecological model in theory every environmental combination inside the fundamental niche ellipse is suitable for the species and if the species can reach a site with those environmental conditions it could persist there indefinitely in the absence of biotic factors such as predators however at a given time t only a discrete subset of the environmental combinations that can be mapped into e space exist in geographic space this subset constitutes the existing niche of the species note that this set of environmental combinations which are contiguous points in e space are divided across different regions when represented in geographic space some of the points are in north america purple points and others are in south america green points species have dispersal limitations that may prevent them from colonizing all the environments in their existing niche thus if a species is native to north america and is only able to reach the area shaded in orange henceforth m then i its realized niche will be a subset of purple points because they are suitable environments that the species has access to and ii the set of green points constitutes its potential niche because they are suitable environments that are not accessible to the species there is therefore only a discrete set of environmental combinations from the fundamental niche that is available to the species and we expect to observe higher abundances of the species in the environmental conditions that both exist and are close to the center of the fundamental niche ellipse 2 1 2 the statistical and data models two stage sampling given a sample of environmental conditions where the species has been observed as present d x 1 x n we propose a likelihood function for the parameters that describe the fundamental niche of the species θ μ σ suppose that the environmental space e is defined by d environmental variables i e d e r d and each point x i in e space has d coordinates if e were a uniform grid of points embedded in r d then the sample of conditions in which a species is present d could be considered to be a random sample of a multivariate normal variable with the density function 2 f x θ 2 π d 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 x μ t σ 1 x μ this density function could theoretically be used to define a likelihood function and estimate μ and σ this is unfortunately not the case for two main reasons first the environmental combinations that exist currently on the planet do not represent a uniform sample taken from the whole multivariate space e because huthinson s duality does not preserve distances if we take a uniform grid in geographic space and map it into environmental space the resulting cloud of points will be concentrated in select regions leaving other regions empty as seen in fig 1 second species occurrences can only come from e m or the set of environmental combinations associated with all the sites in the region that is accessible to the species m the irregular shape of e m induces a sampling bias such that the probability of recording the species as present in an environmental combination is no longer given directly by f x μ σ as these probabilities are affected by the availability of environmental conditions in e m to account for the sampling bias induced by e m suppose that when the event x x occurs i e when the species is recorded as present at a site with these environmental conditions the probability of observing it changes depending on the observed x we represent this probability by w x the set of observed environmental combinations d can therefore be considered as a random sample of the random variable x w with probability density function 3 f w x μ σ w x f x μ σ e w x where e w x w x f x μ σ d x note that f w is an example of a weighted density function in which e w x is the normalizing factor making the total probability function equal to unity patil and ord 1976 patil and rao 1978 lele and keim 2006 patil and rao 1978 call this normalizing factor the visibility factor which captures the idea that samples from e are not uniform the observed species presences can only come from e m the visible set of environmental combinations which may include regions in r d where the environmental combinations are abundant associated to high values of w x but even though the points inside these abundant regions might not be close to μ i e where f x μ σ is small the probability of observing the species in these points could be higher than the probability associated to other points closer to μ i e where f x μ σ is large that do not exist in e m they are not visible or whose weight w x is too small on the other hand eq 3 can also be described as the model resulting from a two stage sampling design that accounts for the random process under which an environmental combination x d is observed patil and rao 1978 suppose that nature produces a sample of size n of environmental conditions inside the fundamental niche with probabilities of being observed given by the density function f x μ σ this sample may contain any point in e because the species not only requires the right abiotic conditions to maintain a population but also needs specific biotic conditions and can only disperse to a finite set of sites the recorded sample will not include all the n observations instead only a subsample of size n n is selected by drawing observations from the original sample of size n with a probabilities proportional to w x without loss of generality let us illustrate this two stage sampling design using the fundamental niche described in the bidimensional environmental space shown in fig 1 suppose that a species fundamental niche is defined by a bivariate normal distribution with parameters 4 μ 1 0 38 1 85 σ 1 0 0412 0 0366 0 0366 0 075 the level curves of the corresponding density function f x μ 1 σ 1 are ellipses they are plotted in the left panel of fig 2 where the largest ellipse corresponds to the 99 confidence region in the first stage of the sampling process we generate a sample of size n 100 from within the fundamental niche and plot this sample on top of the ellipses as expected most of the environmental combinations in this sample are close to the center of the ellipses green points inside the ellipses plotted in the left panel of fig 2 the middle panel of fig 2 shows all the environmental combinations that exist inside the region that is accessible to the species e m which are indicated by purple and orange points in both fig 1 and fig 2 we identified the subset of points that both exist in e m and are inside the 99 confidence region of f x μ σ and colored them purple we then estimated the density function of the accessible environments h ˆ e m using a kernel method the resulting level curves of h ˆ e m correspond to the orange regions in the middle panel of fig 2 we used h ˆ e m to define the weights w x h ˆ x e m which were used in the second stage of the sampling process based on the assumption that not all the n 100 points from the original sample exist in e m the second sampling stage involved selecting a subsample of size n 25 from the first sample of n 100 environments from the fundamental niche the resulting sample d x 1 x n is shown in the right panel of fig 2 purple triangles note that if we use a simple likelihood approach based on the simulated sample to estimate the parameters μ 1 and σ 1 which is equivalent to fitting a mahalanobis distance model we recover a 99 confidence ellipse violet ellipse in the right panel of fig 2 that is smaller than the theoretical fundamental niche of our species largest green ellipse in the right panel of fig 2 more importantly the estimated center of this ellipse does not coincide with the optimal environmental conditions μ 1 therefore if we estimate the parameters that describe the fundamental niche of the species without accounting for the distribution of available environments we cannot claim that the model fully recovers the species fundamental niche moreover if we attempt to test the niche center hypothesis using an ellipse recovered from a mahalanobis distance model we will expect high abundances around an environmental combination that is not the true optimum with respect to the application of the two stage sampling method we assume that the sample of environmental combinations where the species of interest was observed as present d is a random sample of the random variable x w with a probability density function given by eq 3 we can therefore define the likelihood function of the parameters of interest θ μ σ as follows 5 l θ d i 1 n f w x θ i 1 n w x f x θ e w x where the function w x is approximated using all the environmental combinations accessible to the species along with a kernel density procedure and we obtain a monte carlo estimate for the expected value e w x which was defined as an integral see eq 3 note that the function w x does not depend on the parameters of interest and can be ignored when maximizing the log likelihood function furthermore because the analytical form of w x is unknown the analytical form of e w x is also unknown however we can sample environmental combinations from the availability distribution by randomly choosing sites inside m and extracting the values of the environmental variables at those sampled sites using this sample we can obtain monte carlo estimates of e w x for any fixed value of θ this method has been used before in the statistical modeling literature and is called the method of simulated maximum likelihood robert and casella 1999 lele and keim 2006 we can use this method to obtain a monte carlo estimate of the log likelihood function as follows 6 ℓ θ d i 1 n log f w x i θ i 1 n log f w x i θ log 1 k j 1 k f w x j θ where x j j 1 2 k is a random sample that was sampled with replacement from the distribution w x the size of this sample k must be large enough to ignore monte carlo error once this sample is generated we can apply standard optimization techniques to minimize the negative log likelihood function in eq 6 and obtain the maximum likelihood estimators μ ˆ and σ ˆ in summary our proposed modeling procedure uses a sample of occurrences for the species of interest together with polygons that represent the geographic areas accessible to the species inside these polygons we extract environmental values from sites chosen at random this is done with two different purposes 1 to estimate a kernel density used to define the weights in the likelihood function and 2 to obtain a monte carlo estimate of the log likelihood function once we have all the elements of the likelihood function we calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters μ ˆ and σ ˆ these estimated parameters will allow us to plot ellipses in e space that represent the border of the estimated fundamental niche in all the examples we show we plot the ellipses that correspond to the 99 confidence regions of the fitted multivariate normal distribution we compare these ellipses to the ones that correspond to the 99 confidence region of a standard mahalanobis distance model farber and kadmon 2003 with estimated parameters μ ˆ 0 1 n i 1 n x i and σ ˆ 0 1 n i 1 n x i μ ˆ 0 x i μ ˆ 0 t i e the maximum likelihood estimates under a multivariate normal model described in eq 2 we hypothesized that the two ellipses will be similar in cases where e m covers most of the fundamental niche of the species i e the overlap between these two sets is high and the distribution of points in e m is approximately uniform finally we project the resulting models back to geographic space once we have the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of interest θ ˆ we use the multivariate normal density function given in eq 2 to calculate a suitability index that can be plotted in g space as either a continuous value or a binary region defined by a threshold for interpretation purposes it is convenient to standardize this suitability index to the interval 0 1 which is easily done by dividing f x θ by its maximum value f μ ˆ θ ˆ 2 2 data using our method to approximate fundamental niches requires three types of data i species occurrence data which should go through a standard process of detecting and removing inaccurate records before being used see cobos et al 2018 for an example of this ii an m hypothesis or geographic polygon that encloses all the sites accessible to the species taking into consideration the dispersal ability of the species and natural geographic barriers and iii environmental layers cropped to the study area from which we can extract environmental data for the occurrences and for the sites inside m in the following sections we describe the datasets that we used to create our worked examples 2 2 1 occurrence data we selected seven species to illustrate the use of the statistical model that we present here the first species is the asian giant hornet vespa mandarinia matsuura and sakagami 1973 matsuura 1988 because v mandarinia is an invasive species using it in our model can provide valuable insight into whether the niche estimated by our model is a good approximation of a true fundamental niche in other words we test whether the estimated fundamental niche contains the locations that this species has been able to invade we also selected six species of hummingbirds for a separate analysis amazilia chionogaster threnetes ruckeri sephanoides sephanoides basilinna leucotis colibri thalassinus and calypte costae these species were used because detailed m hypotheses are available for them the occurrence data for v mandarinia was obtained from the global biodiversity information facility gbif database https www gbif org we downloaded 1944 occurrence records for gbif 2020 which after undergoing a standard cleaning procedure cobos et al 2018 were reduced to 170 presence records in the species native range and one presence record in europe to avoid introducing an extra source of bias anderson 2012 the cleaned dataset was spatially thinned by geographic distance at least 50 km away resulting in a final sample of 46 presence records that were used to fit the niche models see red points in fig 3 for the hummingbird species we used the cleaned occurrence records that were used by cooper and soberón 2018 which are available at https github com jacobccooper trochilidae and whose original source is also gbif cooper and soberón thoroughly revised and cleaned these presence records and eliminated misidentified individuals and synonyms they additionally defined the regions that were accessible to most of the extant hummingbird species and used those regions to fit species distribution models given the success of cooper and soberón at using these m hypothesis we believed their data provided a great opportunity to test our proposed model fig 4 shows the presence data of each hummingbird species the sample sizes range from 148 observations for a chionogaster to 926 presences for c costae we selected these six species because they occupy different regions of the americas from the southern united states to the patagonia given this wide geographic range we believed it would be interesting to compare the estimated niches of all the species in e space and evaluate how similar or different the optimal environmental conditions are among the different species although the different species are likely to occupy different regions of e space we suspected that their fundamental niches might share some environmental combinations niche overlap 2 2 2 m hypothesis in the case of v mandarinia we defined the area accessible to the species as a combination of buffers that represent the species dispersal ability and the elevation range where the species is known to occur 850 1900 m first we identified the region delineated by a buffer of 500 km around all occurrence records in the sample which accounts for the dispersal ability of the hornets matsuura and sakagami 1973 matsuura 1988 second we clipped this region with an elevation layer to remove regions at elevations higher than 1900 m the resulting polygon is outlined in blue in fig 3 note that this polygon includes some sites not on the continent however we only extracted the environmental values for inland sites within this blue m and did not considered oceanic regions for the hummingbird species we used the polygons generated by cooper and soberón 2018 polygons were hypothesized based on the known species occurrences topography ecoregions and estimated dispersal distances and where bounded by significant geographical barriers such as large rivers and mountains by doing so they took into account all the criteria that are know to yield more accurate models barve et al 2011 owens et al 2013 2020 saupe et al 2012 fig 4 shows the six polygons for the different species note that some species like t ruckeri occupy most of their accessible area fig 4 b whereas others like b leucotis and c costae occupy only a fraction of it in addition there is wide diversity in range sizes with s sephanoides having a more restricted range compared to c thalassinus given this geographic variation among species we were interested in making similar comparisons in e space 2 2 3 environmental variables the climatic layers used to create the models for each species came from the worldclim database hijmans et al 2005 which provides open access to bioclimatic layers built with monthly average measurements for the period 1970 2020 we used only two of the 19 variables available in this database annual mean temperature bio1 and annual precipitation bio12 both variables were recorded at 10 arcmin resolution we clipped each climatic layer using the polygons that correspond to the m hypotheses for each species these two climatic variables were selected because they are known to be biologically meaningful for both the asian hornet and the selected hummingbird species root 1988 specifically it has being documented that the wasps of the genus vespula have high endothermic capacity which benefits their thermoregulatory efficiency allowing them at the same time to survive to broad temperature ranges käfer et al 2012 furthermore other studies suggest that the queens of this genus prefer green environments such as agricultural and forested areas or parks kim et al 2020 whose presence is highly correlated with the amount of rainfall in the area furthermore in the case of the hummingbirds we wanted to compare their estimated niches because comparisons of estimated niches in e spaces with different axes and or dimensions are not possible we only looked at these two dimensions of their niches all analyses were performed in r version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 we used several existing packages for data preparation analysis and visualization ggplot2 wickham 2016 ks duong 2020 raster hijmans 2020 rgdal bivand et al 2020 rgeos bivand and rundel 2019 scales wickham and seidel 2020 sf pebesma 2018 we additionally created new functions that can be used to reproduce our examples and apply our methodology to other species these functions can be found at https github com laurajim nf model with m 3 results 3 1 estimated fundamental niche of vespa mandarinia we randomly sampled 10 000 sites inside the accessible native region of the asian giant hornet shown in fig 3 and extracted their environmental values e m so we could plot them in e space the resulting set e m is shown in fig 5 as a cloud of points in the background gray open circles we used this e m and the 46 presence records of v mandarinia red points in fig 5 to determine the log likelihood function eq 6 of the parameters that describes its fundamental niche under the weighted normal model θ μ σ we maximized this log likelihood function to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates mles μ ˆ and σ ˆ for comparison we also used the 46 presence records only to obtain mles using the mahalanobis distance model μ ˆ 0 and σ ˆ 0 the resulting mles for both models are given in table 1 and the corresponding 99 confidence regions are plotted in fig 5 the mles of μ the optimal environmental conditions estimated by both the weighted normal model and the mahalanobis distance model are highly similar purple and red squares in fig 5 however the models predicted different limits for the fundamental niche of v mandarinia specifically the estimated n f is larger under the mahalanobis distance model purple ellipse in fig 5 whereas the variance predicted by the weighted normal model for annual precipitation is smaller as shown in table 1 nevertheless both estimated ellipses contain 45 out of the 46 initial presence points and they contain all the records from the locations outside the native range of v mandarinia blue points in fig 5 the presences from the invaded regions are not close to the center of the ellipses but they are placed in a region of e m where the environmental combinations are well represented in g space we calculated a standardized suitability index for the asian giant hornet using the mles from the weighted normal model and eq 2 using this index we created a worldwide suitability map fig 6 to visually assess if there are regions where v mandarinia could theoretically establish based solely on the species environmental requirements as shown in fig 6 the pacific coast of the northern united states and southern canada where the species has already been confirmed has a low to moderate suitability index similarly most of europe has a low to moderate suitability particularly around the one site where the species was already recorded additional maps that are focused more closely on the west coast of north america europe and the native range of v mandarinia are provided in the supplementary material we also note that there are other regions within the americas that appear highly suitable for v mandarinia such as the eastern united states the mountain ranges of mexico and the andes and the brazilian and ethiopian highlands 3 2 estimated fundamental niches of hummingbird species in the case of the six hummingbird species that we chose for our analysis the accessible areas m and the presence records were in different regions of g space but also of e space the corresponding e m and presence points therefore occupied different regions see gray clouds of points in fig 7 using the m hypothesis and the presences we estimated the parameters μ and σ which describe the fundamental niche of each species using both the mahalanobis distance model and the weighted normal model the resulting mles for each species are given in table 2 unlike the v mandarinia example the weighted normal model predicted broader fundamental niches for most of the studied hummingbirds except for c thalassinus the estimated centers of the ellipses μ ˆ 0 and μ ˆ and their orientation with respect to the axes were similar for a chionogaster and b leucotis however there was a clear difference between the centers of the estimated ellipses for the t ruckeri s sephanoides c thalassinus and c costae for all the hummingbird species both the mahalanobis distance and the weighed normal models agreed on the sign of the covariance between the two environmental variables used to describe and compare the fundamental niches the estimated ellipses for s sephanoides were the most different with respect to the magnitude of the estimated covariance between the two environmental variables we additionally noted that with the exception of c thalassinus the ellipses obtained with the weighted normal model contained more presence points than the ellipses obtained from a simple mahalanobis distance model it is also worth noting that under the mahalanobis distance model the estimated optimum temperature for four of the six hummingbird species was between 16 and 18 degrees celsius see table 2 the mahalanobis distance model thus predicts that the species temperature optima are not substantially different among these species even though they differ in their precipitation optima however under the weighted normal model the estimated optimum temperatures were clearly different among all the species see fig 8 4 discussion the calibration region limits the presence of a species to a discrete set of environmental combinations and the probabilities of sampling different environments from this set are not uniform using kernel methods we modeled this non uniform e space and used the kernel as a weight function in a multivariate normal model which we then applied to estimating the fundamental niche of a species of interest our main result is that accounting for the shape of the e space defined by an m indeed affects the estimation of the ellipsoids we use to model fundamental niches we illustrated the application of our proposed method with first the asian giant hornet vespa mandarinia invasive to north america the ellipse fitted with our model which represents the border of the fundamental niche of v mandarinia contained the sites outside the species native range where the species has being reported see red dots in fig 5 moreover our results agree with other modeling exercises in predicting a low to moderate suitability for the pacific northwest coast of the united states and canada and over europe nuñez penichet et al 2021 norderud et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 alaniz et al 2021 moo llanes 2021 as well as on identifying a significant proportion of the east coast of the united states as an area of high concern fig 6 studies that have adopted maxent as their modeling framework often have to fit a large set of candidate models using different combinations of variables resampling techniques and parametrizations and apply different selection criteria to generate a final model all this to counteract for maxent s known tendency to fit arbitrarily complex models warren and seifert 2011 for example nuñez penichet et al 2021 fitted 4 560 maxent models using raw variables and 880 candidate models using pcs while moo llanes 2021 fitted candidate models using four different strategies of variable selection combined with 17 possible values for the regularization parameters and 29 possible combinations of five feature classes from maxent unlike these studies our modeling framework relied on having two biologically significant environmental variables for the species and a reasonable approximation of its accessible area to arrive to very similar conclusions and no parameter or variable tuning was needed beforehand in the second example our estimates of fundamental niches were used to test the hypothesis of niche conservatism among closely related species which is about the fundamental niche and predicts low niche differentiation between species over evolutionary time scales peterson et al 1999 we examined six hummingbird species that according to phylogenetic taxonomies belong to different major clades t ruckeri in the hermits phaethornithinae c thalassinus in the mangoes polytmini s sephanoides in the coquettes lophornithini c costae in the bees mellisugini a chianogaster and h leucotis in the emeralds trochilini the clades here were listed starting with the one having the oldest split and following the order in which the splitting continued mcguire et al 2009 hernández baños et al 2014 we compared the estimated fundamental niches ellipses of these six species with respect to the phylogenetic relationships among them and noted that t ruckeri which has the oldest split in the phylogeny had the most different estimated fundamental niche red ellipse in fig 8 among the six species on the other hand the other five species have fundamental niches that are more similar their optimal environmental conditions are close and their elliptical borders intersect significantly 4 1 future directions given that we use the distribution of e m to inform the model about the uneven availability of environmental combinations induced by m the delimitation of m is crucial however there is no unique way to delimit the accessible area of a species barve et al 2011 when outlining m we need to simultaneously consider several factors the natural history of the species its dispersal characteristics the geography of the landscape the time span relevant to the species presence and any environmental changes that occurred during that time span among other things although we do not favor any particular approach as the best method for estimating m we acknowledge that all those factors have an important role in determining its shape as a future work of this research project a thorough analysis comparing different approaches to outlining m and testing their effects in recovering the fundamental niche of a species under the proposed model is needed the presence of geographic sampling biases in primary biodiversity data and the implications of these biases e g decreasing model performance are broadly recognized kadmon et al 2004 meyer et al 2016 here we focused on one specific type of bias that affects the estimation of a fundamental niche however other types of sampling biases such as the accessibility of a site to observers may also affect the estimation of the fundamental niche in such cases we would still use a multivariate normal distribution to represent the hypothesis that the fundamental niche has a simple convex shape but we would modify the way we define the weights in the likelihood function eq 5 for example suppose we want to include the effects of two sources of bias that affect the presence of a species the bias induced by m and the differences in sampling intensity across the landscape due to differences in human accessibility i e accessibility bias if the sources of bias can be considered as independent we can calculate a single general sampling probability distribution to define w x as the product of two probabilities the probability of observing x considering the distribution of points in e m and the probability of observing x considering the accessibility bias we proposed using a kernel to estimate the former and zizka et al 2020 recently developed a method to quantify accessibility biases that could be used to determine the later several other generalizations of our method are possible for example information from physiological experiments could be included if we consider the bayesian approach proposed by jiménez et al 2019 to do so we need to transform the likelihood function eq 5 into a posterior distribution that uses the tolerance ranges obtained from physiological experiments to define the a priori distributions of the parameters μ and σ g 1 μ and g 2 σ respectively as follows 7 f p μ σ d l μ σ d g 1 μ g 2 σ where 8 l μ σ d i 1 n w x i f x i μ σ y e m w y f y μ σ and the function f μ σ is given by eq 3 jiménez et al 2019 also showed how to modify f μ σ to get asymmetrical confidence regions when species that are known to have asymmetrical response curves for the environmental variables under consideration furthermore both the likelihood and the bayesian approaches can be applied in cases where it makes sense to include more than two environmental variables in the delimitation of a species fundamental niche the disadvantage of making these modifications to our proposed model is that they increase the algebraic complexity of the model and the number of parameters to be estimated and more computational power is therefore needed to either maximize the likelihood function or simulate from the posterior distribution 5 conclusions in recent decades we have seen a significant increase in the availability of species presence data and software for ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling at the same time however we have seen a concomitant increase in the number of studies that question important conceptual and methodological aspects of enms austin 2002 jiménez valverde et al 2008 lobo 2008 godsoe 2010 for that reason we agree with jiménez valverde et al 2008 who concluded that the lack of a solid conceptual background endangers the advancement of the field the development and application of enm sdm should be rooted in a firm understanding of the technique s conceptual background we intended to lead by example in this work by explicitly relating the ecological theory to the statistical method that we developed to estimate the fundamental niche of a species it is universal practice in sdm and enm to use the environmental combinations observed at the occurrence sites to fit models if our objective is to use presence data to approximate the fundamental niche it is essential to acknowledge that species presence data come from the realized niche which implies that additional information is needed to determine the whole environmental potential of the species qiao et al 2018 in this study we emphasized that we must account for the sampling bias induced by the available e space in the region of interest we have therefore proposed defining the distribution of environments that are accessible to the species based on the dispersal ability of the species and geographic barriers to dispersal this is a definition of m the geographic area accessible to the species via dispersal sensu peterson et al 2011 but here we

24512,a need was identified to have reliable quantitative wind pattern data for marion island mi in the study of terrestrial ecology fauna and flora on this well preserved and remote territory in the sub antarctic indian ocean the present work aims to estimate a high resolution map of wind speed direction and turbulence on mi through the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd an engineering based discipline for modelling fluid physics this paper presents the comparison between experimental measurements and numerical simulation results of the full scale atmospheric flow around mi and its closely neighbouring prince edward island pei in particular a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach was used with a k ɛ turbulence closure model adapted to atmospheric boundary layer flows this was implemented in the ansys fluent 2019r3 software and validated against wind measurements recorded over the span of two years a 26 9 mean absolute error was seen when predicting wind speed a 14 8 error when predicting wind direction and a 32 6 error when predicting turbulent kinetic energy the baseline cfd model provides future researchers on mi with a reliable means of estimating wind properties near ground level quantities such as average wind speed turbulence gusting and annual wind behaviour can now be recreated at any location on the island something that was not previously possible without environmentally intrusive surveillance methods this research has refined cfd modelling for islands and highlights the potential for the application of this methodology to estimate

a critical role in shaping ecosystems ennos 1997 wind or the motion of atmospheric air is a climatic phenomenon known to cause erosion of geological land forms induce wind driven currents in bodies of water and serve as an important transport mechanism for abiotic matter and genetic material chau et al 2019 hedding et al 2015 blanchet et al 2008 cózar et al 2005 breshears et al 2003 plants in particular have been cited for their reliance on wind for pollination which makes changing wind patterns as a result of climate change an ongoing concern friedman and barrett 2009 nathan et al 2011 further to this wind exerts mechanical and physiological stresses on both plants and animals from abrasion of leaves which increases moisture loss to breaking of branches and stems under high load de langre 2008 kim and manuel 2016 faster loss of body heat in endotherms and greater energy expenditure for any organisms trying to be active in windy environments gilbert et al 2010 liechti 2006 gardiner et al 2016 bang et al 2010 thus the importance of wind as an ecological factor is well acknowledged although an understanding of the fundamental influence of wind may be lacking onoda and anten 2011 it is difficult to collect or model wind data at biologically meaningful resolutions and broad enough extent especially in cases where the placement of a wind sensor would directly interfere with the ecological system being studied pearce higgins et al 2012 in order to include the influence of wind in their study on seed dispersal somerville et al 2019 described an empirical equation for wind behaviour based on various environmental parameters measured within their field although empirical models are useful for studying the effects of wind on biota mechanistic modelling of dispersal agents is seen as the ultimate goal for ecologists since the underlying physical processes are simulated in order to predict dispersal patterns bullock et al 2017 this in turn relieves the effort required to measure dispersal directly in the field bullock et al 2006 atmospheric flow patterns over complex landscapes are of great interest in worldwide engineering studies since they are crucial to the success of wind energy harvesting projects and safety in design of structures and buildings carrying human lives see blocken 2014 and references therein atmospheric flows also have engineering importance in urban climate and pollutant transport applications to this end computational fluid dynamics cfd is widely used to numerically model the atmospheric boundary layer abl and all its physical mechanisms the cfd method supplements sparse wind measurement campaigns since masts are expensive to erect and their location is limited by various factors especially where complex terrain is concerned berge et al 2006 when paired with field quantified wind data wind characteristics can be estimated with cfd over terrain where no masts have been erected 1 1 study system marion island mi is introduced as the main focus of the current study mi and its neighbour prince edward island pei are two small volcanic islands in the sub antarctic southern ocean together known as the prince edward islands south africa these sub antarctic islands are an important meteorological and biological conservation landmark especially for the south african national antarctic programme sanap and the south african government covering a total area of circa 29 000 hectares and located at 46 5 4 4 5 s 37 4 4 3 7 e some 1769 km south east of the south african coast mi lies in the heart of the southern latitudes known as the roaring forties the prince edward islands are one such landscape in which it is known that high wind velocities have a significant impact on both the biotic and abiotic systems in the region chown and froneman 2008 because the southern indian ocean is so vast and mostly uninterrupted by land pelagic animals flock to these sub antarctic islands to breed and moult crawford et al 2008 hofmeyr et al 2006 schoombie et al 2016 although the prince edward islands and most sub antarctic islands are detached from broader human activity they are still subject to the worldwide effects of climate change presenting them as a rich environment for investigating the impacts of climate change under minimal influence from human factors boelhouwers 2003 hedding et al 2006 since only the dominant wind direction of the general atmospheric wind is known from weather and satellite data not much can be said about topographical wind conditions at ground level the mi research base is an outpost for the south african weather service saws home to a single meteorological mast which has been in operation since circa 1948 historical data from this station over 60 years has led to the finding that the majority of the winds in the region are strong westerlies courtesy of saws 2020 the meteorological mast stands 10 metres above ground level agl on the north eastern coastline in the lee of the dominant wind conditions given its leeward position measurements recorded at the mast are unlikely to be representative of fine scale wind conditions around the entire island le roux 2008 there have been research investigations taking place on mi both ecological and geological which have reached conclusions that must necessarily neglect the impacts of local fine scale wind on the systems under study due to this lack of empirical evidence chau et al 2019 hedding et al 2015 chown and froneman 2008 however in conducting a small scale cfd analysis combrinck et al 2020 have recently concluded that wind scouring and deposition patterns may have marked effects on the growth of azorella selago the most widespread plant species on the island based on the success of combrinck et al 2020 and the need for reliable wind estimates this work attempts to answer the simple question is cfd an effective tool for determining ecologically meaningful wind patterns across the full extent of mi a large and complex study domain relative isolation from other land masses the next nearest occurrence of land is the crozet islands france 950 km to the east makes mi an interesting candidate for a large scale cfd investigation the same methods used by engineers to evaluate potential wind energy farming sites may be applied here under a different context rather than modelling the wind to determine energy resource for a wind farming operation motivation behind the current work is to aid future ecological research by providing biologically meaningful fine scale wind estimates on mi under several plausible prevailing atmospheric wind conditions the consequence of such a study is a remedy for the current lack of quantitative data required to draw conclusions about the impacts of wind on the island ecology an important empirical foundation for future work the successful application of cfd to mechanistically model wind on mi also promotes similar cross disciplinary research at other biologically important locations globally detailed measurement and simulation programs of a similar nature have been performed on other isolated hills and islands with documented success isle of arran grant et al 2016 thielen et al 2002 askervein hill raithby et al 1987 undheim et al 2006 and bolund island bechmann et al 2007a 2009 berg et al 2011 although the size of mi is larger than that of these studies they have validated the applicability of modelling an idealised neutrally stable abl over suitably complex terrain research at the technical university of denmark dtu has played a pivotal role in the current study in particular the work surrounding bolund island and the experimental vs computational wind modelling campaign offered a useful preliminary case study for evaluating the methods used later in this article importantly the idea of placing masts in line with dominant wind has been transferred to the mi wind measurement campaign see section 2 1 as it offers the best chance of capturing advancing wind patterns transcending the need for purely theoretical applications in ecological academia the outcome of the current study has further real world impact for a planned island wide mouse eradication program a growing population of invasive house mice have become increasingly destructive to the surviving local fauna on mi requiring an urgent eradication preston et al 2019 parkes 2014 has suggested that an aerial baiting technique using helicopters would be the most effective method of eradicating the mice although this has been successfully achieved at similar locations under threats of invasive species preston et al 2019 a local knowledge of wind patterns on mi itself would be especially helpful in planning and coordinating helicopter flight operations and optimised bait distribution strategies 1 2 overview this investigation is summarised in fig 1 and involves performing an on site wind measurement campaign a and developing and testing a cfd model for the abl b using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and a standard k ɛ turbulence model schlichting 1979 after systematic simulation the abl model is then validated c against a set of time series wind data captured by an array of meteorological masts around mi finally sources of error between the model and observed measurements are identified and discussed so as to improve our understanding for future work output spatially explicit simulation data are then available for subsequent ecological studies d 2 materials and methods 2 1 wind data collection wind data were collected from april 2018 until march 2020 at 17 locations around mi using sonic anemometers wind measurement stations fig 2 consist of two gill windsonic two dimensional 2d ultrasonic anemometers a solar panel and a portable logging device since the anemometers are only capable of 2d readings in a horizontal plane all were installed facing true north and horizontally levelled the two anemometers per station are offset one capturing data at a height of 1 metre while the other is mounted at 0 5 metres high and off to one side to minimise recording wind interference caused by the centre mast the wind was sampled once every 2 s and averaged wind statistics were periodically saved in 10 min 60 min and 24 h intervals due to the presence of many threatened seabirds on mi and the conservation laws under the prince edward island management plan 2010 no permanent structures were installed to support the anemometers and the maximum height of the stations was limited to 1 metre above ground level most stations were placed near the coastal extremities of mi at lower altitudes emphasis was held on keeping stations in relatively flat areas away from any sharp geographical protrusions or valleys where possible some stations were placed in pairs less than 1 km apart fig 3 so that corresponding time series data could be related across short distances westerly north westerly and south westerly winds have been previously identified as the three dominating wind directions from historical weather data saws 2020 stations were placed roughly along lanes within these directions the saws station is located at the mi research base has been designated as station 0 and the corresponding gps coordinates and station numbers are given in appendix a 2 2 wind data analysis all captured wind measurements were cleaned of erroneous data and sorted into a concise database the wind on marion island wmi dataset dominant westerly north westerly and south westerly winds along with any intermediate sectors wsw wnw etc account for 74 of all wind measured on mi over two years fig 4 due to the firm wind dominance some wind sectors were easier and more meaningful to validate than others thus only the three dominant sectors were chosen as candidates for comparison and validation against cfd simulations adjacent wind sectors were excluded from the analysis as they are too similar to the chosen candidate sectors the underlying assumption is that any outcome from validating the dominant wind sectors could be directly translated to the other sectors with reasonable accuracy typical wind studies would designate a single upwind mast as a reference mast used to determine periods of consistent incoming wind conditions this was not possible in the current campaign as there is no way of safely erecting an upwind mast in the southern ocean a new approach was devised to determine periods of consistent incoming wind conditions in a given sector three mid stream reference stations were chosen table 1 if any two of the three reference stations recorded a matching wind in the appropriate sector the corresponding timestamp was saved the list of timestamps was further distilled by only keeping sets of data where the average wind direction had not changed for two continuous hours or more under these circumstances a steady state incoming wind condition could be assumed across all stations on mi these stations were used as reference points due to their coastal location on the windward side of the island relative to the approaching wind direction preference was given to those stations erected at lower altitudes and isolated from sharp geographical features chosen reference stations are in the best possible position to sample an incoming wind before any interactions with the island interior have taken place 3 theory and calculations a formulation of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was used to simulate the abl in this study due to relatively low computational requirements and well documented best practice guidelines franke et al 2010 the rans method has been presented in depth by versteeg and malalasekera 2007 and has become a common workhorse for many micro scale wind studies over the years see blocken 2014 and references therein wallace and hobbs 2006 and panofsky and dutton 1984 offer a full description of the abl and its associated turbulence modelling approaches likewise manwell et al 2009 have reviewed cfd modelling in the context of wind energy farming relevant theory necessary for describing a cfd model relating specifically to mi is given here 3 1 prevailing climate and geography on marion island mi is roughly 25 km long through its longest axis by 16 km wide and reaches a peak elevation of 1242 metres above sea level covering an area of 290 km 2 pei is far smaller 10 km long by 6 5 km wide and reaching a peak of 672 metres vegetation on mi is categorised by 7 habitat complexes coastal salt spray complex fellfield slope biotic grassland biotic herbfield mire and polar desert smith et al 2001 in all these habitats plants are limited to grasses ferns and other mat or cushion forming species which rarely exceed a height of 30 cm the barren areas on the island typically those above 650 750 m altitude are the typical polar desert characterised by sharp volcanic rocks scoria cones and snow ice fields hedding 2008 the climate around marion island is considered hyper oceanic the atmospheric behaviour is neutrally stratified and predominantly determined by the marine boundary layer rather than thermal buoyancy effects over land mass le roux 2008 garratt 1994 the surrounding waters have a much higher thermal inertia than land and in conjunction with the strong influence of passing frontal systems from the polar region the islands are subject to mild daily temperature fluctuations high humidity and high precipitation le roux 2008 as a consequence of its sub antarctic latitude mi also regularly experiences gale force winds and low incident radiation le roux 2008 3 2 modelling the atmosphere the combination of high wind speeds in the roaring forties and small daily thermal variations in the hyper oceanic environment leads to the assumption that one can ignore atmospheric instability arising from thermal buoyancy effects an average wind climate on mi can then be modelled as a neutrally stratified abl other atmospheric regimes have been excluded the turbulent kinetic energy tke k and its dissipation rate ɛ are accounted for in the simulations using a standard turbulence model launder and spalding 1983 however coefficients of the standard k ɛ model which generally take on fixed values for industrial applications have been modified here to be more applicable to abl simulations katul et al 2004 summarised in table 2 when modelling the full scale abl inertial forces experienced by a parcel of air due to the rotation of the earth must be accounted for koblitz 2013 the coriolis force is a centripetal force acting on a fluid parcel inside earth s rotating frame of reference while the companion centrifugal force is neglected in meteorological applications since the earth s rotational acceleration is approximately time independent kageyama and hyodo 2006 bechmann et al 2007b provide a mathematical description of the coriolis force as it was applied in the current cfd model 3 3 boundary conditions to solve realistic flow scenarios cfd modelling requires the definition of a three dimensional 3d meshed domain and appropriate boundary conditions fig 5 in order to numerically approximate the rans and k ɛ turbulence transport equations when considering the inlet conditions for a neutrally stable abl simulation the wind velocity is generally accepted to follow a logarithmic profile that reduces to zero at ground level due to a no slip contact see section 3 4 between the moving air and the ground wallace and hobbs 2006 richards and norris 2011 analytically derived a set of realistic inlet profiles for velocity magnitude u and turbulence parameters k and ɛ directly from the rans equations they are given as one dimensional functions of height z in eqs 1 3 1 u z u κ ln z z 0 z 0 2 k z u 2 c μ 3 ɛ z u 3 κ z z 0 where u is the surface friction velocity defined by eq 4 schlichting 1979 4 u τ w ρ u is approximately constant in the lowest several metres of the abl the local fluid shear stress at ground level τ w is also approximately constant for a newtonian fluid κ is the von kármán constant κ 0 41 u 0 735 m s was applied as a constant boundary condition at the velocity inlet surface see section 4 z denotes the height above ground level in metres and the quantity z 0 represents an aerodynamic roughness length i e the height above ground at which zero wind speed is present due to flow obstacles such as trees buildings or ground cover the k inlet profile described in eq 2 is only applicable to the lower surface portion of the abl typically no more than the first few hundred metres above ground level richards and norris 2011 as soon as increasing height of the abl is modelled a smooth k profile eq 5 needs to be established which accounts for higher turbulence close to surface level and little to no turbulence in the upper part of the atmosphere where geostrophic winds exhibit near laminar flow crasto 2007 5 k z u 2 c μ 1 z z h 2 z h denotes the depth of the abl the height at which actual and geostrophic winds coincide and above which the wind turbulence becomes minimal while it is difficult to determine an exact boundary layer depth in reality a value was estimated for modelling purposes 6 z h c u f c the value for the constant c ranges from 0 2 to 0 4 for a neutral abl garratt 1994 f c denotes a parameter relating to the coriolis force bechmann et al 2007b 3 4 modelling complex terrain and sea surfaces due to the subsonic and incompressible nature of the flow around mi and pei atmospheric interactions between the two land masses were expected and thus both islands had to be modelled together in the same domain geographical files for mi and pei were provided in a high resolution digital elevation model dem developed from data supplied by the chief directorate surveys and mapping mowbray south africa points from the dem were triangulated to form a 3d terrain following geometry description of the islands in stereolithography stl format with a horizontal grid resolution of 30 m a numerical domain was built spanning a 70 km 62 km 6 km bounding box as a quality assurance the total aerodynamic blockage ratio see okajima et al 1997 was estimated to be 10 for the numerical wind domain ensuring that the placement of the domain boundaries does not influence the internal numerical solution more mesh cells were concentrated near the islands on slopes and ridges where increasingly turbulent wind activity was to be expected cell density was gradually decreased further away from the area of importance in line with cfd best practice further detail may be found in the supplementary material all geometric facets are treated as walls which obey a no slip boundary condition rough surfaces are modelled by offsetting the definition of the standard law of the wall to accommodate a departure from smooth conditions parente et al 2011b based on the vegetation height and rock geomorphology discussed in section 3 1 a uniform ground roughness height was fixed at a realistic mean value across the entire surface of mi since there was no clear way to build a variable roughness map the ground roughness height has been approximated by that of a rough pasture z 0 10 15 mm manwell et al 2009 to account for incoming airflow over the surrounding ocean a simplified modelling approach was adapted from peña and gryning 2008 where the charnok model eq 7 is used to approximate the roughness length of the sea due to wind water interactions 7 z 0 a c u 2 g here g is the gravitational constant and a c 0 018 is the charnok constant it is common practice to apply the aerodynamic roughness to the sea surface and neglect applying a drifting wall velocity garratt 1994 an aerodynamic roughness of z 0 0 5 mm was assumed for the wind blown sea surface in this study manwell et al 2009 3 5 comparison between wind measurements and cfd an important requirement of this study was to meaningfully compare the experimental 2d anemometer data to the extracted cfd simulation data both sources are subject to their own sets of limitations making it difficult to find direct comparisons time series data recorded by the 2d anemometers include the mean velocity magnitude u and corresponding standard deviation σ h for a wind flowing in a direction d in the horizontal plane d is a geographical heading with units given in degrees clockwise from true north steady state quantities extracted from a cfd solution include velocity components u v and w relative to the cartesian x y and z directions and turbulent kinetic energy k as calculated in the rans equations any wind velocity data captured by an anemometer can be deconstructed into a mean velocity in the x direction u and a standard deviation σ u v and σ v are the corresponding quantities in the y direction velocity in the vertical direction w has an assumed value of w 0 m s since the anemometers were only capable of recording measurements in the horizontal plane u and σ h are described by eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 u u 2 v 2 9 σ h σ u 2 σ v 2 assuming the average wind speed at two heights is known the log law in eq 1 can be manipulated to estimate a friction velocity u in the experimental dataset using the wind speed gradient 10 u κ 2 u 1 ln h 1 z 0 u 2 ln h 2 z 0 where u 1 and u 2 are the average wind speeds recorded at heights h 1 and h 2 respectively κ 0 41 and z 0 0 015 m are assumed constants already discussed in sections 3 3 3 4 the average turbulent kinetic energy k is readily available as an output from cfd simulations but cannot be directly measured in the field rather it is calculated after discrete time intervals ranging from 10 min periods to no more than an hour manwell et al 2009 11 k 1 2 σ u 2 σ v 2 σ w 2 σ w is not available from measurements but has been approximated by borrowing an underlying assumption from the numerical k ɛ turbulence model that is k is inherently assumed to be isotropic in the cfd simulations and so σ u σ v σ w adopting this convention in the experimental dataset implies that σ w σ h 2 2 drawbacks of making this assumption are discussed in section 5 4 results validation successful extraction of prevailing wind conditions on mi identified south westerlies occurring with significantly higher frequency table 3 offering the best opportunity for successful cfd model validation north westerly prevailing winds were marked as a worst case validation scenario due to lower counts and comparatively larger uncertainty in wind direction and tke measurements the mean experimental friction velocity eq 10 came to u 0 735 m s averaged over all 17 stations under the three dominant prevailing wind sectors in fig 6 consequently this fixed value was applied in the simulations at the inlet boundary surface as an assumed initial condition a corresponding mean u recovered from the cfd results eq 4 showed an increase to u 0 862 m s averaged across the masts on mi despite the spread seen in the data the model was successful at predicting wind velocity with an accurate order of magnitude based on the supplied boundary conditions the absolute error was calculated for the predicted wind velocities and turbulence according to eq 12 φ is a placeholder for any velocity or turbulence quantity while wind direction error required a slightly different eq 13 to account for angular values 12 e r r o r φ e x p φ c f d φ e x p 13 e r r o r d min 360 d e x p d c f d d e x p d c f d 180 the error statistics for each of the three chosen validation cases fig 7a d were weighted according to their total frequency of observations and then aggregated into a mean absolute error mae score the abl model has proved to be a valid predictor of fine scale wind patterns on mi with a 26 9 mae in velocity magnitude an 8 23 mean directional error equivalent to 14 8 and a 32 6 mae when predicting k model validation is a demonstration that the cfd model possesses a satisfactory prediction accuracy consistent with its intended ecological applications a 95 confidence interval ci was calculated in the experimental dataset at each station if a predicted result lies anywhere within the experimental 95 ci it was classified as a correct prediction wind speeds were correctly predicted in 91 2 of cases wind direction in 83 3 of cases and tke in 100 of cases fig 8a c the current model is capable of correctly predicting a complete result i e velocity direction turbulence all simultaneously within a 95 ci in 74 5 of cases around mi under varying wind conditions fig 8d 5 discussion 5 1 error analysis the westerly and south westerly simulations compare favourably with realistic measurements while a relatively poor outcome of the north westerly validation case heavily impacted the combined error however all results are useful since the stations were placed exactly within the region of interest such low altitude wind patterns are ecologically relevant on mi particularly relating to vegetation and invertebrates an analysis of the error was performed to identify reasons for disagreement between the experimental campaign and the cfd simulations the cfd model correctly predicts wind speed in 91 2 of cases this good comparison is most likely due to assuming the inlet boundary profiles based on the experimentally determined u the minor difference between the actual and predicted friction velocities noted in fig 6 is due to the natural step up in wind speed as air moves from sea level and passes over the landscape this was not accounted for during the pre simulation setup since there was no clear way to do so the small number of incorrect wind speed predictions all occurred at stations on the leeward side of mi or else situated near to santa rosa valley in these situations it was assumed that the high turbulence in the wake of geographical features would be a likely cause of volatile experimental measurements rather than an incorrect simulation result the influence of the coriolis force was found to overpower the simulated airflow and lead to large disparities between the model and reality especially when simulating a north westerly prevailing wind fig 9 due to the uncommonly large domain under study the true significance of the coriolis related wind deflection was underestimated until after the cfd solution data had been interrogated wind deflection was seen to grow incrementally with distance from the inlet boundary surface the orientation of mi in its numerical domain means that the island is closest to the inlet during a south westerly wind simulation and furthest away during a north westerly setup giving an explanation for the difference in predictive performance between the two by the time the flow reaches the middle of the numerical domain an approaching north westerly wind in fig 9c has already deflected so much that it seems to be striking mi at an unintended angle somewhere within the nnw wind sector wind patterns are also sensitive to the influence of topography this sensitivity would cause an already deflected wind to deviate even further from the correct solution in hindsight the simulated incoming wind direction could have been optimised to match the experimental measurements at ground level although this is beyond the scope of the current study measurement equipment height was limited to one meter above ground level to prevent bird collisions the chaotic turbulence so close to the ground makes it especially difficult to measure and isolate a clean wind sample the complete agreement between actual and simulated tke is a surprising result which is unlikely to be true the underlying assumption of isotropic k is a simplification that was applied in both datasets but is not expected to remain valid so close to ground level calculating the tke from experimental measurements captured in 10 min long intervals as well as estimating the additional σ w using an isotropic assumption has likely inflated the uncertainty in measured turbulence this extra uncertainty means that a broader range of simulated k values may be classified as correct leaving room for false positives despite the fact that experimental measurements were manipulated into a suitable form to be compared with the numerical output they still have ties to the natural physics which cannot be ignored thus there is good reason to accept the simulated turbulence results as a useful estimation of k while no alternative options exist 5 2 post processing further post processing of the cfd results was performed with the simulations being validated to this extent one could extract cfd data from other as yet untested wind simulations and assume that similar error characteristics would apply turbulence intensity ti is another method of characterising wind speed variation ti is simply the ratio of wind speed fluctuations u over the mean wind velocity often reported as a percentage manwell et al 2009 14 t i u u 15 u σ u 2 σ v 2 σ w 2 3 2 3 k ti is a preferred method for showing wind turbulence in this study since it is easier to conceptualise and understand than k wind maps of velocity magnitude and ti were extracted from a constant height of 1 m agl across mi the maps are available in the supplementary material for all 16 simulated wind sectors these images offer a means of identifying regions of high or low velocity magnitude and turbulence caused by atmospheric interaction with the topography a particularly useful application of the numerical data is yearly weighted average wind maps for mi fig 10 the wind prevalence information fig 4 was used to give each simulated wind direction a weighting before combining their results into a total wind map this is currently the best available approximation of the average low altitude wind climate on mi 5 3 utility using the model to predict wind patterns other than the yearly mean condition is also possible to demonstrate a set of simulations were run with low speed wind conditions i e the new modelled inlet boundary condition was based on u 0 37 m s rather than u 0 735 m s cfd wind profiles were cast into a non dimensional universal form scaling values by their local friction velocity u fig 11 this method of non dimensional scaling is common practice in cfd engineering it is therefore suggested that future researchers do not need to perform any new simulations in order to predict faster or slower than average wind patterns rather an easy way of predicting wind speed near ground level would be to extract the available average speed wind simulation data and scale it up or down accordingly using an appropriate assumed friction velocity eq 16 a reasonable choice of friction velocity would be in the range of 0 3 1 0 m s with u 0 735 m s being the average condition as originally modelled 16 u p r e d u s i m u s i m u a s s u m e d where the subscript s i m denotes a quantity extracted from the simulation data p r e d denotes the approximate wind speed prediction after adjustment and a s s u m e d denotes a reasonable guess at a scaling friction velocity the reliability of this method has not been validated for predicting wind speed higher up in the atmosphere and would only offer a good approximation within the first 10 meters above ground level 6 conclusion this paper has presented the development of a mechanistic modelling approach for the wind patterns on sub antarctic marion island using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were validated against sparse wind anemometer measurements gathered over 2 years in the field although cfd simulations were performed for all 16 cardinal wind directions only three candidates were chosen as representative datasets for validation against the observed wind recordings w nw and sw results showed good comparison with reality displaying a mean absolute error mae of 26 9 across the island when predicting wind speed an underestimation of the wind deflection caused by the coriolis force was responsible for a mae of 14 8 when predicting wind direction turbulent kinetic energy tke had a 32 6 mae although this result was difficult to verify against volatile experimental measurements while there is room for improvement achieving wind estimation with up to 75 accuracy is a remarkable achievement that can lead to numerous discoveries at a destination where spatially explicit wind data have been non existent until now while error cannot be avoided when modelling such complex systems it has been well quantified and discussed as a testament to the usefulness of the current work momberg et al 2021 have made use of the simulated wind pattern data in their own investigation concerning wind stress as a driver of fine scale variation in plant communities similar findings could be achieved across the entire island if a scaled up study were performed in addition to the ecological studies the wind data generated will also aid a planned island wide mouse eradication program offering a way to determine which wind conditions present the safest flight opportunities as well as optimising bait dropping strategies to take advantage of ground level wind dispersal this study has successfully applied cfd as a methodology for modelling biologically relevant wind scales on islands

24512,a need was identified to have reliable quantitative wind pattern data for marion island mi in the study of terrestrial ecology fauna and flora on this well preserved and remote territory in the sub antarctic indian ocean the present work aims to estimate a high resolution map of wind speed direction and turbulence on mi through the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd an engineering based discipline for modelling fluid physics this paper presents the comparison between experimental measurements and numerical simulation results of the full scale atmospheric flow around mi and its closely neighbouring prince edward island pei in particular a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach was used with a k ɛ turbulence closure model adapted to atmospheric boundary layer flows this was implemented in the ansys fluent 2019r3 software and validated against wind measurements recorded over the span of two years a 26 9 mean absolute error was seen when predicting wind speed a 14 8 error when predicting wind direction and a 32 6 error when predicting turbulent kinetic energy the baseline cfd model provides future researchers on mi with a reliable means of estimating wind properties near ground level quantities such as average wind speed turbulence gusting and annual wind behaviour can now be recreated at any location on the island something that was not previously possible without environmentally intrusive surveillance methods this research has refined cfd modelling for islands and highlights the potential for the application of this methodology to estimate

a critical role in shaping ecosystems ennos 1997 wind or the motion of atmospheric air is a climatic phenomenon known to cause erosion of geological land forms induce wind driven currents in bodies of water and serve as an important transport mechanism for abiotic matter and genetic material chau et al 2019 hedding et al 2015 blanchet et al 2008 cózar et al 2005 breshears et al 2003 plants in particular have been cited for their reliance on wind for pollination which makes changing wind patterns as a result of climate change an ongoing concern friedman and barrett 2009 nathan et al 2011 further to this wind exerts mechanical and physiological stresses on both plants and animals from abrasion of leaves which increases moisture loss to breaking of branches and stems under high load de langre 2008 kim and manuel 2016 faster loss of body heat in endotherms and greater energy expenditure for any organisms trying to be active in windy environments gilbert et al 2010 liechti 2006 gardiner et al 2016 bang et al 2010 thus the importance of wind as an ecological factor is well acknowledged although an understanding of the fundamental influence of wind may be lacking onoda and anten 2011 it is difficult to collect or model wind data at biologically meaningful resolutions and broad enough extent especially in cases where the placement of a wind sensor would directly interfere with the ecological system being studied pearce higgins et al 2012 in order to include the influence of wind in their study on seed dispersal somerville et al 2019 described an empirical equation for wind behaviour based on various environmental parameters measured within their field although empirical models are useful for studying the effects of wind on biota mechanistic modelling of dispersal agents is seen as the ultimate goal for ecologists since the underlying physical processes are simulated in order to predict dispersal patterns bullock et al 2017 this in turn relieves the effort required to measure dispersal directly in the field bullock et al 2006 atmospheric flow patterns over complex landscapes are of great interest in worldwide engineering studies since they are crucial to the success of wind energy harvesting projects and safety in design of structures and buildings carrying human lives see blocken 2014 and references therein atmospheric flows also have engineering importance in urban climate and pollutant transport applications to this end computational fluid dynamics cfd is widely used to numerically model the atmospheric boundary layer abl and all its physical mechanisms the cfd method supplements sparse wind measurement campaigns since masts are expensive to erect and their location is limited by various factors especially where complex terrain is concerned berge et al 2006 when paired with field quantified wind data wind characteristics can be estimated with cfd over terrain where no masts have been erected 1 1 study system marion island mi is introduced as the main focus of the current study mi and its neighbour prince edward island pei are two small volcanic islands in the sub antarctic southern ocean together known as the prince edward islands south africa these sub antarctic islands are an important meteorological and biological conservation landmark especially for the south african national antarctic programme sanap and the south african government covering a total area of circa 29 000 hectares and located at 46 5 4 4 5 s 37 4 4 3 7 e some 1769 km south east of the south african coast mi lies in the heart of the southern latitudes known as the roaring forties the prince edward islands are one such landscape in which it is known that high wind velocities have a significant impact on both the biotic and abiotic systems in the region chown and froneman 2008 because the southern indian ocean is so vast and mostly uninterrupted by land pelagic animals flock to these sub antarctic islands to breed and moult crawford et al 2008 hofmeyr et al 2006 schoombie et al 2016 although the prince edward islands and most sub antarctic islands are detached from broader human activity they are still subject to the worldwide effects of climate change presenting them as a rich environment for investigating the impacts of climate change under minimal influence from human factors boelhouwers 2003 hedding et al 2006 since only the dominant wind direction of the general atmospheric wind is known from weather and satellite data not much can be said about topographical wind conditions at ground level the mi research base is an outpost for the south african weather service saws home to a single meteorological mast which has been in operation since circa 1948 historical data from this station over 60 years has led to the finding that the majority of the winds in the region are strong westerlies courtesy of saws 2020 the meteorological mast stands 10 metres above ground level agl on the north eastern coastline in the lee of the dominant wind conditions given its leeward position measurements recorded at the mast are unlikely to be representative of fine scale wind conditions around the entire island le roux 2008 there have been research investigations taking place on mi both ecological and geological which have reached conclusions that must necessarily neglect the impacts of local fine scale wind on the systems under study due to this lack of empirical evidence chau et al 2019 hedding et al 2015 chown and froneman 2008 however in conducting a small scale cfd analysis combrinck et al 2020 have recently concluded that wind scouring and deposition patterns may have marked effects on the growth of azorella selago the most widespread plant species on the island based on the success of combrinck et al 2020 and the need for reliable wind estimates this work attempts to answer the simple question is cfd an effective tool for determining ecologically meaningful wind patterns across the full extent of mi a large and complex study domain relative isolation from other land masses the next nearest occurrence of land is the crozet islands france 950 km to the east makes mi an interesting candidate for a large scale cfd investigation the same methods used by engineers to evaluate potential wind energy farming sites may be applied here under a different context rather than modelling the wind to determine energy resource for a wind farming operation motivation behind the current work is to aid future ecological research by providing biologically meaningful fine scale wind estimates on mi under several plausible prevailing atmospheric wind conditions the consequence of such a study is a remedy for the current lack of quantitative data required to draw conclusions about the impacts of wind on the island ecology an important empirical foundation for future work the successful application of cfd to mechanistically model wind on mi also promotes similar cross disciplinary research at other biologically important locations globally detailed measurement and simulation programs of a similar nature have been performed on other isolated hills and islands with documented success isle of arran grant et al 2016 thielen et al 2002 askervein hill raithby et al 1987 undheim et al 2006 and bolund island bechmann et al 2007a 2009 berg et al 2011 although the size of mi is larger than that of these studies they have validated the applicability of modelling an idealised neutrally stable abl over suitably complex terrain research at the technical university of denmark dtu has played a pivotal role in the current study in particular the work surrounding bolund island and the experimental vs computational wind modelling campaign offered a useful preliminary case study for evaluating the methods used later in this article importantly the idea of placing masts in line with dominant wind has been transferred to the mi wind measurement campaign see section 2 1 as it offers the best chance of capturing advancing wind patterns transcending the need for purely theoretical applications in ecological academia the outcome of the current study has further real world impact for a planned island wide mouse eradication program a growing population of invasive house mice have become increasingly destructive to the surviving local fauna on mi requiring an urgent eradication preston et al 2019 parkes 2014 has suggested that an aerial baiting technique using helicopters would be the most effective method of eradicating the mice although this has been successfully achieved at similar locations under threats of invasive species preston et al 2019 a local knowledge of wind patterns on mi itself would be especially helpful in planning and coordinating helicopter flight operations and optimised bait distribution strategies 1 2 overview this investigation is summarised in fig 1 and involves performing an on site wind measurement campaign a and developing and testing a cfd model for the abl b using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and a standard k ɛ turbulence model schlichting 1979 after systematic simulation the abl model is then validated c against a set of time series wind data captured by an array of meteorological masts around mi finally sources of error between the model and observed measurements are identified and discussed so as to improve our understanding for future work output spatially explicit simulation data are then available for subsequent ecological studies d 2 materials and methods 2 1 wind data collection wind data were collected from april 2018 until march 2020 at 17 locations around mi using sonic anemometers wind measurement stations fig 2 consist of two gill windsonic two dimensional 2d ultrasonic anemometers a solar panel and a portable logging device since the anemometers are only capable of 2d readings in a horizontal plane all were installed facing true north and horizontally levelled the two anemometers per station are offset one capturing data at a height of 1 metre while the other is mounted at 0 5 metres high and off to one side to minimise recording wind interference caused by the centre mast the wind was sampled once every 2 s and averaged wind statistics were periodically saved in 10 min 60 min and 24 h intervals due to the presence of many threatened seabirds on mi and the conservation laws under the prince edward island management plan 2010 no permanent structures were installed to support the anemometers and the maximum height of the stations was limited to 1 metre above ground level most stations were placed near the coastal extremities of mi at lower altitudes emphasis was held on keeping stations in relatively flat areas away from any sharp geographical protrusions or valleys where possible some stations were placed in pairs less than 1 km apart fig 3 so that corresponding time series data could be related across short distances westerly north westerly and south westerly winds have been previously identified as the three dominating wind directions from historical weather data saws 2020 stations were placed roughly along lanes within these directions the saws station is located at the mi research base has been designated as station 0 and the corresponding gps coordinates and station numbers are given in appendix a 2 2 wind data analysis all captured wind measurements were cleaned of erroneous data and sorted into a concise database the wind on marion island wmi dataset dominant westerly north westerly and south westerly winds along with any intermediate sectors wsw wnw etc account for 74 of all wind measured on mi over two years fig 4 due to the firm wind dominance some wind sectors were easier and more meaningful to validate than others thus only the three dominant sectors were chosen as candidates for comparison and validation against cfd simulations adjacent wind sectors were excluded from the analysis as they are too similar to the chosen candidate sectors the underlying assumption is that any outcome from validating the dominant wind sectors could be directly translated to the other sectors with reasonable accuracy typical wind studies would designate a single upwind mast as a reference mast used to determine periods of consistent incoming wind conditions this was not possible in the current campaign as there is no way of safely erecting an upwind mast in the southern ocean a new approach was devised to determine periods of consistent incoming wind conditions in a given sector three mid stream reference stations were chosen table 1 if any two of the three reference stations recorded a matching wind in the appropriate sector the corresponding timestamp was saved the list of timestamps was further distilled by only keeping sets of data where the average wind direction had not changed for two continuous hours or more under these circumstances a steady state incoming wind condition could be assumed across all stations on mi these stations were used as reference points due to their coastal location on the windward side of the island relative to the approaching wind direction preference was given to those stations erected at lower altitudes and isolated from sharp geographical features chosen reference stations are in the best possible position to sample an incoming wind before any interactions with the island interior have taken place 3 theory and calculations a formulation of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was used to simulate the abl in this study due to relatively low computational requirements and well documented best practice guidelines franke et al 2010 the rans method has been presented in depth by versteeg and malalasekera 2007 and has become a common workhorse for many micro scale wind studies over the years see blocken 2014 and references therein wallace and hobbs 2006 and panofsky and dutton 1984 offer a full description of the abl and its associated turbulence modelling approaches likewise manwell et al 2009 have reviewed cfd modelling in the context of wind energy farming relevant theory necessary for describing a cfd model relating specifically to mi is given here 3 1 prevailing climate and geography on marion island mi is roughly 25 km long through its longest axis by 16 km wide and reaches a peak elevation of 1242 metres above sea level covering an area of 290 km 2 pei is far smaller 10 km long by 6 5 km wide and reaching a peak of 672 metres vegetation on mi is categorised by 7 habitat complexes coastal salt spray complex fellfield slope biotic grassland biotic herbfield mire and polar desert smith et al 2001 in all these habitats plants are limited to grasses ferns and other mat or cushion forming species which rarely exceed a height of 30 cm the barren areas on the island typically those above 650 750 m altitude are the typical polar desert characterised by sharp volcanic rocks scoria cones and snow ice fields hedding 2008 the climate around marion island is considered hyper oceanic the atmospheric behaviour is neutrally stratified and predominantly determined by the marine boundary layer rather than thermal buoyancy effects over land mass le roux 2008 garratt 1994 the surrounding waters have a much higher thermal inertia than land and in conjunction with the strong influence of passing frontal systems from the polar region the islands are subject to mild daily temperature fluctuations high humidity and high precipitation le roux 2008 as a consequence of its sub antarctic latitude mi also regularly experiences gale force winds and low incident radiation le roux 2008 3 2 modelling the atmosphere the combination of high wind speeds in the roaring forties and small daily thermal variations in the hyper oceanic environment leads to the assumption that one can ignore atmospheric instability arising from thermal buoyancy effects an average wind climate on mi can then be modelled as a neutrally stratified abl other atmospheric regimes have been excluded the turbulent kinetic energy tke k and its dissipation rate ɛ are accounted for in the simulations using a standard turbulence model launder and spalding 1983 however coefficients of the standard k ɛ model which generally take on fixed values for industrial applications have been modified here to be more applicable to abl simulations katul et al 2004 summarised in table 2 when modelling the full scale abl inertial forces experienced by a parcel of air due to the rotation of the earth must be accounted for koblitz 2013 the coriolis force is a centripetal force acting on a fluid parcel inside earth s rotating frame of reference while the companion centrifugal force is neglected in meteorological applications since the earth s rotational acceleration is approximately time independent kageyama and hyodo 2006 bechmann et al 2007b provide a mathematical description of the coriolis force as it was applied in the current cfd model 3 3 boundary conditions to solve realistic flow scenarios cfd modelling requires the definition of a three dimensional 3d meshed domain and appropriate boundary conditions fig 5 in order to numerically approximate the rans and k ɛ turbulence transport equations when considering the inlet conditions for a neutrally stable abl simulation the wind velocity is generally accepted to follow a logarithmic profile that reduces to zero at ground level due to a no slip contact see section 3 4 between the moving air and the ground wallace and hobbs 2006 richards and norris 2011 analytically derived a set of realistic inlet profiles for velocity magnitude u and turbulence parameters k and ɛ directly from the rans equations they are given as one dimensional functions of height z in eqs 1 3 1 u z u κ ln z z 0 z 0 2 k z u 2 c μ 3 ɛ z u 3 κ z z 0 where u is the surface friction velocity defined by eq 4 schlichting 1979 4 u τ w ρ u is approximately constant in the lowest several metres of the abl the local fluid shear stress at ground level τ w is also approximately constant for a newtonian fluid κ is the von kármán constant κ 0 41 u 0 735 m s was applied as a constant boundary condition at the velocity inlet surface see section 4 z denotes the height above ground level in metres and the quantity z 0 represents an aerodynamic roughness length i e the height above ground at which zero wind speed is present due to flow obstacles such as trees buildings or ground cover the k inlet profile described in eq 2 is only applicable to the lower surface portion of the abl typically no more than the first few hundred metres above ground level richards and norris 2011 as soon as increasing height of the abl is modelled a smooth k profile eq 5 needs to be established which accounts for higher turbulence close to surface level and little to no turbulence in the upper part of the atmosphere where geostrophic winds exhibit near laminar flow crasto 2007 5 k z u 2 c μ 1 z z h 2 z h denotes the depth of the abl the height at which actual and geostrophic winds coincide and above which the wind turbulence becomes minimal while it is difficult to determine an exact boundary layer depth in reality a value was estimated for modelling purposes 6 z h c u f c the value for the constant c ranges from 0 2 to 0 4 for a neutral abl garratt 1994 f c denotes a parameter relating to the coriolis force bechmann et al 2007b 3 4 modelling complex terrain and sea surfaces due to the subsonic and incompressible nature of the flow around mi and pei atmospheric interactions between the two land masses were expected and thus both islands had to be modelled together in the same domain geographical files for mi and pei were provided in a high resolution digital elevation model dem developed from data supplied by the chief directorate surveys and mapping mowbray south africa points from the dem were triangulated to form a 3d terrain following geometry description of the islands in stereolithography stl format with a horizontal grid resolution of 30 m a numerical domain was built spanning a 70 km 62 km 6 km bounding box as a quality assurance the total aerodynamic blockage ratio see okajima et al 1997 was estimated to be 10 for the numerical wind domain ensuring that the placement of the domain boundaries does not influence the internal numerical solution more mesh cells were concentrated near the islands on slopes and ridges where increasingly turbulent wind activity was to be expected cell density was gradually decreased further away from the area of importance in line with cfd best practice further detail may be found in the supplementary material all geometric facets are treated as walls which obey a no slip boundary condition rough surfaces are modelled by offsetting the definition of the standard law of the wall to accommodate a departure from smooth conditions parente et al 2011b based on the vegetation height and rock geomorphology discussed in section 3 1 a uniform ground roughness height was fixed at a realistic mean value across the entire surface of mi since there was no clear way to build a variable roughness map the ground roughness height has been approximated by that of a rough pasture z 0 10 15 mm manwell et al 2009 to account for incoming airflow over the surrounding ocean a simplified modelling approach was adapted from peña and gryning 2008 where the charnok model eq 7 is used to approximate the roughness length of the sea due to wind water interactions 7 z 0 a c u 2 g here g is the gravitational constant and a c 0 018 is the charnok constant it is common practice to apply the aerodynamic roughness to the sea surface and neglect applying a drifting wall velocity garratt 1994 an aerodynamic roughness of z 0 0 5 mm was assumed for the wind blown sea surface in this study manwell et al 2009 3 5 comparison between wind measurements and cfd an important requirement of this study was to meaningfully compare the experimental 2d anemometer data to the extracted cfd simulation data both sources are subject to their own sets of limitations making it difficult to find direct comparisons time series data recorded by the 2d anemometers include the mean velocity magnitude u and corresponding standard deviation σ h for a wind flowing in a direction d in the horizontal plane d is a geographical heading with units given in degrees clockwise from true north steady state quantities extracted from a cfd solution include velocity components u v and w relative to the cartesian x y and z directions and turbulent kinetic energy k as calculated in the rans equations any wind velocity data captured by an anemometer can be deconstructed into a mean velocity in the x direction u and a standard deviation σ u v and σ v are the corresponding quantities in the y direction velocity in the vertical direction w has an assumed value of w 0 m s since the anemometers were only capable of recording measurements in the horizontal plane u and σ h are described by eqs 8 and 9 respectively 8 u u 2 v 2 9 σ h σ u 2 σ v 2 assuming the average wind speed at two heights is known the log law in eq 1 can be manipulated to estimate a friction velocity u in the experimental dataset using the wind speed gradient 10 u κ 2 u 1 ln h 1 z 0 u 2 ln h 2 z 0 where u 1 and u 2 are the average wind speeds recorded at heights h 1 and h 2 respectively κ 0 41 and z 0 0 015 m are assumed constants already discussed in sections 3 3 3 4 the average turbulent kinetic energy k is readily available as an output from cfd simulations but cannot be directly measured in the field rather it is calculated after discrete time intervals ranging from 10 min periods to no more than an hour manwell et al 2009 11 k 1 2 σ u 2 σ v 2 σ w 2 σ w is not available from measurements but has been approximated by borrowing an underlying assumption from the numerical k ɛ turbulence model that is k is inherently assumed to be isotropic in the cfd simulations and so σ u σ v σ w adopting this convention in the experimental dataset implies that σ w σ h 2 2 drawbacks of making this assumption are discussed in section 5 4 results validation successful extraction of prevailing wind conditions on mi identified south westerlies occurring with significantly higher frequency table 3 offering the best opportunity for successful cfd model validation north westerly prevailing winds were marked as a worst case validation scenario due to lower counts and comparatively larger uncertainty in wind direction and tke measurements the mean experimental friction velocity eq 10 came to u 0 735 m s averaged over all 17 stations under the three dominant prevailing wind sectors in fig 6 consequently this fixed value was applied in the simulations at the inlet boundary surface as an assumed initial condition a corresponding mean u recovered from the cfd results eq 4 showed an increase to u 0 862 m s averaged across the masts on mi despite the spread seen in the data the model was successful at predicting wind velocity with an accurate order of magnitude based on the supplied boundary conditions the absolute error was calculated for the predicted wind velocities and turbulence according to eq 12 φ is a placeholder for any velocity or turbulence quantity while wind direction error required a slightly different eq 13 to account for angular values 12 e r r o r φ e x p φ c f d φ e x p 13 e r r o r d min 360 d e x p d c f d d e x p d c f d 180 the error statistics for each of the three chosen validation cases fig 7a d were weighted according to their total frequency of observations and then aggregated into a mean absolute error mae score the abl model has proved to be a valid predictor of fine scale wind patterns on mi with a 26 9 mae in velocity magnitude an 8 23 mean directional error equivalent to 14 8 and a 32 6 mae when predicting k model validation is a demonstration that the cfd model possesses a satisfactory prediction accuracy consistent with its intended ecological applications a 95 confidence interval ci was calculated in the experimental dataset at each station if a predicted result lies anywhere within the experimental 95 ci it was classified as a correct prediction wind speeds were correctly predicted in 91 2 of cases wind direction in 83 3 of cases and tke in 100 of cases fig 8a c the current model is capable of correctly predicting a complete result i e velocity direction turbulence all simultaneously within a 95 ci in 74 5 of cases around mi under varying wind conditions fig 8d 5 discussion 5 1 error analysis the westerly and south westerly simulations compare favourably with realistic measurements while a relatively poor outcome of the north westerly validation case heavily impacted the combined error however all results are useful since the stations were placed exactly within the region of interest such low altitude wind patterns are ecologically relevant on mi particularly relating to vegetation and invertebrates an analysis of the error was performed to identify reasons for disagreement between the experimental campaign and the cfd simulations the cfd model correctly predicts wind speed in 91 2 of cases this good comparison is most likely due to assuming the inlet boundary profiles based on the experimentally determined u the minor difference between the actual and predicted friction velocities noted in fig 6 is due to the natural step up in wind speed as air moves from sea level and passes over the landscape this was not accounted for during the pre simulation setup since there was no clear way to do so the small number of incorrect wind speed predictions all occurred at stations on the leeward side of mi or else situated near to santa rosa valley in these situations it was assumed that the high turbulence in the wake of geographical features would be a likely cause of volatile experimental measurements rather than an incorrect simulation result the influence of the coriolis force was found to overpower the simulated airflow and lead to large disparities between the model and reality especially when simulating a north westerly prevailing wind fig 9 due to the uncommonly large domain under study the true significance of the coriolis related wind deflection was underestimated until after the cfd solution data had been interrogated wind deflection was seen to grow incrementally with distance from the inlet boundary surface the orientation of mi in its numerical domain means that the island is closest to the inlet during a south westerly wind simulation and furthest away during a north westerly setup giving an explanation for the difference in predictive performance between the two by the time the flow reaches the middle of the numerical domain an approaching north westerly wind in fig 9c has already deflected so much that it seems to be striking mi at an unintended angle somewhere within the nnw wind sector wind patterns are also sensitive to the influence of topography this sensitivity would cause an already deflected wind to deviate even further from the correct solution in hindsight the simulated incoming wind direction could have been optimised to match the experimental measurements at ground level although this is beyond the scope of the current study measurement equipment height was limited to one meter above ground level to prevent bird collisions the chaotic turbulence so close to the ground makes it especially difficult to measure and isolate a clean wind sample the complete agreement between actual and simulated tke is a surprising result which is unlikely to be true the underlying assumption of isotropic k is a simplification that was applied in both datasets but is not expected to remain valid so close to ground level calculating the tke from experimental measurements captured in 10 min long intervals as well as estimating the additional σ w using an isotropic assumption has likely inflated the uncertainty in measured turbulence this extra uncertainty means that a broader range of simulated k values may be classified as correct leaving room for false positives despite the fact that experimental measurements were manipulated into a suitable form to be compared with the numerical output they still have ties to the natural physics which cannot be ignored thus there is good reason to accept the simulated turbulence results as a useful estimation of k while no alternative options exist 5 2 post processing further post processing of the cfd results was performed with the simulations being validated to this extent one could extract cfd data from other as yet untested wind simulations and assume that similar error characteristics would apply turbulence intensity ti is another method of characterising wind speed variation ti is simply the ratio of wind speed fluctuations u over the mean wind velocity often reported as a percentage manwell et al 2009 14 t i u u 15 u σ u 2 σ v 2 σ w 2 3 2 3 k ti is a preferred method for showing wind turbulence in this study since it is easier to conceptualise and understand than k wind maps of velocity magnitude and ti were extracted from a constant height of 1 m agl across mi the maps are available in the supplementary material for all 16 simulated wind sectors these images offer a means of identifying regions of high or low velocity magnitude and turbulence caused by atmospheric interaction with the topography a particularly useful application of the numerical data is yearly weighted average wind maps for mi fig 10 the wind prevalence information fig 4 was used to give each simulated wind direction a weighting before combining their results into a total wind map this is currently the best available approximation of the average low altitude wind climate on mi 5 3 utility using the model to predict wind patterns other than the yearly mean condition is also possible to demonstrate a set of simulations were run with low speed wind conditions i e the new modelled inlet boundary condition was based on u 0 37 m s rather than u 0 735 m s cfd wind profiles were cast into a non dimensional universal form scaling values by their local friction velocity u fig 11 this method of non dimensional scaling is common practice in cfd engineering it is therefore suggested that future researchers do not need to perform any new simulations in order to predict faster or slower than average wind patterns rather an easy way of predicting wind speed near ground level would be to extract the available average speed wind simulation data and scale it up or down accordingly using an appropriate assumed friction velocity eq 16 a reasonable choice of friction velocity would be in the range of 0 3 1 0 m s with u 0 735 m s being the average condition as originally modelled 16 u p r e d u s i m u s i m u a s s u m e d where the subscript s i m denotes a quantity extracted from the simulation data p r e d denotes the approximate wind speed prediction after adjustment and a s s u m e d denotes a reasonable guess at a scaling friction velocity the reliability of this method has not been validated for predicting wind speed higher up in the atmosphere and would only offer a good approximation within the first 10 meters above ground level 6 conclusion this paper has presented the development of a mechanistic modelling approach for the wind patterns on sub antarctic marion island using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations were validated against sparse wind anemometer measurements gathered over 2 years in the field although cfd simulations were performed for all 16 cardinal wind directions only three candidates were chosen as representative datasets for validation against the observed wind recordings w nw and sw results showed good comparison with reality displaying a mean absolute error mae of 26 9 across the island when predicting wind speed an underestimation of the wind deflection caused by the coriolis force was responsible for a mae of 14 8 when predicting wind direction turbulent kinetic energy tke had a 32 6 mae although this result was difficult to verify against volatile experimental measurements while there is room for improvement achieving wind estimation with up to 75 accuracy is a remarkable achievement that can lead to numerous discoveries at a destination where spatially explicit wind data have been non existent until now while error cannot be avoided when modelling such complex systems it has been well quantified and discussed as a testament to the usefulness of the current work momberg et al 2021 have made use of the simulated wind pattern data in their own investigation concerning wind stress as a driver of fine scale variation in plant communities similar findings could be achieved across the entire island if a scaled up study were performed in addition to the ecological

24513,farming systems in europe are facing economic social environmental and institutional challenges highly intensive climate exposed arable farming systems like the veenkoloniën in the north of the netherlands are particularly vulnerable to many of these challenges just in the past twenty years the veenkoloniën has lost half of its small and medium sized family farms specialised in cultivating starch potatoes while starch potato production continues to be stable as the remaining farms are increasing the size of their operation local stakeholders are concerned that the farming system in the veenkoloniën is endangered in this paper we investigate this issue by using a system dynamics simulation model to explore what the potential structures are that could threaten the long term future of starch potato production and to identify leverage points that can enhance the resilience of the system our analysis shows that so far farmers active engagement in a processing cooperative has been an important element to their resilience to cope with economic and environmental challenges in practice the cooperative has been able to act as a buffer and stabilise prices for farmers in the region by implementing strategies that increase the value of their products open new markets and increase starch potato production key words system dynamics research analysis farming systems 1 introduction farming systems are a complex component of food systems they are primarily focused on food production farming systems consist of all the subcomponents that are pertinent to farm production but they have blurred boundaries with other components of the food system e g retailing processing etc and involve a wide range of stakeholders and players fao 2021 as a consequence farming systems address multiple and sometimes competing objectives like increasing production improving the quality of farmers livelihoods and enhancing environmental sustainability in trying to meet these objectives farming systems in europe are facing an increasingly broad range of environmental economic social and institutional challenges meuwissen et al 2020 operating in this complex environment requires stakeholders to anticipate the challenges ahead and to prepare for them by enhancing the resilience of farming systems one of the many farming systems working towards achieving long term sustainability in an increasingly challenging environment is the farming system in the veenkoloniën in the netherlands traditionally this farming system has been dominated by the cultivation of starch potato in a rotation with cereals and sugar beets a review of the starch potato production in the region conducted by bont et al 2007 found that the production of starch from potatoes accounted for up to 50 of the income of arable farms and supported more than 7000 direct and indirect jobs in the region the presence of avebe an agro industrial cooperative dedicated to starch processing has resulted in stable prices and demand for the farmers in the area avebe is the only company in the netherlands that processes starch from potatoes and currently has 1400 members approximately 900 in the veenkoloniën that are supplying a steady flow of starch potatoes every year avebe 2018b klok 2019 avebe receives roughly half of all its starch potato supply from the veenkoloniën this supply represents about one third of the global market share of the starch potato value chain strijker 2008 all the starch potato growers in the veenkoloniën own avebe shares which come with the obligation to deliver starch potatoes to avebe van dijk et al 2019 avebe s factories process the potatoes that are produced by all shareholders and sell the resulting starch or other products for an added value on the world market the profits of avebe then get redistributed back to the shareholders according to the volume and quality of starch potatoes they delivered and the number of shares they own avebe 2018a so far this synergy between avebe and the starch potato farmers in the veenkoloniën has proven successful and has helped farmers to overcome significant challenges like the elimination of subsidies thanks to innovation and vertical integration driven by avebe meuwissen et al 2019 however there are growing concerns amongst local stakeholders in the veenkoloniën that this success might be reaching its limits and that starch potato cultivation might stop being a profitable economic activity in the region e g diogo et al 2017 while the amount of starch potato produced and the cultivated area in the region have kept increasing since 2000 the number of farms cultivating starch potatoes has decreased significantly the substantial reduction in the number of farmers potentially due to poor economic performance of smaller producers raises questions about how resilient the system is and whether it will be able to withstand future challenges this paper develops a simulation model to explore how this farming system might respond to future challenges in simple terms resilience describes the capacity of a system to absorb a disturbance and to reorganise itself in ways that allow it to operate under new conditions biggs et al 2012 folke 2006 walker et al 2002 2004 a common way to conceptualise resilience is to think of the system moving about within a particular region in state space in which the system tends to remain within the same stable state beisner et al 2003 or basin of attraction walker et al 2004 p 5 the various basins of attraction that a system may occupy within this region and the boundaries that separate them are known as stability landscapes walker et al 2004 complex systems are known to have multiple basins of attraction within a stability landscape walker et al 2004 beisner et al 2003 and resilience is often conceptualised in terms of the system potential to withstand disturbances without shifting from their current often desirable basin of attraction to a different one folke et al 2010 when systems are affected by a disturbance they might alternate between basins of attractions return to the same configuration after a small disturbance or shift to a different basin of attraction after a large one beisner et al 2003 failure to anticipate these shifts between basins of attraction can be costly and sometimes even catastrophic carpenter et al 2001 an alternative to anticipating shifts between basin of attractions is to use simulation models to explore the impact disturbances have in the variables and processes that control the system s behaviour bennett et al 2005 rodriguez gonzalez et al 2020 complex systems are characterised by comprehensive mechanisms that push the system toward a particular basin of attraction when affected by a disturbance a chain reaction of changes through the system triggers feedback loop mechanisms that either move the system toward a different basin of attraction or help it to remain within the current one resilience alliance 2010 the aims of this study were threefold first we aimed to explore the impact disturbances might have on the long term performance of the starch potato farming system in the veenkoloniën region second we aimed to explore the feedback loops within the system structure that influence condition the resilience of the system finally our third goal was to use the insights gained to identify potential strategies that might help to increase the resilience of this farming system the paper proceeds as follow we start by describing the simulation model developed to characterise the starch potato system in the veenkoloniën next we elaborate on the steps we followed to use this model in the assessment of the resilience of the system these sections are followed by the results and analysis sections where we summarise and reflect on the main insights gained from our research 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling methodology system dynamics sd is a modelling methodology grounded in control theory with a focus on understanding how feedback loop mechanisms drive the behaviour of a system marandure et al 2020 kopainsky et al 2018 lane 2008 sterman 2000 and ford 1999 sd focuses on exploring and improving the performance of complex systems forrester 1961 and has been widely used to model socio ecological systems in a variety of contexts e g lopes and videira 2017 kopainsky et al 2015 bueno and basurto 2009 the purpose of sd is to identify the structure of a system system variables and their relationship that generates observed system behaviour so that solutions can be identified and tested in the model with this aim sd modellers build a formal simulation model that overcomes cognitive limitations to grasp the complexity of the system and allows to make reliable inferences about the system behaviour morecroft 1988 an important initial step in the modelling process is the development of the so called dynamic hypothesis richardson 1981 i e a feedback loop structure that is hypothesized to cause observed and or experienced behaviour sterman 2000 the process to derive this dynamic hypothesis varies from case to case in this study the dynamic hypothesis was developed using qualitative text data and stakeholder mental models presented in the deliverables of the horizon 2020 sure farm project towards sustainable and resilient eu farming systems reidsma 2019 reidsma et al 2020 paas et al 2021 the aim of the dynamic hypothesis is to make the causal structure driving system behaviour explicit in practice this is often done by capturing causal relationships between different variables in causal loop diagrams clds clds use one way arrows indicating that the indicator from which the arrow originates is the cause of change in the indicator at which the arrow is pointed the direction of this change is indicated using or letters next to the arrow heads a indicates that both variables change in the same direction for example if one increases the other also increases while a indicated that the variable at the end of the arrow changes in the opposite direction than the one at the nod see fig 1 for an example the term feedback loop is used to indicate circular causal relationships like the ones shown in figure generally there are two types of feedback loops balancing loops represented with a b and reinforcing loops represented with an r morecroft 2015 ford 2009 in a balancing loop b a change in the condition of a given variable leads to a counteracting or balancing change when the effects are traced around the loop by comparison a reinforcing loop r amplifies or reinforces change in a realistic multi loop system behaviour over time arises from the interplay of balancing and reinforcing loops the interplay of feedback loops quickly results in complex behaviour patterns that require computer simulation the dynamic hypothesis captured in a cld is therefore translated into a simulation model by using mathematical equations to represent the relationships between variables and validated by comparing the simulated behaviour against historical reference modes of behaviour in this case we used country and regional statistical data to inform and quantify model structure and variable choices next we briefly present the model structure by describing the main feedback loop mechanisms captured in the model more details about the model equations can be found in the appendix and in schütz 2020 2 2 model structure the aim of this study was to produce a model that can a explain the dynamics driving the decline seen in the number of starch potato farms in the veenkoloniën see fig 2 b simulate the expected behaviour of the system in terms of starch potato production and farm income and c allow us to explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of strategies identified in the sure farm project that aim to contribute to maintaining a stable number of starch potato farms in the region the model represents both the economic dynamics happening within farms and the dynamics between farms and the cooperative avebe as mentioned before avebe is believed to have been a critical component for the sustainability of the farming system in the past and remains an instrumental part of the system when trying to understand production and income of farmers in simple terms the model developed provides the outputs for the system indicators starch potato production total cultivation area farm number farm size and farm income assumes profitability of starch potato cultivation as the main driver of system behaviour simulates the consequences of farmers decisions to either scale up to improve profitability or to stop cultivating starch potatoes differentiates between the behaviour of small farms as opposed to larger farms explores the feedback between starch potato production and avebe allows testing of the impact of challenges and strategies on model behaviour the main balancing b and reinforcing r loops in the model can be examined in three parts 1 the feedback loops r1 b1 b2 and b3 that describe only starch potato farms and farmers decisions 2 the feedback loops r2 and b4 that describe the interaction between starch potato farmers and avebe 3 the feedback loops b5 r3 until r6 that describe avebe and their strategies of the feedback loops in fig 3 the feedback loop r2 co operative benefit is of particular importance because it captures the relationship between the farmers and the co operative feedback loop r2 can be read as follows the total starch potato production is the product of the total cultivation area the fraction of starch potato in the crop rotation plan and the starch potato yield see fig 3c the total volume of starch potatoes is delivered to avebe and processed into starch and other products the net profit of avebe is determined by the price of their products price paid to avebe and their total costs this net profit is used to pay farmers a price that will maintain a reasonable profitability compared to profits from other crops avebe depends on this steady flow of starch potatoes and thus depends on maintaining their member pool or at least their combined cultivation area beldman 2015 bont et al 2007 the cooperative is therefore committed to maintaining a reasonable relative profitability of starch potato farms avebe 2014 the relative profitability of starch potato farms also depends on the income starch potato production controlled by avebe and factors outside avebe s control like cultivation costs and the income from other crops wheat and sugar beet the feedback loops b1 b2 and b3 portray in a simplified way the farmers decision making process and offer an explanation to the small changes seen in the average cultivation area in comparison to the large decrease in the number of farms see fig 2 asjes and munneke 2007 hypothesise that the main driver of these trends is the low profitability of starch potato cultivation small farms in the region have very low incomes and often do not find successors asjes and munneke 2007 bont et al 2007 bont and everdingen 2010 these represent most farms that have been lost bont et al 2007 larger farms compensate for the low profitability of starch potatoes by increasing their size asjes and munneke 2007 vos 2019 these dynamics are captured in the model as shown in fig 3 a decrease in the relative profitability of starch potato farms can be compensated for by increasing the cultivation area per farm fig 3 b1 economies of scale farms can increase their cultivation area if there is area available fig 3 b2 scaling however as the total cultivation area in the region is limited not all farms can simultaneously increase in size and the number of farms is constrained fig 3 b3 limits to growth 2 3 quantifying and validating the model structure there is no standard process for turning a diagram into a model often called quantification however there are general steps modellers follow as good practice see more detail in sterman 2000 the steps we followed to quantify the model were a identify and estimate parameters or input variables input variables are those that are not calculated by the model itself but are provided to the model as an input so that it can calculate the remaining variables in an sd model there are often only few inputs as the majority of variables are calculated within the model the model inputs and the data sources used in the model are summarised in table 1 1 1 the time frame 2004 2013 of the fadn data represents the shortest time frame of all the time series data collected from different sources to ensure data compatibility between sources all other time series data were trimmed also to this time frame 2 2 for r script see appendix 3 3 fadn classifies sample farms based on uaa size class based on available data the model assumes that there are three farm sizes small farms 24ha farm medium farms 37ha farm and large farms 130ha farm b define mathematical relationships for remaining variables the causal relationships indicated by arrows in the model diagram are operationalised through mathematical equations the type of equation used will depend on the nature of these relationships e g linear exponential etc eqs 1 and 3 show examples of the equations used in the model the full list of model equations can be found in the appendix 4 4 for the model farms were split into three categories based on the average arable land they occupied small 24 ha farm medium 37 ha farm and large 130 ha farm 1 average farm income eur farm farm profit small farms small farm profit medium farms medium farm profit large farms large total number of farms 2 total available area ha t total available area t dt change in total area loss of available area to other industries or farms dt the model was calibrated against historical data model calibration is the process of estimating the model parameters to obtain a match between observed and simulated behaviours oliva 2003 p 552 the results of the model calibration for five selected indicators are shown in fig 4 as shown in the figure the model is able to reproduce the observed past behaviour patterns of these indicators the inputs of the model see table 1 are time series sourced from historical data sources after 2020 the model is run using the actual values seen in 2020 this can be understood as continuation of the status quo with farmers receiving a starch potato price that maintains relative profits reasonably constant for simplicity we are using this status quo as the departing point of our analysis however we recognise that such equilibrium is not a forecast for a business as usual scenario but instead an extrapolation of the current situation 2 4 resilience to what challenges disturbances based on paas et al 2019 we focused on the system s response to two main challenges in the environmental domain c1 nematodes in the soil and c2 decreasing soil quality in combination with increased occurrence of extreme weather events in addition two main challenges in the economic domain were investigated c3 increasing profits from other crops relative to the profits of starch potatoes and c4 high and rising costs of specialised starch potato farms these challenges have a direct impact on the farmers profits and the feedback loop r1 profits driving growth and r2 co operative benefit as they reduce starch potato production and the profits of farmers and avebe however the nematode pressure c1 has mainly an impact on r2 co operative benefit as avebe s profit depend mostly on the starch production but farmers might compensate lower income from starch potato production with income from other crops to conceptualise these challenges in the model we represented them as system disturbances σ herrera 2017 defines a disturbance σ as shown in eq 3 in terms of the magnitude m of the challenge e g 5 decrease on yields and the time duration d the system is affected by such challenge e g 2 years 3 σ m d where m is the magnitude of the challenge affecting the system of the increase decrease of the variable affected d is the disturbance duration in time units in practice disturbances are changes to the model parameters that happen in the future between a time t and a time t d for simplicity in this analysis it was assumed that the disturbances will affect the system in a t 2021 and that the disturbances will stop within the time horizon considered in the model bender et al 1984 herrera de leon and kopainsky 2019 the four disturbances explored in this study are shown in table 2 using monte carlo simulations 1000 iterations we varied the magnitude m from 0 to 50 following a uniform distribution and the duration number of years the system is affected by each σ from 0 to 20 years following an uniform distribution for each disturbance σ for example for σ2 m varied between 0 ton ha 0 of the 45 ton ha used as a base and 22 5ton ha 50 of the 45 ton ha used as a base for a time period between 0 and 20 years 2 5 assessing resilience using a system dynamics model assessing resilience is not straightforward beisner 2012 tendall et al 2015 but it is possible to get a relative indication of resilience expressing whether a system configuration is more resilient than another system configuration by comparing the simulated behaviour of the system after it has been affected by a disturbance against its behaviour in the absence of a disturbance namely we can look at how big of a disturbance a system can withstand before moving to a different basin of attraction gunderson 2000 426 this is a convenient approach because the change towards a different basin of attraction can be measured but is also evident from inspecting the simulation results for instance fig 5 shows the behaviour of the system when affected by two different disturbances in fig 5a the system changes its behaviour while being affected by a disturbance but as soon as the disturbance ends it bounces back to its original basin of attraction alternatively in fig 5b the same system is affected by a larger disturbance that moves the system to a different basin of attraction when the disturbance ends the system remains in this new state and does not bounce back to its original behaviour in this paper we used the maximum disturbance the system can withstand before changing basin of attraction as a measure of the resilience of the system by simulating the behaviour of the system when exposed to different σ and identifying the smallest combination of m and d σ see eq 3 that could make the behaviour move to a different basin of attraction this proxy for resilience proposed by herrera 2017 as the system elasticity σe offers an easy to calculate parameter to compare resilience between different systems e g current system and modified system a system with a higher σe could be considered more resilient than a system with a lower σe 2 6 modelling strategies to enhance resilience one of the purposes of the modelling exercise is to explore strategies that can improve the resilience of the system in this case by enhancing its response to the tested disturbances for our case study we used a subset of potential strategies identified by paas et al 2019 paas et al 2021 through participatory workshops including farmers and members of avebe the strategies considered are strategy 1 s1 plant breeding to increase starch content strategy 2 s2 increasing average yields by breeding using nematode resistant and climate resilient varieties and by improving farm management practices e g irrigation or precision agriculture strategy 3 s3 increasing value of starch products and extracting and selling potato protein for simplicity the sd model does not include these strategies in detail instead the impact of these strategies was tested separately by modifying parameters e g the starch content directly in the model this approach offered flexibility for testing contributions of each strategy to the system resilience separately the parameters changed in each strategy are shown in table 3 using the model it was possible to simultaneously test the different values considered for each strategy see table 3 while the system was affected by disturbances with different magnitudes and durations see table 2 this approach allowed us to understand the benefits of increasing the value applied for a particular strategy on mitigating the impact of each disturbance tested similarly it also allowed us to identify the impacts that will be more difficult to mitigate with the proposed strategies and to compare the effectiveness of each strategy in terms of its ability to prevent the system moving to a different stability domain 3 results 3 1 simulation results fig 6 shows a base simulation up to the year 2050 based on historical trends of exogenous inputs such as yields costs and prices before 2020 the cultivation area and total number of farms were decreasing figs 6b and 6c while average farm size was increasing fig 6d the starch potato production fig 6a and the average profit per farm fig 6e were fluctuating in the initial years the former showing a slight decrease and the latter a slight increase towards 2020 fig 7 shows the simulated behaviours for each of the variables reported in fig 6 when the system is affected by a disturbance σ2 decrease in average yield in 2020 the results show that there are cases where the system can go back to the original basin of attraction and cases where the system moves towards a new basin of attraction as explained in section 2 of all the simulations produced in the monte carlo experiment we were only interested in those cases that result in the system moving to a new basin of attraction we were interested in identifying the smallest combination of m and d that produced such behaviour elasticity table 4 shows the elasticities for the four disturbances considered in this study and the two main outcome functions of the system starch potato production and farm income the results in the table show that the system is more resilient to changes in production costs of starch potato σ4 than it is to an increase in profits of other crops σ3 something similar can be said about the comparison between σ4 and the environmental disturbances affecting starch potato yields σ1 and σ2 as can be seen in table 3 the same outcome function starch potato production farm income shows different degrees of resilience to different disturbances for example the system s elasticity and hence the system resilience of the average starch potato production is larger for σ4 than for environmental disturbances σ1 and σ2 the lower resilience to environmental disturbances can be at least partially explained by the r2 cooperative benefit in fig 3 environmental disturbances σ1 and σ2 directly affecting the starch potato production reduce avebe s net profits and affect their ability to pay high prices to farmers this results in farming facing simultaneously the challenge of having low production volumes and low prices alternatively if the disturbances are mainly economic and affect the farm income σ4 directly then the effect on avebe s net profits is low and avebe will be in a better position to compensate farmers for higher costs by increasing the price paid for the starch potatoes these differences in the system responses highlight the importance of r2 in farmers resilience to economic disturbances and suggest that r2 and social self organisation is an important resilience attribute 3 2 strategies to enhance resilience the three strategies proposed before s1 increasing starch content s2 increasing average yield by means of decreasing yield variability s3 increasing avebe product value were introduced to the model by modifying parameters see table 3 in 2020 and onwards implementation delays were not considered fig 8 illustrates the impact of the strategies considered on the resilience to the four disturbances these charts show the end state of the system when the disturbance and strategies take different values the colour of the dots represent whether the system was change dark dots or not no change empty dots in a different basin of attraction at the end of the simulation for all the strategies and increase in the x axis represents and increase in the values used of each strategy for example for the strategy 1 s1 as we move to the right values in the x axis increase the of increase in the starch potato used in the simulation increases likewise an increase in the y axis values reflects an increase in the severity of the disturbances the straight lines illustrate the boundaries between the combinations that result in changes to the basin of attraction 4 discussion the first aim of this study was to explore the impact disturbances might have on the long term performance of the starch potato farming system in the veenkoloniën region the results of our study show that environmental challenges reducing starch potato yields were found to have a higher impact in the system and relatively small changes in yields might move the starch potato production and the farmers income to a different less favourable basin of attraction for instance to shift the farmers income to a different stability domain farm cost will need to double 102 increase for σ4 in table 4 while the same results are seen when yields decrease by 33 4 over a year see σ3 in table 4 these results support the perception of the veenkoloniën stakeholders who participated workshops organised as part of the surefarm project and indicated that the number of farmers will decline considerably if extreme weather events significantly decrease yields these differences between the resilience to economic and environmental factors leads us to our second research question as we use the model to understand the feedback loops within the system structure that influence condition the resilience of the system as other authors have hypothesised see for example meuwissen et al 2019 the apparent resilience of the farming system in the veenkoloniën is probably driven by its relation with avebe the simulation results indicate that this symbiotic relationship between avebe and the farmers is indeed an enabler of resilience to economic challenges and that there is a clear difference in the system resilience to those disturbances the cooperative benefit r2 in fig 3 can help with and those it cannot it is important to highlight that resilience resulting from this symbiotic relationship between farmers and avebe might be bounded by other mechanisms for example when considering avebe s financial position it can be seen that the same cash reserves used by avebe to support farmers during difficult times are also needed for innovation that is required to increase product value and maintain farmers competitiveness in the future when yields are low r2 takes priority over r3 and r6 in those years profit will be invested in paying the right price rather than in innovation as was done in 2018 however if the disturbances are too severe avebe loses its ability to innovate as it depletes its cash reserves when this threshold is crossed the system experiences larger impacts for longer times and moves to new basins of attraction that are likely to be unsustainable for both avebe and the farmers while resilience is often associated with sustainability there are some scenarios in which resilience might undermine the sustainability of the system sustainability for instance resilience can be improved in the short term e g by reinforcing the ability of a farming system to maintain a high production level at the expense of resilience and sustainability in the long term if e g a production level is threatening natural resources which diminishes the ability to keep maintaining this production level carpenter et al 2001 peterson 2018 robertson 2005 van apeldoorn 2011 this phenomenon occurs when the sustainability goals of policy makers as representatives for society are in conflict with the productivity goals of other actors in agricultural systems including the farmers and agro industries peterson 2018 finding a right balance between sustainability and resilience is an important aspect of the dynamics between farmers and cooperatives that is not only relevant to the veenkoloniën but also to other farming systems in europe it is also a clear example that decisions actors make regarding their resources are not only relevant for resilience in the short term but also on the long term mathijs and wauters 2020 our exploration of potential strategies to enhance resilience yielded three main insights first it can be noticed that the number of cases in which the system remains within the same basin of attraction increases with the implementation of any of the resilience enhancing strategies that we tested it can thus can be concluded that all the strategies could be expected to increase to some extent the size of the disturbance the system can withstand and hence increase resilience the results also show that the proposed strategies are less effective for increasing resilience to environmental disturbances σ1 and σ2 than to economic ones σ3 and σ4 this difference can be seen in the difference between the areas covered by open dots in fig 8a 8f showing effectiveness against disturbances σ1 and σ2 and the same area in fig 8g 8l showing effectiveness against disturbances σ3 and σ4 for instance a decrease of starch potato in the crop rotation σ1 by over 40 or a decrease of the average yields by more than 30 σ2 always resulted in a system shift to a different basin of attraction regardless of how aggressively successfully the strategies could be implemented finally the results in fig 8 also show that s1 increasing starch content and s3 increasing avebe product value outperform s2 increasing average yield by means of decreasing yield variability in their effectiveness for increasing resilience to all the disturbances examined the only considerable difference between the s1 and s3 was observed when analysing the resilience of the system to an increase in production costs of starch potato see σ4 in fig 8 in this case s1 outperforms s3 considerably and even moderate increases in the starch content e g less than 20 increase in starch content increased the resilience of the system considerably an important aspect of our analysis that requires further consideration is the role of randomness in the occurrence of extreme weather events currently we assumed equal probabilities for all potential disturbances in the tested intervals of magnitude and duration but we recognise that some events are more likely than others introducing the effect of random events in the analysis might change not only our conclusions about the resilience of the system but also our observations regarding the effectiveness of strategies similarly analysing the impact of stochasticity on innovation breakthroughs could also reveal new insights about the farming system and its potential development 5 conclusions the behaviour of farming systems and other complex socio ecological systems is the result of many different actors and components interacting within the system when dealing with these types of systems system dynamics offers considerable benefits to understand the processes that influence system resilience as presented in this paper sd allows assessing resilience by providing a quantitative basis for the analysis of and insights about how and why the system might respond to disturbances the results of this study support perceptions of stakeholders and the results of other studies raising concerns about the long term resilience of the system in the veenkolonië in particular it seems that the system is more vulnerable to ecological disturbances affecting potato yields like droughts due to climate change or nematodes pressure than it is to economic and market disturbances this is understandable when looking at the structure of the system because the resilience of the system has been so far driven by avebe through market strategies that have allowed the producers in the region to remain competitive our results also highlight the important role of social self organisation for the resilience of the system the reinforcing loop linking the farmers and avebe drives innovation and adaptability and increases resilience hence as shown in this paper the strategies that enhance the symbiotic relationship between avebe and the farmers are likely to be more effective than those that focus only on one side of the system on the one hand the cooperative creates a catalytic environment that can be exploited by initiatives aiming to increase resilience and as shown in the analysis those strategies that align better with avebe s feedback loop mechanisms are more effective however because avebe s strategies are mainly focused on economic and market mechanisms all strategies explored had limited success in increasing resilience to environmental challenges it can be hypothesised that having other forms of social self organisation orientated towards dealing with these challenges could potentially be the key to unlock further opportunities to enhance resilience social self organisation is often identified as an enabler of resilience and the experience in the veenkoloniën might inspire stakeholders in other farming systems to implement similar structures in their own contexts the sd model and quantitative results presented in this paper bring it to live by operationalising its causal mechanisms we think this model and further modifications of it can be used for investigating the benefits and drawbacks of social self organisation to the resilience of farming systems understanding the successes and challenges of case studies like the veenkoloniën is instrumental to develop an environment that enables resilience without compromising the long term sustainability of the system credit authorship contribution statement h herrera conceptualization writing review editing validation formal analysis

24513,farming systems in europe are facing economic social environmental and institutional challenges highly intensive climate exposed arable farming systems like the veenkoloniën in the north of the netherlands are particularly vulnerable to many of these challenges just in the past twenty years the veenkoloniën has lost half of its small and medium sized family farms specialised in cultivating starch potatoes while starch potato production continues to be stable as the remaining farms are increasing the size of their operation local stakeholders are concerned that the farming system in the veenkoloniën is endangered in this paper we investigate this issue by using a system dynamics simulation model to explore what the potential structures are that could threaten the long term future of starch potato production and to identify leverage points that can enhance the resilience of the system our analysis shows that so far farmers active engagement in a processing cooperative has been an important element to their resilience to cope with economic and environmental challenges in practice the cooperative has been able to act as a buffer and stabilise prices for farmers in the region by implementing strategies that increase the value of their products open new markets and increase starch potato production key words system dynamics research analysis farming systems 1 introduction farming systems are a complex component of food systems they are primarily focused on food production farming systems consist of all the subcomponents that are pertinent to farm production but they have blurred boundaries with other components of the food system e g retailing processing etc and involve a wide range of stakeholders and players fao 2021 as a consequence farming systems address multiple and sometimes competing objectives like increasing production improving the quality of farmers livelihoods and enhancing environmental sustainability in trying to meet these objectives farming systems in europe are facing an increasingly broad range of environmental economic social and institutional challenges meuwissen et al 2020 operating in this complex environment requires stakeholders to anticipate the challenges ahead and to prepare for them by enhancing the resilience of farming systems one of the many farming systems working towards achieving long term sustainability in an increasingly challenging environment is the farming system in the veenkoloniën in the netherlands traditionally this farming system has been dominated by the cultivation of starch potato in a rotation with cereals and sugar beets a review of the starch potato production in the region conducted by bont et al 2007 found that the production of starch from potatoes accounted for up to 50 of the income of arable farms and supported more than 7000 direct and indirect jobs in the region the presence of avebe an agro industrial cooperative dedicated to starch processing has resulted in stable prices and demand for the farmers in the area avebe is the only company in the netherlands that processes starch from potatoes and currently has 1400 members approximately 900 in the veenkoloniën that are supplying a steady flow of starch potatoes every year avebe 2018b klok 2019 avebe receives roughly half of all its starch potato supply from the veenkoloniën this supply represents about one third of the global market share of the starch potato value chain strijker 2008 all the starch potato growers in the veenkoloniën own avebe shares which come with the obligation to deliver starch potatoes to avebe van dijk et al 2019 avebe s factories process the potatoes that are produced by all shareholders and sell the resulting starch or other products for an added value on the world market the profits of avebe then get redistributed back to the shareholders according to the volume and quality of starch potatoes they delivered and the number of shares they own avebe 2018a so far this synergy between avebe and the starch potato farmers in the veenkoloniën has proven successful and has helped farmers to overcome significant challenges like the elimination of subsidies thanks to innovation and vertical integration driven by avebe meuwissen et al 2019 however there are growing concerns amongst local stakeholders in the veenkoloniën that this success might be reaching its limits and that starch potato cultivation might stop being a profitable economic activity in the region e g diogo et al 2017 while the amount of starch potato produced and the cultivated area in the region have kept increasing since 2000 the number of farms cultivating starch potatoes has decreased significantly the substantial reduction in the number of farmers potentially due to poor economic performance of smaller producers raises questions about how resilient the system is and whether it will be able to withstand future challenges this paper develops a simulation model to explore how this farming system might respond to future challenges in simple terms resilience describes the capacity of a system to absorb a disturbance and to reorganise itself in ways that allow it to operate under new conditions biggs et al 2012 folke 2006 walker et al 2002 2004 a common way to conceptualise resilience is to think of the system moving about within a particular region in state space in which the system tends to remain within the same stable state beisner et al 2003 or basin of attraction walker et al 2004 p 5 the various basins of attraction that a system may occupy within this region and the boundaries that separate them are known as stability landscapes walker et al 2004 complex systems are known to have multiple basins of attraction within a stability landscape walker et al 2004 beisner et al 2003 and resilience is often conceptualised in terms of the system potential to withstand disturbances without shifting from their current often desirable basin of attraction to a different one folke et al 2010 when systems are affected by a disturbance they might alternate between basins of attractions return to the same configuration after a small disturbance or shift to a different basin of attraction after a large one beisner et al 2003 failure to anticipate these shifts between basins of attraction can be costly and sometimes even catastrophic carpenter et al 2001 an alternative to anticipating shifts between basin of attractions is to use simulation models to explore the impact disturbances have in the variables and processes that control the system s behaviour bennett et al 2005 rodriguez gonzalez et al 2020 complex systems are characterised by comprehensive mechanisms that push the system toward a particular basin of attraction when affected by a disturbance a chain reaction of changes through the system triggers feedback loop mechanisms that either move the system toward a different basin of attraction or help it to remain within the current one resilience alliance 2010 the aims of this study were threefold first we aimed to explore the impact disturbances might have on the long term performance of the starch potato farming system in the veenkoloniën region second we aimed to explore the feedback loops within the system structure that influence condition the resilience of the system finally our third goal was to use the insights gained to identify potential strategies that might help to increase the resilience of this farming system the paper proceeds as follow we start by describing the simulation model developed to characterise the starch potato system in the veenkoloniën next we elaborate on the steps we followed to use this model in the assessment of the resilience of the system these sections are followed by the results and analysis sections where we summarise and reflect on the main insights gained from our research 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling methodology system dynamics sd is a modelling methodology grounded in control theory with a focus on understanding how feedback loop mechanisms drive the behaviour of a system marandure et al 2020 kopainsky et al 2018 lane 2008 sterman 2000 and ford 1999 sd focuses on exploring and improving the performance of complex systems forrester 1961 and has been widely used to model socio ecological systems in a variety of contexts e g lopes and videira 2017 kopainsky et al 2015 bueno and basurto 2009 the purpose of sd is to identify the structure of a system system variables and their relationship that generates observed system behaviour so that solutions can be identified and tested in the model with this aim sd modellers build a formal simulation model that overcomes cognitive limitations to grasp the complexity of the system and allows to make reliable inferences about the system behaviour morecroft 1988 an important initial step in the modelling process is the development of the so called dynamic hypothesis richardson 1981 i e a feedback loop structure that is hypothesized to cause observed and or experienced behaviour sterman 2000 the process to derive this dynamic hypothesis varies from case to case in this study the dynamic hypothesis was developed using qualitative text data and stakeholder mental models presented in the deliverables of the horizon 2020 sure farm project towards sustainable and resilient eu farming systems reidsma 2019 reidsma et al 2020 paas et al 2021 the aim of the dynamic hypothesis is to make the causal structure driving system behaviour explicit in practice this is often done by capturing causal relationships between different variables in causal loop diagrams clds clds use one way arrows indicating that the indicator from which the arrow originates is the cause of change in the indicator at which the arrow is pointed the direction of this change is indicated using or letters next to the arrow heads a indicates that both variables change in the same direction for example if one increases the other also increases while a indicated that the variable at the end of the arrow changes in the opposite direction than the one at the nod see fig 1 for an example the term feedback loop is used to indicate circular causal relationships like the ones shown in figure generally there are two types of feedback loops balancing loops represented with a b and reinforcing loops represented with an r morecroft 2015 ford 2009 in a balancing loop b a change in the condition of a given variable leads to a counteracting or balancing change when the effects are traced around the loop by comparison a reinforcing loop r amplifies or reinforces change in a realistic multi loop system behaviour over time arises from the interplay of balancing and reinforcing loops the interplay of feedback loops quickly results in complex behaviour patterns that require computer simulation the dynamic hypothesis captured in a cld is therefore translated into a simulation model by using mathematical equations to represent the relationships between variables and validated by comparing the simulated behaviour against historical reference modes of behaviour in this case we used country and regional statistical data to inform and quantify model structure and variable choices next we briefly present the model structure by describing the main feedback loop mechanisms captured in the model more details about the model equations can be found in the appendix and in schütz 2020 2 2 model structure the aim of this study was to produce a model that can a explain the dynamics driving the decline seen in the number of starch potato farms in the veenkoloniën see fig 2 b simulate the expected behaviour of the system in terms of starch potato production and farm income and c allow us to explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of strategies identified in the sure farm project that aim to contribute to maintaining a stable number of starch potato farms in the region the model represents both the economic dynamics happening within farms and the dynamics between farms and the cooperative avebe as mentioned before avebe is believed to have been a critical component for the sustainability of the farming system in the past and remains an instrumental part of the system when trying to understand production and income of farmers in simple terms the model developed provides the outputs for the system indicators starch potato production total cultivation area farm number farm size and farm income assumes profitability of starch potato cultivation as the main driver of system behaviour simulates the consequences of farmers decisions to either scale up to improve profitability or to stop cultivating starch potatoes differentiates between the behaviour of small farms as opposed to larger farms explores the feedback between starch potato production and avebe allows testing of the impact of challenges and strategies on model behaviour the main balancing b and reinforcing r loops in the model can be examined in three parts 1 the feedback loops r1 b1 b2 and b3 that describe only starch potato farms and farmers decisions 2 the feedback loops r2 and b4 that describe the interaction between starch potato farmers and avebe 3 the feedback loops b5 r3 until r6 that describe avebe and their strategies of the feedback loops in fig 3 the feedback loop r2 co operative benefit is of particular importance because it captures the relationship between the farmers and the co operative feedback loop r2 can be read as follows the total starch potato production is the product of the total cultivation area the fraction of starch potato in the crop rotation plan and the starch potato yield see fig 3c the total volume of starch potatoes is delivered to avebe and processed into starch and other products the net profit of avebe is determined by the price of their products price paid to avebe and their total costs this net profit is used to pay farmers a price that will maintain a reasonable profitability compared to profits from other crops avebe depends on this steady flow of starch potatoes and thus depends on maintaining their member pool or at least their combined cultivation area beldman 2015 bont et al 2007 the cooperative is therefore committed to maintaining a reasonable relative profitability of starch potato farms avebe 2014 the relative profitability of starch potato farms also depends on the income starch potato production controlled by avebe and factors outside avebe s control like cultivation costs and the income from other crops wheat and sugar beet the feedback loops b1 b2 and b3 portray in a simplified way the farmers decision making process and offer an explanation to the small changes seen in the average cultivation area in comparison to the large decrease in the number of farms see fig 2 asjes and munneke 2007 hypothesise that the main driver of these trends is the low profitability of starch potato cultivation small farms in the region have very low incomes and often do not find successors asjes and munneke 2007 bont et al 2007 bont and everdingen 2010 these represent most farms that have been lost bont et al 2007 larger farms compensate for the low profitability of starch potatoes by increasing their size asjes and munneke 2007 vos 2019 these dynamics are captured in the model as shown in fig 3 a decrease in the relative profitability of starch potato farms can be compensated for by increasing the cultivation area per farm fig 3 b1 economies of scale farms can increase their cultivation area if there is area available fig 3 b2 scaling however as the total cultivation area in the region is limited not all farms can simultaneously increase in size and the number of farms is constrained fig 3 b3 limits to growth 2 3 quantifying and validating the model structure there is no standard process for turning a diagram into a model often called quantification however there are general steps modellers follow as good practice see more detail in sterman 2000 the steps we followed to quantify the model were a identify and estimate parameters or input variables input variables are those that are not calculated by the model itself but are provided to the model as an input so that it can calculate the remaining variables in an sd model there are often only few inputs as the majority of variables are calculated within the model the model inputs and the data sources used in the model are summarised in table 1 1 1 the time frame 2004 2013 of the fadn data represents the shortest time frame of all the time series data collected from different sources to ensure data compatibility between sources all other time series data were trimmed also to this time frame 2 2 for r script see appendix 3 3 fadn classifies sample farms based on uaa size class based on available data the model assumes that there are three farm sizes small farms 24ha farm medium farms 37ha farm and large farms 130ha farm b define mathematical relationships for remaining variables the causal relationships indicated by arrows in the model diagram are operationalised through mathematical equations the type of equation used will depend on the nature of these relationships e g linear exponential etc eqs 1 and 3 show examples of the equations used in the model the full list of model equations can be found in the appendix 4 4 for the model farms were split into three categories based on the average arable land they occupied small 24 ha farm medium 37 ha farm and large 130 ha farm 1 average farm income eur farm farm profit small farms small farm profit medium farms medium farm profit large farms large total number of farms 2 total available area ha t total available area t dt change in total area loss of available area to other industries or farms dt the model was calibrated against historical data model calibration is the process of estimating the model parameters to obtain a match between observed and simulated behaviours oliva 2003 p 552 the results of the model calibration for five selected indicators are shown in fig 4 as shown in the figure the model is able to reproduce the observed past behaviour patterns of these indicators the inputs of the model see table 1 are time series sourced from historical data sources after 2020 the model is run using the actual values seen in 2020 this can be understood as continuation of the status quo with farmers receiving a starch potato price that maintains relative profits reasonably constant for simplicity we are using this status quo as the departing point of our analysis however we recognise that such equilibrium is not a forecast for a business as usual scenario but instead an extrapolation of the current situation 2 4 resilience to what challenges disturbances based on paas et al 2019 we focused on the system s response to two main challenges in the environmental domain c1 nematodes in the soil and c2 decreasing soil quality in combination with increased occurrence of extreme weather events in addition two main challenges in the economic domain were investigated c3 increasing profits from other crops relative to the profits of starch potatoes and c4 high and rising costs of specialised starch potato farms these challenges have a direct impact on the farmers profits and the feedback loop r1 profits driving growth and r2 co operative benefit as they reduce starch potato production and the profits of farmers and avebe however the nematode pressure c1 has mainly an impact on r2 co operative benefit as avebe s profit depend mostly on the starch production but farmers might compensate lower income from starch potato production with income from other crops to conceptualise these challenges in the model we represented them as system disturbances σ herrera 2017 defines a disturbance σ as shown in eq 3 in terms of the magnitude m of the challenge e g 5 decrease on yields and the time duration d the system is affected by such challenge e g 2 years 3 σ m d where m is the magnitude of the challenge affecting the system of the increase decrease of the variable affected d is the disturbance duration in time units in practice disturbances are changes to the model parameters that happen in the future between a time t and a time t d for simplicity in this analysis it was assumed that the disturbances will affect the system in a t 2021 and that the disturbances will stop within the time horizon considered in the model bender et al 1984 herrera de leon and kopainsky 2019 the four disturbances explored in this study are shown in table 2 using monte carlo simulations 1000 iterations we varied the magnitude m from 0 to 50 following a uniform distribution and the duration number of years the system is affected by each σ from 0 to 20 years following an uniform distribution for each disturbance σ for example for σ2 m varied between 0 ton ha 0 of the 45 ton ha used as a base and 22 5ton ha 50 of the 45 ton ha used as a base for a time period between 0 and 20 years 2 5 assessing resilience using a system dynamics model assessing resilience is not straightforward beisner 2012 tendall et al 2015 but it is possible to get a relative indication of resilience expressing whether a system configuration is more resilient than another system configuration by comparing the simulated behaviour of the system after it has been affected by a disturbance against its behaviour in the absence of a disturbance namely we can look at how big of a disturbance a system can withstand before moving to a different basin of attraction gunderson 2000 426 this is a convenient approach because the change towards a different basin of attraction can be measured but is also evident from inspecting the simulation results for instance fig 5 shows the behaviour of the system when affected by two different disturbances in fig 5a the system changes its behaviour while being affected by a disturbance but as soon as the disturbance ends it bounces back to its original basin of attraction alternatively in fig 5b the same system is affected by a larger disturbance that moves the system to a different basin of attraction when the disturbance ends the system remains in this new state and does not bounce back to its original behaviour in this paper we used the maximum disturbance the system can withstand before changing basin of attraction as a measure of the resilience of the system by simulating the behaviour of the system when exposed to different σ and identifying the smallest combination of m and d σ see eq 3 that could make the behaviour move to a different basin of attraction this proxy for resilience proposed by herrera 2017 as the system elasticity σe offers an easy to calculate parameter to compare resilience between different systems e g current system and modified system a system with a higher σe could be considered more resilient than a system with a lower σe 2 6 modelling strategies to enhance resilience one of the purposes of the modelling exercise is to explore strategies that can improve the resilience of the system in this case by enhancing its response to the tested disturbances for our case study we used a subset of potential strategies identified by paas et al 2019 paas et al 2021 through participatory workshops including farmers and members of avebe the strategies considered are strategy 1 s1 plant breeding to increase starch content strategy 2 s2 increasing average yields by breeding using nematode resistant and climate resilient varieties and by improving farm management practices e g irrigation or precision agriculture strategy 3 s3 increasing value of starch products and extracting and selling potato protein for simplicity the sd model does not include these strategies in detail instead the impact of these strategies was tested separately by modifying parameters e g the starch content directly in the model this approach offered flexibility for testing contributions of each strategy to the system resilience separately the parameters changed in each strategy are shown in table 3 using the model it was possible to simultaneously test the different values considered for each strategy see table 3 while the system was affected by disturbances with different magnitudes and durations see table 2 this approach allowed us to understand the benefits of increasing the value applied for a particular strategy on mitigating the impact of each disturbance tested similarly it also allowed us to identify the impacts that will be more difficult to mitigate with the proposed strategies and to compare the effectiveness of each strategy in terms of its ability to prevent the system moving to a different stability domain 3 results 3 1 simulation results fig 6 shows a base simulation up to the year 2050 based on historical trends of exogenous inputs such as yields costs and prices before 2020 the cultivation area and total number of farms were decreasing figs 6b and 6c while average farm size was increasing fig 6d the starch potato production fig 6a and the average profit per farm fig 6e were fluctuating in the initial years the former showing a slight decrease and the latter a slight increase towards 2020 fig 7 shows the simulated behaviours for each of the variables reported in fig 6 when the system is affected by a disturbance σ2 decrease in average yield in 2020 the results show that there are cases where the system can go back to the original basin of attraction and cases where the system moves towards a new basin of attraction as explained in section 2 of all the simulations produced in the monte carlo experiment we were only interested in those cases that result in the system moving to a new basin of attraction we were interested in identifying the smallest combination of m and d that produced such behaviour elasticity table 4 shows the elasticities for the four disturbances considered in this study and the two main outcome functions of the system starch potato production and farm income the results in the table show that the system is more resilient to changes in production costs of starch potato σ4 than it is to an increase in profits of other crops σ3 something similar can be said about the comparison between σ4 and the environmental disturbances affecting starch potato yields σ1 and σ2 as can be seen in table 3 the same outcome function starch potato production farm income shows different degrees of resilience to different disturbances for example the system s elasticity and hence the system resilience of the average starch potato production is larger for σ4 than for environmental disturbances σ1 and σ2 the lower resilience to environmental disturbances can be at least partially explained by the r2 cooperative benefit in fig 3 environmental disturbances σ1 and σ2 directly affecting the starch potato production reduce avebe s net profits and affect their ability to pay high prices to farmers this results in farming facing simultaneously the challenge of having low production volumes and low prices alternatively if the disturbances are mainly economic and affect the farm income σ4 directly then the effect on avebe s net profits is low and avebe will be in a better position to compensate farmers for higher costs by increasing the price paid for the starch potatoes these differences in the system responses highlight the importance of r2 in farmers resilience to economic disturbances and suggest that r2 and social self organisation is an important resilience attribute 3 2 strategies to enhance resilience the three strategies proposed before s1 increasing starch content s2 increasing average yield by means of decreasing yield variability s3 increasing avebe product value were introduced to the model by modifying parameters see table 3 in 2020 and onwards implementation delays were not considered fig 8 illustrates the impact of the strategies considered on the resilience to the four disturbances these charts show the end state of the system when the disturbance and strategies take different values the colour of the dots represent whether the system was change dark dots or not no change empty dots in a different basin of attraction at the end of the simulation for all the strategies and increase in the x axis represents and increase in the values used of each strategy for example for the strategy 1 s1 as we move to the right values in the x axis increase the of increase in the starch potato used in the simulation increases likewise an increase in the y axis values reflects an increase in the severity of the disturbances the straight lines illustrate the boundaries between the combinations that result in changes to the basin of attraction 4 discussion the first aim of this study was to explore the impact disturbances might have on the long term performance of the starch potato farming system in the veenkoloniën region the results of our study show that environmental challenges reducing starch potato yields were found to have a higher impact in the system and relatively small changes in yields might move the starch potato production and the farmers income to a different less favourable basin of attraction for instance to shift the farmers income to a different stability domain farm cost will need to double 102 increase for σ4 in table 4 while the same results are seen when yields decrease by 33 4 over a year see σ3 in table 4 these results support the perception of the veenkoloniën stakeholders who participated workshops organised as part of the surefarm project and indicated that the number of farmers will decline considerably if extreme weather events significantly decrease yields these differences between the resilience to economic and environmental factors leads us to our second research question as we use the model to understand the feedback loops within the system structure that influence condition the resilience of the system as other authors have hypothesised see for example meuwissen et al 2019 the apparent resilience of the farming system in the veenkoloniën is probably driven by its relation with avebe the simulation results indicate that this symbiotic relationship between avebe and the farmers is indeed an enabler of resilience to economic challenges and that there is a clear difference in the system resilience to those disturbances the cooperative benefit r2 in fig 3 can help with and those it cannot it is important to highlight that resilience resulting from this symbiotic relationship between farmers and avebe might be bounded by other mechanisms for example when considering avebe s financial position it can be seen that the same cash reserves used by avebe to support farmers during difficult times are also needed for innovation that is required to increase product value and maintain farmers competitiveness in the future when yields are low r2 takes priority over r3 and r6 in those years profit will be invested in paying the right price rather than in innovation as was done in 2018 however if the disturbances are too severe avebe loses its ability to innovate as it depletes its cash reserves when this threshold is crossed the system experiences larger impacts for longer times and moves to new basins of attraction that are likely to be unsustainable for both avebe and the farmers while resilience is often associated with sustainability there are some scenarios in which resilience might undermine the sustainability of the system sustainability for instance resilience can be improved in the short term e g by reinforcing the ability of a farming system to maintain a high production level at the expense of resilience and sustainability in the long term if e g a production level is threatening natural resources which diminishes the ability to keep maintaining this production level carpenter et al 2001 peterson 2018 robertson 2005 van apeldoorn 2011 this phenomenon occurs when the sustainability goals of policy makers as representatives for society are in conflict with the productivity goals of other actors in agricultural systems including the farmers and agro industries peterson 2018 finding a right balance between sustainability and resilience is an important aspect of the dynamics between farmers and cooperatives that is not only relevant to the veenkoloniën but also to other farming systems in europe it is also a clear example that decisions actors make regarding their resources are not only relevant for resilience in the short term but also on the long term mathijs and wauters 2020 our exploration of potential strategies to enhance resilience yielded three main insights first it can be noticed that the number of cases in which the system remains within the same basin of attraction increases with the implementation of any of the resilience enhancing strategies that we tested it can thus can be concluded that all the strategies could be expected to increase to some extent the size of the disturbance the system can withstand and hence increase resilience the results also show that the proposed strategies are less effective for increasing resilience to environmental disturbances σ1 and σ2 than to economic ones σ3 and σ4 this difference can be seen in the difference between the areas covered by open dots in fig 8a 8f showing effectiveness against disturbances σ1 and σ2 and the same area in fig 8g 8l showing effectiveness against disturbances σ3 and σ4 for instance a decrease of starch potato in the crop rotation σ1 by over 40 or a decrease of the average yields by more than 30 σ2 always resulted in a system shift to a different basin of attraction regardless of how aggressively successfully the strategies could be implemented finally the results in fig 8 also show that s1 increasing starch content and s3 increasing avebe product value outperform s2 increasing average yield by means of decreasing yield variability in their effectiveness for increasing resilience to all the disturbances examined the only considerable difference between the s1 and s3 was observed when analysing the resilience of the system to an increase in production costs of starch potato see σ4 in fig 8 in this case s1 outperforms s3 considerably and even moderate increases in the starch content e g less than 20 increase in starch content increased the resilience of the system considerably an important aspect of our analysis that requires further consideration is the role of randomness in the occurrence of extreme weather events currently we assumed equal probabilities for all potential disturbances in the tested intervals of magnitude and duration but we recognise that some events are more likely than others introducing the effect of random events in the analysis might change not only our conclusions about the resilience of the system but also our observations regarding the effectiveness of strategies similarly analysing the impact of stochasticity on innovation breakthroughs could also reveal new insights about the farming system and its potential development 5 conclusions the behaviour of farming systems and other complex socio ecological systems is the result of many different actors and components interacting within the system when dealing with these types of systems system dynamics offers considerable benefits to understand the processes that influence system resilience as presented in this paper sd allows assessing resilience by providing a quantitative basis for the analysis of and insights about how and why the system might respond to disturbances the results of this study support perceptions of stakeholders and the results of other studies raising concerns about the long term resilience of the system in the veenkolonië in particular it seems that the system is more vulnerable to ecological disturbances affecting potato yields like droughts due to climate change or nematodes pressure than it is to economic and market disturbances this is understandable when looking at the structure of the system because the resilience of the system has been so far driven by avebe through market strategies that have allowed the producers in the region to remain competitive our results also highlight the important role of social self organisation for the resilience of the system the reinforcing loop linking the farmers and avebe drives innovation and adaptability and increases resilience hence as shown in this paper the strategies that enhance the symbiotic relationship between avebe and the farmers are likely to be more effective than those that focus only on one side of the system on the one hand the cooperative creates a catalytic environment that can be exploited by initiatives aiming to increase resilience and as shown in the analysis those strategies that align better with avebe s feedback loop mechanisms are more effective however because avebe s strategies are mainly focused on economic and market mechanisms all strategies explored had limited success in increasing resilience to environmental challenges it can be hypothesised that having other forms of social self organisation orientated towards dealing with these challenges could potentially be the key to unlock further opportunities to enhance resilience social self organisation is often identified as an enabler of resilience and the experience in the veenkoloniën might inspire stakeholders in other farming systems to implement similar structures in their own contexts the sd model and quantitative results presented in this paper bring it to live by operationalising its causal mechanisms we think this model and further modifications of it can be used for investigating the benefits and drawbacks of social self organisation to the resilience of farming systems understanding the successes and challenges of case studies like the veenkoloniën is instrumental to develop an environment that enables resilience without compromising the long term sustainability of the system credit authorship contribution statement h herrera conceptualization writing review editing validation formal analysis

and manufacturing has been significantly affected by urbanization industrialization and national development policies resulting in regional man land contradiction in this complex region scientifically measuring the land use land cover lulc dynamics and exploring the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the lulc changes are important tasks for local officials and decision makers in the management of urban expansion and land use planning in this study an integrated logistic multi criteria evaluation mce cellular automata ca markov logistic mce ca markov model and a geographic information system gis were used to evaluate and predict the lulc changes the analysis was based on six lulc maps at equal temporal intervals derived from land use data for 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 along with topographic spatial layers elevation and slope derived from an aster digital elevation model in addition other spatial variables points of interest gross domestic product gdp population density proximity to urban center and proximity to transportation line were incorporated in the simulation process the simulated results obtained by the integrated logistic mce ca markov model had a kappa coefficient of 88 582 and a figure of merit value of 27 935 the results indicated that under the influence of the various factors the future land use pattern of the wuhan metropolitan area will be clearly transformed from 2015 to 2025 it is predicted that the area of arable land and woodland will decrease by 1506 152 km2 and 1743 945 km2 respectively and urban land expansion will mainly come from arable land woodland and other construction land with the enhancement of the human disturbance intensity the natural landscape patches will become segmented and the number of individual patches will increase gradually enhancing the spatial heterogeneity the simulation results could not only be used to monitor future lulc trends but could also help local decision makers to provide policy support for land use planning and management keywords land use land cover change landscape pattern urban expansion ca markov wuhan metropolitan area 1 introduction and

international geosphere biosphere programme igbp and the global land programme glp have made lulc change a central theme in global change research purvaja et al 2015 wang et al 2012 in 2012 the international council for science ics and the international social science council issc launched the future earth research plan dawes 2020 soyez 2016 through this detailed research it is expected that the goal of sustainable development can be achieved in the future thus the monitoring and simulation of lulc changes has gradually become the focus of earth surface system research land use research typically focuses on land use surveying land resource evaluation and land use planning tarawally et al 2019 pielke 2011 with the development of the social economy the diversification of land use dynamics is manifested as the change of land use types at different scales lagrosa et al 2018 under the influence of multiple factors different land use types show their differences in different places at the same time or in different time schedules under various environmental influences siyavus 2021 the variation of this difference is restricted by the local socioeconomic and topographic conditions as well as the land use planning and land space management of local decision makers the rapid increase of the global population and the rural population converging into cities is leading to increased demand for urban land space appiah et al 2020 chen et al 2020 a large amount of land around cities is being reclaimed to meet the requirements of socioeconomic development and urban land expansion li et al 2015 in recent decades the agglomeration of urban land has increased and many different land use types have been converted into urban land however the excessive reclamation of production land and ecological land around urban areas is resulting in severe man land contradiction and serious ecological problems urbanization is the most direct carrier of lulc change but can produce a series of regional ecological problems du and huang 2017 barlow et al 2021 such as the heat island effect vojvodikova et al 2020 environmental pollution chen et al 2012 boix and diaz 1998 soil erosion wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c xu and zhang 2020 biodiversity reduction escribano et al 2016 kati et al 2021 and habitat destruction cosentino and brubaker 2018 gomes et al 2021 many environmental problems are closely related to rapid urban expansion meanwhile these environmental problems have also caused drastic changes to the urban landscape pattern larson et al 2020 pavageau et al 2018 frazier 2019 when the process of landscape ecological evolution is disturbed the material circulation and energy flow are both hindered in time and space wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c li et al 2017 which eventually results in regional ecological and environmental problems to promote the optimization of land use structure in ecological barrier areas it is of great value to study the lulc change caused by rapid urban expansion at present the spatial technology of remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis has been more and more widely applied to lulc change research yasir et al 2020 jeykumar and chandran 2019 in a large number of recent studies gis and rs methods have made a significant contribution to the support of global regional and local real time observation databases cetin and sevik 2020 in addition this technology allows scientific researchers and related institutions to conduct comprehensive accurate and valuable analysis and measurement of huge earth surface systems thereby the rs and gis information technology can provide the necessary technical support for the study of vegetation landscape succession and lulc dynamics barakat et al 2016 many different analysis models have been used to analyze the spatiotemporal change of lulc including gis technology tahir and malek 2017 cellular automata ca models wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2021a 2021b markov chain models al shaar et al 2020 system dynamics models lauf et al 2012 artificial neural network models jeong et al 2020 the clue s model verburg et al 2011 the flus model liu et al 2017 and the sleuth model al shalabi et al 2013 clarke and johnson 2020 the system dynamics models analyze the driving factors of land use change based on cybernetics information theory and system theory however to date system dynamics simulation software has not been fully combined with the spatial analysis function of gis to simulate land use change and its simulation function lacks spatial distribution neural networks are a process of simulating the dynamic change of land use through the input factor of the input layer which is processed by the hidden layer function and then transmitted to the output layer however it takes a long time for a neural network to simulate land use change and it cannot reflect specific evolution formulas to users the clue s model has a strong spatiotemporal dynamic simulation capability but the setting of parameters in the model mainly relies on expert knowledge and lacks objective authenticity the sleuth model is mainly used to simulate the change of non urban land use types to urban land use and is not suitable for simulating the evolution of multiple land use types ca markov models are comprehensive models that can effectively predict the dynamic change of land use in time and space ca markov models combine the spatial changeability of a ca model with a markov chain model to simulate a complex system with long term prediction which is suitable for the simulation and prediction of multiple types of land use change chotchaiwong and wijitkosum 2019 sang et al 2011 natural economic and human factors can all be taken into account in the modeling which not only improves the simulation accuracy but also overcomes the shortcoming of the conventional land evolution simulation models hence ca markov models have been widely used in different scale lulc simulation research in other countries some scholars used the gis technology and ca markov modeling techniques to dynamically monitor lulc changes in mega cities and mountainous urban areas mansour et al 2020 khawaldah et al 2020 moradi et al 2020 nguyen et al 2021 in china the ca markov model used to simulate lulc change in shunyi district of beijing and aibi lake wetland nature reserve zhao et al 2016 jing et al 2016 from the experts research found that ca markov has strong spatiotemporal simulation capability by using logistic regression and multi criteria evaluation mce based on ca markov to predict the dynamic change of lulc which can tackle the nonlinear movement and complexity of various factors in february 2014 the regional development plan for the wuhan metropolitan area 2013 2020 was approved by the national development and reform commission of china hpdrc 2014 the wuhan metropolitan area will be developed into a national two oriented society construction demonstration area a national independent innovation pilot area a national important advanced manufacturing and high tech industrial base a national important comprehensive transportation hub the modern service center which plays an important role in promoting the rise of the central region under the current rapid urbanization industrialization and socioeconomic development the wuhan metropolitan area is a population concentrated area such areas feature a one sided pursuit of economic benefits and neglect the rational use of land resources resulting in the land use system suffering damage and the contradiction between man and land being very prominent as the economic link between the upper reaches and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china the wuhan metropolitan area is an area where the land use quality is directly related to the ecological security of the middle reaches of the yangtze river strengthening the study of lulc change has become an urgent requirement in order to solve the many ecological and environmental problems that occur in the process of rapid urbanization this is necessary to enhance the coordinated development of the social economy and ecological environment and maintain good regional development advantages therefore in this study we took the wuhan metropolitan area as the study area based on the land use during 1990 2015 and socioeconomic data and a land use transfer probability matrix was combined with a land use suitability atlas after training to simulate the land use pattern in 2025 by the use of the integrated logistic multi criteria evaluation mce cellular automata ca markov logistic mce ca markov model the aims of this study were 1 to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of lulc the evolution characteristics of the landscape patterns and the internal driving mechanisms of lulc change under the context of rapid urbanization and industrialization 2 to explore the spatial distribution and quantity difference of urban land and arable land in 2025 3 to explore the dynamic evolution of the coupling transformation of urban land and arable land and 4 to analyze the reasons for the urban expansion in the study area the research results will provide a scientific basis for the optimization of land space management and control land use planning and landscape ecology 2 study area the wuhan metropolitan area is known as the 1 8 city circle consisting of the cities of huanggang huangshi ezhou xianning xiaogan xiantao tianmen and qianjiang fig 1 with a land area of 5 8 104 km2 accounting for 31 225 of the total area of hubei province china by 2015 the permanent resident population of the wuhan metropolitan area was 31 952 million accounting for 52 843 of the total population of the province in more detail the urban population was 16 012 million the rural population was 12 802 million the employed population was 18 253 million the agricultural population was 9 723 million and the non agricultural population was 13 697 million by the end of 2020 the gdp of the wuhan metropolitan area had reached 2 639 trillion yuan accounting for more than 60 342 of the total gdp of hubei province the tertiary industries accounted for 55 796 of the region s gdp with the high tech industries contribution increasing from 14 532 in 2013 to 22 856 in 2020 promoting national structural reform and realizing scientific development and social harmony with the proposal of the national strategy of the rise of central china plan and the construction of the 1 8 wuhan metropolitan area the urbanization rate of the wuhan metropolitan area has reached 63 521 the urban expansion shows a spatial expansion pattern of one core four belts one core and one belt and three cores and six belts guan et al 2012 the spatial pattern of the urban expansion shows that wuhan is the first level expansion core with the whan jiujiang railway beijing guangdong railway and wuhan third ring road being the first level expansion zones wang et al 2018 3 data sources and analysis methods in this study land use data topographic data point of interests poi data and socioeconomic data were used to simulate the land use pattern for 2025 in the wuhan metropolitan area moreover urban land and arable land data were extracted to investigate the coordination between these two land use types and to analyze the impact of urban land expansion on arable land finally monitoring and analyzing the lulc dynamics in the wuhan metropolitan area will provide scientific guidance for local policy makers the simulation framework of the integrated logistic mce ca markov model is shown in fig 2 3 1 sources of land use data the land use data for 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences at the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the land use vector data were obtained from a landsat thematic mapper tm image with the support of arcgis 10 2 software the images were classified by the use of a man machine interactive visual interpretation technique at a resolution of 30 m referring to china s land use classification system gb t 21010 2017 these datasets include six first degree types of arable land forest land grassland water area urban and rural industrial and mining land and unused land and twenty five secondary types among which the urban and rural industrial and mining land is divided into urban land rural settlements and another three types of construction land from which the six phases of land use information of the different types of land use could be obtained the accuracy of the first degree type of land use status in the study area has been reported to be more than 93 and the accuracy of the second degree type classification has been reported to be more than 90 liu et al 2018 to ensure the quality and accuracy of the land use data interpretation in different periods the data center for resources and environmental sciences at the chinese academy of sciences has conducted unified quality control verification and inspection of the datasets the specific classification methods used for the remote sensing data can be found in the studies of liu et al 2002 2010 2014 in addition based on the verification conducted by the data center of the chinese academy of sciences we selected fifty three regions in the wuhan metropolitan area to compare and verify the land use data with the actual situation in the field as shown in fig 3 the verification results show that the land use vector map is basically consistent with the actual patches finally the land use maps of the study area were obtained through processing fig 4 3 2 sources of spatial factors the interaction between human and natural factors in different spatiotemporal environments promotes lulc change following the principles of the accessibility continuity reliability diversity and representativeness of the driving factors we selected the geographical conditions population and economic factors proximity to transportation line and point of interests poi data as factors as shown in table 1 the geographical data include elevation slope and distance to water body the socioeconomic data are population and gdp the proximity to transportation line factor include distance to highway distance to national road and distance to railway the poi data include distance to urban settlement distance to industry traffic land distance to rural settlement distance to railway station distance to bus station distance to urban administrative center distance to township administrative center distance to education and school distance to hospital service and distance to tourism region the data used in this study were obtained from open street map https www openstreetmap org baidu maps https map baidu com the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn and the resource and environment data cloud platform of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn it is of great significance to analyze the influence of lulc change in the wuhan metropolitan area through the selection of the above spatial factors and to guide the urbanization development and rational utilization of land resources since the units of each spatial variable factor are different large errors may occur in the calculation process thereby it was necessary to carry out dimensionless variable processing for each factor we used the raster calculator tool of arcgis 10 2 to standardize the data firstly we checked the maximum and minimum values of the spatial data secondly the spatial factor was then input into the standardized eq 1 which was calculated using the raster calculator tool fig 5 shows a visualization of all the spatial variables in the study area the standardized model is as follows 1 b sta x x min x max x min where bsta is the standardization of spatial variables with values from 0 to 1 x is the original value xmax is the maximum value and xmin is the minimum value 3 3 multinomial logistic regression model the multinomial logistic regression model is used for the regression analysis of multiple dependent variables pippuri et al 2016 it can screen out the factors that have a significant impact on the occurrence of events generating the regression coefficients of the significant factors and the probability of events which can effectively express the relationship between lulc changes and driving factors the mathematical model is as follows 2 p k p y k x p y 0 x β 0 k β 0 k β 0 k β p k x p where y is the dependent variable x is the independent variable there are m dependent variables and y 0 as the reference group then k 0 1 2 m 1 p y kx is the conditional probability of y β is the coefficient of the logistic regression equation which indicates the correlation degree between independent variables and dependent variables 3 4 multi criteria evaluation mce method mce can be used to assess the suitability of the various land use types fu et al 2018 suitability evaluation criteria include restriction factor factors and constraint factors for class k land the restriction factor is the initial class k land the restriction factors are the independent variable in the multiple regression the restriction factors which cannot be converted into the k th land type are assigned a value of 0 and other areas which can be converted into the k th land type are assigned a value of 1 in this study the mce model was used to select suitable standardized factors for the eight land use types and the constraint conditions and standardized factors were given different factor weights based on the relevant rule of the weighted linear combination method to generate eight suitability images the mathematical model is as follows 3 e k n m a i k p n b u k w p k where ek is the suitability of k land use k 1 2 8 the higher value of e k the easier it is to convert the area into k th land type aik is the restriction factor i 1 2 m b uk is the constraint factor p 1 2 n wpk is the constraint factor weight 3 5 cellular automata ca model a ca model is a dynamic system that has discrete and finite state characteristics and evolves in discrete time dimensions according to certain transition rules in its cell space wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c zhang and wang 2021 in general the standard ca model is composed of four basic parameters cell cell space transition rule and cell neighbor in addition it also includes state and time the mathematical model of cellular automata is as follows 4 p t f p t 1 n where p is the cell state set n is the neighbor t and t 1 are the time f is the cell state transition rule 3 6 markov model a markov model is an analysis and prediction method that uses the existing state of a variable to predict the future state of the variable karimi et al 2018 the transition probability matrix the transition area matrix and the state transition diagram of each land use type are automatically generated after the markov model is implemented the state transition probability matrix determines the cell state at the next moment and its state can be either discrete or continuous the state transition matrix mathematical model of the markov model are as follows 5 s t 1 s t p 6 p p 11 p 1 n p n 1 p n n 0 p 1 i j 1 2 n j 1 n p i j 1 i j 1 2 n where s t and st 1 are the land use status at time t and t 1 p is the state transition probability matrix the ca markov model is an improved markov model combining a ca model and a markov model naboureh et al 2017 we used the ca markov model which can be incorporated into factors to simulate the land use types to synthesize the respective advantages of ca and markov models the image time interval was set to 10 years the proportional error was set to 0 15 and the forward prediction period was set to 10 years markov transfer matrices for 1995 2005 and 2005 2015 were then obtained the image from 2005 was taken as the initial image the land use suitability atlas and markov transfer matrix from 1995 to 2005 were the input the number of ca cycles was set to 10 and the ca filter was set to 5 5 to simulate the land use pattern in 2015 fig 6 3 7 verification of the model accuracy to quantitatively evaluate the simulation results the integrity of the simulation results and the accuracy of the land use simulation were obtained by calculating the simulated land use and actual land use hence the kappa coefficient and figure of merit fom were used to inspect the consistency between the simulated and actual changes shan et al 2020 yang et al 2020 these indices are calculated as follows 1 kappa coefficient 7 k a p p a p 0 p c 1 p c 8 p 0 i 1 8 x u n 9 p c i 1 8 a i b i n 2 where p 0 is observed consistency pc is expected consistency xu simulated the correct number of grids for various land use types ai is the actual number of grids for each land type bi is grid number of various land use types simulation n is the total number of grids in the study area the kappa value ranges from 0 to 1 which is generally divided into five grades table 2 1 figure of merit fom 10 f o m a a b c d where a means that real changes are simulated correctly b means that real changes are missing in the simulation c means that real changes are wrongly simulated as other categories d means that true unchanged are simulated as changes 3 8 selected landscape pattern indices landscape pattern indices can quantitatively reflect the spatial composition and distribution characteristics of a landscape karasov et al 2021 hou et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b yang et al 2014 to fully reflect the spatial differences of the land use pattern fragmentation and diversity in the wuhan metropolitan area from 2015 to 2025 we selected the number of patches np patch density pd edge density ed largest patch index lpi landscape shape index lsi and perimeter area fractal dimension pafrac index to characterize the fragmentation of the land use landscape we also selected the contagion contag aggregation index ai shannon s diversity index shdi shannon s evenness index shei patch cohesion index cohesion and landscape division index division to characterize the diversity and spatial heterogeneity of the landscape pattern using the raster conversion tool of arcgis 10 2 the vector data of the land use landscape were rasterized and then fragstats 4 2 was used to calculate each landscape index so as to obtain the values of each landscape index for the wuhan metropolitan area 4 results 4 1 land use constraint factors and weights by using the multinomial logistic regression method to determine the constraint factors and weights of the various land use types each of the land use types in the historical period was input into the entropy weight calculation process during the periods of 1995 2005 and 2005 2015 the impact intensity of each constraint factor on the land use type in the different periods showed obvious changes at the same time there were obvious differences in the selection of constraint factors for the different land use types in the different periods from 1995 to 2005 the arable land urban land rural residential land and other construction land all had more than five influencing factors table 3 for 2005 2015 all the constraint factors had a strong effect on woodland grassland water area urban land and other construction land table 4 4 2 fuzzy standardization of the spatial factors a fuzzy function can normalize the factors in the form of a fuzzy geometric function and the standard post processing layer can distribute the conditions of the factors in the continuous range of 0 255 closer to 0 means unsuitable and closer to 255 means more suitable since the distance between each factor and the land use of the study area was different it was necessary to judge the change of each factor with distance in the fuzzy classification according to the research of wang 2014 and combined with the actual situation for the wuhan metropolitan area the elevation gdp urban administrative center township administrative center urban settlement rural settlement and population factors were selected as the s type monotone decreasing function distance to national road railway highway railway station bus station education and schools hospital service and tourism region were selected for the j type monotone decreasing function the wuhan metropolitan area has a large water area which restricts the urban expansion in the surrounding areas thus the s type monotone increasing function was selected for the fuzzy standardization of the water area finally a fuzzy classification diagram of all the constraint factors in the wuhan metropolitan area was obtained fig 7 4 3 land use suitability in this study the mce model was used to select suitable standardized factors for the eight land use types in the verification and prediction of the land use according to the relevant rules of the weighted linear combination method different weight parameters were assigned to the constraint conditions and standardized factors from which images of the land use type suitability in the wuhan metropolitan area were generated for 1995 2005 and 2005 2015 figs 8 and 9 finally the atlas editor in idrisi32 was used to synthesize the suitability file atlas based on the order of the land use categories 4 4 model validation to validate the accuracy of the integrated logistic mce ca markov model for the simulation of the future land use pattern in the wuhan metropolitan area the land use pattern for 1995 2005 was used as the initial data to simulate the land use pattern in 2015 the actual and simulated land use patterns are shown in fig 10 where it is apparent that the simulation result is highly similar to the real land use pattern in the simulation results urban land and other construction land are more concentrated and a small amount of arable land is allocated to construction land the simulation error accuracy was calculated by comparing the simulation map with the actual map these results show that the kappa coefficient and fom value of the simulation results for 2015 are 88 582 and 27 935 respectively the kappa coefficient exceeds 0 80 indicating that the simulation accuracy is superior hishe et al 2020 the calculated kappa coefficient and fom index value are basically consistent with the accuracy of most of the current simulation models and case studies yang et al 2017 aguejdad 2021 in summary the integrated logistic mce ca markov model can simulate land use patterns with a high degree of accuracy and can provide support for the prediction of various future land use scenarios 4 5 lulc future predictions to scientifically explore the changes in land use types for 2025 the integrated logistic mce ca markov was used to predict the spatial distribution of the lulc for 2025 fig 11 compared with 2015 the predicted spatial distribution patterns of the various land use types in 2025 show significant changes the expansion of urban land and other construction land will mainly extend from wuhan to huanggang huangshi and ezhou meanwhile with the city of wuhan as the center the construction land arable land and urban land categories will spread to the northwest arable land will be mainly distributed in the middle and western regions of the study area while woodland will be mainly distributed in the southeast and northeast regions arcgis 10 2 was used to obtain the land use type areas for 2015 and 2025 and the comparison results are shown in table 5 the predicted land use area for 2025 shows different degrees of change compared with the arable land area for 2015 it is predicted that the arable land area for 2025 will decrease to 26 237 466 km2 representing a reduction of 1506 152 km2 a comparative analysis of the area change trend from 2005 to 2015 showed that the area reduction will slow down but there will still be a large reduction in the arable land use type the area change of the grassland and water area categories will show a slight increasing trend during 2015 2025 but the increase rate will slow down and basically stabilize the area change of the woodland and rural residential land categories will show a decreasing trend from 2015 to 2025 but the change will not be obvious the area of other construction land will increase from 2015 to 2025 with an increase of 1930 686 km2 which will still be the greatest increase of any land use type in the study area from 2015 to 2025 it is predicted that the area of urban land other construction land grassland and water in the wuhan metropolitan area will increase with the increase of the other construction land being the most obvious the area of the arable land woodland and rural residential land categories will all show a decreasing trend and the area of the arable land and woodland categories will decrease the most 4 6 analysis of the lulc changes in the wuhan metropolitan area 4 6 1 quantitative analysis of the lulc changes to analyze the land type transition more intuitively the land use types in 2015 and 2025 were compiled in idrisi32 17 0 to make a transfer matrix which can more clearly analyze the transition trend of each land use type table 6 as shown in table 6 the arable land area will decrease greatly and the conversion of arable land to the urban land other construction land and woodland categories will be the most obvious with the transferred areas being 454 580 km2 1414 355 km2 and 821 965 km2 respectively woodland will be mainly converted to the arable land and other construction land categories with the transferred areas being 1605 587 km2 and 672 470 km2 respectively grassland will be mainly converted into the woodland and arable land categories with the transferred areas being 166 956 km2 and 50 694 km2 respectively the area of water converted to arable land is 143 244 km2 urban land will be mainly converted to arable land with a transfer area of 12 4587 km2 the area of arable land converted to urban land is 454 580 km2 followed by other construction land with a transfer area of 236 479 km2 woodland will be mainly converted to urban land with a transfer area of 141 356 km2 and unused land will be mainly converted to arable land with a transfer area of 24 025 km2 during the period of 2015 2025 the transformation of land use types will be intense indicating that the demand for land use for regional socioeconomic development during this period will increase at the same time it is increasingly obvious that the other construction land grassland rural residential land and arable land categories will be converted to urban land 4 6 2 spatial analysis of the lulc changes from 2015 to 2025 the spatial transfer of urban land and other construction land in the wuhan metropolitan area will be the most obvious and will be mainly manifested in wuhan huanggang ezhou huangshi and xianning followed by xiaogan and xiantao fig 12 during 2015 2025 under the guidance of relevant policies such as land consolidation and macro control the transfer of urban construction land will be mainly concentrated in the development zones around the city of wuhan based on the analysis of the spatial pattern of the urban land use in 2025 circular economic development zones in huanggang huangshi ezhou xianning xiaogan wuhan tianmen qianjiang and xiantao will be formed by 2025 urban land and other construction land will form a central core area in the circular economic belt and will radiate outward which is consistent with the general idea of the wuhan metropolitan area master plan for 2007 2020 hpdrc 2009 for the spatial transition of arable land in 2025 the change of arable land will mainly concentrate in the central region and the arable land will be mainly converted into the urban land and other construction land categories in the suburban fringe region the arable land will mainly convert into the rural residential land and grassland categories since the distribution of the water areas is mainly along the yangtze river its conversion will be mainly concentrated in paddy fields and the urban land and rural construction land categories on both sides of the river banks in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the spatial change of grassland and woodland will not be obvious as these categories are protected by the policy of ecological civilization construction 4 7 analysis of the urban land and arable land use in this study based on the quantitative and spatial information we further analyzed the evolution characteristics of urban land and arable land in the wuhan metropolitan area from 1990 to 2025 as shown in fig 13 it is predicted that the arable land area will decrease from 30 283 055 km2 in 1990 to 26 237 466 km2 in 2025 while the urban land area will increase continuously during this period from 595 4877 km2 in 1990 to 2123 235 km2 in 2025 it can be seen that the changes of arable land and urban land show opposite trends although the arable land area will still be in a declining state the rate of decline will tend to slow while the expansion of the urban land area will increase continuously with the growth rate accelerating gradually in urban development areas the utilization intensity of arable land and urban land is often governed by administrative boundaries and it is difficult to grasp the integrity of the region in the process of regional development to break through the limitation of administrative boundaries a micro scale grid of 1500 m 1500 m was established to further define and describe the spatial distribution of urban land and arable land as shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the arable land resources will mainly distribute in the jianghan plain of hubei province followed by the dabie mountain area of the city of huanggang the urban land will mainly distribute in the surrounding area of wuhan and the eastern areas of ezhou and huangshi where the urban agglomeration shows a sprawling development pattern according to the urban planning guiding ideology of hubei province s strategic plan for urbanization and urban development 2012 2030 for the wuhan metropolitan area yan 2012 in the future the wuhan metropolitan area will form a regional development pattern of one core one district three districts and four axes and a regional protection pattern of one ring and two wings in addition a two oriented industrial system is planned coordinating urban and rural development promoting green and low carbon development strengthening infrastructure support promoting equal access to basic public services innovating systems and mechanisms and building a highly urbanized area with close transportation links and integrated socioeconomic development the coupling of the evolution trends of arable land and urban land is of great significance for regional food security and the intensive use of urban land and it also has practical value for regional land use planning and reasonable resource allocation 4 8 analysis of the land use landscape as shown in table 7 the landscape type index will change significantly from 2015 to 2025 by 2025 the np of arable land woodland grassland water area and rural residential land will increase to 62 153 39 393 4828 8237 and 25 737 respectively the land use types that show an increase in the pd index will be mainly arable land and rural residential areas at 0 559 number km 2 and 0 232 number km 2 respectively the land use types that show an increase in the lpi ed and lsi indices will be mainly woodland and water areas with the development of time the value of the pafrac index will show a gradually decreasing trend our findings show that land use interference in the wuhan metropolitan area will gradually increase natural landscape patches will become segmented and eroded and the degree of dispersion between patches will increase resulting in increased spatial heterogeneity as shown in table 8 the contag index will increase from 58 924 in 2015 to 62 737 in 2025 and the shdi and shei indices will increase from 1 358 and 0 653 in 2015 to 1 592 and 0 717 in 2025 respectively the ai cohesion and division will show an increasing trend influenced by human social activities therefore by 2025 the fragmentation degree will be further aggravated the landscape diversity will increase and the landscape heterogeneity will also be strengthened 5 discussion the main purpose of this study was to analyze the dynamic monitoring of lulc changes in the wuhan metropolitan area and to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban expansion and arable land evolution land use data topographic data poi data and socioeconomic data were used to predict the lulc dynamics in the wuhan metropolitan area a ca markov model and multi criterion suitability analysis method were used to simulate the land use dynamics in 2025 based on the gis spatial measurement technology the results showed that a large number of land use types will be converted and a large proportion of the other land use types will be converted into urban land indicating that the rapid socioeconomic development of the study area will promote a rapid increase in urban expansion we used a ca markov model to simulate the lulc changes from 2015 to 2025 and verified the reliability of the model so as to predict the future land use pattern in the model correction stage the kappa value of the simulation accuracy was 88 582 and the fom value was 27 935 indicating that the ca markov model can simulate and predict the land use pattern of the wuhan metropolitan area well however there are still some shortcomings the transition rules were mined based on historical land use data and a logistic model but there can be errors in the adjustment process for the model factors and parameters in the future the selection of factors and adjustment parameters in the simulation process could be further improved to make the simulation closer to reality moreover there was a lack of consideration of policy factors in the construction of the evaluation system which is also the content that needs to be refined in future research work furthermore as land use is a complex system affected by natural economic and social factors it is challenging to fully simulate its evolution process in future research there are still many areas that need to be improved for instance in the process of prediction it will be necessary to combine the latest development planning for the wuhan metropolitan area and to set different development scenarios to make the prediction results closer to the actual situation the land use simulation model is an effective tool for analyzing the driving force and process of lulc change feng et al 2020 as well as making future spatial planning decisions domingo et al 2021 in the current research on future lulc change some scholars have exploited different lulc simulation models counting on different goals and backgrounds but no single model can accurately capture the key process of evolution at different scales each lulc change model has its own potential constraints and limitations table 9 summarizes the research scale of the different models developed and used by scholars for lulc dynamics and urban growth study and it can be seen that these models have different precisions in different areas these models are not single models but are coupled models reflecting the new trend of coupling models in the simulation of land use and urban growth which can improve the simulation and prediction accuracy the regional lulc dynamics are the transition of land use patterns corresponding to the current stage of socioeconomic development aguilos et al 2021 ewane 2021 the evolution of the landscape pattern is the transition of land use structure influenced by industrial adjustment and economic development in the process of dynamic change over time sun and yan 2014 in rural areas the abandonment of arable land is changing the rural landscape around the world in urban areas the occupation of a large volume of arable land resources promotes the drastic growth of urban areas however with the implementation of the national policy of returning farmland to forest in china the forest land destroyed in the past has been gradually restored and the ecological land has shown an increasing trend lulc changes and landscape processes are interrelated and are influenced by biodiversity geophysical and socioeconomic drivers which form a complex and multi scale system burra et al 2021 xu and zhang 2021 the change of the landscape patterns leads to the lulc changes which are the result of the combined action of natural socioeconomic and policy factors of the socio ecosystem and external environment traditional society is subject to regional development potential and socioeconomic development conditions and urgently need to speed up a breakthrough in way of production zhu et al 2020 this shows that the functions of arable land and urban land will continue to be the focus on the win win of economic and ecological functions in the future development direction in addition it provides a security guarantee for realizing agricultural modernization urbanization and ecological security in the future the law of lulc change and urban development will no longer be to blindly pursue a single economic benefit but instead to highlight the intensive use of land resources this indicates that the landscape pattern represented by economically developed areas is changing from the traditional food and agriculture system to an ecological system fig 15 in recent years under the influence of many major events in the wuhan metropolitan area the urban land has clearly expanded fig 16 in the different stages of socioeconomic development the urban expansion patterns have shown significant differences the phased characteristics of urban spatial expansion are mainly influenced by national development strategy urban construction policy and land management policy since 1990 china has begun to implement the policy of economic and industrial development and the whole of society has entered a path with economic construction as the center and socioeconomics have gradually recovered during this period the wuhan metropolitan area has played a prominent role in national economic construction wuhan was approved as a foreign trade port and wuhan became a pilot city for the comprehensive reform of the national economic system in addition local government has also put forward the strategy of land transportation and air circulation by promoting land transportation and air circulation throughout the surrounding cities and towns this has promoted the connection between wuhan and the surrounding areas as well as other parts of the country so as to activate the market and enhance the comprehensive economic strength from 2000 to 2005 with the help of the accelerated economic development urban space expansion was very rapid in wuhan urban land in the wuhan metropolitan area was expanding rapidly but was mainly concentrated in the small and medium sized cities the pattern of urban expansion was mainly characterized by marginal expansion and enclave expansion or small agglomeration and large dispersion from 2005 to 2010 china was implementing a western pattern of development and the central region became the center of china s economic development during this period china put forward the strategy of promoting the rise of the central region and hubei province put forward the construction of the 1 8 wuhan metropolitan area in addition the pilot reform zone which was approved in 2007 as a two oriented society has been officially upgraded to a national strategy under the support of a series of policies economic construction and urban space expansion both approached a new climax and the annual growth rate of urban land was 102 325 km2 since 2010 in the core city of the wuhan metropolitan area the number of industrial enterprises has increased leading to rapid growth of the population economic scale and urban land scale the number of permanent residents increased from 29 312 million in 2010 to 31 952 million in 2015 gdp increased from 963 576 billion rmb in 2010 to 2215 3 billion rmb in 2015 and urban land increased by 378 523 km2 with 65 844 of the newly increased urban land was concentrated during this period the urban land in the wuhan metropolitan area was mainly expanded by edge type expansion which was mainly manifested as outlying expansion filling expansion zhang et al 2018 with the implementation of the strategy for the rise of central china and the rapid advancement of the overall urban and rural development in hubei province the urbanization process has further accelerated the expansion of urban land has increased and the frequent transfer of the various land use types has led to an increase in the number of people living in the area crankshaw and borel saladin 2019 since 2015 with the continuous development zone construction the introduction of modern science and technology and the agglomeration of service industry the urbanization rate of the wuhan metropolitan area has reached 63 521 at this stage urban expansion presented rapid development and the expansion mode was mainly edge type expansion outlying expansion and filling expansion based on our prediction of the future land use patterns the following suggestions are put forward for the land use management of the wuhan metropolitan area by 2025 the arable land area will continue to decrease and the decreasing trend of arable land will exceed the protected area of basic farmland the area of urban land will be constantly increasing and the region will need to preserve land resources such as unused land and grassland at the present stage the overall planning of the land use land use regulation and land macro control indices should be strictly followed in the wuhan metropolitan area thereby enhancing the awareness of arable land protection in the meantime government agencies should strengthen the spatial control of construction land and make full use of 3s technology for the dynamic monitoring of lulc in the key areas especially the industrial development areas and the urban rural boundary areas the impact of lulc changes is influenced by multiple factors and future research should fully explore environmental and socioeconomic factors such as detailed government planning policies so2 carbon sinks energy haze rich points of interest big data population migration data infrastructure living income etc constructing a model incorporating individual human decision making dataset factors into a predictive analysis framework and analyzing the impact mechanism of lulc changes will be important big data should also be used to validate land use ca simulation models and capture the impact of human actions on lulc dynamics 6 conclusion in this study we used land use data poi data and socioeconomic datasets of the wuhan metropolitan area to successfully simulate and evaluate the dynamics of lulc based on an integrated logistic mce ca markov model in addition we analyzed in detail the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and the influencing mechanisms of lulc change and urban land expansion in the study area these findings could play an important role in land use planning decisions by balancing and coordinating urban growth and arable land use and they could also be widely used in other areas of different scales to provide a reference however the interesting finding is that urban development does not necessarily have to come with a price because there is a trade off relationship between urban development and arable land local institutions and decision makers should set rational policy directions and conservation measures so that regional land use can adapt to the expansion of the population growth rate through the dynamic implementation of agricultural land policy rural land resources should be rationally allocated the dynamic monitoring of lulc change plays an important role in promoting the sustainable development of land resources in china s urbanization process similarly the results of this study will provide scientific guidance for government departments and local decision makers in future land use planning funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 42171411 41571384 credit authorship contribution statement quan wang writing original draft

24514,with the rapid socioeconomic development in china the competition for space in land use conversion is getting fierce the wuhan metropolitan area as one of the main areas of modern agriculture and manufacturing has been significantly affected by urbanization industrialization and national development policies resulting in regional man land contradiction in this complex region scientifically measuring the land use land cover lulc dynamics and exploring the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the lulc changes are important tasks for local officials and decision makers in the management of urban expansion and land use planning in this study an integrated logistic multi criteria evaluation mce cellular automata ca markov logistic mce ca markov model and a geographic information system gis were used to evaluate and predict the lulc changes the analysis was based on six lulc maps at equal temporal intervals derived from land use data for 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 along with topographic spatial layers elevation and slope derived from an aster digital elevation model in addition other spatial variables points of interest gross domestic product gdp population density proximity to urban center and proximity to transportation line were incorporated in the simulation process the simulated results obtained by the integrated logistic mce ca markov model had a kappa coefficient of 88 582 and a figure of merit value of 27 935 the results indicated that under the influence of the various factors the future land use pattern of the wuhan metropolitan area will be clearly transformed from 2015 to 2025 it is predicted that the area of arable land and woodland will decrease by 1506 152 km2 and 1743 945 km2 respectively and urban land expansion will mainly come from arable land woodland and other construction land with the enhancement of the human disturbance intensity the natural landscape patches will become segmented and the number of individual patches will increase gradually enhancing the spatial heterogeneity the simulation results could not only be used to monitor future lulc trends but could also help local decision makers to provide policy support for land use planning and management keywords land use land cover change landscape pattern urban expansion ca markov wuhan metropolitan area 1 introduction and literature review land use is a historical complex system formed by natural elements such as geology landform climate hydrology soil and vegetation and human activities in a certain area meiyappan et al 2014 arowolo et al 2018 regasa et al 2021 land use land cover lulc change is a process of regional land use pattern transformation corresponding to the transformation of the socioeconomic development stage aquilue et al 2017 lulc change is the most direct manifestation of the impact of human activities on the earth s surface and plays a very important role in the process of global environmental change lulc is also one of the important factors that represents the response of human activities to global change and is an important input factor when simulating global climate and biogeochemical effects sandru et al 2017 the simulation and study of the dynamic mechanism of the spatiotemporal process of lulc change has become the forefront of scientific attention the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp and the global land programme glp have made lulc change a central theme in global change research purvaja et al 2015 wang et al 2012 in 2012 the international council for science ics and the international social science council issc launched the future earth research plan dawes 2020 soyez 2016 through this detailed research it is expected that the goal of sustainable development can be achieved in the future thus the monitoring and simulation of lulc changes has gradually become the focus of earth surface system research land use research typically focuses on land use surveying land resource evaluation and land use planning tarawally et al 2019 pielke 2011 with the development of the social economy the diversification of land use dynamics is manifested as the change of land use types at different scales lagrosa et al 2018 under the influence of multiple factors different land use types show their differences in different places at the same time or in different time schedules under various environmental influences siyavus 2021 the variation of this difference is restricted by the local socioeconomic and topographic conditions as well as the land use planning and land space management of local decision makers the rapid increase of the global population and the rural population converging into cities is leading to increased demand for urban land space appiah et al 2020 chen et al 2020 a large amount of land around cities is being reclaimed to meet the requirements of socioeconomic development and urban land expansion li et al 2015 in recent decades the agglomeration of urban land has increased and many different land use types have been converted into urban land however the excessive reclamation of production land and ecological land around urban areas is resulting in severe man land contradiction and serious ecological problems urbanization is the most direct carrier of lulc change but can produce a series of regional ecological problems du and huang 2017 barlow et al 2021 such as the heat island effect vojvodikova et al 2020 environmental pollution chen et al 2012 boix and diaz 1998 soil erosion wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c xu and zhang 2020 biodiversity reduction escribano et al 2016 kati et al 2021 and habitat destruction cosentino and brubaker 2018 gomes et al 2021 many environmental problems are closely related to rapid urban expansion meanwhile these environmental problems have also caused drastic changes to the urban landscape pattern larson et al 2020 pavageau et al 2018 frazier 2019 when the process of landscape ecological evolution is disturbed the material circulation and energy flow are both hindered in time and space wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c li et al 2017 which eventually results in regional ecological and environmental problems to promote the optimization of land use structure in ecological barrier areas it is of great value to study the lulc change caused by rapid urban expansion at present the spatial technology of remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis has been more and more widely applied to lulc change research yasir et al 2020 jeykumar and chandran 2019 in a large number of recent studies gis and rs methods have made a significant contribution to the support of global regional and local real time observation databases cetin and sevik 2020 in addition this technology allows scientific researchers and related institutions to conduct comprehensive accurate and valuable analysis and measurement of huge earth surface systems thereby the rs and gis information technology can provide the necessary technical support for the study of vegetation landscape succession and lulc dynamics barakat et al 2016 many different analysis models have been used to analyze the spatiotemporal change of lulc including gis technology tahir and malek 2017 cellular automata ca models wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2021a 2021b markov chain models al shaar et al 2020 system dynamics models lauf et al 2012 artificial neural network models jeong et al 2020 the clue s model verburg et al 2011 the flus model liu et al 2017 and the sleuth model al shalabi et al 2013 clarke and johnson 2020 the system dynamics models analyze the driving factors of land use change based on cybernetics information theory and system theory however to date system dynamics simulation software has not been fully combined with the spatial analysis function of gis to simulate land use change and its simulation function lacks spatial distribution neural networks are a process of simulating the dynamic change of land use through the input factor of the input layer which is processed by the hidden layer function and then transmitted to the output layer however it takes a long time for a neural network to simulate land use change and it cannot reflect specific evolution formulas to users the clue s model has a strong spatiotemporal dynamic simulation capability but the setting of parameters in the model mainly relies on expert knowledge and lacks objective authenticity the sleuth model is mainly used to simulate the change of non urban land use types to urban land use and is not suitable for simulating the evolution of multiple land use types ca markov models are comprehensive models that can effectively predict the dynamic change of land use in time and space ca markov models combine the spatial changeability of a ca model with a markov chain model to simulate a complex system with long term prediction which is suitable for the simulation and prediction of multiple types of land use change chotchaiwong and wijitkosum 2019 sang et al 2011 natural economic and human factors can all be taken into account in the modeling which not only improves the simulation accuracy but also overcomes the shortcoming of the conventional land evolution simulation models hence ca markov models have been widely used in different scale lulc simulation research in other countries some scholars used the gis technology and ca markov modeling techniques to dynamically monitor lulc changes in mega cities and mountainous urban areas mansour et al 2020 khawaldah et al 2020 moradi et al 2020 nguyen et al 2021 in china the ca markov model used to simulate lulc change in shunyi district of beijing and aibi lake wetland nature reserve zhao et al 2016 jing et al 2016 from the experts research found that ca markov has strong spatiotemporal simulation capability by using logistic regression and multi criteria evaluation mce based on ca markov to predict the dynamic change of lulc which can tackle the nonlinear movement and complexity of various factors in february 2014 the regional development plan for the wuhan metropolitan area 2013 2020 was approved by the national development and reform commission of china hpdrc 2014 the wuhan metropolitan area will be developed into a national two oriented society construction demonstration area a national independent innovation pilot area a national important advanced manufacturing and high tech industrial base a national important comprehensive transportation hub the modern service center which plays an important role in promoting the rise of the central region under the current rapid urbanization industrialization and socioeconomic development the wuhan metropolitan area is a population concentrated area such areas feature a one sided pursuit of economic benefits and neglect the rational use of land resources resulting in the land use system suffering damage and the contradiction between man and land being very prominent as the economic link between the upper reaches and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china the wuhan metropolitan area is an area where the land use quality is directly related to the ecological security of the middle reaches of the yangtze river strengthening the study of lulc change has become an urgent requirement in order to solve the many ecological and environmental problems that occur in the process of rapid urbanization this is necessary to enhance the coordinated development of the social economy and ecological environment and maintain good regional development advantages therefore in this study we took the wuhan metropolitan area as the study area based on the land use during 1990 2015 and socioeconomic data and a land use transfer probability matrix was combined with a land use suitability atlas after training to simulate the land use pattern in 2025 by the use of the integrated logistic multi criteria evaluation mce cellular automata ca markov logistic mce ca markov model the aims of this study were 1 to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of lulc the evolution characteristics of the landscape patterns and the internal driving mechanisms of lulc change under the context of rapid urbanization and industrialization 2 to explore the spatial distribution and quantity difference of urban land and arable land in 2025 3 to explore the dynamic evolution of the coupling transformation of urban land and arable land and 4 to analyze the reasons for the urban expansion in the study area the research results will provide a scientific basis for the optimization of land space management and control land use planning and landscape ecology 2 study area the wuhan metropolitan area is known as the 1 8 city circle consisting of the cities of huanggang huangshi ezhou xianning xiaogan xiantao tianmen and qianjiang fig 1 with a land area of 5 8 104 km2 accounting for 31 225 of the total area of hubei province china by 2015 the permanent resident population of the wuhan metropolitan area was 31 952 million accounting for 52 843 of the total population of the province in more detail the urban population was 16 012 million the rural population was 12 802 million the employed population was 18 253 million the agricultural population was 9 723 million and the non agricultural population was 13 697 million by the end of 2020 the gdp of the wuhan metropolitan area had reached 2 639 trillion yuan accounting for more than 60 342 of the total gdp of hubei province the tertiary industries accounted for 55 796 of the region s gdp with the high tech industries contribution increasing from 14 532 in 2013 to 22 856 in 2020 promoting national structural reform and realizing scientific development and social harmony with the proposal of the national strategy of the rise of central china plan and the construction of the 1 8 wuhan metropolitan area the urbanization rate of the wuhan metropolitan area has reached 63 521 the urban expansion shows a spatial expansion pattern of one core four belts one core and one belt and three cores and six belts guan et al 2012 the spatial pattern of the urban expansion shows that wuhan is the first level expansion core with the whan jiujiang railway beijing guangdong railway and wuhan third ring road being the first level expansion zones wang et al 2018 3 data sources and analysis methods in this study land use data topographic data point of interests poi data and socioeconomic data were used to simulate the land use pattern for 2025 in the wuhan metropolitan area moreover urban land and arable land data were extracted to investigate the coordination between these two land use types and to analyze the impact of urban land expansion on arable land finally monitoring and analyzing the lulc dynamics in the wuhan metropolitan area will provide scientific guidance for local policy makers the simulation framework of the integrated logistic mce ca markov model is shown in fig 2 3 1 sources of land use data the land use data for 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences at the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the land use vector data were obtained from a landsat thematic mapper tm image with the support of arcgis 10 2 software the images were classified by the use of a man machine interactive visual interpretation technique at a resolution of 30 m referring to china s land use classification system gb t 21010 2017 these datasets include six first degree types of arable land forest land grassland water area urban and rural industrial and mining land and unused land and twenty five secondary types among which the urban and rural industrial and mining land is divided into urban land rural settlements and another three types of construction land from which the six phases of land use information of the different types of land use could be obtained the accuracy of the first degree type of land use status in the study area has been reported to be more than 93 and the accuracy of the second degree type classification has been reported to be more than 90 liu et al 2018 to ensure the quality and accuracy of the land use data interpretation in different periods the data center for resources and environmental sciences at the chinese academy of sciences has conducted unified quality control verification and inspection of the datasets the specific classification methods used for the remote sensing data can be found in the studies of liu et al 2002 2010 2014 in addition based on the verification conducted by the data center of the chinese academy of sciences we selected fifty three regions in the wuhan metropolitan area to compare and verify the land use data with the actual situation in the field as shown in fig 3 the verification results show that the land use vector map is basically consistent with the actual patches finally the land use maps of the study area were obtained through processing fig 4 3 2 sources of spatial factors the interaction between human and natural factors in different spatiotemporal environments promotes lulc change following the principles of the accessibility continuity reliability diversity and representativeness of the driving factors we selected the geographical conditions population and economic factors proximity to transportation line and point of interests poi data as factors as shown in table 1 the geographical data include elevation slope and distance to water body the socioeconomic data are population and gdp the proximity to transportation line factor include distance to highway distance to national road and distance to railway the poi data include distance to urban settlement distance to industry traffic land distance to rural settlement distance to railway station distance to bus station distance to urban administrative center distance to township administrative center distance to education and school distance to hospital service and distance to tourism region the data used in this study were obtained from open street map https www openstreetmap org baidu maps https map baidu com the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn and the resource and environment data cloud platform of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn it is of great significance to analyze the influence of lulc change in the wuhan metropolitan area through the selection of the above spatial factors and to guide the urbanization development and rational utilization of land resources since the units of each spatial variable factor are different large errors may occur in the calculation process thereby it was necessary to carry out dimensionless variable processing for each factor we used the raster calculator tool of arcgis 10 2 to standardize the data firstly we checked the maximum and minimum values of the spatial data secondly the spatial factor was then input into the standardized eq 1 which was calculated using the raster calculator tool fig 5 shows a visualization of all the spatial variables in the study area the standardized model is as follows 1 b sta x x min x max x min where bsta is the standardization of spatial variables with values from 0 to 1 x is the original value xmax is the maximum value and xmin is the minimum value 3 3 multinomial logistic regression model the multinomial logistic regression model is used for the regression analysis of multiple dependent variables pippuri et al 2016 it can screen out the factors that have a significant impact on the occurrence of events generating the regression coefficients of the significant factors and the probability of events which can effectively express the relationship between lulc changes and driving factors the mathematical model is as follows 2 p k p y k x p y 0 x β 0 k β 0 k β 0 k β p k x p where y is the dependent variable x is the independent variable there are m dependent variables and y 0 as the reference group then k 0 1 2 m 1 p y kx is the conditional probability of y β is the coefficient of the logistic regression equation which indicates the correlation degree between independent variables and dependent variables 3 4 multi criteria evaluation mce method mce can be used to assess the suitability of the various land use types fu et al 2018 suitability evaluation criteria include restriction factor factors and constraint factors for class k land the restriction factor is the initial class k land the restriction factors are the independent variable in the multiple regression the restriction factors which cannot be converted into the k th land type are assigned a value of 0 and other areas which can be converted into the k th land type are assigned a value of 1 in this study the mce model was used to select suitable standardized factors for the eight land use types and the constraint conditions and standardized factors were given different factor weights based on the relevant rule of the weighted linear combination method to generate eight suitability images the mathematical model is as follows 3 e k n m a i k p n b u k w p k where ek is the suitability of k land use k 1 2 8 the higher value of e k the easier it is to convert the area into k th land type aik is the restriction factor i 1 2 m b uk is the constraint factor p 1 2 n wpk is the constraint factor weight 3 5 cellular automata ca model a ca model is a dynamic system that has discrete and finite state characteristics and evolves in discrete time dimensions according to certain transition rules in its cell space wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c zhang and wang 2021 in general the standard ca model is composed of four basic parameters cell cell space transition rule and cell neighbor in addition it also includes state and time the mathematical model of cellular automata is as follows 4 p t f p t 1 n where p is the cell state set n is the neighbor t and t 1 are the time f is the cell state transition rule 3 6 markov model a markov model is an analysis and prediction method that uses the existing state of a variable to predict the future state of the variable karimi et al 2018 the transition probability matrix the transition area matrix and the state transition diagram of each land use type are automatically generated after the markov model is implemented the state transition probability matrix determines the cell state at the next moment and its state can be either discrete or continuous the state transition matrix mathematical model of the markov model are as follows 5 s t 1 s t p 6 p p 11 p 1 n p n 1 p n n 0 p 1 i j 1 2 n j 1 n p i j 1 i j 1 2 n where s t and st 1 are the land use status at time t and t 1 p is the state transition probability matrix the ca markov model is an improved markov model combining a ca model and a markov model naboureh et al 2017 we used the ca markov model which can be incorporated into factors to simulate the land use types to synthesize the respective advantages of ca and markov models the image time interval was set to 10 years the proportional error was set to 0 15 and the forward prediction period was set to 10 years markov transfer matrices for 1995 2005 and 2005 2015 were then obtained the image from 2005 was taken as the initial image the land use suitability atlas and markov transfer matrix from 1995 to 2005 were the input the number of ca cycles was set to 10 and the ca filter was set to 5 5 to simulate the land use pattern in 2015 fig 6 3 7 verification of the model accuracy to quantitatively evaluate the simulation results the integrity of the simulation results and the accuracy of the land use simulation were obtained by calculating the simulated land use and actual land use hence the kappa coefficient and figure of merit fom were used to inspect the consistency between the simulated and actual changes shan et al 2020 yang et al 2020 these indices are calculated as follows 1 kappa coefficient 7 k a p p a p 0 p c 1 p c 8 p 0 i 1 8 x u n 9 p c i 1 8 a i b i n 2 where p 0 is observed consistency pc is expected consistency xu simulated the correct number of grids for various land use types ai is the actual number of grids for each land type bi is grid number of various land use types simulation n is the total number of grids in the study area the kappa value ranges from 0 to 1 which is generally divided into five grades table 2 1 figure of merit fom 10 f o m a a b c d where a means that real changes are simulated correctly b means that real changes are missing in the simulation c means that real changes are wrongly simulated as other categories d means that true unchanged are simulated as changes 3 8 selected landscape pattern indices landscape pattern indices can quantitatively reflect the spatial composition and distribution characteristics of a landscape karasov et al 2021 hou et al 2020 wang et al 2020a 2020b yang et al 2014 to fully reflect the spatial differences of the land use pattern fragmentation and diversity in the wuhan metropolitan area from 2015 to 2025 we selected the number of patches np patch density pd edge density ed largest patch index lpi landscape shape index lsi and perimeter area fractal dimension pafrac index to characterize the fragmentation of the land use landscape we also selected the contagion contag aggregation index ai shannon s diversity index shdi shannon s evenness index shei patch cohesion index cohesion and landscape division index division to characterize the diversity and spatial heterogeneity of the landscape pattern using the raster conversion tool of arcgis 10 2 the vector data of the land use landscape were rasterized and then fragstats 4 2 was used to calculate each landscape index so as to obtain the values of each landscape index for the wuhan metropolitan area 4 results 4 1 land use constraint factors and weights by using the multinomial logistic regression method to determine the constraint factors and weights of the various land use types each of the land use types in the historical period was input into the entropy weight calculation process during the periods of 1995 2005 and 2005 2015 the impact intensity of each constraint factor on the land use type in the different periods showed obvious changes at the same time there were obvious differences in the selection of constraint factors for the different land use types in the different periods from 1995 to 2005 the arable land urban land rural residential land and other construction land all had more than five influencing factors table 3 for 2005 2015 all the constraint factors had a strong effect on woodland grassland water area urban land and other construction land table 4 4 2 fuzzy standardization of the spatial factors a fuzzy function can normalize the factors in the form of a fuzzy geometric function and the standard post processing layer can distribute the conditions of the factors in the continuous range of 0 255 closer to 0 means unsuitable and closer to 255 means more suitable since the distance between each factor and the land use of the study area was different it was necessary to judge the change of each factor with distance in the fuzzy classification according to the research of wang 2014 and combined with the actual situation for the wuhan metropolitan area the elevation gdp urban administrative center township administrative center urban settlement rural settlement and population factors were selected as the s type monotone decreasing function distance to national road railway highway railway station bus station education and schools hospital service and tourism region were selected for the j type monotone decreasing function the wuhan metropolitan area has a large water area which restricts the urban expansion in the surrounding areas thus the s type monotone increasing function was selected for the fuzzy standardization of the water area finally a fuzzy classification diagram of all the constraint factors in the wuhan metropolitan area was obtained fig 7 4 3 land use suitability in this study the mce model was used to select suitable standardized factors for the eight land use types in the verification and prediction of the land use according to the relevant rules of the weighted linear combination method different weight parameters were assigned to the constraint conditions and standardized factors from which images of the land use type suitability in the wuhan metropolitan area were generated for 1995 2005 and 2005 2015 figs 8 and 9 finally the atlas editor in idrisi32 was used to synthesize the suitability file atlas based on the order of the land use categories 4 4 model validation to validate the accuracy of the integrated logistic mce ca markov model for the simulation of the future land use pattern in the wuhan metropolitan area the land use pattern for 1995 2005 was used as the initial data to simulate the land use pattern in 2015 the actual and simulated land use patterns are shown in fig 10 where it is apparent that the simulation result is highly similar to the real land use pattern in the simulation results urban land and other construction land are more concentrated and a small amount of arable land is allocated to construction land the simulation error accuracy was calculated by comparing the simulation map with the actual map these results show that the kappa coefficient and fom value of the simulation results for 2015 are 88 582 and 27 935 respectively the kappa coefficient exceeds 0 80 indicating that the simulation accuracy is superior hishe et al 2020 the calculated kappa coefficient and fom index value are basically consistent with the accuracy of most of the current simulation models and case studies yang et al 2017 aguejdad 2021 in summary the integrated logistic mce ca markov model can simulate land use patterns with a high degree of accuracy and can provide support for the prediction of various future land use scenarios 4 5 lulc future predictions to scientifically explore the changes in land use types for 2025 the integrated logistic mce ca markov was used to predict the spatial distribution of the lulc for 2025 fig 11 compared with 2015 the predicted spatial distribution patterns of the various land use types in 2025 show significant changes the expansion of urban land and other construction land will mainly extend from wuhan to huanggang huangshi and ezhou meanwhile with the city of wuhan as the center the construction land arable land and urban land categories will spread to the northwest arable land will be mainly distributed in the middle and western regions of the study area while woodland will be mainly distributed in the southeast and northeast regions arcgis 10 2 was used to obtain the land use type areas for 2015 and 2025 and the comparison results are shown in table 5 the predicted land use area for 2025 shows different degrees of change compared with the arable land area for 2015 it is predicted that the arable land area for 2025 will decrease to 26 237 466 km2 representing a reduction of 1506 152 km2 a comparative analysis of the area change trend from 2005 to 2015 showed that the area reduction will slow down but there will still be a large reduction in the arable land use type the area change of the grassland and water area categories will show a slight increasing trend during 2015 2025 but the increase rate will slow down and basically stabilize the area change of the woodland and rural residential land categories will show a decreasing trend from 2015 to 2025 but the change will not be obvious the area of other construction land will increase from 2015 to 2025 with an increase of 1930 686 km2 which will still be the greatest increase of any land use type in the study area from 2015 to 2025 it is predicted that the area of urban land other construction land grassland and water in the wuhan metropolitan area will increase with the increase of the other construction land being the most obvious the area of the arable land woodland and rural residential land categories will all show a decreasing trend and the area of the arable land and woodland categories will decrease the most 4 6 analysis of the lulc changes in the wuhan metropolitan area 4 6 1 quantitative analysis of the lulc changes to analyze the land type transition more intuitively the land use types in 2015 and 2025 were compiled in idrisi32 17 0 to make a transfer matrix which can more clearly analyze the transition trend of each land use type table 6 as shown in table 6 the arable land area will decrease greatly and the conversion of arable land to the urban land other construction land and woodland categories will be the most obvious with the transferred areas being 454 580 km2 1414 355 km2 and 821 965 km2 respectively woodland will be mainly converted to the arable land and other construction land categories with the transferred areas being 1605 587 km2 and 672 470 km2 respectively grassland will be mainly converted into the woodland and arable land categories with the transferred areas being 166 956 km2 and 50 694 km2 respectively the area of water converted to arable land is 143 244 km2 urban land will be mainly converted to arable land with a transfer area of 12 4587 km2 the area of arable land converted to urban land is 454 580 km2 followed by other construction land with a transfer area of 236 479 km2 woodland will be mainly converted to urban land with a transfer area of 141 356 km2 and unused land will be mainly converted to arable land with a transfer area of 24 025 km2 during the period of 2015 2025 the transformation of land use types will be intense indicating that the demand for land use for regional socioeconomic development during this period will increase at the same time it is increasingly obvious that the other construction land grassland rural residential land and arable land categories will be converted to urban land 4 6 2 spatial analysis of the lulc changes from 2015 to 2025 the spatial transfer of urban land and other construction land in the wuhan metropolitan area will be the most obvious and will be mainly manifested in wuhan huanggang ezhou huangshi and xianning followed by xiaogan and xiantao fig 12 during 2015 2025 under the guidance of relevant policies such as land consolidation and macro control the transfer of urban construction land will be mainly concentrated in the development zones around the city of wuhan based on the analysis of the spatial pattern of the urban land use in 2025 circular economic development zones in huanggang huangshi ezhou xianning xiaogan wuhan tianmen qianjiang and xiantao will be formed by 2025 urban land and other construction land will form a central core area in the circular economic belt and will radiate outward which is consistent with the general idea of the wuhan metropolitan area master plan for 2007 2020 hpdrc 2009 for the spatial transition of arable land in 2025 the change of arable land will mainly concentrate in the central region and the arable land will be mainly converted into the urban land and other construction land categories in the suburban fringe region the arable land will mainly convert into the rural residential land and grassland categories since the distribution of the water areas is mainly along the yangtze river its conversion will be mainly concentrated in paddy fields and the urban land and rural construction land categories on both sides of the river banks in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the spatial change of grassland and woodland will not be obvious as these categories are protected by the policy of ecological civilization construction 4 7 analysis of the urban land and arable land use in this study based on the quantitative and spatial information we further analyzed the evolution characteristics of urban land and arable land in the wuhan metropolitan area from 1990 to 2025 as shown in fig 13 it is predicted that the arable land area will decrease from 30 283 055 km2 in 1990 to 26 237 466 km2 in 2025 while the urban land area will increase continuously during this period from 595 4877 km2 in 1990 to 2123 235 km2 in 2025 it can be seen that the changes of arable land and urban land show opposite trends although the arable land area will still be in a declining state the rate of decline will tend to slow while the expansion of the urban land area will increase continuously with the growth rate accelerating gradually in urban development areas the utilization intensity of arable land and urban land is often governed by administrative boundaries and it is difficult to grasp the integrity of the region in the process of regional development to break through the limitation of administrative boundaries a micro scale grid of 1500 m 1500 m was established to further define and describe the spatial distribution of urban land and arable land as shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the arable land resources will mainly distribute in the jianghan plain of hubei province followed by the dabie mountain area of the city of huanggang the urban land will mainly distribute in the surrounding area of wuhan and the eastern areas of ezhou and huangshi where the urban agglomeration shows a sprawling development pattern according to the urban planning guiding ideology of hubei province s strategic plan for urbanization and urban development 2012 2030 for the wuhan metropolitan area yan 2012 in the future the wuhan metropolitan area will form a regional development pattern of one core one district three districts and four axes and a regional protection pattern of one ring and two wings in addition a two oriented industrial system is planned coordinating urban and rural development promoting green and low carbon development strengthening infrastructure support promoting equal access to basic public services innovating systems and mechanisms and building a highly urbanized area with close transportation links and integrated socioeconomic development the coupling of the evolution trends of arable land and urban land is of great significance for regional food security and the intensive use of urban land and it also has practical value for regional land use planning and reasonable resource allocation 4 8 analysis of the land use landscape as shown in table 7 the landscape type index will change significantly from 2015 to 2025 by 2025 the np of arable land woodland grassland water area and rural residential land will increase to 62 153 39 393 4828 8237 and 25 737 respectively the land use types that show an increase in the pd index will be mainly arable land and rural residential areas at 0 559 number km 2 and 0 232 number km 2 respectively the land use types that show an increase in the lpi ed and lsi indices will be mainly woodland and water areas with the development of time the value of the pafrac index will show a gradually decreasing trend our findings show that land use interference in the wuhan metropolitan area will gradually increase natural landscape patches will become segmented and eroded and the degree of dispersion between patches will increase resulting in increased spatial heterogeneity as shown in table 8 the contag index will increase from 58 924 in 2015 to 62 737 in 2025 and the shdi and shei indices will increase from 1 358 and 0 653 in 2015 to 1 592 and 0 717 in 2025 respectively the ai cohesion and division will show an increasing trend influenced by human social activities therefore by 2025 the fragmentation degree will be further aggravated the landscape diversity will increase and the landscape heterogeneity will also be strengthened 5 discussion the main purpose of this study was to analyze the dynamic monitoring of lulc changes in the wuhan metropolitan area and to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban expansion and arable land evolution land use data topographic data poi data and socioeconomic data were used to predict the lulc dynamics in the wuhan metropolitan area a ca markov model and multi criterion suitability analysis method were used to simulate the land use dynamics in 2025 based on the gis spatial measurement technology the results showed that a large number of land use types will be converted and a large proportion of the other land use types will be converted into urban land indicating that the rapid socioeconomic development of the study area will promote a rapid increase in urban expansion we used a ca markov model to simulate the lulc changes from 2015 to 2025 and verified the reliability of the model so as to predict the future land use pattern in the model correction stage the kappa value of the simulation accuracy was 88 582 and the fom value was 27 935 indicating that the ca markov model can simulate and predict the land use pattern of the wuhan metropolitan area well however there are still some shortcomings the transition rules were mined based on historical land use data and a logistic model but there can be errors in the adjustment process for the model factors and parameters in the future the selection of factors and adjustment parameters in the simulation process could be further improved to make the simulation closer to reality moreover there was a lack of consideration of policy factors in the construction of the evaluation system which is also the content that needs to be refined in future research work furthermore as land use is a complex system affected by natural economic and social factors it is challenging to fully simulate its evolution process in future research there are still many areas that need to be improved for instance in the process of prediction it will be necessary to combine the latest development planning for the wuhan metropolitan area and to set different development scenarios to make the prediction results closer to the actual situation the land use simulation model is an effective tool for analyzing the driving force and process of lulc change feng et al 2020 as well as making future spatial planning decisions domingo et al 2021 in the current research on future lulc change some scholars have exploited different lulc simulation models counting on different goals and backgrounds but no single model can accurately capture the key process of evolution at different scales each lulc change model has its own potential constraints and limitations table 9 summarizes the research scale of the different models developed and used by scholars for lulc dynamics and urban growth study and it can be seen that these models have different precisions in different areas these models are not single models but are coupled models reflecting the new trend of coupling models in the simulation of land use and urban growth which can improve the simulation and prediction accuracy the regional lulc dynamics are the transition of land use patterns corresponding to the current stage of socioeconomic development aguilos et al 2021 ewane 2021 the evolution of the landscape pattern is the transition of land use structure influenced by industrial adjustment and economic development in the process of dynamic change over time sun and yan 2014 in rural areas the abandonment of arable land is changing the rural landscape around the world in urban areas the occupation of a large volume of arable land resources promotes the drastic growth of urban areas however with the implementation of the national policy of returning farmland to forest in china the forest land destroyed in the past has been gradually restored and the ecological land has shown an increasing trend lulc changes and landscape processes are interrelated and are influenced by biodiversity geophysical and socioeconomic drivers which form a complex and multi scale system burra et al 2021 xu and zhang 2021 the change of the landscape patterns leads to the lulc changes which are the result of the combined action of natural socioeconomic and policy factors of the socio ecosystem and external environment traditional society is subject to regional development potential and socioeconomic development conditions and urgently need to speed up a breakthrough in way of production zhu et al 2020 this shows that the functions of arable land and urban land will continue to be the focus on the win win of economic and ecological functions in the future development direction in addition it provides a security guarantee for realizing agricultural modernization urbanization and ecological security in the future the law of lulc change and urban development will no longer be to blindly pursue a single economic benefit but instead to highlight the intensive use of land resources this indicates that the landscape pattern represented by economically developed areas is changing from the traditional food and agriculture system to an ecological system fig 15 in recent years under the influence of many major events in the wuhan metropolitan area the urban land has clearly expanded fig 16 in the different stages of socioeconomic development the urban expansion patterns have shown significant differences the phased characteristics of urban spatial expansion are mainly influenced by national development strategy urban construction policy and land management policy since 1990 china has begun to implement the policy of economic and industrial development and the whole of society has entered a path with economic construction as the center and socioeconomics have gradually recovered during this period the wuhan metropolitan area has played a prominent role in national economic construction wuhan was approved as a foreign trade port and wuhan became a pilot city for the comprehensive reform of the national economic system in addition local government has also put forward the strategy of land transportation and air circulation by promoting land transportation and air circulation throughout the surrounding cities and towns this has promoted the connection between wuhan and the surrounding areas as well as other parts of the country so as to activate the market and enhance the comprehensive economic strength from 2000 to 2005 with the help of the accelerated economic development urban space expansion was very rapid in wuhan urban land in the wuhan metropolitan area was expanding rapidly but was mainly concentrated in the small and medium sized cities the pattern of urban expansion was mainly characterized by marginal expansion and enclave expansion or small agglomeration and large dispersion from 2005 to 2010 china was implementing a western pattern of development and the central region became the center of china s economic development during this period china put forward the strategy of promoting the rise of the central region and hubei province put forward the construction of the 1 8 wuhan metropolitan area in addition the pilot reform zone which was approved in 2007 as a two oriented society has been officially upgraded to a national strategy under the support of a series of policies economic construction and urban space expansion both approached a new climax and the annual growth rate of urban land was 102 325 km2 since 2010 in the core city of the wuhan metropolitan area the number of industrial enterprises has increased leading to rapid growth of the population economic scale and urban land scale the number of permanent residents increased from 29 312 million in 2010 to 31 952 million in 2015 gdp increased from 963 576 billion rmb in 2010 to 2215 3 billion rmb in 2015 and urban land increased by 378 523 km2 with 65 844 of the newly increased urban land was concentrated during this period the urban land in the wuhan metropolitan area was mainly expanded by edge type expansion which was mainly manifested as outlying expansion filling expansion zhang et al 2018 with the implementation of the strategy for the rise of central china and the rapid advancement of the overall urban and rural development in hubei province the urbanization process has further accelerated the expansion of urban land has increased and the frequent transfer of the various land use types has led to an increase in the number of people living in the area crankshaw and borel saladin 2019 since 2015 with the continuous development zone construction the introduction of modern science and technology and the agglomeration of service industry the urbanization rate of the wuhan metropolitan area has reached 63 521 at this stage urban expansion presented rapid development and the expansion mode was mainly edge type expansion outlying expansion and filling expansion based on our prediction of the future land use patterns the following suggestions are put forward for the land use management of the wuhan metropolitan area by 2025 the arable land area will continue to decrease and the decreasing trend of arable land will exceed the protected area of basic farmland the area of urban land will be constantly increasing and the region will need to preserve land resources such as unused land and grassland at the present stage the overall planning of the land use land use regulation and land macro control indices should be strictly followed in the wuhan metropolitan area thereby enhancing the awareness of arable land protection in the meantime government agencies should strengthen the spatial control of construction land and make full use of 3s technology for the dynamic monitoring of lulc in the key areas especially the industrial development areas and the urban rural boundary areas the impact of lulc changes is influenced by multiple factors and future research should fully explore environmental and socioeconomic factors such as detailed government planning policies so2 carbon sinks energy haze rich points of interest big data population migration data infrastructure living income etc constructing a model incorporating individual human decision making dataset factors into a predictive analysis framework and analyzing the impact mechanism of lulc changes will be important big data should also be used to validate land use ca simulation models and capture the impact of human actions on lulc dynamics 6 conclusion in this study we used land use data poi data and socioeconomic datasets of the wuhan metropolitan area to successfully simulate and evaluate the dynamics of lulc based on an integrated logistic mce ca markov model in addition we analyzed in detail the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and the influencing mechanisms of lulc change and urban land expansion in the study area these findings could play an important role in land use planning decisions by balancing and coordinating urban growth and arable land use and they could also be widely used in other areas of different scales to provide a reference however the interesting finding is that urban development does not necessarily have to come with a price because there is a trade off relationship between urban development and arable land local institutions and decision makers should set rational policy directions and conservation measures so that regional land use can adapt to the expansion of the population growth rate through the dynamic implementation of agricultural land policy rural land resources should be rationally allocated the dynamic monitoring of lulc change plays an important role in promoting the sustainable development of land resources in china s urbanization process similarly the results of this study will provide scientific guidance for government departments and local decision makers in future land use planning funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 42171411 41571384 credit authorship contribution statement quan wang writing original draft
