chirps persiann cdr era 5 and gpm imerg were evaluated to highlight their qualities and shortcomings and to guide researchers in the choice of these rainfall datasets to use for hydro meteorological applications in this study area five quantitative rmse kge and his three components and three qualitative pod far and csi statistical metrics are used to evaluate the amount and detection capacity of the rainfall datasets heavy rainfall percentiles are calculated to assess the ability of rainfall datasets to estimate rare and extreme rainfall new hydrological insights for the region mswep performs well for most statistical metrics and is recommended for most hydro meteorological research chirps and persiann cdr performs well in estimating the annual rainfall seasonality and are recommended for research on water resources management irrigation energy production etc chirps also performs well in estimating heavy rainfall percentiles and is also recommended for statistical research of heavy rainfall events era 5 and gpm imerg have a good ability to capture wet and dry days and is recommended for determination of climatic research or atmospheric sciences applications however bias reduction methods for these rainfall gridded datasets are advised before applications due to their low kge and high rmse graphical abstract ga1 keywords satellite rainfall caribbean region haiti kge heavy rainfall seasonality rainfall rainfall statistics extreme rainfall hispaniola hydrology tropical cyclone hurricane flood 1 introduction the greater and lesser antilles region experienced 264 tropical cyclones between 1960 and 2013 accounting for 95 of the total damage from all natural disasters in the region burgess et al 2018 these tropical cyclones generate heavy rainfall events khouakhi et al 2017 that cause large floods whose intensities and frequency will tend to increase due to climate change peterson et al 2002 given the vulnerability of greater and lesser antilles territories to hydro meteorological hazards rainfall databases are needed on a daily or sub daily timescale to calculate relevant indices e g the annual number of wet days above a certain threshold 100 year rainfall maxima to statistically characterize heavy rainfall events and to discuss their frequency and potential trends over time although rain gauges provide accurate local measurements of rainfall amount they are not numerous enough in this region to reflect the high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall kidd et al 2017 villarini et al 2008 this data scarcity is even more critical when studying heavy rainfall events which requires information on a fine spatiotemporal scale in this context remote sensing offers an opportunity to better study the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation griffith et al 1978 rainfall data obtained from remote sensing have the advantage of a wide spatiotemporal area coverage and have shown high potential for use in many applications dinku et al 2007 li et al 2015 such as rainfall and flow forecasting mapping heavy rainfall statistics flood hazard mapping and many other hydrological applications mazzoleni et al 2019 wannasin et al 2021 currently there are more than 10 precipitation products obtained by remote sensing available in the world covering different periods and different spatiotemporal scales centella artola et al 2020 these remotely sensed precipitation products were created mainly from i satellite data infrared observations passive microwave observations soil moisture observations etc ii combinations of different data sources satellite rainfall estimates sre reanalysis rainfall products observation data etc or iii using atmospheric physics models coupled with reference data to create reanalysis products such as era 5 reanalysis several papers have evaluated the performance of such rainfall gridded datasets rgd at different spatiotemporal scales and in different climate regions baez villanueva et al 2018 prakash 2019 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 tan and santo 2018 xu et al 2017 results indicate that the performance of the rgd is highly dependent on topography geography and climate tang et al 2019 evaluated the performance of four rgd in six climate regions in the mekong basin of southeast asia the rainfall products were divided into seven classes with the purpose of evaluating the ability of rgd products to estimate light and heavy rainfall in different climatic zones the results showed that all four products performed differently in the six climate zones although the rgd tended to perform better in wet climates than in dry climates alijanian et al 2017 evaluated the performance of five rgd in eight climatic zones in iran through correlation coefficient root mean square error and relative error during the period 2003 2012 their results showed that the performance of rgd varies with climate zones with better performance in very hot and humid climates the same conclusions were drawn for heavy rainfall rainfall above the 90th percentile for two rgd in china by fang et al 2019 in addition to the influence of climate on the performance of rgd fang et al 2019 showed that topography also has a significant influence on heavy rainfall estimation with correlation coefficients that decrease with altitude these few examples show the advantages and limitations of the rgd in the regions studied and the need to evaluate their performance for the lesser and greater antilles because the climate dynamics of these islands have a range of concurrent interactions between mid latitudes and tropical features at all spatial scales martinez et al 2019 in the caribbean region several studies have used rgd as baseline data to study spatial and temporal rainfall variability angeles et al 2010 jones et al 2016 jury 2016 flood mapping bozza et al 2016 and the dynamic mechanisms that determine the spatial and temporal patterns of the seasonal cycle martinez et al 2019 moron et al 2016 but very few studies compared such databases with rainfall observations in the caribbean region which including the greater and lesser antilles however very few studies have evaluated their performance specifically in the greater and lesser antilles a first comparison between rainfall observations reanalysis satellite and coupled model datasets was performed by jury 2009 the first part of the study aimed to evaluate in a qualitative way the ability of rgd to capture several climatic features over the caribbean region and the second part of the study evaluated the ability of gridded rainfall to capture the annual rainfall cycle more recently a study evaluating the performance of 16 rgd on a monthly timescale was done by centella artola et al 2020 in the caribbean the results show that mswep is one of the best performing rgd and era 5 performed best among the reanalysis products both the evaluations by jury 2009 and centella artola et al 2020 were done on a monthly timescale nevertheless using long typically several decades temporal series at the daily or sub daily timestep is required for hydrological studies dedicated to heavy rainfall and flood statistics the performance of these rainfall gridded datasets products varies from one timescale to another and they tend to perform better on a monthly than a daily timescale sultana and nasrollahi 2018 tan et al 2015 in this context this work aims to evaluate the general performance of five rainfall gridded datasets rgd available at the daily time step over the period 1980 2019 mswep chirps era 5 persiann cdr and gpm imerg these four rgd are chosen according to i their performance in the greater and lesser antilles on a monthly timescale centella artola et al 2020 and ii their availability on a daily timescale over several decades to our knowledge this is the first study on the evaluation of rgd in the greater and lesser antilles on a daily timescale aiming to highlight the qualities and shortcomings of rgd over these poorly instrumented islands this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the study area sections 3 and 4 present the data and methods used sections 5 and 6 present the results and discussion and section 7 presents conclusion to the paper 2 study area the study area shown in fig 1 is the region between north america and south america and includes the islands that are surrounded by the gulf of mexico in the north west the caribbean sea in the south and the atlantic ocean in the east these islands are often represented in two major groups the greater antilles grouping cuba hispaniola jamaica and puerto rico and the lesser antilles which is an island group located to the east and southeast of the caribbean sea and composed of the islands of the southern part of the caribbean arc from puerto rico to south america the greater antilles has a bimodal annual rainfall cycle with a first rainy season in may and a second rainy season between september and november this bimodal annual rainfall cycle is influenced by the nash north atlantic subtropical high davis et al 1997 and the cllj caribbean low level jet cook and vizy 2010 the lesser antilles has a unimodal annual rainfall cycle strongly influenced by the itcz intertropical convergence zone hastenrath 2002 with peak rainfall in november the heavy rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles observed between september and november is strongly influenced by tropical cyclones of the north atlantic 85 of intense tropical cyclones originate in east african waves agudelo et al 2011 thorncroft and hodges 2001 coupled with the atlantic warm pool area with sea temperatures greater than 28 5 c wang and enfield 2003 and the intertropical convergence zone rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles depends on dominant easterlies topography and land sea interactions the spatial pattern of rainfall in these islands is very inhomogeneous due to their complex topography cantet 2017 moron et al 2015 rainfall is relatively important 2 000 4 000 mm year in the higher elevations and windward parts smith et al 2012 in contrast annual rainfall can be as low as 500 mm year in the leeward areas daly et al 2003 3 rainfall data used the rainfall data used in this study are classified into two categories the rain gauge data that will be used as reference and the rgd rainfall gridded datasets a short description of both types of rainfall dataset is provided below 3 1 rain gauge data 3 1 1 presentation of the reference rain gauges the set of 146 rainfall series that we will use in this study comes from several institutions météo france the hydrometeorological unit of haiti uhm the caribbean institute for meteorology and hydrology cimh the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the meteorological service of jamaica metservice the meteorological institute of the republic of cuba insmet and the national meteorological office of the dominican republic onamet fig 2 presents the gaps in the data availability for each dataset 3 1 2 quality control of the reference rain gauges rain gauge data are used as reference data to evaluate the performance of rgd in the greater and lesser antilles these reference data can have considerable measurement errors sevruk et al 2009 viney and bates 2004 therefore quality control is an essential step before evaluating the rgd to identify and discard periods or rain gauges with significant measurement errors we used a procedure with the following steps this method is inspired by that of beck et al 2019 a remove the rainy days with more than 1000 mm d b remove months with more than 20 days of missing data c remove years with more than 200 days of missing data d remove stations with less than 5 years of data e test the uniformity of the data series from the annual sum of the stations by the method of cumulative residuals as described by bois 1987 this method consists of plotting the cumulative residuals of the linear regression between a reference station and a station to be tested the 90 confidence intervals for the cumulative residuals of each year are plotted to form a confidence ellipse inside which the curve of the cumulative residuals should remain the reference station is a synthetic station formed by the median of the annual accumulations of all stations in the same country 19 of 146 rain gauges were removed after quality control testing on reference data among the 127 rain gauges remaining 27 are in guadeloupe 25 in martinique 21 in dominican republic 5 in haiti 4 in cuba 10 in jamaica 22 in puerto rico and 13 in small islands where cimh provided rain gauge data 3 1 3 independence of the rain gauges from the stations used for rgd development of the five rgd used in our analysis three rgd mswep chirps and persiann cdr have been used rainfall products derived from rain gauges such as gpcc schneider et al 2014 gsod https www ncei noaa gov access metadata landing page bin iso id gov noaa ncdc c00516 ghcn menne et al 2012 and gpcp adler et al 2003 and two rgd chirps and mswep have been used rain gauges directly the rain gauges used by chirps are form mexico central america south america and sub saharan africa funk et al 2015 and not from the greater and the lesser antilles however beck et al 2019 have been used daily rainfall series form the greater and the lesser antilles to calibrate mswep rainfall dataset we excluded the 24 rain gauges figure a 2 in appendix identified as positioned within a 1 km radius from rain gauges mentioned as used within the mswep v2 8 dataset to ensure the independence of the rain gauges from the stations used for rgd development among the 103 rain gauges remaining 27 are in guadeloupe 22 in martinique 19 in dominican republic 5 in haiti 2 in cuba 10 in jamaica 6 in puerto rico and 12 in small islands where cimh provided rain gauge data 3 2 rgd rainfall gridded datasets 3 2 1 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr persiann cdr is a multi satellite product that provides daily precipitation estimates with a spatial resolution of 0 25 from 1983 onwards ashouri et al 2015 the persiann artificial neural model is pre trained with ncep national centers for environmental prediction stage iv hourly precipitation radar data then persiann cdr is generated by the persiann algorithm using gridsat b1 infrared data knapp 2008 the final product is adjusted with the monthly gpcp global precipitation climatology project product to ensure that both datasets are consistent on a monthly scale 3 2 2 climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps chirps precipitation estimates version 2 are available from 1981 onwards with a spatial and temporal resolution of 0 05 24 h funk et al 2015 this database uses monthly precipitation climatology chpclim climate hazards group precipitation climatology quasi global geostationary thermal infrared satellite observations tropical rainfall measuring mission s trmm 3b42 product atmospheric model rainfall fields from noaa cfs climate forecast system and precipitation observations from different sources including national or regional meteorological services the chirps production requires two steps first pentad five day rainfall estimates are created from ccd cold cloud duration which are obtained from regression models and calibrated by using trmm 3b42 pentad precipitation these estimates are expressed as a percentage of normal precipitation by dividing the estimated values for regression models by their long term averages this outcome is names chirp then in situ observation from stations are blended with chirp data in order to produce chirps 3 2 3 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep the second version of mswep as described by beck et al 2017 is a global gridded dataset for the period 1979 2017 with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 1 3 h this dataset is derived by merging rainfall estimates based on rain gauges coming from different databases worldclim fick and hijmans 2017 ghcn d menne et al 2012 gsod https data noaa gov and national databases from different country different sre cmorph joyce et al 2004 gridsat knapp et al 2011 gsmap ushio et al 2009 and tmpa 3b42rt huffman et al 2007 and reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 and jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 to build mswep beck et al 2019 was evaluated the performance of the gridded datasets using the correlation coefficient of the gridded data with the 3 day mean rainfall data next the data were merged via weighted averaging using the interpolated weight maps deduced from the correlation coefficients the biases of the merged data are corrected by a multiplicative approach used by vila et al 2009 to preserve the sub daily rainfall distribution 3 2 4 era 5 we use the fifth generation of the atmospheric global climate reanalysis era 5 available from 1980 onwards with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 25 1 h hersbach et al 2020 era 5 is produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf this new reanalysis replaces the era interim reanalysis that started in 2006 era 5 benefits from decades of developments in the dynamics of data assimilation models and combines them with observations of wind pressure temperature precipitation and humidity from several satellites and from observations near the earth s surface and over the oceans from upper air soundings and from atmospheric measurements from aircraft instruments this is based on the hybrid 4d var data assimilation method using the cy41r2 cycle of the integrated forecast system ifs cy41r2 hersbach and de rosnay 2018 3 2 5 nasa global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg the gpm imerg was launched in february 2014 as the successor to trmm to provide the next generation of global precipitation products it consists of one core observatory and approximately 10 constellation satellites the core observatory carries a ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar and a multi channel gpm imerg microwave imager extending the measurement range of trmm instruments gpm imerg provides three levels of precipitation related products the level 3 products are produced with the imerg algorithm which intercalibrates and merges precipitation estimates from all constellation microwave sensors microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates and monthly gauge precipitation data hou et al 2014 the gpm imerg products available from 2000 onwards offer a relatively fine spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and high temporal resolution of 30 min the gpm imerg day 1 final run v6 data is used in this study the final run product introduces gpcc rainfall dataset schneider et al 2014 for bias correction generally considered to be more accurate results than the near real time products early and late run and is thus widely used in hydrology and climate researches huffman et al 2015 table a 1 in appendix briefly lists the main characteristics of the selected gridded rainfall data persiann cdr chirps mswep era 5 and gpm imerg 4 methodology in this section we describe the methodology designed to evaluate the performance of rgd in the greater and lesser antilles four of the used rgd are available from 1980 persiann cdr chirps mswep and era 5 and gpm imerg is available from 2000 gpm imerg is a rgd widely used in hydrological applications li et al 2021 pradhan et al 2021 wang et al 2022 and has thus being used in this study despite its shorter temporal extension thus we evaluated the performance of four rgd mswep era 5 chirps and persiann cdr over the 1980 2019 period and all five rgd over the 2000 2019 period first the method used to compare rgd grid points and rain gauges temporal series is presented subsection 4 1 then the different performance measures calculated are listed subsection 4 2 4 1 comparison between rgd grid points and rain gauges temporal series 4 1 1 point to pixel analysis a point to pixel analysis was applied to compare the time series of the reference rain gauge stations i e the points with the corresponding grid cell values i e the pixels this approach has been chosen over the pixel to pixel methodology saemian et al 2021 given the sparse rain gauges density over the studied region thus the application of a pixel to pixel methodology requires to have a gridded reference dataset or to spatially interpolate reference rain gauges data in the lesser antilles particularly in the martinique and guadeloupe french islands cf figure a 3 in appendix more than one rain gauge is counted on the same rgd pixel for each rgd pixel containing more than one rain gauges an area weighted average of the considered rain gauge series has been performed using the thiessen polygons e g liu et al 2015 tang et al 2020 4 1 2 rgd upscaling the four rgd considered have different spatial resolutions the point to pixel analysis has been performed i to the original rgd resolution and also ii at a similar resolution of 0 25 which is the resolution of the era 5 and persiann cdr coarser rgd considered thus an upscaling of the chirps and mswep datasets has been performed to a new spatial resolution of 0 25 by using bilinear interpolation baez villanueva et al 2018 4 1 3 use of two different rain gauges sets the mswep rgd has been produced considering different ground datasets including several rain gauges see subsection 3 1 3 thus this bias corrected dataset is expected to better perform than the rgd that do not use rain gauge stations e g baez villanueva et al 2018 to ensure the independence of the rain gauge stations used as reference in our study and those used during the rgd construction we calculated the performances of the rgd on two different rain gauges sets first 103 rain gauges are considered excluding the 24 rain gauges identified as positioned within a 1 km radius from rain gauges mentioned as used within the mswep v2 8 datasets then all the 127 rain gauges are considered the excluded rain gauges are identified in the figure a 2 in appendix 4 2 evaluation of the rgd performances the rgd were evaluated along four characteristics a general performance b reproduction of wet and dry days c reproduction of rainfall seasonality d estimation of heavy rainfall 4 2 1 general performances of the rgd 4 2 1 1 performances at the daily time steps the general performance of the rgd are evaluated at the daily time step by five statistical metrics a the root mean square error rmse mm d b the correlation coefficient r c the α coefficient α ratio of the standard deviation of the rgd to the standard deviation of the observations d the β coefficient β ratio of the mean of the rgd to the observations e the kling and gupta efficiency score kge gupta et al 2009 the kge score is widely used in hydrology in order to compare observations with model simulations e g arciniega esparza et al 2022 mathevet et al 2020 and is also used the context of rgd comparison with rain gauges series e g baez villanueva et al 2018 centella artola et al 2020 saemian et al 2021 the kge is a combination of the r β and α coefficients and thus evaluates the general performance of the rgd in reproducing rainfall in the greater and the lesser antilles the optimal values of the α β coefficients and of the kge criteria are 1 the correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the linear relationship between the rgd and the rain gauges the results vary between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect negative correlation while 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation the α coefficient evaluates the dispersion of the rgd compared to the observed data the β coefficient evaluates the bias of the rgd by measuring the average tendency of the rgd values to overestimate β 1 or underestimate β 1 the root mean square error is used as a measure of the average absolute error an optimal value for rmse is 0 mm d 4 2 1 2 performances at the monthly and annual time steps general performances of the rgd are also evaluated at the monthly and annual timesteps by estimating r α and kge on monthly and annual time series kuentz et al 2015 note that β has the same value on these different timescales 4 2 2 rainfall detection three categorical statistics criteria are used to evaluate the capacity for rgd to detect wet and dry days there are four possible cases mashingia et al 2014 i the rgd detects rainfall that is really observed ii the rgd detects rainfall that is not observed iii the rgd does not detect rainfall that is observed and iv the rgd and rain gauge do not detect any rainfall based on these cases the following categorical statistics are evaluated a the probability of detecting rainfall pod b the false alarm rate far c the critical success index csi the probability of detection measures the capacity of the rgd to correctly detect the rainfall observed the results are between 0 and 1 optimal value the false alarm rate measures the proportion of days in which the rgd measures rainfall that was not observed by the rain gauges results are between 0 optimal value and 1 the critical success index illustrates the fraction of observed rain that was correctly detected by the rgd the optimal value of the critical success index is 1 alijanian et al 2017 table a 2 in appendix lists the statistical metrics used to evaluate the rgd over the lesser and the greater antilles 4 2 3 rainfall seasonality annual rainfall cycles are calculated with the 15 day aggregated rainfall data for the 103 reference rain gauges and on the rgd pixels corresponding to these reference data below the 15 day aggregation the annual rainfall patterns are noisy and of little interest the finest timescale relevant to present the annual rainfall pattern is the 15 day aggregation the result is averaged over the greater and the lesser antilles to highlight the annual rainfall pattern and to assess the ability of the rgd to reproduce the rainfall seasonality in the area study 4 2 4 heavy rainfall statistics the ratios of the 90th and 99th rainfall percentiles and the maximum annual rainfall of each reference rain gauge to the corresponding rgd are calculated to estimate the ability of the rgd to assess heavy rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles a ratio greater than 1 indicates an overestimation of rgd and a ratio below 1 indicates an underestimation of rgd lastly the summary statistics such as average maximum and standard deviation were calculated for selected rainfall percentiles of the rainfall datasets 5 results 5 1 evaluation of the rgd performances over 1980 2019 5 1 1 rgd general performance on a daily timescale fig 3 summarizes the performance of the rgd in estimating daily rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles through the kge criterion and its components correlation coefficient dispersion and bias and the mean square error using the 103 considered rain gauges overall the performance over the greater and lesser antilles are not significantly different mswep is the most correlated with the reference data with a correlation coefficient of 0 5 in the greater antilles and slightly less in the lesser antilles mswep has a good dispersion and a low bias with α and β coefficients close to 1 these relatively good values of r α and β coefficients combine to produce a relatively good kge for mswep with values between 0 45 and 0 5 in the greater and lesser antilles era 5 is the second most correlated rgd with the reference data with correlation coefficients between 0 35 and 0 4 but that the dispersion around the mean value of era 5 is low α near to 0 5 and a priori the estimates of era 5 are relatively uniform and are unable to capture heavy rainfall well as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 era 5 underestimates the reference data with biases β between 0 65 and 0 75 this weakness in the dispersion around the mean value and underestimation of the reference rainfall makes era 5 the worst performing rgd with kge between 0 1 and 0 15 persiann cdr has a better kge score than chirps in the lesser antilles mainly due to a better correlation of persiann cdr compared to chirps however in the greater antilles the r α and β coefficients and thus the kge scores of persiann cdr and chirps are similar overall the performance of chirps in the lesser and greater antilles is impaired by its low correlation coefficient with the reference data but the lack of performance of era 5 is influenced by their low dispersion around the mean value α near to 0 5 the rmse coefficient is relatively low for era 5 and persiann cdr and is about 11 mm d in contrast the rmse coefficient is very high for chirps and is about 17 mm d fig 4 shows a spatial representation of the performance results of the four rgd via the kge statistical metric in general the kge score tends to be relatively high in the eastern greater antilles dominican republic and puerto rico in particular in puerto rico and in the north of the lesser antilles including guadeloupe and the kge score is relatively low in the west of the greater antilles notably in haiti and jamaica and in the north of the lesser antilles including martinique mswep shows the same spatial pattern in the greater antilles but the kge scores are almost uniform in the lesser antilles and have no particular spatial pattern 5 1 2 rgd rainfall detection capacity evaluation indices the ability of the rgd to identify wet and dry days is presented in fig 5 era 5 then mswep have a good capacity to reproduce the rainy days observed on the ground for the lesser and greater antilles pod 0 9 for era 5 and pod 0 75 for mswep that is on all the wet days recorded by the rain gauge 90 were detected by era 5 and 75 by mswep the false alarm rate is on average 0 5 in the greater antilles and 0 25 in the lesser antilles out of all the wet days detected by an rgd 50 were not observed in the rain gauges of the greater antilles and 25 in the lesser antilles the fraction of rainfall observed and correctly detected by the rgd represented by the csi coefficient was 0 5 for mswep and era 5 in the greater antilles and 0 65 0 7 for mswep and era 5 in the lesser antilles and in the range of 0 25 0 30 for chirps and persiann in summary era 5 is the best performing rgd to identify wet and dry days before mswep with a very high pod and a similar csi although far of era 5 is higher than mswep in contrast chirps is the least efficient rgd to identify wet and dry days with low pod and csi these results are very important as these rgd may be used to calculate extreme climate indices such as the annual number of wet days above a certain threshold annual number of wet days or the maximum number of consecutive dry days and therefore the results obtained should be adjusted accordingly 5 1 3 rgd general performance on daily monthly and annual timescales in this section we present in addition to the daily timescale evaluated in sections 5 1 1 and 5 1 2 the ability of the rgd to estimate rainfall on monthly and annual timescales using the kge criterion and their r α and β components the biases β is not shown in fig 6 because it is constant on daily monthly and annual timescales the dispersion α changes slightly on daily monthly and annual scales with era 5 showing low dispersion around the mean value relatively uniform rainfall at all three timescales only the correlation coefficient affects the performance of the rgd at the three temporal scales studied all rgd correlate very well with the reference rainfall data on a monthly scale with correlation coefficient values that reach on average 0 75 for mswep in the greater antilles and for all rgd in the lesser antilles the correlation coefficients on an annual scale are slightly worse than those on a monthly scale but significantly better than the daily scale correlation coefficients r 0 7 at the monthly time scale and r 0 5 at the daily time scale see fig 6 although the correlation coefficients of all rgd are better on monthly and annual scales the kge scores of era 5 in the greater antilles and era 5 and persiann cdr in the lesser antilles are significantly reduced because of their biases and their low α coefficient at daily monthly and annual scales 5 1 4 the annual rainfall cycle the reference rainfall series as well as the corresponding rgd pixels were aggregated over a 15 day period and the annual average rainfall cycle was calculated for each aggregated data series then the annual rainfall cycles were averaged for the greater and lesser antilles see fig 7 the results show that the average annual rainfall cycle in the greater antilles is divided into 4 seasons with two rainfall peaks during the year winter dry season wds from late november to mid march with an average rainfall of 3 mm d early rainy season ers from mid march to mid may with a peak rainfall of about 7 mm d mid summer drought msd from mid may to early august which is a less rainy season interspersed between the two heavy rainy seasons with a rainfall of a little over 4 mm d and late rainy season lrs from early august to late november with an average rainfall of 7 mm d these four seasons are also observed in the lesser antilles however with the msd season being wetter than the ers season as a result the lesser antilles has an increasing rainfall from wds to reach a peak of about 8 mm d in late october to early november all the rgd have well captured the general pattern of the mean annual cycle well with a bimodal precipitation cycle a peak of rainfall in mid may and a late rainy period from august to november in the greater antilles and of the unimodal cycle in the lesser antilles in the greater antilles the rainfall amounts of the mswep chirps and persiann cdr from mid may to early november are in very good agreement with the reference data but these rgd underestimate the rainfall from november to early may all rgd strongly underestimate rainfall in the lesser antilles except chiprs which reproduces the annual rainfall cycle very well era 5 and persiann cdr capture the amplitude of the rainfall in the lesser antilles very poorly 5 1 5 heavy rainfall performance indices in this section we will present the ability of the studied rgd to estimate heavy rainfall accurately by studying their 90th and 99th percentile rainfall and their maximum annual rainfall fig 8 gives a spatial representation of the ratios r of 90th percentiles of the rgd estimates to the reference data and thus shows the areas where the 90th percentile rainfall is overestimated or underestimated by the rgd areas of underestimation r 1 of the reference data are represented by dots and areas of overestimation r 1 are represented by triangles overall the rgd tend to slightly underestimate the 90th percentile rainfall in the study area and especially in the lesser antilles and the eastern part of the greater antilles but all the rgd systematically overestimate the reference data in the north of haiti and south east of cuba and sometimes in jamaica although rgd tend to underestimate the 90th percentile rainfall mswep and chirps have a good ability to estimate the 90th percentile rainfall r close to 1 in the eastern part of the greater antilles and in the northern part of the lesser antilles this spatial variability of heavy rainfall is fairly well measured by chirps with however an overestimation of the 90th percentile rainfall in the lesser antilles and a little less well by mswep with an underestimation of the heavy rainfall percentiles era 5 and to a lesser extent persiann cdr strongly underestimate heavy rainfall percentiles and are unable to represent them spatially over the greater and lesser antilles the results of the rgd performance in estimating heavy rainfall are summarized in fig 9 the gray horizontal line delineates the area where the rgd overestimate the reference percentiles area above the line from the area where the rgd underestimate the reference percentiles area below the line rgd are generally better at estimating heavy rainfall in the greater antilles than in the lesser antilles chirps and mswep perform well in estimating heavy rainfall percentiles in the greater antilles and somewhat less well in the lesser antilles in general all rgd tend to underestimate the 90th and 99th rainfall percentiles and the maximum annual rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles except chirps which overestimates these heavy rainfall percentiles in the lesser antilles era 5 underestimates by half the percentiles of heavy rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles and is the least efficient of the four rgd the 5 25 50 75 and 95 rainfall percentiles are calculated for the 103 considered rain gauges and corresponding rgd pixels in the greater and lesser antilles the mean maximum and standard deviation values of each rainfall database used are presented in table a 3 in appendix the results show that on average more than 75 of the days during our study period had rainfall less than 5 mm d and these low rainfall events are well captured by era 5 and persiann cdr in contrast chirps mswep and persiann cdr tend to capture the heavy rainfall percentiles with chirps overestimating heavy rainfall percentiles and mswep and persiann cdr underestimating them although persiann cdr gives good estimates of heavy rainfall percentile values it strongly underestimates the maximum values 5 1 6 performance of original and upscaled rgd the statistical metrics described in the methodology section are computed for the rgd with their original spatial resolution see subsections 4 1 2 and 4 2 1 and additionally computed for a shared spatial resolution upscaled to 0 25 we present in fig 10 the results for two quantitative metrics the rmse and the kge and the three qualitative metrics pod far and csi for the original and upscaled mswep and chirps rgd the original era 5 and persiann rgd are already at 0 25 so they are not upscaled a decrease of the rmse values is observed for the upscaled rgd which is much more pronounced for chirps especially in the lesser antilles in general we observe a decrease in the kge metric for the upscaled rgd except for chirps in the lesser antilles overall the upscaled rgd have a better ability to detect rainy days and dry days represented by a higher pod and csi despite the fact that the far increased for chirps in the greater antilles fig 11 shows the rainfall regime pattern of the original and upscaled rgd the patterns obtained at the 0 25 resolution are generally similar to these obtained at the original spatial resolution with an overall underestimation of rainfall for the upscaled rgd the rainfall is strongly underestimated particularly in the rainy season september to november in the lesser antilles although the rgd underestimate the rainfall they correctly capture the rainfall regime fig 11 for the two spatial resolutions these results show that the rainfall regime pattern is more sensitive to the spatial scale variation of the rgd in the lesser antilles than in the greater antilles 5 1 7 performance of three rain gauges sets the performance of the four rgd is evaluated using the sets of rain gauges described in section 4 1 3 the first subset subset 1 see fig 12 consists of 103 rain gauges excluding the 24 rain gauges used in mswep the second subset subset 2 consists of only the 24 rain gauges used in mswep and the third subset consists of all the rain gauges subset 1 2 the results are presented in fig 12 for the kge criterion which synthesizes the performance of three statistical metrics and is a good tool to evaluate the overall performance of the rgd the results of all 5 quantitative statistical metrics for subsets 1 were presented in fig 3 while the results for subsets 1 2 are presented in the appendix in figure a 1 clearly the performance of mswep is much better than the other three rgd for subset 2 fig 12 because these rain gauges are used to calibrate mswep the ranks of performance of the rgd with subset 1 and subset 1 2 are similar with a somewhat better performance of mswep with subset 1 2 5 2 evaluation of the rgd performances over 2000 2019 fig 13 presents the performance of the five rgd over 2000 2019 using five statistical metrics the results shown in fig 13 do not show any significant difference in terms of mswep chirps persiann cdr and era 5 rgd performance over the two time periods studied gpm imerg has difficulty to quantify rainfall volume in our study area with the highest rmse in the greater antilles negative kge in both the greater antilles and lesser antilles and poorly represents heavy rainfall not shown although its performance is better than era 5 and persiann cdr however gpm imerg has a good ability to detect rainy and dry days with pod and csi scores better than chirps in the greater antilles and chirps and persiann cdr in the lesser antilles gpm imerg has difficulty representing the rainfall regime in the greater and lesser antilles as shown in fig 14 the may rainfall peaks are captured late around june and sometimes early july by gpm imerg november rainfall peaks in the lesser antilles are captured early late august to early october by gpm imerg in addition gpm imerg underestimates the rainfall pattern in the winter dry season wds and overestimates the rainfall regime from may to november 6 discussion 6 1 comparison of rgd performances the performance of the rgd over the studied region reflects the philosophy behind their design mswep was designed for operational research in hydrology to improve our understanding of hydrological processes and enhance hydrological model performance beck et al 2019 thus mswep has been produced by merging gridded rainfall data and daily rainfall data therefore mswep performs well in most of the statistical metrics considered chirps is designed for monitoring extremes which is why chirps gives good estimates of heavy rainfall percentiles over the studied region the performance of persiann cdr is poor over our study area this poor performance of persiann cdr might be due to the data used to construct precipitation datasets persiann cdr has used an algorithm based on artificial neural networks with trained by the stage iv radar data but this radar data itself is biased habib et al 2009 sharif et al 2020 in addition persiann cdr used mainly infrared ir data that provide a measure of cloud top brightness temperature which correlates with the probability of cloud precipitation brochart and andréassian 2014 but the performance of an ir based algorithm is less accurate for some types of cloud warm rain clouds and cold high cirrus non raining clouds ashouri et al 2015 reanalysis products are designed to study climate variability on a large spatio temporal scale and have wide application in atmospheric sciences this explains the good ability of era 5 to detect rainfall occurrences high pod but due to its too coarse spatial resolution era 5 underestimates the rainfall amplitude in our study area the poor performance of gpm imerg can be explained because it is a purely satellite based rgd and does not use reference rain gauges to calibrate its estimates pradhan et al 2022 have reviewed the performance of gpm imerg at the global scale and show that gpm imerg does not perform well to represent heavy and light rainfall especially at the daily and sub daily scales despite its limitations the fine spatio temporal resolution of gpm imerg and its improvement with each new version pradhan et al 2022 reveals a promising path for current and future applications 6 2 are rgd limitations over lesser and greater antilles site specific although mswep is the best performing rgd the general performances obtained over the greater and lesser antilles are lower than performances obtained by mswep over other regions in southeast asia tang et al 2019 iran alijanian et al 2017 and austria sharifi et al 2019 correlation coefficients obtained by comparing mswep and rain gauges at the daily timestep are generally greater than 0 75 while these correlation coefficients are less than 0 6 in the caribbean this can be explained by the fact that most satellite products have difficulty observing local convection systems in the caribbean islands jury 2009 the winter dry season wds fig 7 in the greater antilles is underestimated by all four rgd while the other three seasons are well reproduced these results corroborate the work of brochart and andréassian 2014 who showed that low rainfall tends to be underestimated by rgd in french guyana the four rgd overestimate the rainfall percentiles in the area between the western part of hispaniola and eastern cuba fig 8 this corroborates the result of jury 2009 showing that remotely sensed rainfall products fail to capture the low rainfall area between haiti cuba and jamaica due to the mountainous terrain rising to 2000 m in a northwest southeast axis extending for 200 km creating a significant wind and rain shadow towards jamaica and cuba the topography is very complex and influences the spatial pattern of rainfall however the rain gauges used in our study are mostly located in low lying areas and this is of little relevance to study the relationship between topography and rainfall the use of the digital terrain model dem in the greater and lesser antilles to study the spatial variability of rainfall and to evaluate the performance of the rgd in relation to the topography is an interesting perspective 6 3 limitation of the point to pixel comparison the point to pixel comparison allows to compare the point data of the rain gauges to the area data of the rgd the comparison of the performances of the original and upscaled rgd allows to evaluate the impact of the spatial resolution of the rgd on their performance and thus to evaluate the limit of the point to pixel approach there was no clear trend in the impact of the spatial resolution of the rgd on their performance for the two quantitative metrics used we observed a decrease in kge except for chirps in the lesser antilles and an improvement in rmse for the upscaled rgd the rmse strongly penalizes errors on heavy rainfall but the rgd upscaled tend to smooth heavy rainfall and therefore the rmse is less penalizing with the rgd upscaled this may explain the better rmse score for the upscaled rgd therefore caution should be used when evaluating the performance of rgd using rmse baez villanueva et al 2018 as the results may not reflect the real performance of rgd the ability of rgd to capture both rainy and dry days is improved for upscaled rgd this can be explained by the rgd being averaged over a larger area and therefore having a higher number of rainy days than the original rgd this could either increase the number of days of rainfall detected by the rgd and rain gauges and or decrease the number of days of rainfall detected by the rain gauges and not by the rgd and therefore increase the pod and or csi the underestimation of rainfall cycle pattern by the rgd particularly in the lesser antilles fig 11 can be explained by the spatial resolution of the rgd which is too coarse compared to the surface area of the lesser antilles islands e g 1128 km2 for martinique indeed the largest spatial resolution of the rgd is 0 25 more than 650 km2 which represents more than half the area of martinique the rgd rainfall is therefore averaged over too large an area and does not adequately capture the rainfall peaks and its spatial variability in this region 6 4 uncertainty of the reference rain gauge observations the spatial patterns of the kge score show that kge scores are systematically higher in some countries puerto rico and martinique than in others haiti and jamaica for example for all rgd the results may well show a good performance of the rgd in the east of the greater antilles and the north of the lesser antilles however this result should be taken with caution as we have assumed that the observed rainfall series is the reference without taking into account uncertainty of these reference series moreover the best kge scores are obtained for countries whose meteorological services have well documented and good quality reference data such as noaa and météo france thus there is a possibility that the spatial pattern of kge scores may reflect countries with good quality reference data in our study the effect of using a large number of reference rain gauges in the lesser antilles and a small number of reference rain gauges in the greater antilles was not evaluated particularly on the underestimation of the rainfall cycle in the lesser antilles nevertheless centella artola et al 2020 considered a larger number of rain gauges over the greater antilles and showed that rgd underestimate the rainfall cycle in the lesser antilles particularly during the rainy season september to november 7 conclusion in this study the performance of five rainfall gridded datasets rgd namely mswep chirps persiann cdr era 5 and gpm imerg were evaluated using 103 rain gauges in the lesser and greater antilles with the aim of highlighting the qualities and shortcomings of these rgd on a daily timescale and to guide researchers in the choice of rgd to use for hydrometeorological applications in this study area to our knowledge this is the first work done on rgd data on daily timescale in this region for hydrological applications in the greater and lesser antilles or on a watershed scale the use of mswep is recommended due to its high kge score and high spatio temporal resolution 0 1 and 3 h on the other hand chirps era 5 gpm imerg and persiann cdr are not recommended due to their low kge score and or coarse spatial resolution which are not appropriate for the greater and lesser antilles countries for climatological applications mainly to calculate climatic indexes such as number of rainy days exceeding a threshold number of consecutive rainy days etc era 5 gmp imerg and mswep are recommended due to their better pod and csi scores mswep chirps and persiann cdr are recommended in the greater and lesser antilles for research on water resources management for irrigation energy production industry etc due to their ability to represent the annual rainfall seasonality for applications on heavy rainfall statistics chirps and mswep are recommended for their good capacity to estimate the percentiles of heavy rainfall in summary mswep is recommended for most hydrometeorological applications in the study area because of its good performance for almost all statistical metrics and its good spatio temporal resolution this work provides a guide to users of rainfall data in the lesser and greater antilles on their choice of rgd to use in countries with very limited rainfall data such as haiti taking into account the benefits and drawbacks of each rgd the evaluation of these rgd performances might be extended on the studied region using other validation metrics based on different parameters such as satellite derived soil moisture products or rainfall runoff modeling gampe and ludwig 2017 musie et al 2019 no tests have evaluated the rgd performance in measuring light rainfall which would be useful for drought monitoring this work could be a good direction for future research finally the use of such rgd as inputs of rainfall runoff models for flood forecasting flood mapping or hydraulic structure design is an interesting application of this

chirps persiann cdr era 5 and gpm imerg were evaluated to highlight their qualities and shortcomings and to guide researchers in the choice of these rainfall datasets to use for hydro meteorological applications in this study area five quantitative rmse kge and his three components and three qualitative pod far and csi statistical metrics are used to evaluate the amount and detection capacity of

heavy rainfall seasonality rainfall rainfall statistics extreme rainfall hispaniola hydrology tropical cyclone hurricane flood 1 introduction the greater and lesser antilles region experienced 264 tropical cyclones between 1960 and 2013 accounting for 95 of the total damage from all natural disasters in the region burgess et al 2018 these tropical cyclones generate heavy rainfall events khouakhi et al 2017 that cause large floods whose intensities and frequency will tend to increase due to climate change peterson et al 2002 given the vulnerability of greater and lesser antilles territories to hydro meteorological hazards rainfall databases are needed on a daily or sub daily timescale to calculate relevant indices e g the annual number of wet days above a certain threshold 100 year rainfall maxima to statistically characterize heavy rainfall events and to discuss their frequency and potential trends over time although rain gauges provide accurate local measurements of rainfall amount they are not numerous enough in this region to reflect the high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall kidd et al 2017 villarini et al 2008 this data scarcity is even more critical when studying heavy rainfall events which requires information on a fine spatiotemporal scale in this context remote sensing offers an opportunity to better study the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation griffith et al 1978 rainfall data obtained from remote sensing have the advantage of a wide spatiotemporal area coverage and have shown high potential for use in many applications dinku et al 2007 li et al 2015 such as rainfall and flow forecasting mapping heavy rainfall statistics flood hazard mapping and many other hydrological applications mazzoleni et al 2019 wannasin et al 2021 currently there are more than 10 precipitation products obtained by remote sensing available in the world covering different periods and different spatiotemporal scales centella artola et al 2020 these remotely sensed precipitation products were created mainly from i satellite data infrared observations passive microwave observations soil moisture observations etc ii combinations of different data sources satellite rainfall estimates sre reanalysis rainfall products observation data etc or iii using atmospheric physics models coupled with reference data to create reanalysis products such as era 5 reanalysis several papers have evaluated the performance of such rainfall gridded datasets rgd at different spatiotemporal scales and in different climate regions baez villanueva et al 2018 prakash 2019 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 tan and santo 2018 xu et al 2017 results indicate that the performance of the rgd is highly dependent on topography geography and climate tang et al 2019 evaluated the performance of four rgd in six climate regions in the mekong basin of southeast asia the rainfall products were divided into seven classes with the purpose of evaluating the ability of rgd products to estimate light and heavy rainfall in different climatic zones the results showed that all four products performed differently in the six climate zones although the rgd tended to perform better in wet climates than in dry climates alijanian et al 2017 evaluated the performance of five rgd in eight climatic zones in iran through correlation coefficient root mean square error and relative error during the period 2003 2012 their results showed that the performance of rgd varies with climate zones with better performance in very hot and humid climates the same conclusions were drawn for heavy rainfall rainfall above the 90th percentile for two rgd in china by fang et al 2019 in addition to the influence of climate on the performance of rgd fang et al 2019 showed that topography also has a significant influence on heavy rainfall estimation with correlation coefficients that decrease with altitude these few examples show the advantages and limitations of the rgd in the regions studied and the need to evaluate their performance for the lesser and greater antilles because the climate dynamics of these islands have a range of concurrent interactions between mid latitudes and tropical features at all spatial scales martinez et al 2019 in the caribbean region several studies have used rgd as baseline data to study spatial and temporal rainfall variability angeles et al 2010 jones et al 2016 jury 2016 flood mapping bozza et al 2016 and the dynamic mechanisms that determine the spatial and temporal patterns of the seasonal cycle martinez et al 2019 moron et al 2016 but very few studies compared such databases with rainfall observations in the caribbean region which including the greater and lesser antilles however very few studies have evaluated their performance specifically in the greater and lesser antilles a first comparison between rainfall observations reanalysis satellite and coupled model datasets was performed by jury 2009 the first part of the study aimed to evaluate in a qualitative way the ability of rgd to capture several climatic features over the caribbean region and the second part of the study evaluated the ability of gridded rainfall to capture the annual rainfall cycle more recently a study evaluating the performance of 16 rgd on a monthly timescale was done by centella artola et al 2020 in the caribbean the results show that mswep is one of the best performing rgd and era 5 performed best among the reanalysis products both the evaluations by jury 2009 and centella artola et al 2020 were done on a monthly timescale nevertheless using long typically several decades temporal series at the daily or sub daily timestep is required for hydrological studies dedicated to heavy rainfall and flood statistics the performance of these rainfall gridded datasets products varies from one timescale to another and they tend to perform better on a monthly than a daily timescale sultana and nasrollahi 2018 tan et al 2015 in this context this work aims to evaluate the general performance of five rainfall gridded datasets rgd available at the daily time step over the period 1980 2019 mswep chirps era 5 persiann cdr and gpm imerg these four rgd are chosen according to i their performance in the greater and lesser antilles on a monthly timescale centella artola et al 2020 and ii their availability on a daily timescale over several decades to our knowledge this is the first study on the evaluation of rgd in the greater and lesser antilles on a daily timescale aiming to highlight the qualities and shortcomings of rgd over these poorly instrumented islands this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the study area sections 3 and 4 present the data and methods used sections 5 and 6 present the results and discussion and section 7 presents conclusion to the paper 2 study area the study area shown in fig 1 is the region between north america and south america and includes the islands that are surrounded by the gulf of mexico in the north west the caribbean sea in the south and the atlantic ocean in the east these islands are often represented in two major groups the greater antilles grouping cuba hispaniola jamaica and puerto rico and the lesser antilles which is an island group located to the east and southeast of the caribbean sea and composed of the islands of the southern part of the caribbean arc from puerto rico to south america the greater antilles has a bimodal annual rainfall cycle with a first rainy season in may and a second rainy season between september and november this bimodal annual rainfall cycle is influenced by the nash north atlantic subtropical high davis et al 1997 and the cllj caribbean low level jet cook and vizy 2010 the lesser antilles has a unimodal annual rainfall cycle strongly influenced by the itcz intertropical convergence zone hastenrath 2002 with peak rainfall in november the heavy rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles observed between september and november is strongly influenced by tropical cyclones of the north atlantic 85 of intense tropical cyclones originate in east african waves agudelo et al 2011 thorncroft and hodges 2001 coupled with the atlantic warm pool area with sea temperatures greater than 28 5 c wang and enfield 2003 and the intertropical convergence zone rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles depends on dominant easterlies topography and land sea interactions the spatial pattern of rainfall in these islands is very inhomogeneous due to their complex topography cantet 2017 moron et al 2015 rainfall is relatively important 2 000 4 000 mm year in the higher elevations and windward parts smith et al 2012 in contrast annual rainfall can be as low as 500 mm year in the leeward areas daly et al 2003 3 rainfall data used the rainfall data used in this study are classified into two categories the rain gauge data that will be used as reference and the rgd rainfall gridded datasets a short description of both types of rainfall dataset is provided below 3 1 rain gauge data 3 1 1 presentation of the reference rain gauges the set of 146 rainfall series that we will use in this study comes from several institutions météo france the hydrometeorological unit of haiti uhm the caribbean institute for meteorology and hydrology cimh the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the meteorological service of jamaica metservice the meteorological institute of the republic of cuba insmet and the national meteorological office of the dominican republic onamet fig 2 presents the gaps in the data availability for each dataset 3 1 2 quality control of the reference rain gauges rain gauge data are used as reference data to evaluate the performance of rgd in the greater and lesser antilles these reference data can have considerable measurement errors sevruk et al 2009 viney and bates 2004 therefore quality control is an essential step before evaluating the rgd to identify and discard periods or rain gauges with significant measurement errors we used a procedure with the following steps this method is inspired by that of beck et al 2019 a remove the rainy days with more than 1000 mm d b remove months with more than 20 days of missing data c remove years with more than 200 days of missing data d remove stations with less than 5 years of data e test the uniformity of the data series from the annual sum of the stations by the method of cumulative residuals as described by bois 1987 this method consists of plotting the cumulative residuals of the linear regression between a reference station and a station to be tested the 90 confidence intervals for the cumulative residuals of each year are plotted to form a confidence ellipse inside which the curve of the cumulative residuals should remain the reference station is a synthetic station formed by the median of the annual accumulations of all stations in the same country 19 of 146 rain gauges were removed after quality control testing on reference data among the 127 rain gauges remaining 27 are in guadeloupe 25 in martinique 21 in dominican republic 5 in haiti 4 in cuba 10 in jamaica 22 in puerto rico and 13 in small islands where cimh provided rain gauge data 3 1 3 independence of the rain gauges from the stations used for rgd development of the five rgd used in our analysis three rgd mswep chirps and persiann cdr have been used rainfall products derived from rain gauges such as gpcc schneider et al 2014 gsod https www ncei noaa gov access metadata landing page bin iso id gov noaa ncdc c00516 ghcn menne et al 2012 and gpcp adler et al 2003 and two rgd chirps and mswep have been used rain gauges directly the rain gauges used by chirps are form mexico central america south america and sub saharan africa funk et al 2015 and not from the greater and the lesser antilles however beck et al 2019 have been used daily rainfall series form the greater and the lesser antilles to calibrate mswep rainfall dataset we excluded the 24 rain gauges figure a 2 in appendix identified as positioned within a 1 km radius from rain gauges mentioned as used within the mswep v2 8 dataset to ensure the independence of the rain gauges from the stations used for rgd development among the 103 rain gauges remaining 27 are in guadeloupe 22 in martinique 19 in dominican republic 5 in haiti 2 in cuba 10 in jamaica 6 in puerto rico and 12 in small islands where cimh provided rain gauge data 3 2 rgd rainfall gridded datasets 3 2 1 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr persiann cdr is a multi satellite product that provides daily precipitation estimates with a spatial resolution of 0 25 from 1983 onwards ashouri et al 2015 the persiann artificial neural model is pre trained with ncep national centers for environmental prediction stage iv hourly precipitation radar data then persiann cdr is generated by the persiann algorithm using gridsat b1 infrared data knapp 2008 the final product is adjusted with the monthly gpcp global precipitation climatology project product to ensure that both datasets are consistent on a monthly scale 3 2 2 climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps chirps precipitation estimates version 2 are available from 1981 onwards with a spatial and temporal resolution of 0 05 24 h funk et al 2015 this database uses monthly precipitation climatology chpclim climate hazards group precipitation climatology quasi global geostationary thermal infrared satellite observations tropical rainfall measuring mission s trmm 3b42 product atmospheric model rainfall fields from noaa cfs climate forecast system and precipitation observations from different sources including national or regional meteorological services the chirps production requires two steps first pentad five day rainfall estimates are created from ccd cold cloud duration which are obtained from regression models and calibrated by using trmm 3b42 pentad precipitation these estimates are expressed as a percentage of normal precipitation by dividing the estimated values for regression models by their long term averages this outcome is names chirp then in situ observation from stations are blended with chirp data in order to produce chirps 3 2 3 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep the second version of mswep as described by beck et al 2017 is a global gridded dataset for the period 1979 2017 with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 1 3 h this dataset is derived by merging rainfall estimates based on rain gauges coming from different databases worldclim fick and hijmans 2017 ghcn d menne et al 2012 gsod https data noaa gov and national databases from different country different sre cmorph joyce et al 2004 gridsat knapp et al 2011 gsmap ushio et al 2009 and tmpa 3b42rt huffman et al 2007 and reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 and jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 to build mswep beck et al 2019 was evaluated the performance of the gridded datasets using the correlation coefficient of the gridded data with the 3 day mean rainfall data next the data were merged via weighted averaging using the interpolated weight maps deduced from the correlation coefficients the biases of the merged data are corrected by a multiplicative approach used by vila et al 2009 to preserve the sub daily rainfall distribution 3 2 4 era 5 we use the fifth generation of the atmospheric global climate reanalysis era 5 available from 1980 onwards with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 25 1 h hersbach et al 2020 era 5 is produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf this new reanalysis replaces the era interim reanalysis that started in 2006 era 5 benefits from decades of developments in the dynamics of data assimilation models and combines them with observations of wind pressure temperature precipitation and humidity from several satellites and from observations near the earth s surface and over the oceans from upper air soundings and from atmospheric measurements from aircraft instruments this is based on the hybrid 4d var data assimilation method using the cy41r2 cycle of the integrated forecast system ifs cy41r2 hersbach and de rosnay 2018 3 2 5 nasa global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg the gpm imerg was launched in february 2014 as the successor to trmm to provide the next generation of global precipitation products it consists of one core observatory and approximately 10 constellation satellites the core observatory carries a ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar and a multi channel gpm imerg microwave imager extending the measurement range of trmm instruments gpm imerg provides three levels of precipitation related products the level 3 products are produced with the imerg algorithm which intercalibrates and merges precipitation estimates from all constellation microwave sensors microwave calibrated infrared satellite estimates and monthly gauge precipitation data hou et al 2014 the gpm imerg products available from 2000 onwards offer a relatively fine spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and high temporal resolution of 30 min the gpm imerg day 1 final run v6 data is used in this study the final run product introduces gpcc rainfall dataset schneider et al 2014 for bias correction generally considered to be more accurate results than the near real time products early and late run and is thus widely used in hydrology and climate researches huffman et al 2015 table a 1 in appendix briefly lists the main characteristics of the selected gridded rainfall data persiann cdr chirps mswep era 5 and gpm imerg 4 methodology in this section we describe the methodology designed to evaluate the performance of rgd in the greater and lesser antilles four of the used rgd are available from 1980 persiann cdr chirps mswep and era 5 and gpm imerg is available from 2000 gpm imerg is a rgd widely used in hydrological applications li et al 2021 pradhan et al 2021 wang et al 2022 and has thus being used in this study despite its shorter temporal extension thus we evaluated the performance of four rgd mswep era 5 chirps and persiann cdr over the 1980 2019 period and all five rgd over the 2000 2019 period first the method used to compare rgd grid points and rain gauges temporal series is presented subsection 4 1 then the different performance measures calculated are listed subsection 4 2 4 1 comparison between rgd grid points and rain gauges temporal series 4 1 1 point to pixel analysis a point to pixel analysis was applied to compare the time series of the reference rain gauge stations i e the points with the corresponding grid cell values i e the pixels this approach has been chosen over the pixel to pixel methodology saemian et al 2021 given the sparse rain gauges density over the studied region thus the application of a pixel to pixel methodology requires to have a gridded reference dataset or to spatially interpolate reference rain gauges data in the lesser antilles particularly in the martinique and guadeloupe french islands cf figure a 3 in appendix more than one rain gauge is counted on the same rgd pixel for each rgd pixel containing more than one rain gauges an area weighted average of the considered rain gauge series has been performed using the thiessen polygons e g liu et al 2015 tang et al 2020 4 1 2 rgd upscaling the four rgd considered have different spatial resolutions the point to pixel analysis has been performed i to the original rgd resolution and also ii at a similar resolution of 0 25 which is the resolution of the era 5 and persiann cdr coarser rgd considered thus an upscaling of the chirps and mswep datasets has been performed to a new spatial resolution of 0 25 by using bilinear interpolation baez villanueva et al 2018 4 1 3 use of two different rain gauges sets the mswep rgd has been produced considering different ground datasets including several rain gauges see subsection 3 1 3 thus this bias corrected dataset is expected to better perform than the rgd that do not use rain gauge stations e g baez villanueva et al 2018 to ensure the independence of the rain gauge stations used as reference in our study and those used during the rgd construction we calculated the performances of the rgd on two different rain gauges sets first 103 rain gauges are considered excluding the 24 rain gauges identified as positioned within a 1 km radius from rain gauges mentioned as used within the mswep v2 8 datasets then all the 127 rain gauges are considered the excluded rain gauges are identified in the figure a 2 in appendix 4 2 evaluation of the rgd performances the rgd were evaluated along four characteristics a general performance b reproduction of wet and dry days c reproduction of rainfall seasonality d estimation of heavy rainfall 4 2 1 general performances of the rgd 4 2 1 1 performances at the daily time steps the general performance of the rgd are evaluated at the daily time step by five statistical metrics a the root mean square error rmse mm d b the correlation coefficient r c the α coefficient α ratio of the standard deviation of the rgd to the standard deviation of the observations d the β coefficient β ratio of the mean of the rgd to the observations e the kling and gupta efficiency score kge gupta et al 2009 the kge score is widely used in hydrology in order to compare observations with model simulations e g arciniega esparza et al 2022 mathevet et al 2020 and is also used the context of rgd comparison with rain gauges series e g baez villanueva et al 2018 centella artola et al 2020 saemian et al 2021 the kge is a combination of the r β and α coefficients and thus evaluates the general performance of the rgd in reproducing rainfall in the greater and the lesser antilles the optimal values of the α β coefficients and of the kge criteria are 1 the correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the linear relationship between the rgd and the rain gauges the results vary between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect negative correlation while 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation the α coefficient evaluates the dispersion of the rgd compared to the observed data the β coefficient evaluates the bias of the rgd by measuring the average tendency of the rgd values to overestimate β 1 or underestimate β 1 the root mean square error is used as a measure of the average absolute error an optimal value for rmse is 0 mm d 4 2 1 2 performances at the monthly and annual time steps general performances of the rgd are also evaluated at the monthly and annual timesteps by estimating r α and kge on monthly and annual time series kuentz et al 2015 note that β has the same value on these different timescales 4 2 2 rainfall detection three categorical statistics criteria are used to evaluate the capacity for rgd to detect wet and dry days there are four possible cases mashingia et al 2014 i the rgd detects rainfall that is really observed ii the rgd detects rainfall that is not observed iii the rgd does not detect rainfall that is observed and iv the rgd and rain gauge do not detect any rainfall based on these cases the following categorical statistics are evaluated a the probability of detecting rainfall pod b the false alarm rate far c the critical success index csi the probability of detection measures the capacity of the rgd to correctly detect the rainfall observed the results are between 0 and 1 optimal value the false alarm rate measures the proportion of days in which the rgd measures rainfall that was not observed by the rain gauges results are between 0 optimal value and 1 the critical success index illustrates the fraction of observed rain that was correctly detected by the rgd the optimal value of the critical success index is 1 alijanian et al 2017 table a 2 in appendix lists the statistical metrics used to evaluate the rgd over the lesser and the greater antilles 4 2 3 rainfall seasonality annual rainfall cycles are calculated with the 15 day aggregated rainfall data for the 103 reference rain gauges and on the rgd pixels corresponding to these reference data below the 15 day aggregation the annual rainfall patterns are noisy and of little interest the finest timescale relevant to present the annual rainfall pattern is the 15 day aggregation the result is averaged over the greater and the lesser antilles to highlight the annual rainfall pattern and to assess the ability of the rgd to reproduce the rainfall seasonality in the area study 4 2 4 heavy rainfall statistics the ratios of the 90th and 99th rainfall percentiles and the maximum annual rainfall of each reference rain gauge to the corresponding rgd are calculated to estimate the ability of the rgd to assess heavy rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles a ratio greater than 1 indicates an overestimation of rgd and a ratio below 1 indicates an underestimation of rgd lastly the summary statistics such as average maximum and standard deviation were calculated for selected rainfall percentiles of the rainfall datasets 5 results 5 1 evaluation of the rgd performances over 1980 2019 5 1 1 rgd general performance on a daily timescale fig 3 summarizes the performance of the rgd in estimating daily rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles through the kge criterion and its components correlation coefficient dispersion and bias and the mean square error using the 103 considered rain gauges overall the performance over the greater and lesser antilles are not significantly different mswep is the most correlated with the reference data with a correlation coefficient of 0 5 in the greater antilles and slightly less in the lesser antilles mswep has a good dispersion and a low bias with α and β coefficients close to 1 these relatively good values of r α and β coefficients combine to produce a relatively good kge for mswep with values between 0 45 and 0 5 in the greater and lesser antilles era 5 is the second most correlated rgd with the reference data with correlation coefficients between 0 35 and 0 4 but that the dispersion around the mean value of era 5 is low α near to 0 5 and a priori the estimates of era 5 are relatively uniform and are unable to capture heavy rainfall well as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 era 5 underestimates the reference data with biases β between 0 65 and 0 75 this weakness in the dispersion around the mean value and underestimation of the reference rainfall makes era 5 the worst performing rgd with kge between 0 1 and 0 15 persiann cdr has a better kge score than chirps in the lesser antilles mainly due to a better correlation of persiann cdr compared to chirps however in the greater antilles the r α and β coefficients and thus the kge scores of persiann cdr and chirps are similar overall the performance of chirps in the lesser and greater antilles is impaired by its low correlation coefficient with the reference data but the lack of performance of era 5 is influenced by their low dispersion around the mean value α near to 0 5 the rmse coefficient is relatively low for era 5 and persiann cdr and is about 11 mm d in contrast the rmse coefficient is very high for chirps and is about 17 mm d fig 4 shows a spatial representation of the performance results of the four rgd via the kge statistical metric in general the kge score tends to be relatively high in the eastern greater antilles dominican republic and puerto rico in particular in puerto rico and in the north of the lesser antilles including guadeloupe and the kge score is relatively low in the west of the greater antilles notably in haiti and jamaica and in the north of the lesser antilles including martinique mswep shows the same spatial pattern in the greater antilles but the kge scores are almost uniform in the lesser antilles and have no particular spatial pattern 5 1 2 rgd rainfall detection capacity evaluation indices the ability of the rgd to identify wet and dry days is presented in fig 5 era 5 then mswep have a good capacity to reproduce the rainy days observed on the ground for the lesser and greater antilles pod 0 9 for era 5 and pod 0 75 for mswep that is on all the wet days recorded by the rain gauge 90 were detected by era 5 and 75 by mswep the false alarm rate is on average 0 5 in the greater antilles and 0 25 in the lesser antilles out of all the wet days detected by an rgd 50 were not observed in the rain gauges of the greater antilles and 25 in the lesser antilles the fraction of rainfall observed and correctly detected by the rgd represented by the csi coefficient was 0 5 for mswep and era 5 in the greater antilles and 0 65 0 7 for mswep and era 5 in the lesser antilles and in the range of 0 25 0 30 for chirps and persiann in summary era 5 is the best performing rgd to identify wet and dry days before mswep with a very high pod and a similar csi although far of era 5 is higher than mswep in contrast chirps is the least efficient rgd to identify wet and dry days with low pod and csi these results are very important as these rgd may be used to calculate extreme climate indices such as the annual number of wet days above a certain threshold annual number of wet days or the maximum number of consecutive dry days and therefore the results obtained should be adjusted accordingly 5 1 3 rgd general performance on daily monthly and annual timescales in this section we present in addition to the daily timescale evaluated in sections 5 1 1 and 5 1 2 the ability of the rgd to estimate rainfall on monthly and annual timescales using the kge criterion and their r α and β components the biases β is not shown in fig 6 because it is constant on daily monthly and annual timescales the dispersion α changes slightly on daily monthly and annual scales with era 5 showing low dispersion around the mean value relatively uniform rainfall at all three timescales only the correlation coefficient affects the performance of the rgd at the three temporal scales studied all rgd correlate very well with the reference rainfall data on a monthly scale with correlation coefficient values that reach on average 0 75 for mswep in the greater antilles and for all rgd in the lesser antilles the correlation coefficients on an annual scale are slightly worse than those on a monthly scale but significantly better than the daily scale correlation coefficients r 0 7 at the monthly time scale and r 0 5 at the daily time scale see fig 6 although the correlation coefficients of all rgd are better on monthly and annual scales the kge scores of era 5 in the greater antilles and era 5 and persiann cdr in the lesser antilles are significantly reduced because of their biases and their low α coefficient at daily monthly and annual scales 5 1 4 the annual rainfall cycle the reference rainfall series as well as the corresponding rgd pixels were aggregated over a 15 day period and the annual average rainfall cycle was calculated for each aggregated data series then the annual rainfall cycles were averaged for the greater and lesser antilles see fig 7 the results show that the average annual rainfall cycle in the greater antilles is divided into 4 seasons with two rainfall peaks during the year winter dry season wds from late november to mid march with an average rainfall of 3 mm d early rainy season ers from mid march to mid may with a peak rainfall of about 7 mm d mid summer drought msd from mid may to early august which is a less rainy season interspersed between the two heavy rainy seasons with a rainfall of a little over 4 mm d and late rainy season lrs from early august to late november with an average rainfall of 7 mm d these four seasons are also observed in the lesser antilles however with the msd season being wetter than the ers season as a result the lesser antilles has an increasing rainfall from wds to reach a peak of about 8 mm d in late october to early november all the rgd have well captured the general pattern of the mean annual cycle well with a bimodal precipitation cycle a peak of rainfall in mid may and a late rainy period from august to november in the greater antilles and of the unimodal cycle in the lesser antilles in the greater antilles the rainfall amounts of the mswep chirps and persiann cdr from mid may to early november are in very good agreement with the reference data but these rgd underestimate the rainfall from november to early may all rgd strongly underestimate rainfall in the lesser antilles except chiprs which reproduces the annual rainfall cycle very well era 5 and persiann cdr capture the amplitude of the rainfall in the lesser antilles very poorly 5 1 5 heavy rainfall performance indices in this section we will present the ability of the studied rgd to estimate heavy rainfall accurately by studying their 90th and 99th percentile rainfall and their maximum annual rainfall fig 8 gives a spatial representation of the ratios r of 90th percentiles of the rgd estimates to the reference data and thus shows the areas where the 90th percentile rainfall is overestimated or underestimated by the rgd areas of underestimation r 1 of the reference data are represented by dots and areas of overestimation r 1 are represented by triangles overall the rgd tend to slightly underestimate the 90th percentile rainfall in the study area and especially in the lesser antilles and the eastern part of the greater antilles but all the rgd systematically overestimate the reference data in the north of haiti and south east of cuba and sometimes in jamaica although rgd tend to underestimate the 90th percentile rainfall mswep and chirps have a good ability to estimate the 90th percentile rainfall r close to 1 in the eastern part of the greater antilles and in the northern part of the lesser antilles this spatial variability of heavy rainfall is fairly well measured by chirps with however an overestimation of the 90th percentile rainfall in the lesser antilles and a little less well by mswep with an underestimation of the heavy rainfall percentiles era 5 and to a lesser extent persiann cdr strongly underestimate heavy rainfall percentiles and are unable to represent them spatially over the greater and lesser antilles the results of the rgd performance in estimating heavy rainfall are summarized in fig 9 the gray horizontal line delineates the area where the rgd overestimate the reference percentiles area above the line from the area where the rgd underestimate the reference percentiles area below the line rgd are generally better at estimating heavy rainfall in the greater antilles than in the lesser antilles chirps and mswep perform well in estimating heavy rainfall percentiles in the greater antilles and somewhat less well in the lesser antilles in general all rgd tend to underestimate the 90th and 99th rainfall percentiles and the maximum annual rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles except chirps which overestimates these heavy rainfall percentiles in the lesser antilles era 5 underestimates by half the percentiles of heavy rainfall in the greater and lesser antilles and is the least efficient of the four rgd the 5 25 50 75 and 95 rainfall percentiles are calculated for the 103 considered rain gauges and corresponding rgd pixels in the greater and lesser antilles the mean maximum and standard deviation values of each rainfall database used are presented in table a 3 in appendix the results show that on average more than 75 of the days during our study period had rainfall less than 5 mm d and these low rainfall events are well captured by era 5 and persiann cdr in contrast chirps mswep and persiann cdr tend to capture the heavy rainfall percentiles with chirps overestimating heavy rainfall percentiles and mswep and persiann cdr underestimating them although persiann cdr gives good estimates of heavy rainfall percentile values it strongly underestimates the maximum values 5 1 6 performance of original and upscaled rgd the statistical metrics described in the methodology section are computed for the rgd with their original spatial resolution see subsections 4 1 2 and 4 2 1 and additionally computed for a shared spatial resolution upscaled to 0 25 we present in fig 10 the results for two quantitative metrics the rmse and the kge and the three qualitative metrics pod far and csi for the original and upscaled mswep and chirps rgd the original era 5 and persiann rgd are already at 0 25 so they are not upscaled a decrease of the rmse values is observed for the upscaled rgd which is much more pronounced for chirps especially in the lesser antilles in general we observe a decrease in the kge metric for the upscaled rgd except for chirps in the lesser antilles overall the upscaled rgd have a better ability to detect rainy days and dry days represented by a higher pod and csi despite the fact that the far increased for chirps in the greater antilles fig 11 shows the rainfall regime pattern of the original and upscaled rgd the patterns obtained at the 0 25 resolution are generally similar to these obtained at the original spatial resolution with an overall underestimation of rainfall for the upscaled rgd the rainfall is strongly underestimated particularly in the rainy season september to november in the lesser antilles although the rgd underestimate the rainfall they correctly capture the rainfall regime fig 11 for the two spatial resolutions these results show that the rainfall regime pattern is more sensitive to the spatial scale variation of the rgd in the lesser antilles than in the greater antilles 5 1 7 performance of three rain gauges sets the performance of the four rgd is evaluated using the sets of rain gauges described in section 4 1 3 the first subset subset 1 see fig 12 consists of 103 rain gauges excluding the 24 rain gauges used in mswep the second subset subset 2 consists of only the 24 rain gauges used in mswep and the third subset consists of all the rain gauges subset 1 2 the results are presented in fig 12 for the kge criterion which synthesizes the performance of three statistical metrics and is a good tool to evaluate the overall performance of the rgd the results of all 5 quantitative statistical metrics for subsets 1 were presented in fig 3 while the results for subsets 1 2 are presented in the appendix in figure a 1 clearly the performance of mswep is much better than the other three rgd for subset 2 fig 12 because these rain gauges are used to calibrate mswep the ranks of performance of the rgd with subset 1 and subset 1 2 are similar with a somewhat better performance of mswep with subset 1 2 5 2 evaluation of the rgd performances over 2000 2019 fig 13 presents the performance of the five rgd over 2000 2019 using five statistical metrics the results shown in fig 13 do not show any significant difference in terms of mswep chirps persiann cdr and era 5 rgd performance over the two time periods studied gpm imerg has difficulty to quantify rainfall volume in our study area with the highest rmse in the greater antilles negative kge in both the greater antilles and lesser antilles and poorly represents heavy rainfall not shown although its performance is better than era 5 and persiann cdr however gpm imerg has a good ability to detect rainy and dry days with pod and csi scores better than chirps in the greater antilles and chirps and persiann cdr in the lesser antilles gpm imerg has difficulty representing the rainfall regime in the greater and lesser antilles as shown in fig 14 the may rainfall peaks are captured late around june and sometimes early july by gpm imerg november rainfall peaks in the lesser antilles are captured early late august to early october by gpm imerg in addition gpm imerg underestimates the rainfall pattern in the winter dry season wds and overestimates the rainfall regime from may to november 6 discussion 6 1 comparison of rgd performances the performance of the rgd over the studied region reflects the philosophy behind their design mswep was designed for operational research in hydrology to improve our understanding of hydrological processes and enhance hydrological model performance beck et al 2019 thus mswep has been produced by merging gridded rainfall data and daily rainfall data therefore mswep performs well in most of the statistical metrics considered chirps is designed for monitoring extremes which is why chirps gives good estimates of heavy rainfall percentiles over the studied region the performance of persiann cdr is poor over our study area this poor performance of persiann cdr might be due to the data used to construct precipitation datasets persiann cdr has used an algorithm based on artificial neural networks with trained by the stage iv radar data but this radar data itself is biased habib et al 2009 sharif et al 2020 in addition persiann cdr used mainly infrared ir data that provide a measure of cloud top brightness temperature which correlates with the probability of cloud precipitation brochart and andréassian 2014 but the performance of an ir based algorithm is less accurate for some types of cloud warm rain clouds and cold high cirrus non raining clouds ashouri et al 2015 reanalysis products are designed to study climate variability on a large spatio temporal scale and have wide application in atmospheric sciences this explains the good ability of era 5 to detect rainfall occurrences high pod but due to its too coarse spatial resolution era 5 underestimates the rainfall amplitude in our study area the poor performance of gpm imerg can be explained because it is a purely satellite based rgd and does not use reference rain gauges to calibrate its estimates pradhan et al 2022 have reviewed the performance of gpm imerg at the global scale and show that gpm imerg does not perform well to represent heavy and light rainfall especially at the daily and sub daily scales despite its limitations the fine spatio temporal resolution of gpm imerg and its improvement with each new version pradhan et al 2022 reveals a promising path for current and future applications 6 2 are rgd limitations over lesser and greater antilles site specific although mswep is the best performing rgd the general performances obtained over the greater and lesser antilles are lower than performances obtained by mswep over other regions in southeast asia tang et al 2019 iran alijanian et al 2017 and austria sharifi et al 2019 correlation coefficients obtained by comparing mswep and rain gauges at the daily timestep are generally greater than 0 75 while these correlation coefficients are less than 0 6 in the caribbean this can be explained by the fact that most satellite products have difficulty observing local convection systems in the caribbean islands jury 2009 the winter dry season wds fig 7 in the greater antilles is underestimated by all four rgd while the other three seasons are well reproduced these results corroborate the work of brochart and andréassian 2014 who showed that low rainfall tends to be underestimated by rgd in french guyana the four rgd overestimate the rainfall percentiles in the area between the western part of hispaniola and eastern cuba fig 8 this corroborates the result of jury 2009 showing that remotely sensed rainfall products fail to capture the low rainfall area between haiti cuba and jamaica due to the mountainous terrain rising to 2000 m in a northwest southeast axis extending for 200 km creating a significant wind and rain shadow towards jamaica and cuba the topography is very complex and influences the spatial pattern of rainfall however the rain gauges used in our study are mostly located in low lying areas and this is of little relevance to study the relationship between topography and rainfall the use of the digital terrain model dem in the greater and lesser antilles to study the spatial variability of rainfall and to evaluate the performance of the rgd in relation to the topography is an interesting perspective 6 3 limitation of the point to pixel comparison the point to pixel comparison allows to compare the point data of the rain gauges to the area data of the rgd the comparison of the performances of the original and upscaled rgd allows to evaluate the impact of the spatial resolution of the rgd on their performance and thus to evaluate the limit of the point to pixel approach there was no clear trend in the impact of the spatial resolution of the rgd on their performance for the two quantitative metrics used we observed a decrease in kge except for chirps in the lesser antilles and an improvement in rmse for the upscaled rgd the rmse strongly penalizes errors on heavy rainfall but the rgd upscaled tend to smooth heavy rainfall and therefore the rmse is less penalizing with the rgd upscaled this may explain the better rmse score for the upscaled rgd therefore caution should be used when evaluating the performance of rgd using rmse baez villanueva et al 2018 as the results may not reflect the real performance of rgd the ability of rgd to capture both rainy and dry days is improved for upscaled rgd this can be explained by the rgd being averaged over a larger area and therefore having a higher number of rainy days than the original rgd this could either increase the number of days of rainfall detected by the rgd and rain gauges and or decrease the number of days of rainfall detected by the rain gauges and not by the rgd and therefore increase the pod and or csi the underestimation of rainfall cycle pattern by the rgd particularly in the lesser antilles fig 11 can be explained by the spatial resolution of the rgd which is too coarse compared to the surface area of the lesser antilles islands e g 1128 km2 for martinique indeed the largest spatial resolution of the rgd is 0 25 more than 650 km2 which represents more than half the area of martinique the rgd rainfall is therefore averaged over too large an area and does not adequately capture the rainfall peaks and its spatial variability in this region 6 4 uncertainty of the reference rain gauge observations the spatial patterns of the kge score show that kge scores are systematically higher in some countries puerto rico and martinique than in others haiti and jamaica for example for all rgd the results may well show a good performance of the rgd in the east of the greater antilles and the north of the lesser antilles however this result should be taken with caution as we have assumed that the observed rainfall series is the reference without taking into account uncertainty of these reference series moreover the best kge scores are obtained for countries whose meteorological services have well documented and good quality reference data such as noaa and météo france thus there is a possibility that the spatial pattern of kge scores may reflect countries with good quality reference data in our study the effect of using a large number of reference rain gauges in the lesser antilles and a small number of reference rain gauges in the greater antilles was not evaluated particularly on the underestimation of the rainfall cycle in the lesser antilles nevertheless centella artola et al 2020 considered a larger number of rain gauges over the greater antilles and showed that rgd underestimate the rainfall cycle in the lesser antilles particularly during the rainy season september to november 7 conclusion in this study the performance of five rainfall gridded datasets rgd namely mswep chirps persiann cdr era 5 and gpm imerg were evaluated using 103 rain gauges in the lesser and greater antilles with the aim of highlighting the qualities and shortcomings of these rgd on a daily timescale and to guide researchers in the choice of rgd to use for hydrometeorological applications in this study area to our knowledge this is the first work done on rgd data on daily timescale in this region for hydrological applications in the greater and lesser antilles or on a watershed scale the use of mswep is recommended due to its high kge score and high spatio temporal resolution 0 1 and 3 h on the other hand chirps era 5 gpm imerg and persiann cdr are not recommended due to their low kge score and or coarse spatial resolution which are not appropriate for the greater and lesser antilles countries for climatological applications mainly to calculate climatic indexes such as number of rainy days exceeding a threshold number of consecutive rainy days etc era 5 gmp imerg and mswep are recommended due to their better pod and csi scores mswep chirps and persiann cdr are recommended in the greater and lesser antilles for research on water resources management for irrigation energy production industry etc due to their ability to represent the annual rainfall seasonality for applications on heavy rainfall statistics chirps and mswep are recommended for their good capacity to estimate the percentiles of heavy rainfall in summary mswep is recommended for most hydrometeorological applications in the study area because of its good performance for almost all statistical metrics and its good spatio temporal resolution this work provides a guide to users of rainfall data in the lesser and greater antilles on their choice of rgd to use in countries with very limited rainfall data such as haiti taking into account the benefits and drawbacks of each rgd the evaluation of these rgd performances might be extended on the studied region using other validation metrics based on different parameters such as satellite derived soil moisture products or rainfall runoff modeling gampe and ludwig 2017 musie et al 2019 no tests have evaluated the rgd performance in measuring light rainfall which would be useful for drought monitoring this work could be a good direction for future research finally the use of such rgd as inputs of rainfall runoff models for flood forecasting flood mapping or hydraulic structure design is an interesting application of this

7881,study region a 1 km² mountainous karst watershed on the larzac plateau in southern france study focus the village of la vacquerie located at the outlet of the watershed is punctually affected by flash floods during storm events on the contrary no runoff is observed in the village during other rainfalls a sinkhole draining surface flows at the entrance of the village plays a role on these differences descriptions of short and intense rainfalls in 2015 avg 40 mm h over 5 h and long and light events in 2014 2016 avg 8 mm h over 25 h provide valuable data to calibrate inputs of a distributed physic based flow model in particular the sinkhole drainage capacity this study aims to quantify drainage capacity changes with rainfall characteristics and to find the rain intensity threshold at which runoff exceeds sinkhole capacity new hydrological insights for the region the hydrological water balance of the hydrosystem is affected by the intensity variations for each of the different rain events it shows the limited part of drainage in sinkhole 10 during long light rains but its significant increase 40 during short and intense rains drainage in sinkhole is affected by intensity variations rather than by the total amount of precipitation when intensity exceeds 110 mm h the sinkhole is submerged however this result is obtained in a case of plateau configuration where the saturated level located deep below the surface here 500 m does not retro affect drainage in the sinkhole graphical abstract ga1 keywords karst interface flood hydrology modeling mediterranean data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological investigations aim at quantifying the repartition of rain water among surface flow through runoff and the different underground reservoirs through infiltration of a watershed the determination of these exchanges between surface and subsurface become even more crucial when considering extreme events floods or droughts in karstic environments the underground domain is highly contrasted between low permeability limestone rocks and the network of conductive fractures or conduits enlarged by dissolution through groundwater flows this specificity in karst environments is source of additional challenges for hydrological and hydrogeological sciences white 2002 ford and williams 2007 therefore hydrological case studies on karst are often site specific as the existing contrasts in such medium and thus its complex hydrological responses are closely related to a karstogenesis that is related to the geological and climatologic history of a region these contrasts can also be found at the surface in the epikarst where surface subsurface exchanges are slow and diffuse in soils while they can be fast in the fracture networks and almost instantaneous but localized in sinkholes or losses klimchouk 1995 the hydrological processes controlling the infiltration rates and the generation of runoff have been studied on a mountainous karst area in spain in li et al 2011 they performed rainfall simulations on in situ micro plots among a karst landscape and show the role of vegetation and rock fragments on infiltrations they quantified the averaged runoff coefficient over one year at the hillslope scale and found runoff to be globally limited 1 44 a similar study was performed in a sub tropical soil epikarst system in china in wang et al 2020 they quantified surface soil seepage and epikarst seepage runoffs in 20 m long in situ hillslope plots in a 5 m width and 4 m deep trench and for artificial rainfall events at different intensities they observed that soil seepage runoff always generated first during rain events and that surface runoff was the resultant of both a rain intensity exceeding of the soil epikarst interface infiltration rate and a sufficient cumulated rain to saturate the soil layer the previously presented studies in karst system do not take impact of developed karst sinkholes or losses in the epikarst such structures are punctual and represent a very limited surface among karst landscapes nevertheless they can still play an important role on the global hydrological balance in a karst watershed especially in relation with runoffs during intense rain events gutiérrez et al 2014 according to zhou 2007 sinkholes play a significant role in flood risks on karst terranes in particular a recharge related flooding is defined to describe floods occurring in karst landscapes when the sinkholes drainage capacities become lower than the storm water runoffs the determination of this drainage capacity is however complex because it mainly depends on the sinkhole size morphology and the configuration of the underlying karst network thus zhou 2007 advises to collect detailed information about the sinkholes in karst floods studies hydraulic models for quantifying drainage in sinkholes have been proposed in field 2010 on the basis of torricelli s theorem however these models require a good knowledge on sinkholes dimensions and shapes the role of sinkholes in local flash flood case studies has been taken into account in conceptual models in maréchal et al 2008 and fleury et al 2013 they analyzed the spatial responses of a karst hydrosytem in southern france to a storm event on the basis of runoff measurements at the surface water table measured in sinkholes and the karst spring discharge in particular they show how sinkholes near to the spring can play a role of drainage at the beginning of the event and swap to a role of back flooding when the karst network becomes totally saturated and generates backflows in bailly comte et al 2009 similar data have been collected for another storm event in southern france in addition to water temperature measurements in karst sinkhole these additional temperature data allowed better identifying when sinkholes were playing a role of drainage or when they were supplying surface runoffs if these conceptual models help understanding the global behaviors of sinkholes in terms of exchanges during rainfall event on karst terranes they do not allow to quantify these exchanges and the drainage capacities of the sinkholes thus bailly comte et al 2012 later performed a semi distributed modeling analysis with hec hms on the same hydrosystem in southern france and could estimate the sinkholes global drainage capacities to be 7 m3 s palanisamy and workman 2015 also proposed an adaptation of the semi distributed physical based hydrological model swat in order to take the role of individual sinkholes into account they have tested their model on a karst watershed in kentucky and have shown that the integration of the location and mean diameter of each sinkhole significantly improved the models prediction abilities a distributed physical based modeling of surface runoffs and infiltration among a karst watershed has been tested in liu et al 2005 on a 273 km² catchment in vietnam however at this important scale they could not specifically quantify the role of the different sinkholes along the river recently a distributed combined discrete continuum model has been proposed in al aamery et al 2021 that take into account vertical exchanges between surface flows and groundwater flows in a karst medium in particular it also allows integrating punctual drainage in sinkholes this model has been tested on a 58 km² karst basin in kentucky the requirement of an advanced knowledge on the karst underground structures for the application of such model is highlighted this work presents a 2d spatially distributed modeling application to simulate the hydrological responses of a small karst watershed 1 km² located in southern france to four different rainfall events these four events generate 150 to 250 mm of cumulated rain over periods ranging from 5 h to 25 h a village is located at the outlet of the watershed during short but intense events important flash floods affect the village on the contrary during longer but lighter events runoff is almost absent in the village a karst sinkhole located at the entrance of the village plays a key role on this response contrast due to its small size and its configuration this watershed can be easily conceptualized and spatial modeling can contribute to the understanding of its hydrological behavior the different karst sinkholes and losses among the watershed have been individually identified and characterized so that performing a quantification of drainage capacity becomes possible furthermore a storm event in august 2015 has been particularly described and provides valuable data to calibrate the model thus this study site represents a particularly interesting case in order to more generally investigate the effect of water runoffs drainage in karst network through surface sinkholes on global runoff at the outlet of the hydrosystem 2 presentation of the study site 2 1 hydrogeological context the study case presented in this work is based on a small 1 km² watershed located at the periphery of the larzac plateau between the cevennes mountain and the mediterranean sea in the south of france fig 1a at the outlet of this watershed is located the village of la vacquerie et saint martin de castries hereafter reduced to la vacquerie fig 2 the watershed is localized at quite high altitudes between 630 and 800 m asl it is typical for mountainous watersheds characterized by important slopes the underground of the watershed is composed of fractured bajocian dolomites and oxfordian limestones these carbonated formations are karstified three important karst structures north sinkhole south sinkhole and vacquerie loss can be found at the surface in particular the south sinkhole forms a large depression at the surface extending among a diameter of 8 m and a depth of 6 m a speleological investigation has shown that it vertically extends to at least a depth of 109 m where a constriction prevents deeper progress see fig s2 tracer tests have shown that the south sinkhole is connected to the clamouse karst system located in the hérault river canyon near saint guilhem le désert fig 1b the clamouse spring is a non perennial spring at the outlet a multi layered sub horizontal unsaturated karst system visited along 500 m camus 1997 and malcles et al 2020 have described the karstogenesis of the karst network around the larzac plateau due to the digging of canyons by rivers over time unsaturated karst levels have progressively formed in multi layered systems fig 1c as the current saturated level in at the altitude of the hérault river 100 m asl nowadays the studied watershed lies over a 500 m deep layered unsaturated karst conduits network the watershed is mostly covered by scrublands on the fractured calcareous rocks outcrops with only a few centimeters of soils in some areas the soils become thicker and allow the development of denser vegetation conifers hardwoods grass however globally the soil thickness barely exceeds one meter over the calcareous rocks among the area these soils partially cover the well developed karst system the average vertical permeability of the karst is assumed to be higher than that of the soils and therefore sufficient to evacuate the infiltrated water to deep levels 2 2 catastrophic flood events this mediterranean area is subject to extreme storm event due to the cevennes reliefs that block and concentrate the humid air coming from the sea one particularity of the village of la vacquerie is that its main street corresponds to the outlet of the watershed fig 2 thus in this context of mediterranean intense storm event the village is often subject to fast and torrential floods nevertheless through time villagers have tried to take advantages of the environment of the watershed to counterbalance this hydrological risk in particular they have understood the role of drainage played by the karst sinkholes and losses during the flood events and have built barriers and walls to lead water to them an historical study of these adaptions is described in leblanc 2018 and summarized in fig s1 of the supplementary files a geomorphological description of the different sinkholes among the watershed and the anthropic structures built around them is proposed in fig s2 of the supplementary files currently when runoff appears during a storm event water flows preferentially along natural and anthropized streambeds which are usually dry until it reaches a dike located at the entrance of the village and built in front of the south sinkhole in order to both protect the village and favor drainage in the sinkhole the two other sinkholes of the watershed have been used as flood protection by villagers in the past but are now almost entirely clogged despite these natural and anthropic protections flooding of the village still occurs during some particularly intense storm events in particular in 2015 two extreme events in august and september have both resulted in catastrophic fast and torrential floods in the main street of the village according to the meteorological data presented in bois et al 1997 these two events have a return period of more than 100 years fig 3 presents the hyetographs of these two storm events in comparison to two other rainfall events from november 2014 and october 2016 generating similar magnitudes of cumulated rainfalls over the watershed but no flood and associated to return periods of 10 years according to bois et al 1997 it is obvious that rainfall intensity and karst structures play a role in the formation of flood however this particular study case represents an interesting possibility to quantify this role trough numerical modeling in fact the small size of the watershed makes it easy to characterize furthermore the main street of the village is the outlet of the watershed this street has a constant width and houses are all built in one block along each border of the street thus the main street forms a rectangular channel that can be used to assess the flowrate at the outlet fast floods occur during very limited amount of time which make data measurement of such events very complicated nevertheless the chronology of the flood event of august 2015 in la vacquerie has been documented both during the flood and after see fig s3 in the complementary files for details on the basis of a video image processing with the freeware fudaa lspiv le coz et al 2010 2014 made on six videos taken during the flood it has been possible to estimate the velocities of the flows in the street during this event these velocity values associated to the water level visual estimations are used both to calibrate the roughness of the main street and to confront the spatial numerical model 3 numerical model 3 1 global presentation of the model the 2d top down view hydrological numerical model of the watershed is created in the modeling software hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras unsteady fluid flow is described by the navier stokes equations considering the shallow water assumptions incompressible flow uniform density negligible vertical velocity i e hydrostatic pressure can be assumed and turbulence is approximated the continuity equation then becomes 1 h t h v q where h is the water depth m v is the horizontal velocity vector m s t represents time s and q is the sink source term i e in this case rainfall infiltration and drainage the momentum equation becomes 2 v t v v f c v g z w s 1 h ν t h v τ b ρ r where f c is the coriolis parameter unit vector g is the gravitational acceleration m s² z w s is the water table elevation ν t is the eddy viscosity tensor τ b is the bottom shear stress vector calculated based on the manning coefficients ρ is the fluid density kg m3 and r is the hydraulic radius m the resolution of the 2d fluid flow equations in the model is performed base on an eulerian lagrangian method and a combination of finite difference and finite volume methods on a polygonal mesh a characteristic size of 10 m for the unit mesh elements has been chosen however the mesh is refined in the areas surrounding the streambed see fig 4b to a size of 2 m furthermore the streambed itself represents a mesh breakline where mesh is generated along the flow direction with a mesh size of 1 m finally a buffer area is considered on the larzac plateau downstream of the watershed which is meshed with a characteristic cell size of 20 m in total the mesh is composed of 22500 cells in each mesh cell a hydrological water budget is computed based on lateral and rainfall incomes and losses through infiltration and runoffs in order to update the local water depth underground flow processes in the karst conduits network are not considered explicitly in this model all infiltrated water is considered to be lost in the simulations however the model quantifies in each cell the water exiting the model through infiltration therefore we can pay particular attention to the volume and flow lost through absorption locally in the sinkholes and have an estimation of its consistency based on the sinkholes dimension the boundary conditions of the model are no flow conditions as the boundaries follow the limits of the watershed the large buffer area created downstream of the village in the model permits to limit the impact of the downstream boundary condition as water will then reach the larzac plateau where it will spread without impacting the upstream flows an unsteady flow time step of 0 5 s is chosen based on the mean mesh size and the maximal flow velocities this modeling of the watershed hydrodynamics assumes different important hypotheses linked to its characteristics i rainfall is uniform among the watershed ii the watershed is at a sufficient altitude and the groundwater saturated level is sufficiently low during the intense rainfall time periods august and september to consider that water level in the karst network does not impact drainage in the sinkholes iii thus when water enters a sinkhole it is drained based on a constant flow rate value in relation to its morphology iv soils become quickly saturated so that diffuse infiltrations are constant and depend on the soils saturated conductivities v evapotranspiration and wind effects are neglected during the rain events in the model we considered drainage only in the south sinkhole the other sinkholes being clogged they contribute to diffuse infiltration in the model but not for punctual drainage the drainage in the south sinkhole is considered to be limited by the narrowness found at 109 m depth thus during storms the sinkhole can be simplified to a funnel leading water to a filled vertical pipe draining at a constant rate conditioned by this narrowness diameter in the model considering the previous assumption an equivalent drained constant rate is set in order to remove water from the model as long as there is water in the depression formed by the sinkhole in the topography if water incomes exceed the draining rate the depression begins to fill up 3 2 input and output parameters the principal input of the model consists in the digital terrain model of the watershed with an altimetry accuracy of 1 cm and a spatial resolution of 1 m a tacheometry campaign has been led on field in order to add to this terrain model through gis tools the anthropic structures such as building and walls and the streambed and sinkhole surface dimensions with similar accuracies rainfall is then applied uniformly in the model for the intense events august and september 2015 the rainfalls were applied at a time step of 6 min while for the long events 2014 and 2016 the rainfalls were applied at a time step of 1 h other inputs of the model are associated to hydraulic properties of soils such as roughness saturated conductivities and impermeability percentage first the different biomes of the watershed have been spatially identified based on the french national institute of geographical and forestry information ign database fig 4a which has also been verified on field and using drone aerial views the saturated hydraulic conductivities were assessed for three types of soils observed among these biomes based on the beerkan infiltration method lassabatère et al 2006 roughness and impermeability percentage cannot be measured easily on field thus ranges of values a minimal a maximal and a plausible value between them were estimated for each biome based on tables and visual observations the input values used for these three properties are listed in table 1 simulation allows to assess water level and velocity spatially however in order to compare the simulation to real observations we have especially selected two observations points in the model see fig 4b one observation point is in the main street of the village were the water depth and the velocity in the street can be compared to the visual or video information of each event the other observation point concerns the water table elevation at the sinkhole and the dike in order to check potential overflowing of these structures 4 simulations results 4 1 calibration with the 23th august 2015 event the model has first been calibrated with the rainfall event of august 2015 before being validated on the other events in particular the constant drainage rate of the south sinkhole has been optimized in order to mimic the numerous observations of the catastrophic event thus 9 simulations on this event have been performed with drainage rates increasing from 0 to 40 m3 s overall simulation obtained with a sinkhole drainage of 20 m3 s appeared to provide the most coherent behaviors at observations points fig 5 in particular in the main street a peak water level of 49 cm with a peak velocity of 5 1 m s are simulated real observation of this event mentions a peak level of approximately 50 cm and videos interpretations reveal velocities reaching at least 4 m s however according to ocular observations during the event the level in the street has quickly risen at the peak and remained at a high level during one hour before starting decreasing at 1 20 pm in the simulation the water level indeed rises in 15 min before reaching the peak but then immediately decreases and remains at 10 cm until 1 20 pm thus the simulation doesn t show a one hour peak level plateau post event observations in the watershed mention that both sinkholes north and south and the loss were flooded and that a floodplain of 100 m length has formed between the dike and the debris barrier all these observations are also simulated with the model figs 5 and 6 furthermore in the simulation the dike was overflown under at most 31 cm of water which corresponds to the observed high water marks in order to check the consistency of the drainage of 20 m3 s in the sinkhole we have applied the torricelli s formula adaptation presented in field 2010 considering the sinkhole to have a conic shape and the hazen and williams 1920 formula of pipe flows considering the sinkhole to be similar to a continuous vertical pipe of 109 m in both cases in order to obtain such maximal rate we find that the diameter of the minimal section of the sinkhole structure should be between 75 and 100 cm these values appear as rather realistic in regards to the observed shrinkage that blocked the speleologists progression at 109 m depth the water levels and velocities simulated in the main street in the 9 scenarii with increasing sinkhole drainage and plotted in fig 7 it shows that the peak in the street is directly correlated to drainage of the south sinkhole in fact between 0 and 20 m3 s the higher the drainage the lower the peak level and velocity in the street over 20 m3 s the peak level and velocity remain approximately the same looking at the simulations in these cases and especially the water level in the sinkhole fig 7 one notes that this is related to the fact the sinkhole is no more totally submerged an interesting simulated observation that even remains for all drainage rates over 20 m3 s is that the dike remains submerged even if the sinkhole is not this is due to the configuration of the area and the high velocity of the flows upstream from the dike a rotational flow forms over the sinkhole which allows some of the water at the exterior of the vortex to pass over the dike it can also be noted that without the role of the sinkhole i e when drainage rate is considered to be 0 m3 s peak water level in the street would be 1 25 m instead of 49 cm this shows the importance of the south sinkhole and the structures built around it to protect the village if the model can indeed simulate most of the observations it can remain questionable due to some of its inputs i e manning coefficients and impermeability percentages uncertainties thus a sensibility analyses are required to test the robustness of this calibration 4 2 sensibility analyses three basic analyses were conducted on the manning value inputs the soils impermeability ratio inputs and on the infiltration rates they consist in comparing the simulated water velocity in the main street during the august 2015 event considering the sinkhole drainage rate previously calibrated for this event i e 20 m3 s this comparison presented in fig 8 and fig 9 is performed each time with three scenarii simulation using the minimal values the chosen values used for the calibration and the maximal values as presented in table 1 the possible range of values for the impervious parameter appears to have a negligible impact on the simulation the range of manning coefficients can only slightly impact the simulation results in the main street the lowest values would accentuate the peaks while the highest values would smooth the signal globally the simulations show a low sensibility to the input parameters that could not be measured which is reassuring for the accuracy of the model the water velocity simulated in the main street is also almost insensitive to a variation of 50 of the infiltration rates only a slight deviation can be observed when the water level decreases thus these analyses show that in such context of torrential flows in a mountain watershed the predominant factor influencing runoffs and flows remains indeed the morphology of the terrain this morphological information is quite precisely integrated in the model through a high resolution digital terrain model 4 3 validation on the other events the previously calibrated sinkhole drainage rate in the model can be tested for the other rainfall events for the three other events we do not have as much observations as for the august 2015 event but we know that the village was not flooded during the november 2014 and october 2016 event and flooded during the september 2015 event thus these model validations remain qualitative flooded or unflooded when performing simulations on these events with the model we reproduce a correct behavior fig 10 water fluxes in the main street is negligible during the 2014 and 2016 events while the village flooded with an important peak due to the dike submersion for the september 2015 event furthermore we tested other drainage rates also for these events it can be noted that for the 2014 and 2016 events when no drainage in the sinkhole is considered the village becomes flooded however a small drainage rate of 5 m3 s was already sufficient in these cases to prevent flooding concerning the september 2015 event simulation shows a slightly less catastrophic flood than for the august 2015 event however according the villagers the september event resulted in a more important flood than the one several days before in order to explain this difference with the simulations it shall be considered that the model considers a similar condition and sinkhole drainage for both events in reality after the august event the sinkhole was partly obstructed by debris and the street downstream from the dike was destroyed when the september event occurred these consequences were not fixed yet and may have aggravated the flood mainly by decreasing the drainage capacity of the sinkhole table 2 summarizes the different rainfall events and their simulations results in the main street and at the dike during the peaks it shows that more than the total rain quantity it is the intensity thus quantity over duration that determines if the village will be flooded or not in particular the august 2015 and october 2016 events provided the same amount of water on the watershed in the first case it resulted in a catastrophic flood in the second case there was no runoff in the village in order to explain this difference of runoff behavior during different rainfall events we used the simulation results in order to quantify the hydrological budget of the watershed for each event fig 11 note that as the model does not take into account the underground fluxes the underground storage and leakage capacities being considered as sufficiently high to not affect infiltration on the watershed this budget only account for surface processes runoffs and infiltrations when comparing the rainfall characteristics in table 2 to the budgets in fig 10 it obviously appears that the rainfall intensity affects the becoming of water in the watershed the higher the rain intensity the higher the runoff which is logical however it is interesting to see that in the cases of high intensities the proportion of water drained by the sinkhole becomes significantly higher and tends to limit this increase of runoff thus even if the main intensity of the august 2015 event is 40 higher than the one of september the runoff in the village remains in almost similar proportion for both events as a result this study case shows that when it comes to quantify runoffs during extreme events integrating the role of karst structures here in particular the sinkhole is crucial on the contrary the 2014 and 2016 low intensities events resulted in almost 90 of the water infiltrated in the soil over the watershed and thus a relatively low impact of the karst structures 4 4 effect of rainfall intensity we have taken advantages of the model in order to simulate different synthetic rain events based on the aug 2015 hyetogram and conditions in order to find the tipping rain intensity i e starting to generate important runoff in the village when the dike is submerged in this specific study case therefore we have first tested different rainfall scenarii described in table 3 these scenarii are applied based on the exact same assumptions than for the aug 2015 event that infiltrated and absorbed water are never limited by underground storage capacities thus the total rain amount considered for these synthetic rain events remain in a same order or less than the true historical event the synthetic cases show that the maximal rain intensity before dike submersion in this study case is 110 mm h in fact when performing simulations with 1 h uniform rains at this intensity or below the dike remains unflooded even when increasing the rainfall duration however when considering a 120 mm h rainfall the dike is submerged this is further validated by the fact that when one simulates the august 2015 event but clipping all intensities above 110 mm h 12 of the event the dike also remains unflooded it is also interesting to show the effect of rainfall sub hourly variability in fact when testing a triangular rain shape for a 1 h rainfall rain intensity increases from 60 to 140 mm h before decreasing back to the initial value within 1 h the dike is also submerged even if the total quantify of rain over the event is the same as a 100 mm h uniform event that would not generate this submersion this shows that for extreme event with high variabilities over short amount of time it is necessary to measure precisely these variations as an illustration of this fact when simulating the august 2015 event with an hourly averaged rainfall the results indicate that the village would not be significantly flooded 5 discussion this study case presents several advantages for the setup of a spatial model of surface runoffs and their relation to the underground systems the watershed is relatively small 1 km² it can be easily explored to identify the different biomes and karst features it also allows to constrain the model properties with several spatially distributed field measurements the small village mainly built along one main street is located at the outlet of the watershed furthermore the houses on either sides of the main street are built one against the other thus the main street of the village forms a giant venturi channel that collect all runoffs during the flood events where they can be quantified finally flash flood events can rarely be measured because of their very limited time scale hourly scale nevertheless the aug 2015 flash flood in this watershed has been widely documented in time and space based on ocular observations but also several videos providing the water velocities this documentation could be used as a basis for the model calibration however the uncertainties of the model can barely be quantified because of the limited amount of data for such flash floods events the rainfall events responsible for such floods having a return period of more than 100 years thus the model could be validated with three other rain events only qualitatively submersion of the dike or not nevertheless the sensitivity analysis performed on the input parameters of the model infiltration rates roughness impervious surfaces showed that the simulation results were rather insensitive to variations of these inputs thus suggesting that the modelling of runoffs for such events is mostly conditioned to the topography of the watershed and the absorptions in the sinkholes the first parameter is well known in this study case as we could use a high resolution digital terrain model of the area the second parameter was then calibrated on the aug 15 event observations as a result if the produced model could barely be validated it remains sufficiently constrained to be representative in order to perform the simulations some simplifications of the model presented in section 3 1 have been adopted in small watersheds like in this case considering a uniform rainfall is acceptable likewise neglecting the evapotranspiration during rainfall events will not generate important errors in the results the assumption of constant diffuse infiltration in soils adopted for this model could also be a source of simulations uncertainties if considering the soil to become quickly saturated during a rainfall remains acceptable in such watershed with important slopes it is possible that a small part of the infiltrated water is restituted in the talweg within a same rainfall event as interflows or hypodermic runoffs it is however complex to quantify without spatial measurements of water levels along the stream paths and it may represent only a very limited part of the total water volume however this study case presented a particular configuration that allowed considering important simplifications that can usually not be generalized in particular the watershed is at a relatively high altitude and thus its karst features are dry over 500 m high furthermore the considered rainfall events in this study and especially the most intense ones happened at the end of summer thus when the underground are the driest and the saturated water table in the karst network is very low these particularities allowed considering that the saturated water table was low enough to not affect drainage in the sinkholes of the watershed during these rainfalls at lower altitudes or at wetter periods of the year this assumption could generate important errors in the simulations and groundwater level should be taken into account it could reduce the drainage rate over time or even inverse the surface underground exchanges sinkhole becoming a karst network discharge at the surface in some cases jourde et al 2007 maréchal et al 2008 bailly comte et al 2009 6 summary and conclusion this work presents a hydrological study case of runoffs quantification for different rainfall conditions in a small mountainous karstic watershed this quantification relies on a spatial physical based numerical model this small basin dimension makes it possible to accurately assess the different hydrodynamic factors spatially conditioning water fluxes and exchanges topography soil conductivity roughness the most important remaining unknown is the drainage capacity of the karst sinkholes located near the outlet the basin however runoffs descriptions and observations in the village located at the outlet of the basin during four different rainfall event and especially during one catastrophic event in 2015 allows to calibrate the punctual infiltration rate associated to the sinkholes in the model the model has then be used to quantify the water balances diffuse infiltration sinkhole drainage or runoffs for this study case during four rain events characterized by different intensities but similar total cumulated rainfalls the simulations show that for the two long and low intensity rain events a majority of water approx 90 infiltrates the soil as diffuse infiltration a lower part is drained into the karst network approx 10 and a negligible part 1 runoffs however for the two short and intense rain events the water balance drastically changes as the diffuse infiltration part is decreased approx 50 instead of 90 in favor of runoff reaching approx 10 in such events the direct drainage into the karst plays a significant role as it reduces surface runoff by absorbing a larger part of total water approx 40 instead of 10 an analysis with synthetic rain events shows that it is not the total amount of fallen water that affects the generation of floods in the village but rather the exceeding of a critical rainfall intensity during the event in the same idea we show that using hyetograms at hourly time steps for such short and intense events generates totally inaccurate and underestimated simulations as it tends to average intensity variability within an hour this study is not totally generalizable as our study site allowed several numerical simplifications in particular that infiltration rate through sinkholes remained constant during rains events while in general this rate is affected by the groundwater table level and can be in the opposite way under particular conditions thus a similar approach could be applied in similar watershed configurations mainly in karstified calcareous plateau or mountainous areas with important thickness of unsaturated conduits network separating the entries sinkholes and the exit spring however this study shows with an application how the hydrological water balance can be significantly affected by the intensity variations during a rain event in a karst watershed furthermore as other references on this topic it also shows that taking into account the local fast exchanges between surface and underground through karst connections becomes crucial during extreme events credit authorship

7881,study region a 1 km² mountainous karst watershed on the larzac plateau in southern france study focus the village of la vacquerie located at the outlet of the watershed is punctually affected by flash floods during storm events on the contrary no runoff is observed in the village during other rainfalls a sinkhole draining surface flows at the entrance of the village plays a role on these differences descriptions of short and intense rainfalls in 2015 avg 40 mm h over 5 h and long and light events in 2014 2016 avg 8 mm h over 25 h provide valuable data to calibrate inputs of a distributed physic based flow model in particular the sinkhole drainage capacity this study aims to quantify drainage capacity changes with rainfall characteristics and to find the rain intensity threshold at which runoff exceeds sinkhole capacity new hydrological insights for the region the hydrological water balance of the hydrosystem is affected by the intensity variations for each of the different rain events it shows the limited part of drainage in sinkhole 10 during long light rains but its significant increase 40 during short and intense rains drainage in sinkhole is affected by intensity variations rather than by the total amount of precipitation when intensity exceeds 110 mm h the sinkhole is submerged however this result is obtained in a case of plateau configuration where the saturated level located deep below the surface here 500 m does not retro affect drainage in the sinkhole graphical abstract ga1 keywords karst interface flood hydrology modeling mediterranean data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological investigations aim at quantifying the repartition of rain water among surface flow through runoff and the different underground reservoirs through infiltration of a watershed the determination of these exchanges between surface and subsurface become even more crucial when considering extreme events floods or droughts in karstic environments the underground domain is highly contrasted between low permeability limestone rocks and the network of conductive fractures or conduits enlarged by dissolution through groundwater flows this specificity in karst environments is source of additional challenges for hydrological and hydrogeological sciences white 2002 ford and williams 2007 therefore hydrological case studies on karst are often site specific as the existing contrasts in such medium and thus its complex hydrological responses are closely related to a karstogenesis that is related to the geological and climatologic history of a region these contrasts can also be found at the surface in the epikarst where surface subsurface exchanges are slow and diffuse in soils while they can be fast in the fracture networks and almost instantaneous but localized in sinkholes or losses klimchouk 1995 the hydrological processes controlling the infiltration rates and the generation of runoff have been studied on a mountainous karst area in spain in li et al 2011 they performed rainfall simulations on in situ micro plots among a karst landscape and show the role of vegetation and rock fragments on infiltrations they quantified the averaged runoff coefficient over one year at the hillslope scale and found runoff to be globally limited 1 44 a similar study was performed in a sub tropical soil epikarst system in china in wang et al 2020 they quantified surface soil seepage and epikarst seepage runoffs in 20 m long in situ hillslope plots in a 5 m width and 4 m deep trench and for artificial rainfall events at different intensities they observed that soil seepage runoff always generated first during rain events and that surface runoff was the resultant of both a rain intensity exceeding of the soil epikarst interface infiltration rate and a sufficient cumulated rain to saturate the soil layer the previously presented studies in karst system do not take impact of developed karst sinkholes or losses in the epikarst such structures are punctual and represent a very limited surface among karst landscapes nevertheless they can still play an important role on the global hydrological balance in a karst watershed especially in relation with runoffs during intense rain events gutiérrez et al 2014 according to zhou 2007 sinkholes play a significant role in flood risks on karst terranes in particular a recharge related flooding is defined to describe floods occurring in karst landscapes when the sinkholes drainage capacities become lower than the storm water runoffs the determination of this drainage capacity is however complex because it mainly depends on the sinkhole size morphology and the configuration of the underlying karst network thus zhou 2007 advises to collect detailed information about the sinkholes in karst floods studies hydraulic models for quantifying drainage in sinkholes have been proposed in field 2010 on the basis of torricelli s theorem however these models require a good knowledge on sinkholes dimensions and shapes the role of sinkholes in local flash flood case studies has been taken into account in conceptual models in maréchal et al 2008 and fleury et al 2013 they analyzed the spatial responses of a karst hydrosytem in southern france to a storm event on the basis of runoff measurements at the surface water table measured in sinkholes and the karst spring discharge in particular they show how sinkholes near to the spring can play a role of drainage at the beginning of the event and swap to a role of back flooding when the karst network becomes totally saturated and generates backflows in bailly comte et al 2009 similar data have been collected for another storm event in southern france in addition to water temperature measurements in karst sinkhole these additional temperature data allowed better identifying when sinkholes were playing a role of drainage or when they were supplying surface runoffs if these conceptual models help understanding the global behaviors of sinkholes in terms of exchanges during rainfall event on karst terranes they do not allow to quantify these exchanges and the drainage capacities of the sinkholes thus bailly comte et al 2012 later performed a semi distributed modeling analysis with hec hms on the same hydrosystem in southern france and could estimate the sinkholes global drainage capacities to be 7 m3 s palanisamy and workman 2015 also proposed an adaptation of the semi distributed physical based hydrological model swat in order to take the role of individual sinkholes into account they have tested their model on a karst watershed in kentucky and have shown that the integration of the location and mean diameter of each sinkhole significantly improved the models prediction abilities a distributed physical based modeling of surface runoffs and infiltration among a karst watershed has been tested in liu et al 2005 on a 273 km² catchment in vietnam however at this important scale they could not specifically quantify the role of the different sinkholes along the river recently a distributed combined discrete continuum model has been proposed in al aamery et al 2021 that take into account vertical exchanges between surface flows and groundwater flows in a karst medium in particular it also allows integrating punctual drainage in sinkholes this model has been tested on a 58 km² karst basin in kentucky the requirement of an advanced knowledge on the karst underground structures for the application of such model is highlighted this work presents a 2d spatially distributed modeling application to simulate the hydrological responses of a small karst watershed 1 km² located in southern france to four different rainfall events these four events generate 150 to 250 mm of cumulated rain over periods ranging from 5 h to 25 h a village is located at the outlet of the watershed during short but intense events important flash floods affect the village on the contrary during longer but lighter events runoff is almost absent in the village a karst sinkhole located at the entrance of the village plays a key role on this response contrast due to its small size and its configuration this watershed can be easily conceptualized and spatial modeling can contribute to the understanding of its hydrological behavior the different karst sinkholes and losses among the watershed have been individually identified and characterized so that performing a quantification of drainage capacity becomes possible furthermore a storm event in august 2015 has been particularly described and provides valuable data to calibrate the model thus this study site represents a particularly interesting case in order to more generally investigate the effect of water runoffs drainage in karst network through surface sinkholes on global runoff at the outlet of the hydrosystem 2 presentation of the study site 2 1 hydrogeological context the study case presented in this work is based on a small 1 km² watershed located at the periphery of the larzac plateau between the cevennes mountain and the mediterranean sea in the south of france fig 1a at the outlet of this watershed is located the village of la vacquerie et saint martin de castries hereafter reduced to la vacquerie fig 2 the watershed is localized at quite high altitudes between 630 and 800 m asl it is typical for mountainous watersheds characterized by important slopes the underground of the watershed is composed of fractured bajocian dolomites and oxfordian limestones these carbonated formations are karstified three important karst structures north sinkhole south sinkhole and vacquerie loss can be found at the surface in particular the south sinkhole forms a large depression at the surface extending among a diameter of 8 m and a depth of 6 m a speleological investigation has shown that it vertically extends to at least a depth of 109 m where a constriction prevents deeper progress see fig s2 tracer tests have shown that the south sinkhole is connected to the clamouse karst system located in the hérault river canyon near saint guilhem le désert fig 1b the clamouse spring is a non perennial spring at the outlet a multi layered sub horizontal unsaturated karst system visited along 500 m camus 1997 and malcles et al 2020 have described the karstogenesis of the karst network around the larzac plateau due to the digging of canyons by rivers over time unsaturated karst levels have progressively formed in multi layered systems fig 1c as the current saturated level in at the altitude of the hérault river 100 m asl nowadays the studied watershed lies over a 500 m deep layered unsaturated karst conduits network the watershed is mostly covered by scrublands on the fractured calcareous rocks outcrops with only a few centimeters of soils in some areas the soils become thicker and allow the development of denser vegetation conifers hardwoods grass however globally the soil thickness barely exceeds one meter over the calcareous rocks among the area these soils partially cover the well developed karst system the average vertical permeability of the karst is assumed to be higher than that of the soils and therefore sufficient to evacuate the infiltrated water to deep levels 2 2 catastrophic flood events this mediterranean area is subject to extreme storm event due to the cevennes reliefs that block and concentrate the humid air coming from the sea one particularity of the village of la vacquerie is that its main street corresponds to the outlet of the watershed fig 2 thus in this context of mediterranean intense storm event the village is often subject to fast and torrential floods nevertheless through time villagers have tried to take advantages of the environment of the watershed to counterbalance this hydrological risk in particular they have understood the role of drainage played by the karst sinkholes and losses during the flood events and have built barriers and walls to lead water to them an historical study of these adaptions is described in leblanc 2018 and summarized in fig s1 of the supplementary files a geomorphological description of the different sinkholes among the watershed and the anthropic structures built around them is proposed in fig s2 of the supplementary files currently when runoff appears during a storm event water flows preferentially along natural and anthropized streambeds which are usually dry until it reaches a dike located at the entrance of the village and built in front of the south sinkhole in order to both protect the village and favor drainage in the sinkhole the two other sinkholes of the watershed have been used as flood protection by villagers in the past but are now almost entirely clogged despite these natural and anthropic protections flooding of the village still occurs during some particularly intense storm events in particular in 2015 two extreme events in august and september have both resulted in catastrophic fast and torrential floods in the main street of the village according to the meteorological data presented in bois et al 1997 these two events have a return period of more than 100 years fig 3 presents the hyetographs of these two storm events in comparison to two other rainfall events from november 2014 and october 2016 generating similar magnitudes of cumulated rainfalls over the watershed but no flood and associated to return periods of 10 years according to bois et al 1997 it is obvious that rainfall intensity and karst structures play a role in the formation of flood however this particular study case represents an interesting possibility to quantify this role trough numerical modeling in fact the small size of the watershed makes it easy to characterize furthermore the main street of the village is the outlet of the watershed this street has a constant width and houses are all built in one block along each border of the street thus the main street forms a rectangular channel that can be used to assess the flowrate at the outlet fast floods occur during very limited amount of time which make data measurement of such events very complicated nevertheless the chronology of the flood event of august 2015 in la vacquerie has been documented both during the flood and after see fig s3 in the complementary files for details on the basis of a video image processing with the freeware fudaa lspiv le coz et al 2010 2014 made on six videos taken during the flood it has been possible to estimate the velocities of the flows in the street during this event these velocity values associated to the water level visual estimations are used both to calibrate the roughness of the main street and to confront the spatial numerical model 3 numerical model 3 1 global presentation of the model the 2d top down view hydrological numerical model of the watershed is created in the modeling software hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras unsteady fluid flow is described by the navier stokes equations considering the shallow water assumptions incompressible flow uniform density negligible vertical velocity i e hydrostatic pressure can be assumed and turbulence is approximated the continuity equation then becomes 1 h t h v q where h is the water depth m v is the horizontal velocity vector m s t represents time s and q is the sink source term i e in this case rainfall infiltration and drainage the momentum equation becomes 2 v t v v f c v g z w s 1 h ν t h v τ b ρ r where f c is the coriolis parameter unit vector g is the gravitational acceleration m s² z w s is the water table elevation ν t is the eddy viscosity tensor τ b is the bottom shear stress vector calculated based on the manning coefficients ρ is the fluid density kg m3 and r is the hydraulic radius m the resolution of the 2d fluid flow equations in the model is performed base on an eulerian lagrangian method and a combination of finite difference and finite volume methods on a polygonal mesh a characteristic size of 10 m for the unit mesh elements has been chosen however the mesh is refined in the areas surrounding the streambed see fig 4b to a size of 2 m furthermore the streambed itself represents a mesh breakline where mesh is generated along the flow direction with a mesh size of 1 m finally a buffer area is considered on the larzac plateau downstream of the watershed which is meshed with a characteristic cell size of 20 m in total the mesh is composed of 22500 cells in each mesh cell a hydrological water budget is computed based on lateral and rainfall incomes and losses through infiltration and runoffs in order to update the local water depth underground flow processes in the karst conduits network are not considered explicitly in this model all infiltrated water is considered to be lost in the simulations however the model quantifies in each cell the water exiting the model through infiltration therefore we can pay particular attention to the volume and flow lost through absorption locally in the sinkholes and have an estimation of its consistency based on the sinkholes dimension the boundary conditions of the model are no flow conditions as the boundaries follow the limits of the watershed the large buffer area created downstream of the village in the model permits to limit the impact of the downstream boundary condition as water will then reach the larzac plateau where it will spread without impacting the upstream flows an unsteady flow time step of 0 5 s is chosen based on the mean mesh size and the maximal flow velocities this modeling of the watershed hydrodynamics assumes different important hypotheses linked to its characteristics i rainfall is uniform among the watershed ii the watershed is at a sufficient altitude and the groundwater saturated level is sufficiently low during the intense rainfall time periods august and september to consider that water level in the karst network does not impact drainage in the sinkholes iii thus when water enters a sinkhole it is drained based on a constant flow rate value in relation to its morphology iv soils become quickly saturated so that diffuse infiltrations are constant and depend on the soils saturated conductivities v evapotranspiration and wind effects are neglected during the rain events in the model we considered drainage only in the south sinkhole the other sinkholes being clogged they contribute to diffuse infiltration in the model but not for punctual drainage the drainage in the south sinkhole is considered to be limited by the narrowness found at 109 m depth thus during storms the sinkhole can be simplified to a funnel leading water to a filled vertical pipe draining at a constant rate conditioned by this narrowness diameter in the model considering the previous assumption an equivalent drained constant rate is set in order to remove water from the model as long as there is water in the depression formed by the sinkhole in the topography if water incomes exceed the draining rate the depression begins to fill up 3 2 input and output parameters the principal input of the model consists in the digital terrain model of the watershed with an altimetry accuracy of 1 cm and a spatial resolution of 1 m a tacheometry campaign has been led on field in order to add to this terrain model through gis tools the anthropic structures such as building and walls and the streambed and sinkhole surface dimensions with similar accuracies rainfall is then applied uniformly in the model for the intense events august and september 2015 the rainfalls were applied at a time step of 6 min while for the long events 2014 and 2016 the rainfalls were applied at a time step of 1 h other inputs of the model are associated to hydraulic properties of soils such as roughness saturated conductivities and impermeability percentage first the different biomes of the watershed have been spatially identified based on the french national institute of geographical and forestry information ign database fig 4a which has also been verified on field and using drone aerial views the saturated hydraulic conductivities were assessed for three types of soils observed among these biomes based on the beerkan infiltration method lassabatère et al 2006 roughness and impermeability percentage cannot be measured easily on field thus ranges of values a minimal a maximal and a plausible value between them were estimated for each biome based on tables and visual observations the input values used for these three properties are listed in table 1 simulation allows to assess water level and velocity spatially however in order to compare the simulation to real observations we have especially selected two observations points in the model see fig 4b one observation point is in the main street of the village were the water depth and the velocity in the street can be compared to the visual or video information of each event the other observation point concerns the water table elevation at the sinkhole and the dike in order to check potential overflowing of these structures 4 simulations results 4 1 calibration with the 23th august 2015 event the model has first been calibrated with the rainfall event of august 2015 before being validated on the other events in particular the constant drainage rate of the south sinkhole has been optimized in order to mimic the numerous observations of the catastrophic event thus 9 simulations on this event have been performed with drainage rates increasing from 0 to 40 m3 s overall simulation obtained with a sinkhole drainage of 20 m3 s appeared to provide the most coherent behaviors at observations points fig 5 in particular in the main street a peak water level of 49 cm with a peak velocity of 5 1 m s are simulated real observation of this event mentions a peak level of approximately 50 cm and videos interpretations reveal velocities reaching at least 4 m s however according to ocular observations during the event the level in the street has quickly risen at the peak and remained at a high level during one hour before starting decreasing at 1 20 pm in the simulation the water level indeed rises in 15 min before reaching the peak but then immediately decreases and remains at 10 cm until 1 20 pm thus the simulation doesn t show a one hour peak level plateau post event observations in the watershed mention that both sinkholes north and south and the loss were flooded and that a floodplain of 100 m length has formed between the dike and the debris barrier all these observations are also simulated with the model figs 5 and 6 furthermore in the simulation the dike was overflown under at most 31 cm of water which corresponds to the observed high water marks in order to check the consistency of the drainage of 20 m3 s in the sinkhole we have applied the torricelli s formula adaptation presented in field 2010 considering the sinkhole to have a conic shape and the hazen and williams 1920 formula of pipe flows considering the sinkhole to be similar to a continuous vertical pipe of 109 m in both cases in order to obtain such maximal rate we find that the diameter of the minimal section of the sinkhole structure should be between 75 and 100 cm these values appear as rather realistic in regards to the observed shrinkage that blocked the speleologists progression at 109 m depth the water levels and velocities simulated in the main street in the 9 scenarii with increasing sinkhole drainage and plotted in fig 7 it shows that the peak in the street is directly correlated to drainage of the south sinkhole in fact between 0 and 20 m3 s the higher the drainage the lower the peak level and velocity in the street over 20 m3 s the peak level and velocity remain approximately the same looking at the simulations in these cases and especially the water level in the sinkhole fig 7 one notes that this is related to the fact the sinkhole is no more totally submerged an interesting simulated observation that even remains for all drainage rates over 20 m3 s is that the dike remains submerged even if the sinkhole is not this is due to the configuration of the area and the high velocity of the flows upstream from the dike a rotational flow forms over the sinkhole which allows some of the water at the exterior of the vortex to pass over the dike it can also be noted that without the role of the sinkhole i e when drainage rate is considered to be 0 m3 s peak water level in the street would be 1 25 m instead of 49 cm this shows the importance of the south sinkhole and the structures built around it to protect the village if the model can indeed simulate most of the observations it can remain questionable due to some of its inputs i e manning coefficients and impermeability percentages uncertainties thus a sensibility analyses are required to test the robustness of this calibration 4 2 sensibility analyses three basic analyses were conducted on the manning value inputs the soils impermeability ratio inputs and on the infiltration rates they consist in comparing the simulated water velocity in the main street during the august 2015 event considering the sinkhole drainage rate previously calibrated for this event i e 20 m3 s this comparison presented in fig 8 and fig 9 is performed each time with three scenarii simulation using the minimal values the chosen values used for the calibration and the maximal values as presented in table 1 the possible range of values for the impervious parameter appears to have a negligible impact on the simulation the range of manning coefficients can only slightly impact the simulation results in the main street the lowest values would accentuate the peaks while the highest values would smooth the signal globally the simulations show a low sensibility to the input parameters that could not be measured which is reassuring for the accuracy of the model the water velocity simulated in the main street is also almost insensitive to a variation of 50 of the infiltration rates only a slight deviation can be observed when the water level decreases thus these analyses show that in such context of torrential flows in a mountain watershed the predominant factor influencing runoffs and flows remains indeed the morphology of the terrain this morphological information is quite precisely integrated in the model through a high resolution digital terrain model 4 3 validation on the other events the previously calibrated sinkhole drainage rate in the model can be tested for the other rainfall events for the three other events we do not have as much observations as for the august 2015 event but we know that the village was not flooded during the november 2014 and october 2016 event and flooded during the september 2015 event thus these model validations remain qualitative flooded or unflooded when performing simulations on these events with the model we reproduce a correct behavior fig 10 water fluxes in the main street is negligible during the 2014 and 2016 events while the village flooded with an important peak due to the dike submersion for the september 2015 event furthermore we tested other drainage rates also for these events it can be noted that for the 2014 and 2016 events when no drainage in the sinkhole is considered the village becomes flooded however a small drainage rate of 5 m3 s was already sufficient in these cases to prevent flooding concerning the september 2015 event simulation shows a slightly less catastrophic flood than for the august 2015 event however according the villagers the september event resulted in a more important flood than the one several days before in order to explain this difference with the simulations it shall be considered that the model considers a similar condition and sinkhole drainage for both events in reality after the august event the sinkhole was partly obstructed by debris and the street downstream from the dike was destroyed when the september event occurred these consequences were not fixed yet and may have aggravated the flood mainly by decreasing the drainage capacity of the sinkhole table 2 summarizes the different rainfall events and their simulations results in the main street and at the dike during the peaks it shows that more than the total rain quantity it is the intensity thus quantity over duration that determines if the village will be flooded or not in particular the august 2015 and october 2016 events provided the same amount of water on the watershed in the first case it resulted in a catastrophic flood in the second case there was no runoff in the village in order to explain this difference of runoff behavior during different rainfall events we used the simulation results in order to quantify the hydrological budget of the watershed for each event fig 11 note that as the model does not take into account the underground fluxes the underground storage and leakage capacities being considered as sufficiently high to not affect infiltration on the watershed this budget only account for surface processes runoffs and infiltrations when comparing the rainfall characteristics in table 2 to the budgets in fig 10 it obviously appears that the rainfall intensity affects the becoming of water in the watershed the higher the rain intensity the higher the runoff which is logical however it is interesting to see that in the cases of high intensities the proportion of water drained by the sinkhole becomes significantly higher and tends to limit this increase of runoff thus even if the main intensity of the august 2015 event is 40 higher than the one of september the runoff in the village remains in almost similar proportion for both events as a result this study case shows that when it comes to quantify runoffs during extreme events integrating the role of karst structures here in particular the sinkhole is crucial on the contrary the 2014 and 2016 low intensities events resulted in almost 90 of the water infiltrated in the soil over the watershed and thus a relatively low impact of the karst structures 4 4 effect of rainfall intensity we have taken advantages of the model in order to simulate different synthetic rain events based on the aug 2015 hyetogram and conditions in order to find the tipping rain intensity i e starting to generate important runoff in the village when the dike is submerged in this specific study case therefore we have first tested different rainfall scenarii described in table 3 these scenarii are applied based on the exact same assumptions than for the aug 2015 event that infiltrated and absorbed water are never limited by underground storage capacities thus the total rain amount considered for these synthetic rain events remain in a same order or less than the true historical event the synthetic cases show that the maximal rain intensity before dike submersion in this study case is 110 mm h in fact when performing simulations with 1 h uniform rains at this intensity or below the dike remains unflooded even when increasing the rainfall duration however when considering a 120 mm h rainfall the dike is submerged this is further validated by the fact that when one simulates the august 2015 event but clipping all intensities above 110 mm h 12 of the event the dike also remains unflooded it is also interesting to show the effect of rainfall sub hourly variability in fact when testing a triangular rain shape for a 1 h rainfall rain intensity increases from 60 to 140 mm h before decreasing back to the initial value within 1 h the dike is also submerged even if the total quantify of rain over the event is the same as a 100 mm h uniform event that would not generate this submersion this shows that for extreme event with high variabilities over short amount of time it is necessary to measure precisely these variations as an illustration of this fact when simulating the august 2015 event with an hourly averaged rainfall the results indicate that the village would not be significantly flooded 5 discussion this study case presents several advantages for the setup of a spatial model of surface runoffs and their relation to the underground systems the watershed is relatively small 1 km² it can be easily explored to identify the different biomes and karst features it also allows to constrain the model properties with several spatially distributed field measurements the small village mainly built along one main street is located at the outlet of the watershed furthermore the houses on either sides of the main street are built one against the other thus the main street of the village forms a giant venturi channel that collect all runoffs during the flood events where they can be quantified finally flash flood events can rarely be measured because of their very limited time scale hourly scale nevertheless the aug 2015 flash flood in this watershed has been widely documented in time and space based on ocular observations but also several videos providing the water velocities this documentation could be used as a basis for the model calibration however the uncertainties of the model can barely be quantified because of the limited amount of data for such flash floods events the rainfall events responsible for such floods having a return period of more than 100 years thus the model could be validated with three other rain events only qualitatively submersion of the dike or not nevertheless the sensitivity analysis performed on the input parameters of the model infiltration rates roughness impervious surfaces showed that the simulation results were rather insensitive to variations of these inputs thus suggesting that the modelling of runoffs for such events is mostly conditioned to the topography of the watershed and the absorptions in the sinkholes the first parameter is well known in this study case as we could use a high resolution digital terrain model of the area the second parameter was then calibrated on the aug 15 event observations as a result if the produced model could barely be validated it remains sufficiently constrained to be representative in order to perform the simulations some simplifications of the model presented in section 3 1 have been adopted in small watersheds like in this case considering a uniform rainfall is acceptable likewise neglecting the evapotranspiration during rainfall events will not generate important errors in the results the assumption of constant diffuse infiltration in soils adopted for this model could also be a source of simulations uncertainties if considering the soil to become quickly saturated during a rainfall remains acceptable in such watershed with important slopes it is possible that a small part of the infiltrated water is restituted in the talweg within a same rainfall event as interflows or hypodermic runoffs it is however complex to quantify without spatial measurements of water levels along the stream paths and it may represent only a very limited part of the total water volume however this study case presented a particular configuration that allowed considering important simplifications that can usually not be generalized in particular the watershed is at a relatively high altitude and thus its karst features are dry over 500 m high furthermore the considered rainfall events in this study and especially the most intense ones happened at the end of summer thus when the underground are the driest and the saturated water table in the karst network is very low these particularities allowed considering that the saturated water table was low enough to not affect drainage in the sinkholes of the watershed during these rainfalls at lower altitudes or at wetter periods of the year this assumption could generate important errors in the simulations and groundwater level should be taken into account it could reduce the drainage rate over time or even inverse the surface underground exchanges sinkhole becoming a karst network discharge at the surface in some cases jourde et al 2007 maréchal et al 2008 bailly comte et al 2009 6 summary and conclusion this work presents a hydrological study case of runoffs quantification for different rainfall conditions in a small mountainous karstic watershed this quantification relies on a spatial physical based numerical model this small basin dimension makes it possible to accurately assess the different hydrodynamic factors spatially conditioning water fluxes and exchanges topography soil conductivity roughness the most important remaining unknown is the drainage capacity of the karst sinkholes located near the outlet the basin however runoffs descriptions and observations in the village located at the outlet of the basin during four different rainfall event and especially during one catastrophic event in 2015 allows to calibrate the punctual infiltration rate associated to the sinkholes in the model the model has then be used to quantify the water balances diffuse infiltration sinkhole drainage or runoffs for this study case during four rain events characterized by different intensities but similar total cumulated rainfalls the simulations show that for the two long and low intensity rain events a majority of water approx 90 infiltrates the soil as diffuse infiltration a lower part is drained into the karst network approx 10 and a negligible part 1 runoffs however for the two short and intense rain events the water balance drastically changes as the diffuse infiltration part is decreased approx 50 instead of 90 in favor of runoff reaching approx 10 in such events the direct drainage into the karst plays a significant role as it reduces surface runoff by absorbing a larger part of total water approx 40 instead of 10 an analysis with synthetic rain events shows that it is not the total amount of fallen water that affects the generation of floods in the village but rather the exceeding of a critical rainfall intensity during the event in the same idea we show that using hyetograms at hourly time steps for such short and intense events generates totally inaccurate and underestimated simulations as it tends to average intensity variability within an hour this study is not totally generalizable as our study site allowed several numerical simplifications in particular that infiltration rate through sinkholes remained constant during rains events while in general this rate is affected by the groundwater table level and can be in the opposite way under particular conditions thus a similar approach could be applied in similar watershed configurations mainly in karstified calcareous plateau or mountainous areas with important thickness of unsaturated conduits network separating the entries sinkholes and the exit spring however this study shows with an application how the hydrological water balance can be significantly affected by the intensity variations during a rain event in a karst watershed furthermore as other references on this topic it also shows that taking into account the local fast exchanges between surface and underground through karst connections becomes crucial during extreme events credit authorship

service is a scientific concept and an important research field first proposed by chinese scientists in recent years xiao et al 2015 wang et al 2019a with relevant research results published in nature in 2020 immerzeel et al 2020 as one of the functions and services of the cryosphere the hydrological regulating function of glaciers and its importance is gradually being recognized the first study on glacier regulation of streamflow was conducted in 1961 meier and tangborn 1961 the hydrological regulation of glaciers has been successively observed and confirmed in the course of hydrological studies of glacier basins in the asian himalayas european alps and the rocky mountains of north america fountain 1985 yang 1991 comeau et al 2009 immerzeel et al 2010 farinotti et al 2012 currently there is a lack of effective quantitative assessment methods for the hydrological regulation of glaciers and two crucial research progress are summarized below first the critical glacier coverage with a long lasting regulating effect on streamflow has been defined relevant studies have shown that glaciers regulate streamflow on the annual and seasonal scales through their changes and glacier covered basins are more stable than those without glaciers fountain 1985 chen and ohmura 1990 ye et al 1999 comeau et al 2009 in the saskatchewan river of the canadian rockies glaciers provide strong annual regulation of runoff when the glacier cover of the basin is greater than 3 comeau et al 2009 whereas in the major basins in western china glaciers have a solid regulating effect only when the glacier cover exceeds 5 ye et al 1999 second a static definition index was proposed to judge whether glaciers had a regulating effect on streamflow hopkinson and young proposed that whether glaciers have a regulating effect on streamflow can be judged by comparing the difference between the coefficient of variation of streamflow cb and the coefficient of variation of non glacial meltwater runoff cw hopkinson and young 1998 the advantage of this method is that it can accurately determine whether glaciers have a regulating function on streamflow in a specific basin during the study or observation period however the intensity of glacier regulation cannot be identified and the dynamics of this regulation cannot be characterized in general the research on glaciers hydrological regulating function is still at the stage of qualitative understanding the consensus is that with the accelerated shrinkage of glaciers and glacier mass losses glacier runoff increases but rapidly decreases after reaching a peak the glaciers runoff regulating function eventually weakens or disappears ye et al 2003 li et al 2015 moore et al 2020 which leads to uneven runoff and increases disaster risk in most cryosphere basins especially those in arid regions you et al 2017 li et al 2020 the modern glaciers of china are primarily found in the tianshan mountains these abundant glacier resources provide water resources for socio economic development oasis agricultural development and ecological environment protection in xinjiang deng et al 2019 due to global warming the glaciers in tianshan are generally retreating with glacier melt and continuous glacier mass loss accelerating seriously impacting streamflow regulation bolch 2007 sorg et al 2012 however current researchers on glaciers in tianshan have mainly focused on glacier mass balance ye et al 2005 liu and liu 2016 runoff simulation hagg et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2020 and the socio economic impact of

management to assess the glaciers hydrological regulating function we selected the upper stream of manas river basin umns on the northern slope of the tianshan mountains and the upper stream of the muzati river basin umzt on the southern slope as the study areas we defined the glacier hydrological regulation index glacier r to quantify the glacier runoff regulation function and analyzed the dynamics under three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 from 1971 to 2100 this study aims to enhance the understanding of glacier hydrological regulation functions in the tianshan mountains and to provide scientific guidance and decision support for local governments to cope with glacier changes and their impacts 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tianshan mountains in china are located at 73 30 96 06 e 39 36 45 30 n with a length of approximately 1700 km an average breadth of about 250 350 km and an average altitude of 4000 m on the ridges they are distinguished by topography that slopes from west to east fig 1 due to the influence of topography and westerly latitudinal circulation the precipitation distribution in the tian shan varies greatly with abundant precipitation in the western and northern mountainous regions averaging about 300 mm per year and sparse precipitation in the eastern and southern regions less than 150 mm the spatial temperature variation is substantial with a multi year average temperature of approximately 5 0 c the average annual temperature on the southern slopes is considerably higher than that on the northern slopes at 7 5 10 0 and 2 5 5 0 c respectively cai et al 2021 the tianshan mountains are also the origin of many rivers such as the tarim aksu manas and weigan rivers the manas river basin is located in the middle of the northern foothills of the tianshan mountains and the southern edge of the junggar basin with the terrain gently sloping from southeast to northwest the manas river with a total length of 324 km an average annual discharge of 12 95 108 m3 and a catchment area of 5156 km2 above the watershed at the kensiwate hydrological station is one of the greatest rivers in the region with the largest number and size of glaciers in the junggar inland flow area the overall climate of the basin is dry with little rain and extensive annual evaporation precipitation is primarily concentrated in the plain areas in front of the mountains with annual precipitation ranging from 110 to 200 mm mainly falling from april to august accounting for 70 2 of the average annual precipitation the annual evaporation ranges from 1500 to 2000 mm the elevation of the manas river basin is approximately 846 5138 m above 3600 m the area is covered by snow and glaciers all year round the glaciers cover 12 of the basin area while glacier meltwater and snowmelt replenish the rivers with 35 of the streamflow the muzati river flows out from the khan tengri peak at the southern foot of the tianshan mountains with a catchment area of 2653 km2 and an elevation of approximately 1884 6779 m the elevation of the watershed slopes from northwest to southeast with water vapor mainly originating from the warm and humid air currents of the atlantic and arctic oceans the basin contains 243 glaciers covering 1 28 103 km2 and accounting for 48 2 of the basin area the muzati river is one of xinjiang s rivers with the highest glacier coverage with an average annual discharge of 14 5 108 m3 the discharge of muzati river is predominantly concentrated in summer which accounts for approximately 70 of the annual runoff and is dominated by glacier meltwater in this study we selected the upstream regions of the manas and muzati river basins as typical watersheds fig 1 they both originate from snow and glacier covered areas and snow and glacier meltwater account for a large proportion of river runoff the downstream areas of these rivers are distributed with large areas of cultivated land and the selected watersheds represent the north and south slopes of the tianshan mountains 2 2 data sources we applied an extended variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrological model named vic cas zhao et al 2019 to project runoff changes in the umns and umzt we obtained daily meteorological forcing data wind speed precipitation maximum minimum and mean

information center of cma strictly controlled data quality including homogeneity checks temporal and spatial consistency tests and probable outlier rejection feng et al 2004 we collected monthly discharge data from the xinjiang hydrological bureau for the hydrological stations of kensiwate and bao chengzi from 1971 to 2013 we obtained glacier distribution data from the ﬁrst and second chinese glacier inventory http westdc westgis ac cn and soil data from the international geosphere biosphere program data and information system igbp dis https daac ornl gov we derived a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m from the geospatial data cloud of china http www gscloud cn we used the latest version of general circulation models gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 as the climate forcing data for the vic cas model from the world climate research program wcrp website https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 in this study we employed five gcms under three ssps table 1 to project the response of hydrological processes to future climate change to downscale the selected gcms we used the quantile delta mapping qdm method cannon et al 2015 kim et al 2021 tong et al 2021 the baseline period was 1971 2013 and future daily climate data was projected from 2014 to 2100 the vic cas model has been successfully implemented in the central tianshan mountains and the muzati river zhao et al 2015 2020 we systematically assessed hydrological processes in selected catchments under three ssps using calibrated vic cas model and downscaled cmip6 climate forcing data 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 brief overview of the vic model the vic model is based on the soil vegetation atmospheric transfer scheme svats developed by experts from the universities of washington california berkeley and princeton liang et al 1996 the model simulates energy and water budgets snow melt and accumulation and soil freezing and thawing processes at daily time steps within each grid cell nijssen et al 2001 hidalgo et al 2013 hamman et al 2018 since the vic model cannot simulate glacier hydrological processes zhao et al 2015 proposed a sub gridded scheme for coupled glacier hydrological processes the model calculation units were set as sub basins the glaciers within the sub basins were divided into continuous elevation bands and the gradient method was used to sub grid the mean meteorological forcing data temperature precipitation to glacier elevation bands the enhanced degree day factor method was adopted to calculate the accumulation and ablation processes of each glacier on the elevation bands the glacier volume changes were calculated based on the annual glacier mass balance and the glacier area volume relationship v a scaling law was adopted to calculate the area changes of each glacier the detailed calculation method is described in the literature by zhao et al 2015 2019 for the first time an upgraded vic cas model was employed in the kunma like river catchment zhao et al 2015 it has been widely utilized for simulating regional hydrology processes zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 jin et al 2021 2 3 2 calibration and validation of the model we set 1961 1970 as the warming period 1971 1990 as the calibration period and 1991 2010 as the validation period the vic cas model was calibrated by the second glacier inventory dataset of china and observed monthly runoff following a two step process 1 glacier simulation calibration we used glacier data from the first chinese glacier inventory as the starting point of the simulation all glaciers in each catchment were classified into three size classes 1 km2 1 6 km2 and 6 km2 and half of the glaciers in each size class were randomly selected as model parameters ddfsnow ice the degree day factors of ice or snow and r exp the impact factor of slope ablation calibration data and the other half as validation data for each catchment the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns and relative bias er were adopted to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model on glaciers in each size class 2 runoff generation calibration the key soil parameters related to runoff the variable infiltration curve parameter b the three layer soil thickness d1 d2 d3 and parameters affecting the baseflow ds ds max and ws were calibrated against the observed monthly runoff from 1971 to 1990 for the umns and umzt nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns coefficient of determination r2 and relative bias er were employed to verify the simulation accuracy of the model the

where q obs and q sim represent the monthly observed runoff and simulated runoff respectively q obs and q sim represent the mean monthly observed runoff and simulated runoff respectively 2 3 3 trend analysis the mann kendall test mk test is a non parametric test method originally proposed by mann and kendall kendall 1975 mann 1945 and the non parametric sen s slope procedure was developed by sen 1968 the mk and sen s slope estimation tests are commonly used worldwide to analyze trends in time series in hydro meteorological variables baraer et al 2012 li et al 2022 the mk test statistic index z so called mk value conforms to the standard normal distribution if z z 1 α 2 it indicates a significant upward or downward trend in the time series values at the significance level of α given that α 0 01 then zα 2 2 58 here the mk and sen s slope estimator tests were used to analyze the trends of hydro meteorological variables in the umns and umzt 2 3 4 runoff variation coefficient hopkinson and young 1998 constructed a method to identify the role of glaciers in regulating streamflow by comparing the coefficient of variation of streamflow c b and the coefficient of variation of non glacial runoff c w using the following equation 4 c b σ b r b 5 c w σ w r w where c b is the coefficient of variation of streamflow c w is the coefficient of variation of non glacial meltwater runoff the c b minus the coefficient of variation glacial meltwater runoff σ b is the standard deviation of streamflow σ w is the standard deviation of non glacial meltwater runoff r b is the mean value of streamflow and r w is the mean value of non glacial meltwater runoff if c b c w glaciers have a regulating effect on watershed runoff 2 3 5 glacier hydrology regulation index based on the above formula we defined the glacier hydrology regulation index glacier r to characterize the intensity of the regulation function provided by glaciers we analyzed the dynamics of the hydrological runoff regulation function of glaciers by using the decadal division method with the following equation 6 glacier r c b c w where glacier r is the glacier hydrology regulation index a smaller glacier r value indicates that glacial runoff has a stronger hydrology regulation ability and vice versa 3 results 3 1 comparison of observed runoff with simulated runoff fig 2 compares the monthly observed and simulated streamflow for the calibration and validation periods the simulation efficiency of the umns was excellent fig 2a with a mean ns value of 0 89 the r2 value of 0 91 and er value of 2 69 for the calibration period and 0 89 0 91 and 3 80 for the validation period respectively we also obtained excellent results for the umzt fig 2b with a mean ns value of 0 96 the r2 value of 0 96 and er value of 0 61 for the calibration period and 0 94 0 96 and 1 41 for the validation period respectively the results of the vic cas model for the calibration and validation periods are consistent with the previous study zhao et al 2020 3 2 variations in climate variables fig 3 displays the past and future annual precipitation and temperature variations in the umns and umzt we used the mk test method to evaluate the time series trend characteristics for 1971 2100 table 2 presents the climate variables mk values and rates of change slope or s during the historical period the annual precipitation on the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains both showed an increasing trend fig 3a g the annual precipitation in the umns and umzt increased at an average rate of 18 38 mm 10a and 21 36 mm 10a respectively meanwhile the annual temperature in the umns and umzt also showed an increasing trend fig 3d j the average annual temperature increase rates in the two basins were 0 32 10a and 0 41 10a respectively the precipitation and temperature showed a significant rising trend in the umns and umzt with mk values of 2 85 3 24 and 2 24 4 95 respectively table 2 fig 3 also indicates that precipitation and temperature on the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains show an increasing trend under three scenarios at the end of the 21st century table 2 shows the projected rates of increase in precipitation and temperature for the umns and umzt during 2014 2100 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios the precipitation and temperature increasing rates in the umns and umzt range from 2 53 to 3 5 mm 10a 0 15 0 64 10a and from 4 8 to 11 43 mm 10a 0 15 0 68 10a respectively the temperature in the umns and umzt shows a significant increasing trend with a confidence level of 0 01 table 2 3 3 variations in streamflow and glacial runoff 3 3 1 interannual variations the past and future annual variations of streamflow in the two basins differed fig 4 during the historical period the annual streamflow change rates of the umns and umzt were 0 97 108 m3 10a and 0 09 108 m3 10a respectively table 2 under the three ssps the annual streamflow in the umns shows a decreasing trend fig 4a c and the rate of streamflow decrease ranges from 0 11 108 m3 10a to 0 38 108 m3 10a table 2 the annual streamflow in the umzt shows a decreasing trend under the ssp1 2 6 scenario fig 4g and the decreasing rate of streamflow is 0 23 108 m3 10a however the annual streamflow of the umzt shows a slightly increasing trend under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios fig 4h i from 1971 2100 the annual glacier runoff on the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains both showed a decreasing trend fig 4d f j l during the historical period the decreasing rate of glacier runoff was 0 14 108 m3 10a and 0 75 108 m3 10a respectively table 2 under the three ssps the glacier runoff of the umzt decreases rapidly and the decreasing rate of glacier runoff is more than twice that of the umns the glacier runoff in the umns and umzt shows a significant decreasing trend with a confidence level of 0 01 table 2 3 3 2 interdecadal variations the streamflow in the umns increased by 24 6 from 11 22 108 m3 in the 1970 s to 13 98 108 m3 in the 2000 s fig 5 however glacier runoff in the basin decreased by 16 9 from 2 87 108 m3 in the 1970 s to 2 37 108 m3 in the 2000 s compared to the 1970 2000 s streamflow in the umns decreases by 3 0 1 5 and 6 0 while glacier runoff decreases by 23 5 23 3 and 21 7 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively from 2021 to 2060 from 2061 2100 streamflow decreases by 6 9 8 9 and 17 6 and glacier runoff decreases by 44 1 44 3 and 47 7 under the three ssps respectively the results showed that the tipping point of glacier runoff in the umns occurred in the 2010 s 2011 2020 the streamflow in the umzt showed a decreasing trend fig 6 from 15 05 108 m3 in the 1970 s to 13 85 108 m3 in the 2000 s with a decrease rate of 8 glacier runoff decreased from 11 30 108 m3 in the 1970 s to 8 62 108 m3 in the 2000 s with a decrease rate of 23 7 compared to the 1970 2000 s streamflow in the umzt decreases by 4 5 4 1 and 1 5 and glacier runoff decreases by 17 1 16 7 and 12 4 under the three ssps respectively from 2021 to 2060 from 2061 2100 streamflow decreases by 13 1 4 9 and 2 0 and glacier runoff decreases by 32 9 26 4 and 21 4 for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively the projection results showed that the tipping point of glacial runoff in the umzt also occurred in the 2010 s in summary the interdecadal streamflow variations in the umns and umzt differed but glacier runoff in the two basins showed a decreasing trend under the three ssps streamflow and glacier runoff in the umns and umzt exhibit decreasing trends with glacier runoff decreasing more 3 4 variations in glacier hydrological regulation function 3 4 1 overall variations during the historical period 1971 2010 glaciers hydrological regulation functions on the north and south slopes of the tianshan mountains differed fig 7 in general the glaciers hydrological regulation functions of the umzt were stronger than those of the umns the glacier hydrological regulation index glacier r of the umzt and umns was 0 30 and 0 78 respectively in the future the hydrological regulation functions of glaciers in the two basins will decrease at the end of the 21st century fig 7 from 2021 2060 the glacier r of the umzt and umns will be 0 46 and 0 82 for ssp1 2 6 respectively compared with the historical period 1971 2010 the hydrological regulation functions of glaciers in the umzt and umns will decrease by 52 1 and 5 8 respectively for ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 the glaciers hydrological regulation functions in the two basins will decrease by 53 6 54 9 and 7 0 3 0 respectively compared with the historical period the hydrological regulation function of glaciers on the north and south slope basins of the tianshan mountains will further decrease from 2061 through 2100 for ssp1 2 6 the decrease in the hydrological regulation function of glaciers will be 66 9 and 10 5 in the umzt and umns respectively for ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 the glaciers hydrological regulation functions in the two basins will decrease by 58 6 57 0 and 8 8 14 0 respectively in conclusion we reveal that the hydrological regulation role of glaciers in the north and south slope basins of the tianshan mountains will vary differently during the periods of 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 the hydrological regulation function of glaciers on the south slope of the tianshan mountains will be decreased by 52 1 66 9 under the three ssps while that on the north slope only will be reduced by 3 0 14 0 the hydrological regulating function of glaciers on the south slope of the tianshan mountains is more potent than that on the north slope the significant decrease in the hydrological regulating function of glaciers on the south slope may significantly weaken their role in regulating streamflow in the future 3 4 2 interdecadal variations to analyze the dynamics of glaciers hydrological regulation function on the north and south facing slopes of the tianshan mountains we divided ten years as a period to calculate the glacier r and analyzed the interdecadal changes in the hydrological regulation function provided by glaciers from the 1970 s to the 2090 s in detail from the 1970 s to the 2090 s the glaciers hydrological regulating function in the umns and umzt showed a weakening trend fig 8 the glaciers had a powerful regulatory function in the umns from the 1970 s to the 2010 s fig 8a in the 1970 s glaciers had the strongest regulatory function in the umns with a glacier r of 0 47 it then gradually weakened and reached its minimum value in the 1990 s although its regulation function rebounded in the 2000 s and 2010 s it was still lower than in the 1970 s and 1980 s the hydrological regulating function of the glaciers in the umns will continue to decrease under the three ssps from the 2010 s to the 2090 s fig 8a however the regulating function of the glaciers in the umzt has remained in an intense phase fig 8b with the strongest function occurring in the 1980 s with a glacier r of 0 19 although its regulation ability weakened after the 1980 s the glacier r in the umzt still ranged from 0 37 to 0 55 under the three ssps indicating that the regulating function remained strong the tipping point of glacier runoff regulation also differs fig 8 shows that from the 1970 s to the 2090 s the 1970 s was the period of the strongest hydrological regulating function of glaciers in the umns for the umzt it occurred in the 1980 s the tipping point of glaciers hydrological regulation functions in the umns appeared ten years earlier than in the umzt the tipping points that occurred at different periods in the two basins are associated with the different scales of glacier area and rates of temperature increase zhang et al 2016 ding et al 2020 in the umns and umzt the proportion of glacier area to basin area is 12 and 48 respectively in addition the proportion of small scale glacier area is more extensive in the umns than in the umzt in summary the hydrological regulating functions of glaciers in the umns and umzt are weakening and the 1970 2010 s are the period of the strongest glaciers regulating function under the three ssps the hydrological regulation function of glaciers in the two basins will be significantly weakened by the end of the 21st century due to the different characteristics and scales of glaciers the umns and umzt show some differences in the variations of glaciers regulation functions overall the hydrology regulation function of glaciers is more potent in the umzt on the south slope and weaker in the umns on the north slope 3 4 3 seasonality variations fig 9 shows the seasonal variations of hydrological regulation provided by glaciers in the umns and umzt the glaciers hydrological regulating role of the umns was mainly concentrated in june september and was stronger in summer june august with glacier r between 0 68 and 0 73 the glaciers had the strongest hydrological regulation function in august with a glacier r of 0 68 however the regulation function of the glaciers in the umzt was primarily concentrated in april october and stronger in may august with a glacier r ranging from 0 30 to 0 45 the maximum value of glacier r was 0 30 in july under the three ssps the hydrological regulation of glaciers in the two basins will mainly concentrate in april october may september will be the period of stronger hydrological regulation functioning of glaciers in general the glaciers hydrological regulating function in the north and south slope basins of the tianshan mountains will tend to weaken within the year fig 9b d compared with the historical period the hydrological regulation function of glaciers in the summer in the umzt and umns will substantially decrease under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 from 2021 to 2060 with a decreasing rate of 12 7 2 9 12 7 2 9 and 14 1 5 7 respectively from 2061 2100 the hydrological regulation functions of glaciers in the two basins will decrease by 14 1 17 1 14 1 11 4 and 25 4 8 6 in the summer respectively 4 discussion the interannual variations of streamflow and glacier flow in the umns and umzt were analyzed in the study our results indicated that the streamflow in the umns showed an increasing trend which showed a slightly decreasing trend in the umzt and the glacier flow in the two basins showed a decreasing trend during the historical period similar studies were reported in other studies in the manas river basin wang et al 2019b ding et al 2020 and muzati river basin zhao et al 2020 our results also indicated that the variations of glaciers hydrological regulation in the umns and umzt were different and the reasons were analyzed as follows first the contribution rates of glacier runoff are different between the two basins during the baseline period 1971 2013 the contribution rate of annual glacier flow in the umns and umzt was 23 24 and 65 55 respectively fig 10 in the early studies by luo et al 2013 and wang et al 2019 the annual glacier flow contribution in the manas river basin was 25 and 27 respectively a similar study was employed in the muzati river basin by zhao et al 2020 the annual glacier flow contribution was 66 6 thus the different contribution rates of glacier runoff in the two basins may lead to different changes in the glaciers hydrological regulation second the streamflow components of the two basins are different the streamflow is dominated by snowmelt and glacier runoff in the umns and snow meltwater accounts for a more considerable proportion conversely glacier meltwater provides the majority of streamflow recharge in the umzt sorg et al 2012 liu et al 2020 finally the climate differs between the basins due to global warming the temperature in the tianshan mountains has increased since the 1970 s as has glacier instability ding et al 2019 the average annual temperature on the south facing slope of the tianshan mountains is approximately 2 c higher than that on the north facing slope chen et al 2017 luo et al 2013 found that glacier meltwater was positively correlated to temperature variation with an r2 value of 0 70 and statistical significance of p 0 001 in the tianshan mountains the difference in temperature change is an essential reason for glaciers hydrological regulation in the umns and umzt the role of glacier meltwater in streamflow reduction and replenishment is crucial pritchard 2019 which will have profound effects on inland river basins in arid regions li et al 2010 chen et al 2015 2016 however no studies have yet focused on the glaciers runoff regulation in the tianshan mountains to support water resources management thus we defined glacier r based on the coefficient of variation method however the method has limitations as it only considers streamflow and glacier runoff and the method does not reflect the interannual variations in future studies the temperature and precipitation in the glacier area need to be considered to correctly characterize the runoff regulation function of glaciers and approximate their real state 5 conclusions we used the glacier r to analyze past and future variations of the glaciers hydrological regulation by simulating glacier runoff and streamflow data with the vic cas model our results suggest that the annual precipitation and temperature in the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains show an increasing trend from 1971 to 2100 while glacier runoff from the umns and umzt show a decreasing trend during the historical period and under the three ssps under ssp1 2 6 glacier runoff of the umns and umzt will reduce by 32 9 and 44 1 respectively from 2061 to 2100 the glacier hydrological regulation is higher in the umzt and lower in the umns in terms of overall variability and the regulatory functions of glaciers in the two basins will substantially weaken by the end of the 21st century under ssp1 2 6 the glaciers hydrological regulating functions in the umzt and umns will decrease by 66 9 and 10 5 respectively between 2061 and 2100 in terms of interdecadal variation the tipping points of the glaciers hydrological regulating functions in the umns and umzt occurred in the 1970 s and the 1980 s respectively summer june august was the period of the strongest hydrological regulation provided by glaciers in the north and south slope basins of the tianshan mountains glacier meltwater is essential to glacier covered arid regions our results suggest that the glaciers hydrological regulation role in the north and south slope basins of tianshan mountains will continue to decline in the future thus the incidence of extreme hydrological events triggered by glacier changes will be high zappa and kan 2007 liu et al 2021 these changes will extensively and profoundly impact the sustainable use of water resources oasis ecological and environmental security and sustainable socioeconomic development in arid areas to cope with the risk of water scarcity resulting from glacier retreat effective actions must be taken including enhancing the efficiency of irrigation water usage in agriculture restructuring the industry and enhancing water conservation awareness credit authorship contribution statement qingshan he conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft writing

7882,study region the upstream reaches of manas river basin umns and muzati river basin umzt study focus glaciers as solid reservoirs substantially regulate runoff abundance and depletion through peak shaving and valley filling the regulations of glaciers in hydrological cycles are crucial to the arid regions we aim to quantify the dynamics of the glaciers hydrological regulating function in the umns and umzt from 1971 to 2100 using a glacier hydrological regulation index glacier r new hydrological insights for the region our results indicate that the glacier runoff in both basins showed a decreasing trend in the past four decades and will continue decreasing in the future under three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 the umzt has a stronger regulating function of glacial runoff than the umns in contrast the tipping point of the glaciers hydrological regulating function in the umns occurred ten years earlier than in the umzt under the three ssps the glaciers hydrological regulation function on the north and south facing slopes of the tianshan mountains will show a weakening trend the weakness trend is more notable in umzt where the glaciers hydrological regulation function will decrease by 66 9 between 2061 and 2100 under ssp1 2 6 thus it sets alarm bells for the rational use of water resources in glacier covered arid regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords glacier runoff glaciers hydrological regulation cmip6 north and south facing slopes of tianshan data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cryosphere service is a scientific concept and an important research field first proposed by chinese scientists in recent years xiao et al 2015 wang et al 2019a with relevant research results published in nature in 2020 immerzeel et al 2020 as one of the functions and services of the cryosphere the hydrological regulating function of glaciers and its importance is gradually being recognized the first study on glacier regulation of streamflow was conducted in 1961 meier and tangborn 1961 the hydrological regulation of glaciers has been successively observed and confirmed in the course of hydrological studies of glacier basins in the asian himalayas european alps and the rocky mountains of north america fountain 1985 yang 1991 comeau et al 2009 immerzeel et al 2010 farinotti et al 2012 currently there is a lack of effective quantitative assessment methods for the hydrological regulation of glaciers and two crucial research progress are summarized below first the critical glacier coverage with a long lasting regulating effect on streamflow has been defined relevant studies have shown that glaciers regulate streamflow on the annual and seasonal scales through their changes and glacier covered basins are more stable than those without glaciers fountain 1985 chen and ohmura 1990 ye et al 1999 comeau et al 2009 in the saskatchewan river of the canadian rockies glaciers provide strong annual regulation of runoff when the glacier cover of the basin is greater than 3 comeau et al 2009 whereas in the major basins in western china glaciers have a solid regulating effect only when the glacier cover exceeds 5 ye et al 1999 second a static definition index was proposed to judge whether glaciers had a regulating effect on streamflow hopkinson and young proposed that whether glaciers have a regulating effect on streamflow can be judged by comparing the difference between the coefficient of variation of streamflow cb and the coefficient of variation of non glacial meltwater runoff cw hopkinson and young 1998 the advantage of this method is that it can accurately determine whether glaciers have a regulating function on streamflow in a specific basin during the study or observation period however the intensity of glacier regulation cannot be identified and the dynamics of this regulation cannot be characterized in general the research on glaciers hydrological regulating function is still at the stage of qualitative understanding the consensus is that with the accelerated shrinkage of glaciers and glacier mass losses glacier runoff increases but rapidly decreases after reaching a peak the glaciers runoff regulating function eventually weakens or disappears ye et al 2003 li et al 2015 moore et al 2020 which leads to uneven runoff and increases disaster risk in most cryosphere basins especially those in arid regions you et al 2017 li et al 2020 the modern glaciers of china are primarily found in the tianshan mountains these abundant glacier resources provide water resources for socio economic development oasis agricultural development and ecological environment protection in xinjiang deng et al 2019 due to global warming the glaciers in tianshan are generally retreating with glacier melt and continuous glacier mass loss accelerating seriously impacting streamflow regulation bolch 2007 sorg et al 2012 however current researchers on glaciers in tianshan have mainly focused on glacier mass balance ye et al 2005 liu and liu 2016 runoff simulation hagg et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2020 and the socio economic impact of glacier meltwater sorg et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 but no reports studies have been published to improve understanding the glacier runoff regulation in tianshan mountains to support water resources management to assess the glaciers hydrological regulating function we selected the upper stream of manas river basin umns on the northern slope of the tianshan mountains and the upper stream of the muzati river basin umzt on the southern slope as the study areas we defined the glacier hydrological regulation index glacier r to quantify the glacier runoff regulation function and analyzed the dynamics under three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 from 1971 to 2100 this study aims to enhance the understanding of glacier hydrological regulation functions in the tianshan mountains and to provide scientific guidance and decision support for local governments to cope with glacier changes and their impacts 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tianshan mountains in china are located at 73 30 96 06 e 39 36 45 30 n with a length of approximately 1700 km an average breadth of about 250 350 km and an average altitude of 4000 m on the ridges they are distinguished by topography that slopes from west to east fig 1 due to the influence of topography and westerly latitudinal circulation the precipitation distribution in the tian shan varies greatly with abundant precipitation in the western and northern mountainous regions averaging about 300 mm per year and sparse precipitation in the eastern and southern regions less than 150 mm the spatial temperature variation is substantial with a multi year average temperature of approximately 5 0 c the average annual temperature on the southern slopes is considerably higher than that on the northern slopes at 7 5 10 0 and 2 5 5 0 c respectively cai et al 2021 the tianshan mountains are also the origin of many rivers such as the tarim aksu manas and weigan rivers the manas river basin is located in the middle of the northern foothills of the tianshan mountains and the southern edge of the junggar basin with the terrain gently sloping from southeast to northwest the manas river with a total length of 324 km an average annual discharge of 12 95 108 m3 and a catchment area of 5156 km2 above the watershed at the kensiwate hydrological station is one of the greatest rivers in the region with the largest number and size of glaciers in the junggar inland flow area the overall climate of the basin is dry with little rain and extensive annual evaporation precipitation is primarily concentrated in the plain areas in front of the mountains with annual precipitation ranging from 110 to 200 mm mainly falling from april to august accounting for 70 2 of the average annual precipitation the annual evaporation ranges from 1500 to 2000 mm the elevation of the manas river basin is approximately 846 5138 m above 3600 m the area is covered by snow and glaciers all year round the glaciers cover 12 of the basin area while glacier meltwater and snowmelt replenish the rivers with 35 of the streamflow the muzati river flows out from the khan tengri peak at the southern foot of the tianshan mountains with a catchment area of 2653 km2 and an elevation of approximately 1884 6779 m the elevation of the watershed slopes from northwest to southeast with water vapor mainly originating from the warm and humid air currents of the atlantic and arctic oceans the basin contains 243 glaciers covering 1 28 103 km2 and accounting for 48 2 of the basin area the muzati river is one of xinjiang s rivers with the highest glacier coverage with an average annual discharge of 14 5 108 m3 the discharge of muzati river is predominantly concentrated in summer which accounts for approximately 70 of the annual runoff and is dominated by glacier meltwater in this study we selected the upstream regions of the manas and muzati river basins as typical watersheds fig 1 they both originate from snow and glacier covered areas and snow and glacier meltwater account for a large proportion of river runoff the downstream areas of these rivers are distributed with large areas of cultivated land and the selected watersheds represent the north and south slopes of the tianshan mountains 2 2 data sources we applied an extended variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrological model named vic cas zhao et al 2019 to project runoff changes in the umns and umzt we obtained daily meteorological forcing data wind speed precipitation maximum minimum and mean

information center of cma strictly controlled data quality including homogeneity checks temporal and spatial consistency tests and probable outlier rejection feng et al 2004 we collected monthly discharge data from the xinjiang hydrological bureau for the hydrological stations of kensiwate and bao chengzi from 1971 to 2013 we obtained glacier distribution data from the ﬁrst and second chinese glacier inventory http westdc westgis ac cn and soil data from the international geosphere biosphere program data and information system igbp dis https daac ornl gov we derived a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m from the geospatial data cloud of china http www gscloud cn we used the latest version of general circulation models gcms from the coupled model

employed five gcms under three ssps table 1 to project the response of hydrological processes to future climate change to downscale the selected gcms we used the quantile delta mapping qdm method cannon et al 2015 kim et al 2021 tong et al 2021 the baseline period was 1971 2013 and future daily climate data was projected from 2014 to 2100 the vic cas model has been successfully implemented in the central tianshan mountains and the muzati river zhao et al 2015 2020 we systematically assessed hydrological processes in selected catchments under three ssps using calibrated vic cas model and downscaled cmip6 climate forcing data 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 brief overview of the vic model the vic model is based on the soil vegetation atmospheric transfer scheme svats developed by experts from the universities of washington california berkeley and princeton liang et al 1996 the model simulates energy and water budgets snow melt and accumulation and soil freezing and thawing processes at daily time steps within each grid cell nijssen et al 2001 hidalgo et al 2013 hamman et al 2018 since the vic model cannot simulate glacier hydrological processes zhao et al 2015 proposed a sub gridded scheme for coupled glacier hydrological processes the model calculation units were set as sub basins the glaciers within the sub basins were divided into continuous elevation bands and the gradient method was used to sub grid the mean meteorological forcing data temperature precipitation to glacier elevation bands the enhanced degree day factor method was adopted to calculate the accumulation and ablation processes of each glacier on the elevation bands the glacier volume changes were calculated based on the annual glacier mass balance and the glacier area volume relationship v a scaling law was adopted to calculate the area changes of each glacier the detailed calculation method is described in the literature by zhao et al 2015 2019 for the first time an upgraded vic cas model was employed in the kunma like river catchment zhao et al 2015 it has been widely utilized for simulating regional hydrology processes zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 jin et al 2021 2 3 2 calibration and validation of the model we set 1961 1970 as the warming period 1971 1990 as the calibration period and 1991 2010 as the validation period the vic cas model was calibrated by the second glacier inventory dataset of china and observed monthly runoff following a two step process 1 glacier simulation calibration we used glacier data from the first chinese glacier inventory as the starting point of the simulation all glaciers in each catchment were classified into three size classes 1 km2 1 6 km2 and 6 km2 and half of the glaciers in each size class were randomly selected as model parameters ddfsnow ice the degree day factors of ice or snow and r exp the impact factor of slope ablation calibration data and the other half as validation data for each catchment the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns and relative bias er were adopted to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model on glaciers in each size class 2 runoff generation calibration the key soil parameters related to runoff the variable infiltration curve parameter b the three layer soil thickness d1 d2 d3 and parameters affecting the baseflow ds ds max and ws were calibrated against the observed monthly runoff from 1971 to 1990 for the umns and umzt nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns coefficient of determination r2 and relative bias er were employed to verify the simulation accuracy of the model the

where q obs and q sim represent the monthly observed runoff and simulated runoff respectively q obs and q sim represent the mean monthly observed runoff and simulated runoff respectively 2 3 3 trend analysis the mann kendall test mk test is a non parametric test method originally proposed by mann and kendall kendall 1975 mann 1945 and the non parametric sen s slope procedure was developed by sen 1968 the mk and sen s slope estimation tests are commonly used worldwide to analyze trends in time series in hydro meteorological variables baraer et al 2012 li et al 2022 the mk test statistic index z so called mk value conforms to the standard normal distribution if z z 1 α 2 it indicates a significant upward or downward trend in the time series values at the significance level of α given that α 0 01 then zα 2 2 58 here the mk and sen s slope estimator tests were used to analyze the trends of hydro meteorological variables in the umns and umzt 2 3 4 runoff variation coefficient hopkinson and young 1998 constructed a method to identify the role of glaciers in regulating streamflow by comparing the coefficient of variation of streamflow c b and the coefficient of variation of non glacial runoff c w using the following equation 4 c b σ b r b 5 c w σ w r w where c b is the coefficient of variation of streamflow c w is the coefficient of variation of non glacial meltwater runoff the c b minus the coefficient of variation glacial meltwater runoff σ b is the standard deviation of streamflow σ w is the standard deviation of non glacial meltwater runoff r b is the mean value of streamflow and r w is the mean value of non glacial meltwater runoff if c b c w glaciers have a regulating effect on watershed runoff 2 3 5 glacier hydrology regulation index based on the above formula we defined the glacier hydrology regulation index glacier r to characterize the intensity of the regulation function provided by glaciers we analyzed the dynamics of the hydrological runoff regulation function of glaciers by using the decadal division method with the following equation 6 glacier r c b c w where glacier r is the glacier hydrology regulation index a smaller glacier r value indicates that glacial runoff has a stronger hydrology regulation ability and vice versa 3 results 3 1 comparison of observed runoff with simulated runoff fig 2 compares the monthly observed and simulated streamflow for the calibration and validation periods the simulation efficiency of the umns was excellent fig 2a with a mean ns value of 0 89 the r2 value of 0 91 and er value of 2 69 for the calibration period and 0 89 0 91 and 3 80 for the validation period respectively we also obtained excellent results for the umzt fig 2b with a mean ns value of 0 96 the r2 value of 0 96 and er value of 0 61 for the calibration period and 0 94 0 96 and 1 41 for the validation period respectively the results of the vic cas model for the calibration and validation periods are consistent with the previous study zhao et al 2020 3 2 variations in climate variables fig 3 displays the past and future annual precipitation and temperature variations in the umns and umzt we used the mk test method to evaluate the time series trend characteristics for 1971 2100 table 2 presents the climate variables mk values and rates of change slope or s during the historical period the annual precipitation on the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains both showed an increasing trend fig 3a g the annual precipitation in the umns and umzt increased at an average rate of 18 38 mm 10a and 21 36 mm 10a respectively meanwhile the annual temperature in the umns and umzt also showed an increasing trend fig 3d j the average annual temperature increase rates in the two basins were 0 32 10a and 0 41 10a respectively the precipitation and temperature showed a significant rising trend in the umns and umzt with mk values of 2 85 3 24 and 2 24 4 95 respectively table 2 fig 3 also indicates that precipitation and temperature on the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains show an increasing trend under three scenarios at the end of the 21st century table 2 shows the projected rates of increase in precipitation and temperature for the umns and umzt during 2014 2100 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios the precipitation and temperature increasing rates in the umns and umzt range from 2 53 to 3 5 mm 10a 0 15 0 64 10a and from 4 8 to 11 43 mm 10a 0 15 0 68 10a respectively the temperature in the umns and umzt shows a significant increasing trend with a confidence level of 0 01 table 2 3 3 variations in streamflow and glacial runoff 3 3 1 interannual variations the past and future annual variations of streamflow in the two basins differed fig 4 during the historical period the annual streamflow change rates of the umns and umzt were 0 97 108 m3 10a and 0 09 108 m3 10a respectively table 2 under the three ssps the annual streamflow in the umns shows a decreasing trend fig 4a c and the rate of streamflow decrease ranges from 0 11 108 m3 10a to 0 38 108 m3 10a table 2 the annual streamflow in the umzt shows a decreasing trend under the ssp1 2 6 scenario fig 4g and the decreasing rate of streamflow is 0 23 108 m3 10a however the annual streamflow of the umzt shows a slightly increasing trend under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios fig 4h i from 1971 2100 the annual glacier runoff on the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains both showed a decreasing trend fig 4d f j l during the historical period the decreasing rate of glacier runoff was 0 14 108 m3 10a and 0 75 108 m3 10a respectively table 2 under the three ssps the glacier runoff of the umzt decreases rapidly and the decreasing rate of glacier runoff is more than twice that of the umns the glacier runoff in the umns and umzt shows a significant decreasing trend with a confidence level of 0 01 table 2 3 3 2 interdecadal variations the streamflow in the umns increased by 24 6 from 11 22 108 m3 in the 1970 s to 13 98 108 m3 in the 2000 s fig 5 however glacier runoff in the basin decreased by 16 9 from 2 87 108 m3 in the 1970 s to 2 37 108 m3 in the 2000 s compared to the 1970 2000 s streamflow in the umns decreases by 3 0 1 5 and 6 0 while glacier runoff decreases by 23 5 23 3 and 21 7 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively from 2021 to 2060 from 2061 2100 streamflow decreases by 6 9 8 9 and 17 6 and glacier runoff decreases by 44 1 44 3 and 47 7 under the three ssps respectively the results showed that the tipping point of glacier runoff in the umns occurred in the 2010 s 2011 2020 the streamflow in the umzt showed a decreasing trend fig 6 from 15 05 108 m3 in the 1970 s to 13 85 108 m3 in the 2000 s with a decrease rate of 8 glacier runoff decreased from 11 30 108 m3 in the 1970 s to 8 62 108 m3 in the 2000 s with a decrease rate of 23 7 compared to the 1970 2000 s streamflow in the umzt decreases by 4 5 4 1 and 1 5 and glacier runoff decreases by 17 1 16 7 and 12 4 under the three ssps respectively from 2021 to 2060 from 2061 2100 streamflow decreases by 13 1 4 9 and 2 0 and glacier runoff decreases by 32 9 26 4 and 21 4 for the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively the projection results showed that the tipping point of glacial runoff in the umzt also occurred in the 2010 s in summary the interdecadal streamflow variations in the umns and umzt differed but glacier runoff in the two basins showed a decreasing trend under the three ssps streamflow and glacier runoff in the umns and umzt exhibit decreasing trends with glacier runoff decreasing more 3 4 variations in glacier hydrological regulation function 3 4 1 overall variations during the historical period 1971 2010 glaciers hydrological regulation functions on the north and south slopes of the tianshan mountains differed fig 7 in general the glaciers hydrological regulation functions of the umzt were stronger than those of the umns the glacier hydrological regulation index glacier r of the umzt and umns was 0 30 and 0 78 respectively in the future the hydrological regulation functions of glaciers in the two basins will decrease at the end of the 21st century fig 7 from 2021 2060 the glacier r of the umzt and umns will be 0 46 and 0 82 for ssp1 2 6 respectively compared with the historical period 1971 2010 the hydrological regulation functions of glaciers in the umzt and umns will decrease by 52 1 and 5 8 respectively for ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 the glaciers hydrological regulation functions in the two basins will decrease by 53 6 54 9 and 7 0 3 0 respectively compared with the historical period the hydrological regulation function of glaciers on the north and south slope basins of the tianshan mountains will further decrease from 2061 through 2100 for ssp1 2 6 the decrease in the hydrological regulation function of glaciers will be 66 9 and 10 5 in the umzt and umns respectively for ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 the glaciers hydrological regulation functions in the two basins will decrease by 58 6 57 0 and 8 8 14 0 respectively in conclusion we reveal that the hydrological regulation role of glaciers in the north and south slope basins of the tianshan mountains will vary differently during the periods of 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 the hydrological regulation function of glaciers on the south slope of the tianshan mountains will be decreased by 52 1 66 9 under the three ssps while that on the north slope only will be reduced by 3 0 14 0 the hydrological regulating function of glaciers on the south slope of the tianshan mountains is more potent than that on the north slope the significant decrease in the hydrological regulating function of glaciers on the south slope may significantly weaken their role in regulating streamflow in the future 3 4 2 interdecadal variations to analyze the dynamics of glaciers hydrological regulation function on the north and south facing slopes of the tianshan mountains we divided ten years as a period to calculate the glacier r and analyzed the interdecadal changes in the hydrological regulation function provided by glaciers from the 1970 s to the 2090 s in detail from the 1970 s to the 2090 s the glaciers hydrological regulating function in the umns and umzt showed a weakening trend fig 8 the glaciers had a powerful regulatory function in the umns from the 1970 s to the 2010 s fig 8a in the 1970 s glaciers had the strongest regulatory function in the umns with a glacier r of 0 47 it then gradually weakened and reached its minimum value in the 1990 s although its regulation function rebounded in the 2000 s and 2010 s it was still lower than in the 1970 s and 1980 s the hydrological regulating function of the glaciers in the umns will continue to decrease under the three ssps from the 2010 s to the 2090 s fig 8a however the regulating function of the glaciers in the umzt has remained in an intense phase fig 8b with the strongest function occurring in the 1980 s with a glacier r of 0 19 although its regulation ability weakened after the 1980 s the glacier r in the umzt still ranged from 0 37 to 0 55 under the three ssps indicating that the regulating function remained strong the tipping point of glacier runoff regulation also differs fig 8 shows that from the 1970 s to the 2090 s the 1970 s was the period of the strongest hydrological regulating function of glaciers in the umns for the umzt it occurred in the 1980 s the tipping point of glaciers hydrological regulation functions in the umns appeared ten years earlier than in the umzt the tipping points that occurred at different periods in the two basins are associated with the different scales of glacier area and rates of temperature increase zhang et al 2016 ding et al 2020 in the umns and umzt the proportion of glacier area to basin area is 12 and 48 respectively in addition the proportion of small scale glacier area is more extensive in the umns than in the umzt in summary the hydrological regulating functions of glaciers in the umns and umzt are weakening and the 1970 2010 s are the period of the strongest glaciers regulating function under the three ssps the hydrological regulation function of glaciers in the two basins will be significantly weakened by the end of the 21st century due to the different characteristics and scales of glaciers the umns and umzt show some differences in the variations of glaciers regulation functions overall the hydrology regulation function of glaciers is more potent in the umzt on the south slope and weaker in the umns on the north slope 3 4 3 seasonality variations fig 9 shows the seasonal variations of hydrological regulation provided by glaciers in the umns and umzt the glaciers hydrological regulating role of the umns was mainly concentrated in june september and was stronger in summer june august with glacier r between 0 68 and 0 73 the glaciers had the strongest hydrological regulation function in august with a glacier r of 0 68 however the regulation function of the glaciers in the umzt was primarily concentrated in april october and stronger in may august with a glacier r ranging from 0 30 to 0 45 the maximum value of glacier r was 0 30 in july under the three ssps the hydrological regulation of glaciers in the two basins will mainly concentrate in april october may september will be the period of stronger hydrological regulation functioning of glaciers in general the glaciers hydrological regulating function in the north and south slope basins of the tianshan mountains will tend to weaken within the year fig 9b d compared with the historical period the hydrological regulation function of glaciers in the summer in the umzt and umns will substantially decrease under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 from 2021 to 2060 with a decreasing rate of 12 7 2 9 12 7 2 9 and 14 1 5 7 respectively from 2061 2100 the hydrological regulation functions of glaciers in the two basins will decrease by 14 1 17 1 14 1 11 4 and 25 4 8 6 in the summer respectively 4 discussion the interannual variations of streamflow and glacier flow in the umns and umzt were analyzed in the study our results indicated that the streamflow in the umns showed an increasing trend which showed a slightly decreasing trend in the umzt and the glacier flow in the two basins showed a decreasing trend during the historical period similar studies were reported in other studies in the manas river basin wang et al 2019b ding et al 2020 and muzati river basin zhao et al 2020 our results also indicated that the variations of glaciers hydrological regulation in the umns and umzt were different and the reasons were analyzed as follows first the contribution rates of glacier runoff are different between the two basins during the baseline period 1971 2013 the contribution rate of annual glacier flow in the umns and umzt was 23 24 and 65 55 respectively fig 10 in the early studies by luo et al 2013 and wang et al 2019 the annual glacier flow contribution in the manas river basin was 25 and 27 respectively a similar study was employed in the muzati river basin by zhao et al 2020 the annual glacier flow contribution was 66 6 thus the different contribution rates of glacier runoff in the two basins may lead to different changes in the glaciers hydrological regulation second the streamflow components of the two basins are different the streamflow is dominated by snowmelt and glacier runoff in the umns and snow meltwater accounts for a more considerable proportion conversely glacier meltwater provides the majority of streamflow recharge in the umzt sorg et al 2012 liu et al 2020 finally the climate differs between the basins due to global warming the temperature in the tianshan mountains has increased since the 1970 s as has glacier instability ding et al 2019 the average annual temperature on the south facing slope of the tianshan mountains is approximately 2 c higher than that on the north facing slope chen et al 2017 luo et al 2013 found that glacier meltwater was positively correlated to temperature variation with an r2 value of 0 70 and statistical significance of p 0 001 in the tianshan mountains the difference in temperature change is an essential reason for glaciers hydrological regulation in the umns and umzt the role of glacier meltwater in streamflow reduction and replenishment is crucial pritchard 2019 which will have profound effects on inland river basins in arid regions li et al 2010 chen et al 2015 2016 however no studies have yet focused on the glaciers runoff regulation in the tianshan mountains to support water resources management thus we defined glacier r based on the coefficient of variation method however the method has limitations as it only considers streamflow and glacier runoff and the method does not reflect the interannual variations in future studies the temperature and precipitation in the glacier area need to be considered to correctly characterize the runoff regulation function of glaciers and approximate their real state 5 conclusions we used the glacier r to analyze past and future variations of the glaciers hydrological regulation by simulating glacier runoff and streamflow data with the vic cas model our results suggest that the annual precipitation and temperature in the northern and southern slopes of the tianshan mountains show an increasing trend from 1971 to 2100 while glacier runoff from the umns and umzt show a decreasing trend during the historical period and under the three ssps under ssp1 2 6 glacier runoff of the umns and umzt will reduce by 32 9 and 44 1 respectively from 2061 to 2100 the glacier hydrological regulation is higher in the umzt and lower in the umns in terms of overall variability and the regulatory functions of glaciers in the two basins will substantially weaken by the end of the 21st century under ssp1 2 6 the glaciers hydrological regulating functions in the umzt and umns will decrease by 66 9 and 10 5 respectively between 2061 and 2100 in terms of interdecadal variation the tipping points of the glaciers hydrological regulating functions in the umns and umzt occurred in the 1970 s and the 1980 s respectively summer june august was the period of the strongest hydrological regulation provided by glaciers in the north and south slope basins of the tianshan mountains glacier meltwater is essential to glacier covered arid regions our results suggest that the glaciers hydrological regulation role in the north and south slope basins of tianshan mountains will continue to decline in the future thus the incidence of extreme hydrological events triggered by glacier changes will be high zappa and kan 2007 liu et al 2021 these changes will extensively and profoundly impact the sustainable use of water resources oasis ecological and environmental security and sustainable socioeconomic development in arid areas to cope with the risk of water scarcity resulting from glacier retreat effective actions must be taken including enhancing the efficiency of irrigation water usage in

7883,study region atlas mountains located in morocco study focus mountainous regions constitute an area of water production while water is used in downstream plains in central morocco the atlas mountains represent the most important water supply in the country the solid part of precipitation forms seasonal snowpack snowmelt is important for the water supply for different uses in neighbouring plains accurate knowledge of snow water equivalent is key information needed by policy makers to help design and implement appropriate allocation strategies for water resource management the objective of this paper is to provide a summary of our research activities on snow hydrology in the atlas mountains during the past twenty years the approach combines in situ measurements remote sensing and modeling new hydrological insights for the region following a description of the context of the moroccan atlas mountains and the experimental network an overview of the main results obtained is presented the characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover the impact of the north atlantic oscillation on the snow covered area the snowmelt contribution to the flows of the atlas rivers the contribution of snowmelt to surface and groundwater recharge and the quantification of climate change impacts on snow and associated runoff from the atlas mountains we also present challenges and future research perspectives within this topic graphical abstract ga1 keywords snow hydrology remote sensing snowpack semiarid areas moroccan atlas mountains 1 introduction in semiarid and arid areas sustainable water resource management requires precise quantification of surface and groundwater variability zaidi et al 2020 in many semiarid catchments the hydrological cycle is influenced by the presence of a mountain range which enhances precipitation fayad et al 2017 mankin et al 2015 the high elevation of mountainous regions constitutes an area of water production while water is used in the downstream plains mainly for irrigation in the upper catchment areas the solid part of precipitation is important and forms a seasonal snowpack where water is stored during winter meltwater runoff feeds river stream flows refills reservoirs and contributes to the recharge of aquifers later in the spring the buffer effect played by snowpack is essential for the agricultural sector particularly for crops whose water needs peak during the dry and hot period in summer since the pioneering work of giorgi and lionello 2008 several studies have pointed out the mediterranean as a hot spot of climate change associated with a 2 3 c temperature rise and a drop in precipitation of approximately 20 30 the impact of these projected changes on water resources and the agricultural sector could lead to dramatic social instability because of the low adaptative capacity of north african countries schilling et al 2020 concerning snowfall a warming climate could be associated with 1 a drastic drop in the water amount held in the snowpack through a change in partition between rainfall and snowfall as already observed in morocco simonneaux et al 2008 2 a potential increase in the water lost through sublimation boudhar et al 2016 and finally 3 a shift in the timing of the water discharge that could peak earlier in the season the latter effect could even jeopardize high value added crops such as citrus apples and olives that are fostered by different agricultural policies in the region berbel et al 2013 in addition with the potential shift in terms of the snow melting the rules of water allocation adopted by the managers for decades will probably need to be strongly modified in central morocco which is characterized by an arid to semiarid climate the atlas mountains represent the most important water supply in the country and contribute significantly to socioeconomic development fig 1 given the high elevations of the atlas which reaches 4167 m a s l precipitation occurs in the form of rain and snow due to the orographic effect the average annual precipitation in the plains is low and varies between 150 and 250 mm while this annual amount can exceed 800 mm in the highest regions with a significant portion falling as snow i e between 20 and 80 boudhar et al 2009 therefore these mountain ranges can be considered as the water tower of morocco that provides freshwater for the large downstream arid plains snowmelt is extremely important for the water supply for different uses especially irrigation which is responsible for more than 85 of available water uptake fao 2016 jarlan et al 2015 khabba et al 2013 as such accurate knowledge of snow water equivalent swe is key information needed by policy makers to help design and implement appropriate allocation strategies for water resource management this information helps to better plan the distribution of water for downstream irrigators by hydraulic basin agency managers and agriculture departments who are in charge of monitoring atlasic river discharge and managing water in the low land watersheds surrounding the moroccan atlas mountains on the other hand snow cover is highly vulnerable to climate change especially given the evidence that atmospheric warming increases with elevation in the mediterranean mountains kotlarski et al 2015 moucha et al 2021 pepin et al 2015 it is expected that climate change will reduce the available swe in the future giorgi and lionello 2008 lópez moreno et al 2017 marchane et al 2017 schilling et al 2012 tramblay et al 2020 in addition rising temperatures may shift the annual peak flow due to snowmelt occurring earlier in the hydrologic year potentially compromising the supply of irrigation water to downstream areas in late spring therefore studying climate change impacts on water resources for the atlas mountains is necessary to develop adaptation strategies for managing water hssaisoune et al 2020 marchane et al 2017 2015 ground measurements provide reliable information on snowpack properties but their spatial representativity is difficult to characterize in remote mountain areas given that hydroclimatic and snow conditions in the mountainous environments are extremely heterogeneous in both space and time boudhar et al 2011 ouatiki et al 2017 vieira et al 2017 with regards to the sparsity of the in situ network limited to snow research stations snow studies in morocco have often relied upon remote sensing usually used jointly with modeling tools taking advantage of the specific optical properties of snow high visible and low mid infrared reflectance properties many studies have used optical remote sensing in particular to estimate the distribution of snow covered areas scas from different satellite sensors with various spatial and temporal resolutions bouamri et al 2021 boudhar et al 2007 2009 2010 2011 2014 chaponnière et al 2005 marchane et al 2013 2015 boudhar 2009 hanich et al 2003 additionally different modeling approaches have been developed point scale semi distributed and distributed approaches to estimate swe and snowmelt from the point scale to the basin scale baba et al 2019 2018a 2018b bouamri et al 2018 2021 boudhar et al 2009 2016 schulz and de jong 2004 other studies have integrated snowmelt models into hydrological models to simulate streamflow boudhar et al 2009 hajhouji et al 2018 this paper aims to provide a summary of our research activities on snow hydrology in the atlas mountains in the recent years these different activities have been carried out within the frame of the research program sudmed project 2002 2011 chehbouni et al 2008 the young team associated with ird jeai cremas 2006 2009 and the joint international laboratory lmi trema 2011 2020 jarlan et al 2015 to understand snowpack processes and their influences on the basin hydrological response our scientific approach was focused on the joint use of in situ measurements remote sensing of snow and modeling by taking into consideration the sparsity of ground based networks this approach has evolved with the development of space technology leading to freely available and increasingly precise data in terms of spatial and temporal resolution in terms of modeling this increased amount of data together with the improvement of the resolution and accuracy of the meteorological forcing enabled a switch toward more physically based approaches in contrast with the conceptual modeling tools that were implemented in early studies this synthesis of the research results is useful science advancement is intimately related to the availability of new data in hydrological science as well as in other environmental sciences the availability of new data is a driver of change of paradigm both with regard to science and to management and ultimately to policy development in this regard our research objectives fall under several of the unsolved problems in hydrology identified in the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology initiative of the iahs international association of hydrological sciences blöschl et al 2019 such as how will cold region runoff and groundwater change in a warmer climate what are the mechanisms by which climate change and water use alter ephemeral rivers and groundwater in semi arid regions why how and when do rain on snow events produce exceptional runoff how can we use innovative technologies to measure surface and subsurface properties states and fluxes at a range of spatial and temporal scales how can we disentangle and reduce model structural parameter input uncertainty in hydrological prediction blöschl et al 2019 following a description of the context of the moroccan atlas mountains and the in situ measurements of different hydrologic and climatic variables this paper presents an overview of the results obtained concerning 1 the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover by remote sensing 2 the impact of the north atlantic oscillation nao on the snow covered area of the main watersheds 3 the snowmelt contribution to the flows of the atlas rivers using different modeling approaches 4 the contribution of snowmelt to surface and groundwater recharge using snow isotopes and 5 the quantification of climate change impacts on snow and associated runoff from the atlas mountains we also present future challenges and some future research perspectives on this topic 2 moroccan atlas mountain context the atlas mountain range stretches over 700 kilometers along a west southwest to east northeast axis with a width of 70 kilometers fig 1 it forms in the center of morocco a barrier between the mediterranean sea in northern morocco and the sahara it is made up of seven watersheds with a mixed influence of rainfall and snowmelt and it is subdivided into three physiographic units the anti atlas the high atlas and the middle atlas the seven watersheds are the draa and souss located in the anti atlas with altitudes varying between 1500 and 2000 m a s l the tensift oum er bia and ziz rheris located within the high atlas chain are the highest unit with altitudes exceeding 4000 m a s l and the sebou and moulouya located in the middle atlas 3 experimental and in situ measurements within the frame of the tensift climate and water observatory measurements of hydrological parameters and processes in the high atlas were focused on the rheraya watershed located south of marrakech with altitudes ranging from 1000 to 4167 m a s l toubkal summit the highest peak in north africa the basin covers an area of 228 km2 with snow present at least three months per year at an elevation above 3000 m starting in 2002 a network of five automatic weather stations recording temperature air humidity wind speed solar radiation and rainfall at a 30 mn time step was progressively installed four additional sites record only rainfall fig 1 fig 2 and table 1 these meteorological data are used either directly to force hydrological models or to check the quality of reanalysis satellite precipitation datasets or weather forecasts which are increasingly used in modeling to monitor snow cover two of five stations include a geonor total precipitation gauge since 2013 namely the toubkal refuge site at 3200 m a s l and the oukaimeden summit at 3250 m a s l the latter site has also included a snow height measurement sensor since 2003 the snow density was measured periodically between 2007 and 2016 around the oukaimeden station located on a plateau with altitudes between 3150 and 3250 m a s l during each campaign a transect of 10 15 points was sampled measuring for each point the snow height and the snow weight sampled with a tube from which the density was calculated finally daily minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and fresh snowfall depth were continuously observed from 1989 to 2009 by the keeper of the oukaimeden caf refuge 2650 m a s l which is highly valuable thanks to its record length and consistency with to our knowledge no equivalent in the region finally soil moisture has also been observed at the aremd site 1950 m a s l since 2013 six sensors ml2 theta probes from delta t continuously recorded the soil moisture at 5 and 40 cm depths for three points located at 10 m from each other on a slope of approximately 30 covered with degraded rangeland typical from this area additionally moisture and temperature sensors were installed in 2019 at the oukaimeden site at 10 30 and 60 cm depths 3 campbell cs215 probes fig 2 river flow measurements at the outlet of the main subbasins of the high atlas mountains have been collected since the 1960 s or 1970 s by the tensift hydraulic basin agency abht these runoff estimates are obtained from water heights observed manually three times a day 8 h 12 h and 18 h by station keepers with more frequent observations during flood events frequency is left to the station keeper to capture the quick variations in runoff typical of wadis these heights are converted into daily runoff using gauging curves determined by manual gauging achieved every month using a current meter through the riverbed section the gauging curves are updated each time a strong flow event modifies the river cross section these runoff measurements are used to calibrate or validate the snowmelt and runoff models 4 remote sensing of snow cover area regarding the climate aridity of the moroccan atlas zone processes governing the state of snowpack and its evolution are extremely variable both in space e g exposition control photo 1 and in time and snow can fall and melt within one week boudhar et al 2009 2007 chaponnière et al 2005 hanich et al 2003 to take into consideration the parameters controlling these changes it is recommended to acquire snow and climate information ideally at a high temporal and spatial resolution the lack of in situ measurements led us to use remote sensing especially optical remote sensing to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover over the atlas mountains we focused on optical remote sensing since the specific optical properties of snow high visible and low medium infrared reflectance properties provide an accurate means to derive the snow cover area e g using the ndsi the normalized difference snow index dozier 1989 hall et al 2001 salomonson and appel 2004 4 1 snow cover area of five subwatersheds of the tensift catchment using the spot vegetation product in early works we developed an approach that combines data derived from two types of instruments low spatial and high temporal resolution spot vegetation daily revisit time and pixel size of 1 km2 and high spatial and low temporal resolution landsat tm 16 days revisit time and 30 m pixel size the approach consisted of calibrating a pixel based relationship between a low resolution multispectral index and a high resolution snow cover area to derive the subpixel snow cover fraction at low resolution this relationship was then applied to a series of spot vegetation images covering the 1998 2005 period over five subwatersheds of the tensift catchment within the high atlas to map the snow cover area boudhar et al 2010 2009 2007 chaponnière et al 2005 hanich et al 2003 a long time series of sca covering the 1998 2005 period was generated for the five subbasin of the tensift catchment boudhar et al 2010 2009 2007 these studies highlighted the strong heterogeneity of seasonal and interannual sca from one basin to another related to the altitudinal and exposition effects indeed the snowfall period calculated from the date of appearance of snow surfaces until its disappearance is very variable the onset of the snow season fluctuates between the end of september and the end of december while the last snowfall events were recorded between the end of january and the beginning of april the minimum snow cover altitudes are approximately 1400 m for wet seasons compared to 1800 m for dry seasons based on a similar methodology a modified normalized difference snow index mndsi boudhar et al 2009 was proposed to derive the sca the scatter plots in fig 3 shows the correlation between spot vegetation and modis sca fractions over the mountain part of the tensift river basin during the 2003 2004 snow season this date by date intercomparison reveals the high correlation between the two products with an average r² coefficient of 0 84 and rmse of 1 29 4 2 snow cover area over the atlas mountains using the modis product 4 2 1 snow cover variability the freely distributed snow product collection provided by the national snow and ice data center derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis observations hall et al 2001 was assessed in the rapidly changing snow cover of the atlas with an overall accuracy of 89 this product was found to be appropriate to characterize the high dynamics of snowpack in the arid to semiarid context of the moroccan atlas mountains thanks to its spatial resolution 500 m and its short revisit time 1 day jarlan et al 2015 marchane et al 2015 2013 nevertheless it is revealed that this low spatial resolution product is not efficient in capturing the local variability of the snow extent related to the terrain aspect effect induced by solar radiation bouamri et al 2021 the high accuracy of this product above 80 snow detection for cloud free images was highlighted by several studies gascoin et al 2015 hall and riggs 2007 klein and barnett 2003 parajka and blöschl 2006 but they also pointed out two main weaknesses 1 the monitoring of snow may be very sporadic in areas with high cloudiness 2 due to a close spectral signature in the visible domain a misclassification between snow and clouds may lead to up to 12 false positives snow detected but not present and up to 15 sca overestimation within this context a spatiotemporal filter aiming to increase the number of usable images and to improve the snow cloud classification adapted from gafurov and bárdossy 2009 and gafurov parajka and blöschl 2006 for semiarid snow cover was developed by marchane et al 2015 the filter reduces the number of pixels identified as a cloud correctly or not by 96 over the atlas mountain range the corrected products were also assessed against five in situ automatic snow depth stations and a series of 19 snow cover maps derived from formosat 2 images acquired during winter 2009 over the high atlas in the tensift catchment regarding the good accuracy of the corrected products they have been used 1 to characterize the snow cover variability in seven catchments covering the moroccan atlas mountain range and 2 to assess the spatiotemporal trends using a mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 of snow cover areas at the scale of all moroccan catchments with snow rain functioning to assess the spatial variability of the snow cover dynamics in morocco the time series of snow cover areas at the catchment level were grouped using cluster analysis the analysis identified three groups fig 1 the first group moulouya oum erbia and sebou gathers the northern catchments whereas the second group tensift souss draa is located in the southern part finally group 3 isolates the last catchment ziz rheris located in the southeastern part of the at las chain fig 4 the dynamics of sca in the three groups are characterized by high interannual variability with a variation coefficient of the maximum sca equal to 41 25 and 77 for groups 1 2 and 3 respectively group 2 is dominated by high altitudes which explains the value of the coefficient of variation cv while the cv of group 3 can be explained by solar radiation which is the highest compared to the other groups the inter and intra annual variability is extremely high both in terms of maximum and total snow cover as well as in terms of event distribution and season length fig 5 shows in particular the strong seasonal dynamics of snow cover at the scale of the whole moroccan atlas additionally the number of snow events is limited and there are periods of almost complete ablation even at the scale of the whole massif and in the middle of winter 2002 2003 season in particular in terms of interannual variability the maximum snow cover area varies from 13 433 km² for the 2013 2014 season to 42 000 km² for the 2004 2005 season which induces significant consequences on water availability in spring similarly the date of seasonal maximum snow cover also shows high variability from one year to another with an occurrence in mid december for the 2006 2007 season and up to mid march for the 2001 2002 and 2010 2011 seasons finally to assess the trend of the snowy days a 2 month period was chosen here following brown and mote 2009 who showed that the duration of snow cover was the most climate sensitive variable the analysis of the trend maps fig 6 led to the following remarks at the start of the season in october november a general increasing trend was observed for most of the region 77 of the pixels with a few scattered spatial patterns mainly located on the north side of the atlas where a decrease was detected nevertheless these observations should be analyzed with caution as only 7 9 of the pixels passed the mann kendall test in december january there is no evidence of strong long term trends that would impact the entire region nonetheless there is a clear trend toward a decrease in the duration of snowfall that passes the mann kendall test in the southern part of the study area in the souss and tensift basins in february march the increasing trend is significant over the region 96 4 of the pixels among which 36 8 showed a positive and significant trend most of these pixels are located at high altitudes 53 1 of the area above 2500 m above sea level shows a significant increase in snow duration for pixels where the trend is significant the median slope is 5 8 days 10 years and it is even above 9 7 days 10 years for 10 of the pixels finally april may is the only period where the downward trend dominates the region with 68 8 of the area but only 11 5 passes the mann kendall test most of this observed drop was detected below 2500 m altitude with 76 1 of the pixels below this altitude showing a downward trend 15 1 is significant the slopes of 11 5 of the pixels with a significant trend are much weaker with a median value of 2 1 days 10 years even if the observed trends are not for most pixels statistically significant in the long term the spatial consistency of the results suggests an increasing trend in the duration of snow cover in february and march mainly impacting areas of high altitude above 2500 m and to a lesser extent a slight decrease in the duration of snow cover in april and may although not significant the decrease affects 76 1 of areas below 2500 m the observed increase of sca during february march marchane et al 2015 is corroborated by the negative trend of december february nao not shown observed during the period of study 2000 2013 this means that an extension to the recent years after 2015 characterized by mainly positive nao during winter could turn this positive sca trend into a decrease of sca the advent of sentinel 2 opens new avenues in the monitoring of snow cover area in the atlas sentinel 2 provides 20 meter resolution multispectral images with only five days of revisit time in contrast to 16 days for landsat 8 similar to modis and vegetation the snow cover area can easily be distinguished from snow free areas and clouds using the ndsi the theia land data centre provides operational snow products for a large region of the atlas mountains gascoin et al 2019 4 2 2 impact of the north atlantic oscillation nao on the snow covered area the north atlantic oscillation nao has long been known to be the main climatic pseudooscillation impacting winter precipitation in the euro mediterranean region over morocco lamb and peppler 1987 showed for the first time a strong negative correlation between winter precipitation december april and nao from december february the daily series of the corrected snow covered area products were synthesized using seasonal indicators the maximum snow covered area scamax the sum of total snow covered areas scasum the average of the snow covered areas scamean and the dates of maximum snow cover that were related to the north atlantic oscillation through simple lagged correlations marchane et al 2016 highlighting for the first time the linkages between snow cover and nao in western north africa as a preliminary step the relationships between precipitation and air temperature and nao were revisited precipitation and air temperature were obtained from 17 meteorological stations from the synoptic network between 1993 and 2011 and from the ncep reanalysis national center for environmental prediction reanalysis in line with previous studies winter precipitation in morocco appeared to be inversely related to the nao excluding the inland stations located southwestern midelt er rachidia and ouarzazate and in the mediterranean area al hoceima and nouasseur stations as expected the correlation decreased significantly after february a negative correlation is demonstrated with temperature which means that the negative positive phase of the nao preferentially leads to a temperature higher than normal lower than normal this could be attributed to the increased advection of air from the warm ocean during the negative phase by contrast with the nao precipitation correlation two significant differences can be highlighted for the nao temperature linkage 1 the correlation is significant inland even on the southern slope of the atlas the stations of er rachidia and midelt in february show a negative correlation of 0 67 and 0 56 respectively 2 the negative correlation remains later in the season in april all the southern stations show very high negative values and a spatial pattern of negative correlation over the same area is also very marked for the ncep reanalysis concerning snow indicators no significant correlation was found between nao and the start date of the snow season the main striking results are a positive correlation significant at the 95 level for the duration of the snow season and the date of complete ablation which means that a positive negative nao is favorable for a longer shorter season fig 7 this is consistent with the correlation between the nao in march and the air temperature in april at the end of the season stated differently milder temperatures during the negative phases of the nao promote earlier snow clearing additionally this emphasizes the dominant influence of temperature anomalies on the snowpack induced by the nao rather than an effect of precipitation which turned out to be weak beyond the winter months and which moreover would imply a negative correlation a positive correlation is also found with the average sca in april may and to a lesser extent in december january these correlations also support a dominant effect of temperature 1 the sign of the correlation is positive if the effect of the rains were dominant a negative sign would have been expected 2 a significant correlation is demonstrated for the whole atlas including the area located south of the atlas mountains in agreement with the spatial pattern of the correlation between nao and temperature which covers the whole country and 3 the correlation is significant even at the end of the season when the correlation between precipitation and nao has disappeared 5 snowmelt hydrology modeling to estimate the snowpack state e g snow height hs snow water equivalent swe melt and sublimation different modeling approaches have been evaluated as follows point scale which consists of modeling the snowpack evolution at a particular point generally this point is the location of the weather station that provides meteorological data we used an energy balance model to monitor the different processes of energy and mass balance of the snowpack at the oukaimeden 3200 m a s l automatic weather station from 2003 to 2004 2009 2010 bouamri et al 2018 boudhar et al 2016 the objective of this approach is to test the efficiency of various melting models and examine the physical processes affecting the evolution of snowpack notably the inversion of turbulent fluxes and the sublimation rate semidistributed modeling consists of dividing the basin into different units that are supposed to have the same characteristics e g altitudes many studies have highlighted the importance of semidistributed models in mountain hydrology douglas mankin et al 2010 fontaine et al 2002 grusson et al 2015 rahman et al 2013 for that we evaluated the performance of integrated snowmelt models on some subwatersheds of the tensift catchment through the high atlas range to simulate streamflow boudhar et al 2009 hajhouji et al 2018 the objective of this approach consists of a simple spatialization that makes it possible to consider the first order factors governing the dynamic of the snowpack in particular altitude distributed modeling the study area is divided into a regular grid where each grid cell has its own characteristics e g altitude slope orientation this approach was used for the simulation of the snow water equivalent evolution in the high atlas baba et al 2019 2018a 2018b bouamri et al 2021 this approach allows the use of 3d methods that consider fine scale variations in radiative and turbulent heat fluxes in the landscape 5 1 modeling at the point scale snowpack modeling in dry mountainous environments is an issue since many processes can interact while little is known about each process taken separately the separation between melt and sublimation or evaporation is particularly important in those environments a comparative study of snowmelt modeling approaches varying from simple to physically based models was carried out by boudhar et al 2009 using automatic data recorded at the oukaimden aws 3200 m a s l and ground measurements sampled in the vicinity of the same site first the simplified degree day approach has been evaluated with a focus on how the ddf degree day factor methodology influences simulations of swe in this regard three formulations i e those from kuusisto 1980 and martinec 1960 and the radiative approach of brubaker et al 1996 were considered to simulate ddf for snowmelt quantification the calibration procedure was carried out using field observations acquired during the snow season 2007 2008 however the other seasons 2003 2004 2004 2005 and 2005 2006 were used for the validation phase for physically based modeling the isba es model boone 2000 was applied to analyze different snowpack processes from the 2003 2004 2009 2010 snow seasons the results show interannual variation in snow water equivalent swe observed and simulated using isba es and the three degree day models all models efficiently simulate the variation in swe over the calibration season during the validation period the martinec model cannot simulate swe efficiently during the season while the brubaker and kuustisto models provide a better simulation in all seasons with a correlation coefficient more than 0 8 and bias between 13 mm to 2 32 mm the use of the isba es model at the oukaimden site during four seasons shows that most of the snow ablation is due to the melting process however a significant proportion of water losses are caused by sublimation the melting process is generally characterized by the sudden release of water in short periods concomitant with the increase in air temperature however the sublimation process occurs regularly throughout the season and can reach 38 of the total ablation depending on the year a simple approach based on a simple energy balance equation forced by all available measurements radiative budget surface temperature etc was implemented by boudhar et al 2016 to monitor the different processes of energy and mass balance of the snowpack this confirmed the importance of sublimation between 7 and 20 of the cumulative snowfall over 5 years of data it also showed the superiority of energy balance tools in snowmelt retrieval performances compared to traditional temperature or radiation index based methods the isba crocus characterized with a better representation of physical processes involved in the snowpack and in the superficial soil with regards to isba es implemented by chaponnière 2005 showed that albedo specifically the maximum albedo is the most important driving factor additionally empirical snowmelt models have been examined by bouamri et al 2018 using five years of meteorological and swe observations at the oukaimeden weather station they compared a traditional temperature index ti melt model with various enhanced versions that include different treatments of solar radiation potential global and net solar radiation they performed extensive calibration and validation on different sub periods and found that all models performed equally well in calibration when calibrated on a single year of observations whereas the enhanced models with an additive radiation term were most transferable between years the model including snow albedo etib model was found to perform best fig 8 a b conversely when calibrating on multiyear periods all models performed equally well with the simple ti model performing only slightly worse than the etib model that includes the net solar radiation fig 8 c d hence temporal variations in snowmelt could be adequately reproduced when sufficiently long periods are available for calibration of the ti model as suggested previously by réveillet et al 2017 in the case of glacier melt modeling bouamri et al 2018 this study also found large interannual variations in model parameters while previous studies proposed that this parameter variability is related to climate conditions carenzo et al 2009 gabbi et al 2014 bouamri et al 2018 showed no correlation between parameters and climate but rather found equifinality in model coefficients i e several combinations of the temperature and radiation parameters leading to similar performance were the main reason for parameter variability equifinality was attributed to the partial collinearity of air temperature and solar radiation which hampers parameter identifiability and increases their uncertainty despite equifinality enhanced models were still found to better transfer to other years when calibrated over a short period compared to the simple ti model these results highlight the flexible nature of enhanced empirical melt models for the scarce data context of the atlas and the need to obtain long observational records to better constrain simpler models such as ti 5 2 semidistributed modeling we have used two semidistributed snowmelt models the snowmelt runoff model srm range boudhar et al 2009 and the cemaneige model hajhouji et al 2018 the snowmelt runoff model srm was used to simulate the streamflow at the outlet of the five subwatersheds of the tensift river basin throughout the high atlas range in which high melting rates contribute to baseflow from late winter to early summer in this study the added value of using remotely sensed snow cover area maps scas to simulate streamflow over ungauged basins in this case issued from the spot vegetation instrument was demonstrated indeed accurate streamflow predictions are obtained when the remotely sensed data are used to force srm instead of data from an in situ forcing station that missed a significant snow event in the early season fig 9 following the interannual and interwatershed variability of the observed snow covered area the fractions of snowmelt contributing to streamflow are also variable from one year to another and from one watershed to another it was revealed that the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow at the outlets of the watersheds varies from 15 to 51 the cemaneige model valéry et al 2014 was used as a module upstream of the conceptual model gr4j perrin et al 2003 to simulate the rain snow partition the evolution of snow cover and snow melting cemaneige uses a discretization of the watershed in five altitudinal bands which makes it possible to represent the altitudinal effect on temperature and precipitation the melt is simulated using a temperature index approach accounting for the snowpack cold content evolution this model was applied over the rheraya watershed the daily snow cover simulated by cemaneige is in good agreement with that extracted from the modis snow product during the period 2000 2009 r² 0 63 additionally the simulated daily snow water equivalent is consistent with that measured at a weather station finally the streamflow simulation at the outlet of the rheraya watershed reproduces the strong seasonal and interannual variability hajhouji et al 2018 5 3 distributed modelling bouamri et al 2021 used the same empirical melt models developed at the point scale by bouamri et al 2018 fig 8 to model snow accumulation and melting in the rheraya catchment bouamri et al 2021 developed grid based 100 m temperature index ti models enhanced with either potential clear sky radiation hti model global radiation etia model or net solar radiation etib and compared their respective performance in simulating snow cover area sca over 14 years 2003 2016 sca maps were derived from blended and cloud filtered modis snow products from the terra and aqua satellites the authors hypothesized that including solar radiation would explain more of the snow cover spatial heterogeneity allowing us to later improve hydrological forecasts they also found that while models enhanced with solar radiation did improve the simulation of snow cover area inter model differences in model performance were overall small and the simple ti model appeared sufficient for basin scale snowmelt modeling this was attributed to two reasons 1 topographic induced variations in solar radiation tend to average out due to a near uniform distribution of slope aspects in the basin fig 10c so that mean simulated melt rates swe and sca do not differ greatly from using temperature alone to predict snowmelt 2 the necessary aggregation of finer scale model outputs to a resolution larger than key processes scales such as that where interactions between topography and solar radiation are greatest suppresses valid model information fig 10a b the authors called for caution when using medium resolution satellite products such as modis to validate spatially distributed snow models a widely used practice in snow hydrological modeling e g parajka and blöschl 2006 lumped or semidistributed models do not enable us to represent the high spatial heterogeneity of the snow cover in the atlas mountains in semiarid mountain regions the swe distribution is influenced by many accumulation and ablation processes that are primarily controlled by weather patterns and complex topography gascoin et al 2013 winstral and marks 2002 key factors are the dependence of precipitation and temperature on elevation the effect of slope and aspect on incoming solar radiation and the deflection of the wind field by the terrain distributed snowpack models aim to resolve the main effects of topography and the related variability in meteorological forcing on snowpack properties they are typically based on a gridded representation of the terrain which is derived from a digital elevation model dem physically based models compute the energy balance at the snow surface liston and elder 2006 a finer digital elevation model dem resolution is expected to better capture the variability of the snow cover however the computing cost of distributed models increases strongly dependent on the dem resolution baba et al 2019 this is a critical issue particularly for data assimilation which requires large ensembles of model runs for this reason baba et al 2019 investigated the effect of the dem resolution on the simulation of the snow water equivalent evolution in the high atlas this study was conducted using the distributed snowpack model snowmodel liston and elder 2006 which was forced by meteorological data provided by six automatic weather stations aws located at the rheraya catchment the outcomes of this study revealed that 250 m spatial resolution reproduced efficiently the main spatial patterns of the snowpack and especially the swe the use of snowmodel from 2000 to 2018 at ourika catchment showed the possibility of modeling the swe evolution in such region even with the lack of weather station measurements fig 11 in the high atlas of morocco snow water equivalent varies widely spatio temporally it is strongly dependent on elevations baba et al 2019 which control the amount of precipitation and the gradient of air temperature in normal seasons the swe in higher regions 3000 m a s l is higher than 200 mm from december to march and could reach 800 mm or more as a peak during the wet years baba et al 2021 paved the way to monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of the snowpack at tensift subbasins on a daily scale since 1981 these studies highlighted that recent progress of meteorological reanalyses data e g merra 2 and era5 could open new perspectives to overcome the data scarcity issue in the high atlas although snowmodel fed by meteorological reanalyses data performed well compared to observations significant biases remained in some years indeed the r m s e between modeled air temperature with era5 and the observed temperature in four stations was closer to 2 c and with strong correlation for all of them r2 0 9 while the comparison between modeled snow height and observed one at oukaimeden summit 3200 m a s l showed that the r m s e varies in general between 15 cm and 30 cm except for 2010 2011 water year where it reaches 43 cm this suggests that data assimilation of remote sensing products could be used to reduce the biases of inputs liu et al 2021 to that end a particle filter using sentinel 2 snow cover maps was developed to reduce precipitation and temperature bias and to better estimate swe in a tensift subbasin rheraya baba et al 2018a this assimilation scheme has the potential to better estimate swe in data scarce regions when additional meteorological variables e g shortwave radiations are used as control variables of the scheme 6 snowmelt contribution to surface water and groundwater recharge evidence of the contribution of a fairly constant slow water redistribution within the fractured rock media has been provided by chaponnière et al 2008 using tracing silica and dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the streamflow at the outlet of the rheraya watershed between april and december 2003 this slow component corresponds to almost 100 of the recharge flow during the driest months summer and might be mostly related to snowmelt using stable isotopes groundwater recharge in the plains was shown to be linked to the mountain streamflow bouimouass et al 2020 boukhari et al 2014 howell et al 2019 to estimate the contribution of the end members rainfall and snowmelt we used the isotopic mass balance model n da et al 2016 bouchaou et al 2008 based on the average oxygen 18 values of groundwater obtained in the souss n da et al 2016 bouchaou et al 2008 bouragba et al 2011 dindane et al 2003 haouz aquifer rhoujjati et al 2021 boukhari et al 2014 and draa basin cappy 2007 warner et al 2013 the contributions of precipitation rain and snow in the high atlas and the surrounding plains were established the contribution of snowmelt varies between 42 and 80 in the different studied areas n da et al 2016 cappy 2007 these results are consistent with those obtained by modeling the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow in the high atlas with a proportions varying between 15 and 51 boudhar et al 2009 cappy 2007 schulz and de jong 2004 these recharge rates indicate the role of the atlas mountains and the significant contribution of snow cover in supplying water resources in surrounding semiarid areas in addition to this quantitative contribution the snowmelt coming from the atlas with lower mineralisation plays an important role in decreasing water salinity in many hydrologic systems beyond the experimental sites of the rheraya catchment including the souss tensift and draa basins bouimouass et al 2022 bouchaou et al 2008 warner et al 2013 using isotopic tracers is a very relevant proxy but it should be extended to other catchments of the mountain range 7 climate change impact on snow reservoir the climate evolution in the mediterranean mountains suggests an earlier decline in high flows due to snowmelt in spring and a reduced influence of snow accumulation and snowmelt processes on river runoff garcía ruiz et al 2011 in morocco regional climate model simulations indicate that minimum temperatures are expected to increase more than the maximum temperature in most parts of the country with a strong agreement between models filahi et al 2017 mountainous areas showing higher increase than in the plains moucha et al 2021 these projected changes in temperature are associated with a decrease in precipitation totals that could exceed 20 following a north south gradient filahi et al 2017 indeed the southern regions of morocco have been identified as the most at risk of strong climate change impacts in the region with temperatures rising by 6 c under the rcp8 5 scenarios leading to a sharp decrease in surface water resources due to the combined effects of declining precipitation and stronger evapotranspiration rates tramblay et al 2018a for the rheraya basin in the high atlas hydrological scenarios have been provided with an ensemble of regional climate model simulations from the med cordex initiative marchane et al 2017 the future projections for 2050 under two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 indicate a significant decrease in surface runoff 19 to 63 depending on the scenario and hydro logical model associated with a strong reduction of snow accumulation from 57 under rcp4 5 but with a considerable spread with different models to 82 under rcp8 5 with less model spread fig 12 marchane et al 2017 similar projections have been obtained for the bin ouidane catchment upstream of the tadla region tramblay et al 2018b following the trends in observations indicating a shift from a snow pluvial flow regime to a pluvial regime ahbari et al 2017 8 research perspectives in our work on moroccan atlas snow hydrology the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover the contribution of snowmelt to surface and groundwater recharge and the quantification of climate change impacts on snow have been evaluated for this purpose we used a scientific approach based on the synergy between in situ measurements remote sensing of snow and modeling despite the substantial advances that have been made there are still many challenges to be taken up to contribute to a better understanding of atlas snow hydrology the results of remote sensing and modeling are encouraging but the integration of hydrometeorological data and in situ measurements for validation and model bias correction are needed it would therefore be important to develop a hydrometeorological network especially for sublimation direct swe snow depths and runoff measurements over the moroccan atlas watersheds the potential to map melting snow karbou et al 2021 nagler et al 2016 and snow depth lievens et al 2019 using c band radar data such as those acquired by the sentinel 1 satellite should be assessed in the near future in the specific conditions of our study area characterized by marked orography likewise new opportunities for monitoring the properties of snowpack will also be given by future missions at high spatial and temporal resolutions in the thermal infrared tir domain such as trishna thermal infrared imaging satellite for high resolution natural resource assessment https ieeexplore ieee org document 8518720 and lstm land surface temperature monitoring indeed tir data could be used to reduce uncertainties in the snowpack energy budget and assess the thermal inertia grace data have been used to monitor seasonal dynamics and long term trends of major snow and ice regions such as the himalayas e g chen et al 2016 greenland e g slobbe et al 2009 the arctic e g niu et al 2007 and canada e g forman et al 2012 and at a global scale frappart et al 2006 in the atlas the mass of the snowpack over the mountain may fall within the uncertainty range of the grace and grace follow on missions tapley et al 2019 in the future scientists have shown that a constellation of pairs of grace satellites could significantly improve the current limits of the temporal and spatial resolution of the grace missions and allow us to measure smaller mass fluctuations elsaka et al 2013 wiese et al 2011 for now it is interesting to use grace data to replace and compare the dynamics of the atlas snowpack with that of the large hydrological basins of the region ouatiki et al submitted found that in the oum er rbia and tensift basins the peak of the snow cover occurs 2 3 months ahead of the total terrestrial water storage in the basins they attributed this time lag to the fact that evaporation and groundwater recharge processes are more influenced by frequency of wet days and the length of the wet spells than the average and total monthly precipitation given the importance of snow in the regional water balance and on socioeconomic activities it is essential to characterize the snow deficits over the atlas mountain area snow drought snow drought is defined as a deficit in snow water equivalent swe huning and aghakouchak 2020 huning and aghakouchak 2020 used a standardized snow water equivalent index swei as a metric to characterize the temporal evolution of snow drought this index is used to assess the duration and intensity of snow drought at the spatial scale concerning the climate impacts despite a lower sensitivity to warming of snowpack in the atlas mountains due to shallow and cold snowpack and the influence of net radiation on the snow energy and mass balance lópez moreno et al 2017 climate scenarios indicate strong impacts on snowmelt runoff however a better understanding of the snow ablation processes under climate change is needed for this region if snowmelt is the dominant process for altitudes below 3000 m snow sublimation at higher altitudes can exceed 40 schulz and de jong 2004 and this direct water loss to the atmosphere does not contribute to runoff current climate model simulations are not able to adequately reproduce these processes to quantify the relative impacts of the different components of the water balance notably to look at the water partitioning between runoff evaporation and sublimation however recent advances in regional climate modeling at convection permitting scales coppola et al 2020 open new perspectives to evaluate climate change impacts on the mountain hydrology in these regions regarding operational aspects we are developing a dss decision support system tool in the framework of morsnow 1 research program within the um6p mohammed vi poly technic university the intended dss tool will integrate a multi modelling scheme with a focus on the combined use of both ground measurement and spatial observations issued from different sensors as inputs the specific context of the ungauged basin will be taken into consideration toward earlier spring snowmelt and peak spring streamflows prediction 9 conclusion in this paper we presented an overview of the results obtained concerning our research activities on snow hydrology in the moroccan atlas mountains during the past twenty years from 2001 to 2021 we have also targeted unsolved issues to identify any challenges to be taken up to contribute to a better understanding of atlas snow hydrology to understand snowpack processes and their influence on the hydrological basin response our scientific approach was focused on the joint use of in situ measurements remote sensing of snow and modeling by taking into consideration the sparsity of ground based networks our research activities are supported by in situ data measurements that we designed within the tensift climate and water observatory our approach has evolved with the development of space technology leading to increasingly precise data in terms of spatial and temporal resolution as well as their availability for free in terms of modeling we opted for more physically based approaches in contrast with the conceptual modeling tools that were implemented in the early studies substantial results were obtained during this first phase of our work and concern the following points 1 the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover by remote sensing the dynamics of the snow cover area are characterized by very strong inter and intra annual variability both in terms of maximum and total snow cover and in terms of event distribution and season length on average it is found that the snow season occurs between november and april for the upper regions of the atlas mountains using cluster analysis of the time series of snow cover areas at the catchment level over the atlas mountains three groups of catchments were identified that have similar intra annual snowfall dynamics the first group moulouya oum erbia and sebou gathers the northern catchments whereas the second group tensift souss draa is located in the southern part finally group 3 isolates the last catchment ziz rheris located in the southeastern part of the atlas chain the analysis of the bimonthly trends in the number of snowy days revealed a tendency for accumulation in february march and a tendency for early snow melting in the spring april may 2 the impact of the north atlantic oscillation nao on the snow covered area of the main watersheds the impact of nao on the snow cover sca area is shown to be the result of the nao s influence on temperature the primary striking result is a significant positive correlation at 95 for the duration of the snow season and the date of complete ablation which means that a positive negative nao in spring may favor later earlier melting and link higher lower sca on average 3 the snowmelt contribution to the flows of the atlas rivers using different model ing approaches following the interannual and interwatershed variability of the observed snow covered area the fractions of snowmelt contributing to streamflow are also variable from one year to another and from one watershed to another it was revealed that the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow at the outlets of the watersheds varies from 15 to 51 the assimilation of remotely sensed snow cover areas can improve the estimation of the swe in this region this assimilation was performed using sentinel 2 snow cover products these results indicated that remote sensing products and global scale reanalysis such as merra 2 or era5 have reached a level of accuracy which now allows the estimation of swe distribution with physically based models in the atlas mountains even without in situ measurements 4 both modeling results and observed snow height highlighted that the snowpack has a strong annual variation in general the peak of snow height exceeds 1 m and in some seasons e g 2008 2009 water year it reaches two meters in the upper regions 3000 m a s l 5 the contribution of snowmelt to the surface and groundwater recharge using snow isotopes based on the isotopes of water and the mass balance model the contributions of precipitation rain and snow in the high atlas and the surrounding plains were established this contribution of snowmelt varies between 42 and 80 in the different areas studied these results are consistent with those obtained by modeling the contribution of snowmelt these recharge rates indicate the role of the atlas mountains and their significant snow cover in supplying water resources in surrounding semiarid areas 6 quantification of climate change impacts on snow and associated runoff from the atlas mountains the quantitative evaluation of the possible impact of future climate for the high atlas focused on the rheraya basin indicates a significant decrease in surface runoff for 2050 with a strong reduction of half of the snow accumulation related to reduced precipitation and increased temperature similar projections have been obtained for the bin ouidane catchment upstream of the tadla region following the trends in observations indicating a shift from a snow pluvial flow regime to a pluvial regime although substantial progress has been made we present challenges and some perspectives for future research on this topic to contribute to a better understanding of atlas snow hydrology among these scientific challenges to be addressed we cite 1 development of the hydrometeorological network especially for sublimation direct swe snow depths and runoff measurements over the moroccan atlas watersheds for model validation and bias correction 2 extrapolation over the atlas mountains the use of the assimilation of sentinel 2 snow cover products with the use of the reanalysis of remote sensing data will provide better results of snow water equivalent 3 replace and compare the dynamics of the atlas snowpack with that of the integral water cycle over the region as recorded in the grace data as terrestrial total water storage 4 characterization of the temporal evolution of snow drought

challenges and future research perspectives within this topic graphical abstract ga1 keywords snow hydrology remote sensing snowpack semiarid areas moroccan atlas mountains 1 introduction in semiarid and arid areas sustainable water resource management requires precise quantification of surface and groundwater variability zaidi et al 2020 in many semiarid catchments the hydrological cycle is influenced by the presence of a mountain range which enhances precipitation fayad et al 2017 mankin et al 2015 the high elevation of mountainous regions constitutes an area of water production while water is used in the downstream plains mainly for irrigation in the upper catchment areas the solid part of precipitation is important and forms a seasonal snowpack where water is stored during winter meltwater runoff feeds river stream flows refills reservoirs and contributes to the recharge of aquifers later in the spring the buffer effect played by snowpack is essential for the agricultural sector particularly for crops whose water needs peak during the dry and hot period in summer since the pioneering work of giorgi and lionello 2008 several studies have pointed out the mediterranean as a hot spot of climate change associated with a 2 3 c temperature rise and a drop in precipitation of approximately 20 30 the impact of these projected changes on water resources and the agricultural sector could lead to dramatic social instability because of the low adaptative capacity of north african countries schilling et al 2020 concerning snowfall a warming climate could be associated with 1 a drastic drop in the water amount held in the snowpack through a change in partition between rainfall and snowfall as already observed in morocco simonneaux et al 2008 2 a potential increase in the water lost through sublimation boudhar et al 2016 and finally 3 a shift in the timing of the water discharge that could peak earlier in the season the latter effect could even jeopardize high value added crops such as citrus apples and olives that are fostered by different agricultural policies in the region berbel et al 2013 in addition with the potential shift in terms of the snow melting the rules of water allocation adopted by the managers for decades will probably need to be strongly modified in central morocco which is characterized by an arid to semiarid climate the atlas mountains represent the most important water supply in the country and contribute significantly to socioeconomic development fig 1 given the high elevations of the atlas which reaches 4167 m a s l precipitation occurs in the form of rain and snow due to the orographic effect the average annual precipitation in the plains is low and varies between 150 and 250 mm while this annual amount can exceed 800 mm in the highest regions with a significant portion falling as snow i e between 20 and 80 boudhar et al 2009 therefore these mountain ranges can be considered as the water tower of morocco that provides freshwater for the large downstream arid plains snowmelt is extremely important for the water supply for different uses especially irrigation which is responsible for more than 85 of available water uptake fao 2016 jarlan et al 2015 khabba et al 2013 as such accurate knowledge of snow water equivalent swe is key information needed by policy makers to help design and implement appropriate allocation strategies for water resource management this information helps to better plan the distribution of water for downstream irrigators by hydraulic basin agency managers and agriculture departments who are in charge of monitoring atlasic river discharge and managing water in the low land watersheds surrounding the moroccan atlas mountains on the other hand snow cover is highly vulnerable to climate change especially given the evidence that atmospheric warming increases with elevation in the mediterranean mountains kotlarski et al 2015 moucha et al 2021 pepin et al 2015 it is expected that climate change will reduce the available swe in the future giorgi and lionello 2008 lópez moreno et al 2017 marchane et al 2017 schilling et al 2012 tramblay et al 2020 in addition rising temperatures may shift the annual peak flow due to snowmelt occurring earlier in the hydrologic year potentially compromising the supply of irrigation water to downstream areas in late spring therefore studying climate change impacts on water resources for the atlas mountains is necessary to develop adaptation strategies for managing water hssaisoune et al 2020 marchane et al 2017 2015 ground measurements provide reliable information on snowpack properties but their spatial representativity is difficult to characterize in remote mountain areas given that hydroclimatic and snow conditions in the mountainous environments are extremely heterogeneous in both space and time boudhar et al 2011 ouatiki et al 2017 vieira et al 2017 with regards to the sparsity of the in situ network limited to snow research stations snow studies in morocco have often relied upon remote sensing usually used jointly with modeling tools taking advantage of the specific optical properties of snow high visible and low mid infrared reflectance properties many studies have used optical remote sensing in particular to estimate the distribution of snow covered areas scas from different satellite sensors with various spatial and temporal resolutions bouamri et al 2021 boudhar et al 2007 2009 2010 2011 2014 chaponnière et al 2005 marchane et al 2013 2015 boudhar 2009 hanich et al 2003 additionally different modeling approaches have been developed point scale semi distributed and distributed approaches to estimate swe and snowmelt from the point scale to the basin scale baba et al 2019 2018a 2018b bouamri et al 2018 2021 boudhar et al 2009 2016 schulz and de jong 2004 other studies have integrated snowmelt models into hydrological models to simulate streamflow boudhar et al 2009 hajhouji et al 2018 this paper aims to provide a summary of our research activities on snow hydrology in the atlas mountains in the recent years these different activities have been carried out within the frame of the research program sudmed project 2002 2011 chehbouni et al 2008 the young team associated with ird jeai cremas 2006 2009 and the joint international laboratory lmi trema 2011 2020 jarlan et al 2015 to understand snowpack processes and their influences on the basin hydrological response our scientific approach was focused on the joint use of in situ measurements remote sensing of snow and modeling by taking into consideration the sparsity of ground based networks this approach has evolved with the development of space technology leading to freely available and increasingly precise data in terms of spatial and temporal resolution in terms of modeling this increased amount of data together with the improvement of the resolution and accuracy of the meteorological forcing enabled a switch toward more physically based approaches in contrast with the conceptual modeling tools that were implemented in early studies this synthesis of the research results is useful science advancement is intimately related to the availability of new data in hydrological science as well as in other environmental sciences the availability of new data is a driver of change of paradigm both with regard to science and to management and ultimately to policy development in this regard our research objectives fall under several of the unsolved problems in hydrology identified in the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology initiative of the iahs international association of hydrological sciences blöschl et al 2019 such as how will cold region runoff and groundwater change in a warmer climate what are the mechanisms by which climate change and water use alter ephemeral rivers and groundwater in semi arid regions why how and when do rain on snow events produce exceptional runoff how can we use innovative technologies to measure surface and subsurface properties states and fluxes at a range of spatial and temporal scales how can we disentangle and reduce model structural parameter input uncertainty in hydrological prediction blöschl et al 2019 following a description of the context of the moroccan atlas mountains and the in situ measurements of different hydrologic and climatic variables this paper presents an overview of the results obtained concerning 1 the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover by remote sensing 2 the impact of the north atlantic oscillation nao on the snow covered area of the main watersheds 3 the snowmelt contribution to the flows of the atlas rivers using different modeling approaches 4 the contribution of snowmelt to surface and groundwater recharge using snow isotopes and 5 the quantification of climate change impacts on snow and associated runoff from the atlas mountains we also present future challenges and some future research perspectives on this topic 2 moroccan atlas mountain context the atlas mountain range stretches over 700 kilometers along a west southwest to east northeast axis with a width of 70 kilometers fig 1 it forms in the center of morocco a barrier between the mediterranean sea in northern morocco and the sahara it is made up of seven watersheds with a mixed influence of rainfall and snowmelt and it is subdivided into three physiographic units the anti atlas the high atlas and the middle atlas the seven watersheds are the draa and souss located in the anti atlas with altitudes varying between 1500 and 2000 m a s l the tensift oum er bia and ziz rheris located within the high atlas chain are the highest unit with altitudes exceeding 4000 m a s l and the sebou and moulouya located in the middle atlas 3 experimental and in situ measurements within the frame of the tensift climate and water observatory measurements of hydrological parameters and processes in the high atlas were focused on the rheraya watershed located south of marrakech with altitudes ranging from 1000 to 4167 m a s l toubkal summit the highest peak in north africa the basin covers an area of 228 km2 with snow present at least three months per year at an elevation above 3000 m starting in 2002 a network of five automatic weather stations recording temperature air humidity wind speed solar radiation and rainfall at a 30 mn time step was progressively installed four additional sites record only rainfall fig 1 fig 2 and table 1 these meteorological data are used either directly to force hydrological models or to check the quality of reanalysis satellite precipitation datasets or weather forecasts which are increasingly used in modeling to monitor snow cover two of five stations include a geonor total precipitation gauge since 2013 namely the toubkal refuge site at 3200 m a s l and the oukaimeden summit at 3250 m a s l the latter site has also included a snow height measurement sensor since 2003 the snow density was measured periodically between 2007 and 2016 around the oukaimeden station located on a plateau with altitudes between 3150 and 3250 m a s l during each campaign a transect of 10 15 points was sampled measuring for each point the snow height and the snow weight sampled with a tube from which the density was calculated finally daily minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and fresh snowfall depth were continuously observed from 1989 to 2009 by the keeper of the oukaimeden caf refuge 2650 m a s l which is highly valuable thanks to its record length and consistency with to our knowledge no equivalent in the region finally soil moisture has also been observed at the aremd site 1950 m a s l since 2013 six sensors ml2 theta probes from delta t continuously recorded the soil moisture at 5 and 40 cm depths for three points located at 10 m from each other on a slope of approximately 30 covered with degraded rangeland typical from this area additionally moisture and temperature sensors were installed in 2019 at the oukaimeden site at 10 30 and 60 cm depths 3 campbell cs215 probes fig 2 river flow measurements at the outlet of the main subbasins of the high atlas mountains have been collected since the 1960 s or 1970 s by the tensift hydraulic basin agency abht these runoff estimates are obtained from water heights observed manually three times a day 8 h 12 h and 18 h by station keepers with more frequent observations during flood events frequency is left to the station keeper to capture the quick variations in runoff typical of wadis these heights are converted into daily runoff using gauging curves determined by manual gauging achieved every month using a current meter through the riverbed section the gauging curves are updated each time a strong flow event modifies the river cross section these runoff measurements are used to calibrate or validate the snowmelt and runoff models 4 remote sensing of snow cover area regarding the climate aridity of the moroccan atlas zone processes governing the state of snowpack and its evolution are extremely variable both in space e g exposition control photo 1 and in time and snow can fall and melt within one week boudhar et al 2009 2007 chaponnière et al 2005 hanich et al 2003 to take into consideration the parameters controlling these changes it is recommended to acquire snow and climate information ideally at a high temporal and spatial resolution the lack of in situ measurements led us to use remote sensing especially optical remote sensing to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover over the atlas mountains we focused on optical remote sensing since the specific optical properties of snow high visible and low medium infrared reflectance properties provide an accurate means to derive the snow cover area e g using the ndsi the normalized difference snow index dozier 1989 hall et al 2001 salomonson and appel 2004 4 1 snow cover area of five subwatersheds of the tensift catchment using the spot vegetation product in early works we developed an approach that combines data derived from two types of instruments low spatial and high temporal resolution spot vegetation daily revisit time and pixel size of 1 km2 and high spatial and low temporal resolution landsat tm 16 days revisit time and 30 m pixel size the approach consisted of calibrating a pixel based relationship between a low resolution multispectral index and a high resolution snow cover area to derive the subpixel snow cover fraction at low resolution this relationship was then applied to a series of spot vegetation images covering the 1998 2005 period over five subwatersheds of the tensift catchment within the high atlas to map the snow cover area boudhar et al 2010 2009 2007 chaponnière et al 2005 hanich et al 2003 a long time series of sca covering the 1998 2005 period was generated for the five subbasin of the tensift catchment boudhar et al 2010 2009 2007 these studies highlighted the strong heterogeneity of seasonal and interannual sca from one basin to another related to the altitudinal and exposition effects indeed the snowfall period calculated from the date of appearance of snow surfaces until its disappearance is very variable the onset of the snow season fluctuates between the end of september and the end of december while the last snowfall events were recorded between the end of january and the beginning of april the minimum snow cover altitudes are approximately 1400 m for wet seasons compared to 1800 m for dry seasons based on a similar methodology a modified normalized difference snow index mndsi boudhar et al 2009 was proposed to derive the sca the scatter plots in fig 3 shows the correlation between spot vegetation and modis sca fractions over the mountain part of the tensift river basin during the 2003 2004 snow season this date by date intercomparison reveals the high correlation between the two products with an average r² coefficient of 0 84 and rmse of 1 29 4 2 snow cover area over the atlas mountains using the modis product 4 2 1 snow cover variability the freely distributed snow product collection provided by the national snow and ice data center derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis observations hall et al 2001 was assessed in the rapidly changing snow cover of the atlas with an overall accuracy of 89 this product was found to be appropriate to characterize the high dynamics of snowpack in the arid to semiarid context of the moroccan atlas mountains thanks to its spatial resolution 500 m and its short revisit time 1 day jarlan et al 2015 marchane et al 2015 2013 nevertheless it is revealed that this low spatial resolution product is not efficient in capturing the local variability of the snow extent related to the terrain aspect effect induced by solar radiation bouamri et al 2021 the high accuracy of this product above 80 snow detection for cloud free images was highlighted by several studies gascoin et al 2015 hall and riggs 2007 klein and barnett 2003 parajka and blöschl 2006 but they also pointed out two main weaknesses 1 the monitoring of snow may be very sporadic in areas with high cloudiness 2 due to a close spectral signature in the visible domain a misclassification between snow and clouds may lead to up to 12 false positives snow detected but not present and up to 15 sca overestimation within this context a spatiotemporal filter aiming to increase the number of usable images and to improve the snow cloud classification adapted from gafurov and bárdossy 2009 and gafurov parajka and blöschl 2006 for semiarid snow cover was developed by marchane et al 2015 the filter reduces the number of pixels identified as a cloud correctly or not by 96 over the atlas mountain range the corrected products were also assessed against five in situ automatic snow depth stations and a series of 19 snow cover maps derived from formosat 2 images acquired during winter 2009 over the high atlas in the tensift catchment regarding the good accuracy of the corrected products they have been used 1 to characterize the snow cover variability in seven catchments covering the moroccan atlas mountain range and 2 to assess the spatiotemporal trends using a mann kendall test hirsch et al 1982 of snow cover areas at the scale of all moroccan catchments with snow rain functioning to assess the spatial variability of the snow cover dynamics in morocco the time series of snow cover areas at the catchment level were grouped using cluster analysis the analysis identified three groups fig 1 the first group moulouya oum erbia and sebou gathers the northern catchments whereas the second group tensift souss draa is located in the southern part finally group 3 isolates the last catchment ziz rheris located in the southeastern part of the at las chain fig 4 the dynamics of sca in the three groups are characterized by high interannual variability with a variation coefficient of the maximum sca equal to 41 25 and 77 for groups 1 2 and 3 respectively group 2 is dominated by high altitudes which explains the value of the coefficient of variation cv while the cv of group 3 can be explained by solar radiation which is the highest compared to the other groups the inter and intra annual variability is extremely high both in terms of maximum and total snow cover as well as in terms of event distribution and season length fig 5 shows in particular the strong seasonal dynamics of snow cover at the scale of the whole moroccan atlas additionally the number of snow events is limited and there are periods of almost complete ablation even at the scale of the whole massif and in the middle of winter 2002 2003 season in particular in terms of interannual variability the maximum snow cover area varies from 13 433 km² for the 2013 2014 season to 42 000 km² for the 2004 2005 season which induces significant consequences on water availability in spring similarly the date of seasonal maximum snow cover also shows high variability from one year to another with an occurrence in mid december for the 2006 2007 season and up to mid march for the 2001 2002 and 2010 2011 seasons finally to assess the trend of the snowy days a 2 month period was chosen here following brown and mote 2009 who showed that the duration of snow cover was the most climate sensitive variable the analysis of the trend maps fig 6 led to the following remarks at the start of the season in october november a general increasing trend was observed for most of the region 77 of the pixels with a few scattered spatial patterns mainly located on the north side of the atlas where a decrease was detected nevertheless these observations should be analyzed with caution as only 7 9 of the pixels passed the mann kendall test in december january there is no evidence of strong long term trends that would impact the entire region nonetheless there is a clear trend toward a decrease in the duration of snowfall that passes the mann kendall test in the southern part of the study area in the souss and tensift basins in february march the increasing trend is significant over the region 96 4 of the pixels among which 36 8 showed a positive and significant trend most of these pixels are located at high altitudes 53 1 of the area above 2500 m above sea level shows a significant increase in snow duration for pixels where the trend is significant the median slope is 5 8 days 10 years and it is even above 9 7 days 10 years for 10 of the pixels finally april may is the only period where the downward trend dominates the region with 68 8 of the area but only 11 5 passes the mann kendall test most of this observed drop was detected below 2500 m altitude with 76 1 of the pixels below this altitude showing a downward trend 15 1 is significant the slopes of 11 5 of the pixels with a significant trend are much weaker with a median value of 2 1 days 10 years even if the observed trends are not for most pixels statistically significant in the long term the spatial consistency of the results suggests an increasing trend in the duration of snow cover in february and march mainly impacting areas of high altitude above 2500 m and to a lesser extent a slight decrease in the duration of snow cover in april and may although not significant the decrease affects 76 1 of areas below 2500 m the observed increase of sca during february march marchane et al 2015 is corroborated by the negative trend of december february nao not shown observed during the period of study 2000 2013 this means that an extension to the recent years after 2015 characterized by mainly positive nao during winter could turn this positive sca trend into a decrease of sca the advent of sentinel 2 opens new avenues in the monitoring of snow cover area in the atlas sentinel 2 provides 20 meter resolution multispectral images with only five days of revisit time in contrast to 16 days for landsat 8 similar to modis and vegetation the snow cover area can easily be distinguished from snow free areas and clouds using the ndsi the theia land data centre provides operational snow products for a large region of the atlas mountains gascoin et al 2019 4 2 2 impact of the north atlantic oscillation nao on the snow covered area the north atlantic oscillation nao has long been known to be the main climatic pseudooscillation impacting winter precipitation in the euro mediterranean region over morocco lamb and peppler 1987 showed for the first time a strong negative correlation between winter precipitation december april and nao from december february the daily series of the corrected snow covered area products were synthesized using seasonal indicators the maximum snow covered area scamax the sum of total snow covered areas scasum the average of the snow covered areas scamean and the dates of maximum snow cover that were related to the north atlantic oscillation through simple lagged correlations marchane et al 2016 highlighting for the first time the linkages between snow cover and nao in western north africa as a preliminary step the relationships between precipitation and air temperature and nao were revisited precipitation and air temperature were obtained from 17 meteorological stations from the synoptic network between 1993 and 2011 and from the ncep reanalysis national center for environmental prediction reanalysis in line with previous studies winter precipitation in morocco appeared to be inversely related to the nao excluding the inland stations located southwestern midelt er rachidia and ouarzazate and in the mediterranean area al hoceima and nouasseur stations as expected the correlation decreased significantly after february a negative correlation is demonstrated with temperature which means that the negative positive phase of the nao preferentially leads to a temperature higher than normal lower than normal this could be attributed to the increased advection of air from the warm ocean during the negative phase by contrast with the nao precipitation correlation two significant differences can be highlighted for the nao temperature linkage 1 the correlation is significant inland even on the southern slope of the atlas the stations of er rachidia and midelt in february show a negative correlation of 0 67 and 0 56 respectively 2 the negative correlation remains later in the season in april all the southern stations show very high negative values and a spatial pattern of negative correlation over the same area is also very marked for the ncep reanalysis concerning snow indicators no significant correlation was found between nao and the start date of the snow season the main striking results are a positive correlation significant at the 95 level for the duration of the snow season and the date of complete ablation which means that a positive negative nao is favorable for a longer shorter season fig 7 this is consistent with the correlation between the nao in march and the air temperature in april at the end of the season stated differently milder temperatures during the negative phases of the nao promote earlier snow clearing additionally this emphasizes the dominant influence of temperature anomalies on the snowpack induced by the nao rather than an effect of precipitation which turned out to be weak beyond the winter months and which moreover would imply a negative correlation a positive correlation is also found with the average sca in april may and to a lesser extent in december january these correlations also support a dominant effect of temperature 1 the sign of the correlation is positive if the effect of the rains were dominant a negative sign would have been expected 2 a significant correlation is demonstrated for the whole atlas including the area located south of the atlas mountains in agreement with the spatial pattern of the correlation between nao and temperature which covers the whole country and 3 the correlation is significant even at the end of the season when the correlation between precipitation and nao has disappeared 5 snowmelt hydrology modeling to estimate the snowpack state e g snow height hs snow water equivalent swe melt and sublimation different modeling approaches have been evaluated as follows point scale which consists of modeling the snowpack evolution at a particular point generally this point is the location of the weather station that provides meteorological data we used an energy balance model to monitor the different processes of energy and mass balance of the snowpack at the oukaimeden 3200 m a s l automatic weather station from 2003 to 2004 2009 2010 bouamri et al 2018 boudhar et al 2016 the objective of this approach is to test the efficiency of various melting models and examine the physical processes affecting the evolution of snowpack notably the inversion of turbulent fluxes and the sublimation rate semidistributed modeling consists of dividing the basin into different units that are supposed to have the same characteristics e g altitudes many studies have highlighted the importance of semidistributed models in mountain hydrology douglas mankin et al 2010 fontaine et al 2002 grusson et al 2015 rahman et al 2013 for that we evaluated the performance of integrated snowmelt models on some subwatersheds of the tensift catchment through the high atlas range to simulate streamflow boudhar et al 2009 hajhouji et al 2018 the objective of this approach consists of a simple spatialization that makes it possible to consider the first order factors governing the dynamic of the snowpack in particular altitude distributed modeling the study area is divided into a regular grid where each grid cell has its own characteristics e g altitude slope orientation this approach was used for the simulation of the snow water equivalent evolution in the high atlas baba et al 2019 2018a 2018b bouamri et al 2021 this approach allows the use of 3d methods that consider fine scale variations in radiative and turbulent heat fluxes in the landscape 5 1 modeling at the point scale snowpack modeling in dry mountainous environments is an issue since many processes can interact while little is known about each process taken separately the separation between melt and sublimation or evaporation is particularly important in those environments a comparative study of snowmelt modeling approaches varying from simple to physically based models was carried out by boudhar et al 2009 using automatic data recorded at the oukaimden aws 3200 m a s l and ground measurements sampled in the vicinity of the same site first the simplified degree day approach has been evaluated with a focus on how the ddf degree day factor methodology influences simulations of swe in this regard three formulations i e those from kuusisto 1980 and martinec 1960 and the radiative approach of brubaker et al 1996 were considered to simulate ddf for snowmelt quantification the calibration procedure was carried out using field observations acquired during the snow season 2007 2008 however the other seasons 2003 2004 2004 2005 and 2005 2006 were used for the validation phase for physically based modeling the isba es model boone 2000 was applied to analyze different snowpack processes from the 2003 2004 2009 2010 snow seasons the results show interannual variation in snow water equivalent swe observed and simulated using isba es and the three degree day models all models efficiently simulate the variation in swe over the calibration season during the validation period the martinec model cannot simulate swe efficiently during the season while the brubaker and kuustisto models provide a better simulation in all seasons with a correlation coefficient more than 0 8 and bias between 13 mm to 2 32 mm the use of the isba es model at the oukaimden site during four seasons shows that most of the snow ablation is due to the melting process however a significant proportion of water losses are caused by sublimation the melting process is generally characterized by the sudden release of water in short periods concomitant with the increase in air temperature however the sublimation process occurs regularly throughout the season and can reach 38 of the total ablation depending on the year a simple approach based on a simple energy balance equation forced by all available measurements radiative budget surface temperature etc was implemented by boudhar et al 2016 to monitor the different processes of energy and mass balance of the snowpack this confirmed the importance of sublimation between 7 and 20 of the cumulative snowfall over 5 years of data it also showed the superiority of energy balance tools in snowmelt retrieval performances compared to traditional temperature or radiation index based methods the isba crocus characterized with a better representation of physical processes involved in the snowpack and in the superficial soil with regards to isba es implemented by chaponnière 2005 showed that albedo specifically the maximum albedo is the most important driving factor additionally empirical snowmelt models have been examined by bouamri et al 2018 using five years of meteorological and swe observations at the oukaimeden weather station they compared a traditional temperature index ti melt model with various enhanced versions that include different treatments of solar radiation potential global and net solar radiation they performed extensive calibration and validation on different sub periods and found that all models performed equally well in calibration when calibrated on a single year of observations whereas the enhanced models with an additive radiation term were most transferable between years the model including snow albedo etib model was found to perform best fig 8 a b conversely when calibrating on multiyear periods all models performed equally well with the simple ti model performing only slightly worse than the etib model that includes the net solar radiation fig 8 c d hence temporal variations in snowmelt could be adequately reproduced when sufficiently long periods are available for calibration of the ti model as suggested previously by réveillet et al 2017 in the case of glacier melt modeling bouamri et al 2018 this study also found large interannual variations in model parameters while previous studies proposed that this parameter variability is related to climate conditions carenzo et al 2009 gabbi et al 2014 bouamri et al 2018 showed no correlation between parameters and climate but rather found equifinality in model coefficients i e several combinations of the temperature and radiation parameters leading to similar performance were the main reason for parameter variability equifinality was attributed to the partial collinearity of air temperature and solar radiation which hampers parameter identifiability and increases their uncertainty despite equifinality enhanced models were still found to better transfer to other years when calibrated over a short period compared to the simple ti model these results highlight the flexible nature of enhanced empirical melt models for the scarce data context of the atlas and the need to obtain long observational records to better constrain simpler models such as ti 5 2 semidistributed modeling we have used two semidistributed snowmelt models the snowmelt runoff model srm range boudhar et al 2009 and the cemaneige model hajhouji et al 2018 the snowmelt runoff model srm was used to simulate the streamflow at the outlet of the five subwatersheds of the tensift river basin throughout the high atlas range in which high melting rates contribute to baseflow from late winter to early summer in this study the added value of using remotely sensed snow cover area maps scas to simulate streamflow over ungauged basins in this case issued from the spot vegetation instrument was demonstrated indeed accurate streamflow predictions are obtained when the remotely sensed data are used to force srm instead of data from an in situ forcing station that missed a significant snow event in the early season fig 9 following the interannual and interwatershed variability of the observed snow covered area the fractions of snowmelt contributing to streamflow are also variable from one year to another and from one watershed to another it was revealed that the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow at the outlets of the watersheds varies from 15 to 51 the cemaneige model valéry et al 2014 was used as a module upstream of the conceptual model gr4j perrin et al 2003 to simulate the rain snow partition the evolution of snow cover and snow melting cemaneige uses a discretization of the watershed in five altitudinal bands which makes it possible to represent the altitudinal effect on temperature and precipitation the melt is simulated using a temperature index approach accounting for the snowpack cold content evolution this model was applied over the rheraya watershed the daily snow cover simulated by cemaneige is in good agreement with that extracted from the modis snow product during the period 2000 2009 r² 0 63 additionally the simulated daily snow water equivalent is consistent with that measured at a weather station finally the streamflow simulation at the outlet of the rheraya watershed reproduces the strong seasonal and interannual variability hajhouji et al 2018 5 3 distributed modelling bouamri et al 2021 used the same empirical melt models developed at the point scale by bouamri et al 2018 fig 8 to model snow accumulation and melting in the rheraya catchment bouamri et al 2021 developed grid based 100 m temperature index ti models enhanced with either potential clear sky radiation hti model global radiation etia model or net solar radiation etib and compared their respective performance in simulating snow cover area sca over 14 years 2003 2016 sca maps were derived from blended and cloud filtered modis snow products from the terra and aqua satellites the authors hypothesized that including solar radiation would explain more of the snow cover spatial heterogeneity allowing us to later improve hydrological forecasts they also found that while models enhanced with solar radiation did improve the simulation of snow cover area inter model differences in model performance were overall small and the simple ti model appeared sufficient for basin scale snowmelt modeling this was attributed to two reasons 1 topographic induced variations in solar radiation tend to average out due to a near uniform distribution of slope aspects in the basin fig 10c so that mean simulated melt rates swe and sca do not differ greatly from using temperature alone to predict snowmelt 2 the necessary aggregation of finer scale model outputs to a resolution larger than key processes scales such as that where interactions between topography and solar radiation are greatest suppresses valid model information fig 10a b the authors called for caution when using medium resolution satellite products such as modis to validate spatially distributed snow models a widely used practice in snow hydrological modeling e g parajka and blöschl 2006 lumped or semidistributed models do not enable us to represent the high spatial heterogeneity of the snow cover in the atlas mountains in semiarid mountain regions the swe distribution is influenced by many accumulation and ablation processes that are primarily controlled by weather patterns and complex topography gascoin et al 2013 winstral and marks 2002 key factors are the dependence of precipitation and temperature on elevation the effect of slope and aspect on incoming solar radiation and the deflection of the wind field by the terrain distributed snowpack models aim to resolve the main effects of topography and the related variability in meteorological forcing on snowpack properties they are typically based on a gridded representation of the terrain which is derived from a digital elevation model dem physically based models compute the energy balance at the snow surface liston and elder 2006 a finer digital elevation model dem resolution is expected to better capture the variability of the snow cover however the computing cost of distributed models increases strongly dependent on the dem resolution baba et al 2019 this is a critical issue particularly for data assimilation which requires large ensembles of model runs for this reason baba et al 2019 investigated the effect of the dem resolution on the simulation of the snow water equivalent evolution in the high atlas this study was conducted using the distributed snowpack model snowmodel liston and elder 2006 which was forced by meteorological data provided by six automatic weather stations aws located at the rheraya catchment the outcomes of this study revealed that 250 m spatial resolution reproduced efficiently the main spatial patterns of the snowpack and especially the swe the use of snowmodel from 2000 to 2018 at ourika catchment showed the possibility of modeling the swe evolution in such region even with the lack of weather station measurements fig 11 in the high atlas of morocco snow water equivalent varies widely spatio temporally it is strongly dependent on elevations baba et al 2019 which control the amount of precipitation and the gradient of air temperature in normal seasons the swe in higher regions 3000 m a s l is higher than 200 mm from december to march and could reach 800 mm or more as a peak during the wet years baba et al 2021 paved the way to monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of the snowpack at tensift subbasins on a daily scale since 1981 these studies highlighted that recent progress of meteorological reanalyses data e g merra 2 and era5 could open new perspectives to overcome the data scarcity issue in the high atlas although snowmodel fed by meteorological reanalyses data performed well compared to observations significant biases remained in some years indeed the r m s e between modeled air temperature with era5 and the observed temperature in four stations was closer to 2 c and with strong correlation for all of them r2 0 9 while the comparison between modeled snow height and observed one at oukaimeden summit 3200 m a s l showed that the r m s e varies in general between 15 cm and 30 cm except for 2010 2011 water year where it reaches 43 cm this suggests that data assimilation of remote sensing products could be used to reduce the biases of inputs liu et al 2021 to that end a particle filter using sentinel 2 snow cover maps was developed to reduce precipitation and temperature bias and to better estimate swe in a tensift subbasin rheraya baba et al 2018a this assimilation scheme has the potential to better estimate swe in data scarce regions when additional meteorological variables e g shortwave radiations are used as control variables of the scheme 6 snowmelt contribution to surface water and groundwater recharge evidence of the contribution of a fairly constant slow water redistribution within the fractured rock media has been provided by chaponnière et al 2008 using tracing silica and dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the streamflow at the outlet of the rheraya watershed between april and december 2003 this slow component corresponds to almost 100 of the recharge flow during the driest months summer and might be mostly related to snowmelt using stable isotopes groundwater recharge in the plains was shown to be linked to the mountain streamflow bouimouass et al 2020 boukhari et al 2014 howell et al 2019 to estimate the contribution of the end members rainfall and snowmelt we used the isotopic mass balance model n da et al 2016 bouchaou et al 2008 based on the average oxygen 18 values of groundwater obtained in the souss n da et al 2016 bouchaou et al 2008 bouragba et al 2011 dindane et al 2003 haouz aquifer rhoujjati et al 2021 boukhari et al 2014 and draa basin cappy 2007 warner et al 2013 the contributions of precipitation rain and snow in the high atlas and the surrounding plains were established the contribution of snowmelt varies between 42 and 80 in the different studied areas n da et al 2016 cappy 2007 these results are consistent with those obtained by modeling the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow in the high atlas with a proportions varying between 15 and 51 boudhar et al 2009 cappy 2007 schulz and de jong 2004 these recharge rates indicate the role of the atlas mountains and the significant contribution of snow cover in supplying water resources in surrounding semiarid areas in addition to this quantitative contribution the snowmelt coming from the atlas with lower mineralisation plays an important role in decreasing water salinity in many hydrologic systems beyond the experimental sites of the rheraya catchment including the souss tensift and draa basins bouimouass et al 2022 bouchaou et al 2008 warner et al 2013 using isotopic tracers is a very relevant proxy but it should be extended to other catchments of the mountain range 7 climate change impact on snow reservoir the climate evolution in the mediterranean mountains suggests an earlier decline in high flows due to snowmelt in spring and a reduced influence of snow accumulation and snowmelt processes on river runoff garcía ruiz et al 2011 in morocco regional climate model simulations indicate that minimum temperatures are expected to increase more than the maximum temperature in most parts of the country with a strong agreement between models filahi et al 2017 mountainous areas showing higher increase than in the plains moucha et al 2021 these projected changes in temperature are associated with a decrease in precipitation totals that could exceed 20 following a north south gradient filahi et al 2017 indeed the southern regions of morocco have been identified as the most at risk of strong climate change impacts in the region with temperatures rising by 6 c under the rcp8 5 scenarios leading to a sharp decrease in surface water resources due to the combined effects of declining precipitation and stronger evapotranspiration rates tramblay et al 2018a for the rheraya basin in the high atlas hydrological scenarios have been provided with an ensemble of regional climate model simulations from the med cordex initiative marchane et al 2017 the future projections for 2050 under two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 indicate a significant decrease in surface runoff 19 to 63 depending on the scenario and hydro logical model associated with a strong reduction of snow accumulation from 57 under rcp4 5 but with a considerable spread with different models to 82 under rcp8 5 with less model spread fig 12 marchane et al 2017 similar projections have been obtained for the bin ouidane catchment upstream of the tadla region tramblay et al 2018b following the trends in observations indicating a shift from a snow pluvial flow regime to a pluvial regime ahbari et al 2017 8 research perspectives in our work on moroccan atlas snow hydrology the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover the contribution of snowmelt to surface and groundwater recharge and the quantification of climate change impacts on snow have been evaluated for this purpose we used a scientific approach based on the synergy between in situ measurements remote sensing of snow and modeling despite the substantial advances that have been made there are still many challenges to be taken up to contribute to a better understanding of atlas snow hydrology the results of remote sensing and modeling are encouraging but the integration of hydrometeorological data and in situ measurements for validation and model bias correction are needed it would therefore be important to develop a hydrometeorological network especially for sublimation direct swe snow depths and runoff measurements over the moroccan atlas watersheds the potential to map melting snow karbou et al 2021 nagler et al 2016 and snow depth lievens et al 2019 using c band radar data such as those acquired by the sentinel 1 satellite should be assessed in the near future in the specific conditions of our study area characterized by marked orography likewise new opportunities for monitoring the properties of snowpack will also be given by future missions at high spatial and temporal resolutions in the thermal infrared tir domain such as trishna thermal infrared imaging satellite for high resolution natural resource assessment https ieeexplore ieee org document 8518720 and lstm land surface temperature monitoring indeed tir data could be used to reduce uncertainties in the snowpack energy budget and assess the thermal inertia grace data have been used to monitor seasonal dynamics and long term trends of major snow and ice regions such as the himalayas e g chen et al 2016 greenland e g slobbe et al 2009 the arctic e g niu et al 2007 and canada e g forman et al 2012 and at a global scale frappart et al 2006 in the atlas the mass of the snowpack over the mountain may fall within the uncertainty range of the grace and grace follow on missions tapley et al 2019 in the future scientists have shown that a constellation of pairs of grace satellites could significantly improve the current limits of the temporal and spatial resolution of the grace missions and allow us to measure smaller mass fluctuations elsaka et al 2013 wiese et al 2011 for now it is interesting to use grace data to replace and compare the dynamics of the atlas snowpack with that of the large hydrological basins of the region ouatiki et al submitted found that in the oum er rbia and tensift basins the peak of the snow cover occurs 2 3 months ahead of the total terrestrial water storage in the basins they attributed this time lag to the fact that evaporation and groundwater recharge processes are more influenced by frequency of wet days and the length of the wet spells than the average and total monthly precipitation given the importance of snow in the regional water balance and on socioeconomic activities it is essential to characterize the snow deficits over the atlas mountain area snow drought snow drought is defined as a deficit in snow water equivalent swe huning and aghakouchak 2020 huning and aghakouchak 2020 used a standardized snow water equivalent index swei as a metric to characterize the temporal evolution of snow drought this index is used to assess the duration and intensity of snow drought at the spatial scale concerning the climate impacts despite a lower sensitivity to warming of snowpack in the atlas mountains due to shallow and cold snowpack and the influence of net radiation on the snow energy and mass balance lópez moreno et al 2017 climate scenarios indicate strong impacts on snowmelt runoff however a better understanding of the snow ablation processes under climate change is needed for this region if snowmelt is the dominant process for altitudes below 3000 m snow sublimation at higher altitudes can exceed 40 schulz and de jong 2004 and this direct water loss to the atmosphere does not contribute to runoff current climate model simulations are not able to adequately reproduce these processes to quantify the relative impacts of the different components of the water balance notably to look at the water partitioning between runoff evaporation and sublimation however recent advances in regional climate modeling at convection permitting scales coppola et al 2020 open new perspectives to evaluate climate change impacts on the mountain hydrology in these regions regarding operational aspects we are developing a dss decision support system tool in the framework of morsnow 1 research program within the um6p mohammed vi poly technic university the intended dss tool will integrate a multi modelling scheme with a focus on the combined use of both ground measurement and spatial observations issued from different sensors as inputs the specific context of the ungauged basin will be taken into consideration toward earlier spring snowmelt and peak spring streamflows prediction 9 conclusion in this paper we presented an overview of the results obtained concerning our research activities on snow hydrology in the moroccan atlas mountains during the past twenty years from 2001 to 2021 we have also targeted unsolved issues to identify any challenges to be taken up to contribute to a better understanding of atlas snow hydrology to understand snowpack processes and their influence on the hydrological basin response our scientific approach was focused on the joint use of in situ measurements remote sensing of snow and modeling by taking into consideration the sparsity of ground based networks our research activities are supported by in situ data measurements that we designed within the tensift climate and water observatory our approach has evolved with the development of space technology leading to increasingly precise data in terms of spatial and temporal resolution as well as their availability for free in terms of modeling we opted for more physically based approaches in contrast with the conceptual modeling tools that were implemented in the early studies substantial results were obtained during this first phase of our work and concern the following points 1 the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover by remote sensing the dynamics of the snow cover area are characterized by very strong inter and intra annual variability both in terms of maximum and total snow cover and in terms of event distribution and season length on average it is found that the snow season occurs between november and april for the upper regions of the atlas mountains using cluster analysis of the time series of snow cover areas at the catchment level over the atlas mountains three groups of catchments were identified that have similar intra annual snowfall dynamics the first group moulouya oum erbia and sebou gathers the northern catchments whereas the second group tensift souss draa is located in the southern part finally group 3 isolates the last catchment ziz rheris located in the southeastern part of the atlas chain the analysis of the bimonthly trends in the number of snowy days revealed a tendency for accumulation in february march and a tendency for early snow melting in the spring april may 2 the impact of the north atlantic oscillation nao on the snow covered area of the main watersheds the impact of nao on the snow cover sca area is shown to be the result of the nao s influence on temperature the primary striking result is a significant positive correlation at 95 for the duration of the snow season and the date of complete ablation which means that a positive negative nao in spring may favor later earlier melting and link higher lower sca on average 3 the snowmelt contribution to the flows of the atlas rivers using different model ing approaches following the interannual and interwatershed variability of the observed snow covered area the fractions of snowmelt contributing to streamflow are also variable from one year to another and from one watershed to another it was revealed that the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow at the outlets of the watersheds varies from 15 to 51 the assimilation of remotely sensed snow cover areas can improve the estimation of the swe in this region this assimilation was performed using sentinel 2 snow cover products these results indicated that remote sensing products and global scale reanalysis such as merra 2 or era5 have reached a level of accuracy which now allows the estimation of swe distribution with physically based models in the atlas mountains even without in situ measurements 4 both modeling results and observed snow height highlighted that the snowpack has a strong annual variation in general the peak of snow height exceeds 1 m and in some seasons e g 2008 2009 water year it reaches two meters in the upper regions 3000 m a s l 5 the contribution of snowmelt to the surface and groundwater recharge using snow isotopes based on the isotopes of water and the mass balance model the contributions of precipitation rain and snow in the high atlas and the surrounding plains were established this contribution of snowmelt varies between 42 and 80 in the different areas studied these results are consistent with those obtained by modeling the contribution of snowmelt these recharge rates indicate the role of the atlas mountains and their significant snow cover in supplying water resources in surrounding semiarid areas 6 quantification of climate change impacts on snow and associated runoff from the atlas mountains the quantitative evaluation of the possible impact of future climate for the high atlas focused on the rheraya basin indicates a significant decrease in surface runoff for 2050 with a strong reduction of half of the snow accumulation related to reduced precipitation and increased temperature similar projections have been obtained for the bin ouidane catchment upstream of the tadla region following the

sufficient for applying such modeling approach that can provide useful outputs for a variety of practical hydrological studies graphical abstract ga1 keywords small and ungauged basins continuous modeling event based approach design hydrographs design simulation 1 introduction one of the common aims in hydrological studies is estimating design hydrograph characteristics e g peak discharge flood volume hydrograph shape duration presence of multiple peaks for a selected watershed such information is crucial for a variety of practical applications and environmental studies e g for designing hydraulic infrastructures or producing flood hazard maps in the last century the rapid evolution in rainfall runoff models made available to practitioners a paramount of simple e g rational formula or event based models or elaborated e g continuous or distributed models approaches typically the adopted choice is a compromise among the relevance of the study the economic resources and the availability of observations młyński et al 2019 recently it was emphasized the benefit of continuous modeling compared to the event based approach boughton and droop 2003 de luca et al 2022 the latter is usually based on a lumped model providing as output a design hydrograph with an assigned return period while the former is based on a lumped or distributed model providing as output a design simulation e g a simulated runoff time series the main difference between the two approaches is the rainfall input indeed the event based approach refers to a design storm while the continuous one refers to a long synthetic rainfall scenario in practice the benefit of the continuous modeling consists in a more realistic estimation of hydrograph volumes and in providing a simulated runoff time series that allows for a multitude of applications a direct use of synthetic runoff time series grimaldi et al 2013a sikorska et al 2018 b flood frequency analysis for estimating peak discharge de paola et al 2018 c design hydrograph estimation with multivariate approach serinaldi and grimaldi 2011 brunner et al 2017 d monte carlo analysis with the synthetic runoff time series annis et al 2020 while this promising approach is widely diffused and applied boughton and droop 2003 berthet et al 2009 beneyto et al 2020 brown et al 2022 it still needs some ameliorations mainly related to the synthetic rainfall generation however we can consider it as a well established methodology that probably will commonly be adopted in the future and will substitute the event based approach in the last years simplified versions of continuous modeling were implemented for small i e with a contributing area smaller than few hundreds of km2 and ungauged i e lacking of runoff observations basins demonstrating that also in such challenging conditions the continuous framework can provide an added value to the practitioners grimaldi et al 2012a 2013a 2021 the challenge of such approach concerns its application using the same minimal input information typically used when employing the rational formula in this work we investigate the possibility to apply a specific and simplified continuous framework cosmo4sub continuous simulation model for small and ungauged basins grimaldi et al 2012a 2021 in selected ethiopian watersheds verifying if this model can improve the hydrologic hydraulic design procedure and overcome the diffused application of the rational formula indeed it is well known in literature e g grimaldi and petroselli 2014 that the rational formula although is a useful and widely used method presents severe limitations and provides minimal output information i e only the peak discharge however in ethiopia the rational formula is commonly adopted due to its simplicity although in some areas of the country it seems that there are enough observations for applying more advanced models for instance distributed rainfall runoff models like swat hec hms or hbv have been successfully applied desta and lemma 2017 worqlul et al 2018 zelelew and melesse 2018 goshime et al 2019 leta et al 2021 it is noteworthy that in all the aforementioned applications the rainfall input data set was always available only at daily scale and not with finer temporal resolution while other input data such as digital elevation model land use and soil type information were available at appropriate resolution based on this it seems that the rainfall observation is a potential bottleneck for implementing continuous schemes often characterized by the use of rainfall timeseries at higher e g hourly resolution this manuscript aims hence in answering the following questions what is the common procedure applied in ethiopia for estimating design hydrograph characteristics peak discharge flood volume flood duration and what are the available data for the practitioners is it possible to apply the cosmo4sub model as an alternative to the rational formula and to the event based approach in order to answer these questions we provide an overview of the hydrological procedures adopted in ethiopia and the related data availability section 2 then the rational formula an event based approach eba4sub event based approach for small and ungauged basins and the cosmo4sub model are applied and compared on four case studies sections 3 and 4 in section 5 results are illustrated and commented supporting the conclusions available in section 6 2 hydrological data availability and design procedure in ethiopia ethiopia is a federal democratic republic composed by 9 national regional states nrs i e amhara tigray afar oromia somali benishangul gumuz southern nations nationalities and peoples region snnpr gambella and harari and two administrative councils i e addis ababa and dire dawa in ethiopia the official authority for meteorological observation is the national meteorology agency nma http www ethiomet gov et that was established in 1980 although since 1946 some preliminary meteorological tasks were carried out by government offices mainly in the agricultural sector regional meteorological stations have been classified by nma as first class c1 second class c2 third class c3 and fourth class c4 stations c1 stations are synoptic stations and provide hourly observations e g rainfall air and soil temperature wind evaporation c2 stations are principal or indicative stations and provide observations every three hours c3 stations are ordinary stations where only three meteorological elements are observed maximum air temperature of the day minimum air temperature of the day and total rainfall amount c4 stations are rainfall recording stations where only the daily total rainfall amount is observed in table 1 a resume of meteorological stations is reported as it can be seen from table 1 in ethiopia there are 919 meteorological stations 884 listed as active and 167 18 9 of the total active are classified as c1 i e recording hourly cumulated rainfall the average number of years of observations is equal to 44 for stations c1 c2 and to 37 for stations c3 c4 confirming that large areas have only few years of data available tamalew and kemal 2016 regarding the spatial location of the meteorological stations fig 1 they are not regularly distributed throughout the country and in some large areas of the country e g afar and somali there are only few ones this circumstance confirms that the lack of meteorological data is one of the major problems when dealing with hydrological and hydraulic applications gebreigziabher 2020 indeed design hydrograph estimation for small and ungauged basins is a critical issue and reliable estimates of flood frequency in terms of peak flows and volumes remain a current challenge in developing countries like ethiopia gebremedhin 2017 moreover in water resources planning and in rainfall runoff relationship studies the accurate estimation of basin hydrologic response is the main concern of ethiopian hydrologists as a consequence such research topic has been very active in ethiopia and the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie research and development directorate identified that most of the rivers in the country are ungauged suggesting the development of improved tools and methods to estimate the design discharge of ungauged rivers from a scientific point of view recent literature shows a growing interest in using advanced hydraulic and hydrologic models in ethiopia erena et al 2018 employed the distributed flo 2d hydrodynamic model to identify flood prone villages but the availability of rainfall records obtained from the investigated meteorological stations was limited to daily scale making necessary the application of a rainfall disaggregation model chimdessa et al 2019 assessed the impact of land use and land cover lulc change on the didessa river flow and soil loss using swat model under historical and future climates employing lulc of the years 1986 2001 and 2015 that were independently combined with the historical climate to assess their individual impacts on river flow and soil loss adem et al 2020 investigated the hydrologic response of two watersheds in the headwaters of the blue nile using three different digital soil inventories and the widely used swat model dibaba et al 2020 used first cellular automata ca markov in idrisi software to predict the future lulc scenarios and the ensemble mean of four regional climate models and then the swat model to evaluate the watershed hydrological responses under separate and combined lulc and climate change from the practitioner point of view the rational formula is probably the most commonly used method to estimate the peak discharge in ethiopia employing rainfall data synthesized in the depth duration frequency ddf curves for instance erena and worku 2019 analyzed the dynamics of lulc and resulting surface runoff management for environmental flood hazard mitigation in case of dire dawa city the study was aimed to explore the hydrological impacts of lulc changes using the rational method and four decade based satellite imagery analyzed employing erdas imagine moreover the ethiopia road authority suggests the rational formula to estimate the peak flow to construct ditches canals and other different drainage structures for applying the rational formula the ddf curves are necessary however in the case of ethiopia the amount of available rainfall data at high time resolution was too sparse for developing accurate ddf curves and was insufficient to develop a frequency distribution plot for each rainfall period era 2013 zimale and beyene 2017 therefore the ethiopian road authority era developed ddf curves based on the disaggregation of the 24 h rainfall using several methods verifying their validity with short duration rainfall where available the ddf relationship curves are highly refereed material for the design of hydraulic structures and are the most used tools in drainage design for many engineering applications in the country zimale and beyene 2017 era 2013 classified the country in eight regions where rainfall is assumed homogenous fig 2 aggregating them in four macro areas for which zimale and beyene 2017 provided empirical equations in the form of intensity duration frequency idf curves reported as in the following 1 i 389 06 tr 0 22 t p 0 65 region a 1 a 4 2 i 336 98 tr 0 21 t p 0 65 region a 2 a 3 3 i 421 47 tr 0 21 t p 0 65 region b 1 b 2 c 4 i 432 32 tr 0 22 t p 0 65 region d where i is rainfall intensity mm h tr is the return period y and tp is the rainfall duration min it is noteworthy that idf and ddf curves are strictly related each other indeed a ddf curve represents the analytical relationship for a specified return period between cumulative rainfall depth and rainfall duration while an idf curve represents the analytical relationship for the same return period between rainfall intensity and rainfall duration since rainfall intensity is defined as the ratio between cumulative rainfall depth and rainfall duration multiplying the idf curve for rainfall duration allows obtaining the ddf curve and viceversa 3 materials the case study area investigated in the present manuscript is included in the upper blue nile river basin which starts at lake tana and crosses the ethiopia sudan border the topographic feature of the blue nile river basin is highlands hills valleys and occasional rock peaks alem et al 2019 the average annual rainfall varies between 1100 mm and 1800 mm sutcliffe and parks 1999 locally the climatic seasons are defined as the dry season bega from october to february a short rain period belg from march to may and a long rainy period kiremt from june to september with the highest rainfall occurring in july and august alem et al 2019 four small watersheds chemoga koga gulda and sede see fig 3 characterized by contributing areas in the range 211 349 km2 and which are part of the upper blue nile river basin and are included in the amhara regional state have been selected for comparing the approaches described in the section 4 the elevation of the case study watersheds was retrieved by using a 30 m resolution dem acquired from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm fig 4 the elevation of chemoga watershed ranges from 2362 to 3946 m above sea level m a s l koga from 1883 to 3140 m a s l gulda from 2021 to 3653 m a s l and sede from 2374 to 3520 m a s l among the selected watersheds chemoga has the highest elevation it originates from the chockie mountain which is also called the water tower of the upper blue nile basin gulda and sede watersheds are also originated from the chockie mountain and have high elevations while koga watershed which is located in a flat area in the lake tana basin has comparatively lower elevations the analyzed watersheds have different slope fig 5 ranging from 0 to above 45 the dominant slope of the investigated watersheds is between 10 and 25 it accounts for 47 97 44 29 42 34 and 43 13 of chemoga koga gulda and sede watersheds respectively sede and koga have larger areas with slope lower than 10 17 34 and 14 35 respectively while gulda has larger areas covered by slope greater than 45 the land cover of the investigated watersheds referred to 2016 and collected from amhara design and supervision works enterprise office is shown in fig 6 the upper nile basin dominant land use is agricultural land and it covers a large portion of all the investigated watersheds 75 9 90 7 87 2 and 75

watersheds have also high tree cover areas 13 5 12 4 and 10 5 respectively from fig 7 the dominant soil types in the chemoga watershed are pellic vertisols and chromic luvisols which cover about 47 and 35 respectively of the total area chromic luvisols and eutric nitisols cover the largest area about 56 and 29 of the total area respectively of the gulda watershed dystric gleysols cover the largest area 48 of the total area in the koga watershed and are followed by chromic vertisols which cover about 25 of the total area finally regarding sede watershed pellic vertisols cover the largest area about 74 of the total area followed by chromic luvisols that cover 12 of the total area each watershed was associated with the nearest meteorological stations chemoga to debre markos station koga to dangila station sede to motta station and gulda to dembecha station see fig 4 the four rainfall stations provide daily rainfall data from 1985 to 2020 and are c3 stations following the nma classification there are also streamflow gauge stations in each outlet but they were only recently installed and so they are unable to provide useful flow data for the present analysis the mean annual rainfall estimated at dangila dembecha debre markos and motta meteorological stations was 1569 mm 1385 mm 1341 mm and 1226 mm respectively the highest rainfall is recorded at dangila meteorological station while the lowest rainfall is recorded at motta meteorological station the mean monthly rainfall shows the highest record in july at dembecha and motta stations and in august at dangila and debre markos stations december january and february have low rainfall records based on the information obtained from all the stations since the four watersheds are included in same rainfall region a2 the ddf curves derived by eq 2 are represented by the following eq 5 5 h p 23 54 t r 0 21 t p 0 35 a t p n with a 23 54 t r 0 21 and n 0 35 and where h p is the cumulative rainfall depth mm t p the rainfall duration h n and a mm hn the ddf parameters based on the assumed return period tr y in the following table 2 we report a summary description of the used data input 4 methods 4 1 the rational formula the rational formula mulvaney 1851 is probably the most known and used worldwide method to estimate the design discharge for a catchment eq 6 6 q p c t h p t c a where q p is the peak discharge m3 s c t is runoff coefficient h p is the cumulative rainfall depth m t c is the basin concentration time s here estimated by the giandotti 1934 formula a is the watershed area m2 although the method is diffuse its drawbacks are well recognized and documented in literature grimaldi and petroselli 2014 the hydraulics manual used by the ethiopian road authority for the drainage design era 2013 suggests to include one adjustment coefficient in the eq 6 for better reproducing the infiltration processes in case of high intensity storms and for better characterizing the slope land use and land type in the runoff coefficient consequently the formulation adopted in this study is expressed by eq 7 7 q p c f c t h p t c a where h p is the cumulative rainfall depth m quantified through the ddf curve eq 5 t c is the concentration time s c f is a frequency factor function of return period c t c s c p c v is the adjusted runoff coefficient where c s is based on slope c p is based on soil permeability and c p is based on land use type such coefficients are estimated using the equation available in the ethiopian road authority manual table 5 9 era 2013 and using the information shown in fig 5 slope fig 6 land use and fig 7 soil type 4 2 eba4sub the event based rainfall runoff modeling eba4sub event based approach for small and ungauged basins model is an empirical conceptual rainfall runoff model that has been developed in recent years piscopia et al 2015 for estimating the design hydrograph it consists of three steps design hyetograph estimation excess rainfall estimation and excess rainfall runoff transformation in the first step the ddf function is used for quantifying the cumulative rainfall depth h p for different return periods t r assuming as critical rainfall duration the catchment concentration time t c then the chicago hyetograph is selected for determining the design rainfall temporal distribution petroselli et al 2020a 2020b as in the rational formula the giandotti formula for estimating the concentration time and the eq 5 representing the ddf function are used also in eba4sub application in the second step the excess rainfall is estimated using the cn4ga curve number for green ampt procedure grimaldi et al 2013b cn4ga is a mixed and automatic approach that combines the curve number cn method natural resources conservation service nrcs 2008 and the green ampt physically based infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 to estimate the excess rainfall temporal distribution starting from design rainfall in the present analysis we compared the three antecedent moisture condition amc classes i dry soil ii soil in average wetness conditions and iii wet soil the only parameter to be assessed in this step is the cn ranging from 0 no runoff the whole rainfall amount becomes infiltration to 100 no infiltration the whole rainfall amount becomes runoff that is quantified based on land use fig 6 and soil type fig 7 natural resources conservation service nrcs 2008 employing the original look up tables in the third and last step the excess rainfall runoff transformation is estimated applying the wfiuh width function based instantaneous unit hydrograph based on basin travel time distribution that is automatically calculated from dem flow paths and t c value in detail surface flow velocities are calculated based on local slopes and land cover employing empirical formulas for hillslope cells and calibrating river network cells ensuring that the projection of the wfiuh center of mass on the temporal axis is equal to the basin lag time that is expressed as 60 of t c natural resources conservation service nrcs 2008 petroselli and grimaldi 2018 in summary eba4sub needs the same input data as the rational formula the eba4sub peculiarity is to provide the entire design hydrograph using a procedure that reduces the subjectivity and the sensitivity of the rational formula grimaldi and petroselli 2014 4 3 storage the synthetic rainfall timeseries as described in the introduction a continuous rainfall runoff modeling needs as input a long synthetic rainfall scenario that is transformed in the corresponding runoff scenario in the present work we used the recently released storage stochastic rainfall generator model de luca et al 2020 de luca and petroselli 2021 grimaldi et al 2022 to create the long synthetic rainfall timeseries storage is a synthetic rainfall generator srg model able to reconstruct a long up to 500 years and high resolution up to 5 min rainfall timeseries based on limited raingauge observations storage is a modified version of the neyman scott rectangular pulses nsrp stochastic rainfall model burton et al 2010 in storage five parameters play a crucial role and they are represented by the mean values for the following random variables the waiting time assumed as exponentially distributed between the occurrences of two consecutive storms the number of rain cells also named as bursts or pulses in each storm this quantity is considered as a geometric random variable the waiting time assumed as exponentially distributed between the occurrences of a storm and of an associated cell the intensity and the duration both considered as exponentially distributed of each cell inside a storm storage introduces two main innovations as respect to the basic nsrp models first the parametric estimation is carried out by using aggregated data annual maxima rainfall annual and monthly cumulative rainfall annual number of wet days which are usually more available compared to the high resolution rainfall information which are commonly considered for calibration of the basic nsrp models second the seasonality is modeled using series of goniometric functions sine and cosine this approach makes storage strongly parsimonious as respect to the use of monthly or seasonal sets for parameters as it usually occurs for basic versions of nsrp models such characteristics allow storage to be particularly promising for reconstruction of rainfall fields in data scarce areas petroselli et al 2021 it must be highlighted that the proposed case study analysis is implemented under the hypothesis of stationary processes in fact authors retained that trend analysis for observed time series could be not reliable when case studies with scarce data like in this work are investigated 4 4 cosmo4sub the continuous rainfall runoff framework the continuous rainfall runoff modeling is here carried out by using cosmo4sub model with storage results as rainfall input cosmo4sub continuous simulation model for small and ungauged basin grimaldi et al 2012a 2021 2022 is the continuous version of eba4sub model and is characterized by four steps 1 the rainfall scenario simulation 2 the excess rainfall estimation 3 the excess rainfall runoff transformation 4 the design simulation strategy regarding the first step for the proposed application the rainfall timeseries is represented by 500 years at 15 min resolution generated by storage model in stationary conditions in particular each case study is associated with a reference raingauge and the observed rainfall data are used for simulating the corresponding rainfall timeseries regarding the second step a continuous version of cn4ga is implemented it needs an additional parameter compared to the event based version named separation time ts that represents the dry period that should be waited in order to consider independent the rainfall events so that the initial abstraction become again effective previous works suggest 24 h for ts value grimaldi et al 2012a 2021 so model parameters inherent to this step are essentially cn in amc ii condition and ts the continuous version of cn4ga procedure is able to automatically assess the amc condition based on the amount of rainfall occurred in the five antecedent days and to accordingly modify the cn ii value natural resources conservation service nrcs 2008 regarding the third step the same version of the wfiuh used in the eba4sub model was used the application of the first three steps of cosmo4sub allows obtaining a 500 year runoff timeseries from which the design simulation strategy step 4 of the model can be assessed here we selected the annual maxima of peak discharge and its related hydrograph moreover we determined the peak discharge return period relationship based on the empirical distribution according the following equation 8 j n 1 1 1 t r where j 1 n represents the jth observation of the samples arranged in ascending order an tr y the return period 4 5 the comparison analysis in order to evaluate if cosmo4sub model is appropriate in ethiopian watersheds ideally we should compare the simulated results with observed data or similar information grimaldi et al 2012a 2012b however when such benchmark is not available the only possible solution is to compare the results with the typically adopted approaches and to evaluate the differences consequently the described models are applied on the investigated case studies and evaluated comparing the design peak discharge related to the following tr values 2 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 years the comparison is based on different model configurations a rational formula b eba4sub for amc i ii and iii employing the regional ddf parameters c storage cosmo4sub continuous modeling approach each model is calibration free and uses the same input information ddf functions eq 5 dem slopes land use and soil type figs 4 7 except storage adopted as input for cosmo4sub that is calibrated using 1 the specific observed data for each raingauge extracted from the continuous daily time series i e daily annual maxima am series mean annual precipitation map mean values of seasonal precipitation december january february march april may june july august september october november mean annual number of wet days manwd 2 ddf curves provided by the ethiopian road authority with regional values of a and n quantified using eq 5 ideally storage should have been calibrated referring only to the raingauge observations however we preferred to use a mixed information source point 1 and 2 this is either because the amount of observed data at high time resolution are limited and also because the regionalized ddf curves are the official reference for ethiopian practitioners 5 results and discussion concerning storage calibration figs 8 and 9 show the obtained results for debre markos raingauge for sake of brevity results for the other stations are shown in appendix a the outcomes for all the investigated raingauges highlight a satisfying reproduction for annual rainfall values monthly seasonal component and ddf curves results depicted in figs 8 and 9 and in appendix a show that storage model can effectively be employed for modeling rainfall in ethiopia region also if few rainfall data are available focusing on the application of the rational formula the eba4sub model for the three amc classes and the cosmo4sub model on the four case studies the results are summarized in tables 3 and 4 and figs 10 12 in detail table 3 includes the contributing areas cn and tc values used in the three compared models while table 4 shows the runoff coefficient adopted in the rational formula application i e the product of c f c t in eq 7 fig 10 shows the comparison among the hydrograph peak values estimated for the seven return periods gray lines refer to the three amc classes included in the eba4sub framework and in practice they offer a complete overview of all possible results since the cn values span in a very wide range peak discharges resulting from the rational formula are always lower than the corresponding obtained with eba4sub in amc ii condition this expected behavior is due to the runoff coefficient indeed although it is adjusted it underestimates the excess rainfall for extreme storms due to the proportional relationship between gross rainfall and runoff concerning the peak discharge values obtained with cosmo4sub application they are included in the range of eba4sub amc ii and amc iii this is also expected since in the continuous modeling scheme the amc is variable and related to the rainfall amount collected in the five days before the storms this is one of the benefits of the continuous approach that allows to overcome the limitation of the event based and rational formula methods offering a more realistic representation of rainfall input the obtained results are coherent with the previous related literature for instance petroselli et al 2019 determined with cosmo4sub design peak discharges that were lower than the corresponding ones obtained with eba4sub in amc iii condition but higher than the corresponding ones obtained with eba4sub in amc ii condition and highlighted the critical role of amc and how subjective the event based approach is for the design hydrograph estimation moreover grimaldi et al 2012b compared the continuous modeling with event based approaches applied with amc ii they concluded that estimations from the continuous modeling are generally greater than the corresponding ones from event based approaches with differences for 100 year return period in the range 20 40 finally winter et al 2019 highlighted that peak discharge values obtained with a continuous modeling were systematically higher than event based ones in this last contribution the authors argued that the event based approaches could not fully account for the variability of possible flood events and that their use may lead to an underestimation of peak discharge in comparison to a continuous modeling this circumstance is particularly important in applications like flood mapping where the potential damages are influenced by both flood peak and runoff volume another added value provided by cosmo4sub model is related to the hydrograph attributes indeed while the rational formula provides only the peak discharge the event based and continuous approaches estimate also the flood hydrograph shape and the related characteristics such as total volume and duration it is true that after having estimated the design peak discharge with the rational formula it could be possible to employ synthetic equations e g natural resources conservation service nrcs 1986 in order to determine the design hydrograph ascending and descending limb but this procedure does not keep in account the basin geomorphic properties providing not realistic flood volume and duration for instance in fig 11 the design hydrographs for tr 100 years obtained with the rational formula and the triangular method natural resources conservation service nrcs 1986 for determining the hydrograph shape plus with eba4sub amc ii are shown for koga case study fig 11 shows also one of the cosmo4sub annual maxima hydrographs having a peak discharge similar to the design peak discharge that is shown in fig 10 looking at fig 11 differences in the hydrograph shape affecting flood duration and total volume are evident the rational method provides a hydrograph with a potentially unrealistic duration and volume in eba4sub it is evident the irregular shape of the design hydrograph due to the wfiuh geomorphological signature of the watershed circumstance that highlights the benefit offered by eba4sub as respect to the use of the rational formula a more realistic shape is offered by cosmo4sub due to the simulated storms indeed the continuous runoff time series allows to select the extreme floods that are not constrained to the critical rainfall definition as in the eba4sub model in order to provide a further visual evidence of this fig 12 shows all the maximum annual hydrographs in terms of peak discharge generated by cosmo4sub plus the seven design hydrographs generated by eba4sub amc ii this simple comparison allows to verify that the cosmo4sub results are coherent to the eba4sub and rational formula outputs indeed we expected that the rational formula underestimates the peak discharge for high return period compared to the eba4sub model amc ii and that the cosmo4sub peak discharges are within the range of eba4sub outputs obtained with amc ii and amc iii due to the automatic amc quantification from the input synthetic rainfall time series 6 conclusions the present work aims at verifying the potentiality in ethiopia to adopt more advanced procedures for estimating design hydrographs in small basins as respect to the use of the rational formula that is commonly used in the country indeed the review of the currently available hydrological information confirmed a limited amount of observed rainfall data and the absence of discharge observations circumstance that would justify the use of the rational formula hence a comparison among three rainfall runoff models has been performed for four case studies specifically the widely used rational formula an event based approach eba4sub model and a continuous framework specifically tailored for small and ungauged basins cosmo4sub model have been applied on chemoga koga gulda and sede catchments located in the upper blue nile basin for estimating the design hydrographs related to various return periods spanning in the range 2 200 years the comparison allows for verifying the behavior of advanced models as respect to the rational formula results are in line each other reproducing expected differences the underestimation of peak discharges resulting from rational formula and more realistic peak discharge values offered by cosmo4sub that can optimize the available rainfall information for identifying the soil moisture condition before the storm moreover the added values of the continuous framework is emphasized showing the variety of available hydrographs characterized by realistic shapes the obtained results support the conclusion that ethiopia has enough hydrological information for implementing simplified continuous modeling in the country however we realize that an effort could be made for improving the rainfall observations providing a more homogeneous raingauge network useful for updating the regional ddf curves parameters moreover the quality of the instrumentation for assuring sub daily monitoring crucial for rainfall simulation models could be enhanced as well declaration of competing

framework a simplified continuous rainfall runoff model specifically tailored for small and ungauged basins can be applied in ethiopia indeed the minimal information available in the country are sufficient for applying such modeling approach that can provide useful outputs for a variety of practical hydrological studies graphical abstract ga1 keywords small and ungauged basins continuous modeling event based approach design hydrographs design simulation 1 introduction one of the common aims in hydrological studies is estimating design hydrograph characteristics e g peak discharge flood volume hydrograph shape duration presence of multiple peaks for a selected watershed such information is crucial for a variety of practical applications and environmental studies e g for designing hydraulic infrastructures or producing flood hazard maps in the last century the rapid evolution in rainfall runoff models made available to practitioners a paramount of simple e g rational formula or event based models or elaborated e g continuous or distributed models approaches typically the adopted choice is a compromise among the relevance of the study the economic resources and the availability of observations młyński et al 2019 recently it was emphasized the benefit of continuous modeling compared to the event based approach boughton and droop 2003 de luca et al 2022 the latter is usually based on a lumped model providing as output a design hydrograph with an assigned return period while the former is based on a lumped or distributed model providing as output a design simulation e g a simulated runoff time series the main difference between the two approaches is the rainfall input indeed the event based approach refers to a design storm while the continuous one refers to a long synthetic rainfall scenario in practice the benefit of the continuous modeling consists in a more realistic estimation of hydrograph volumes and in providing a simulated runoff time series that allows for a multitude of applications a direct use of synthetic runoff time series grimaldi et al 2013a sikorska et al 2018 b flood frequency analysis for estimating peak discharge de paola et al 2018 c design hydrograph estimation with multivariate approach serinaldi and grimaldi 2011 brunner et al 2017 d monte carlo analysis with the synthetic runoff time series annis et al 2020 while this promising approach is widely diffused and applied boughton and droop 2003 berthet et al 2009 beneyto et al 2020 brown et al 2022 it still needs some ameliorations mainly related to the synthetic rainfall generation however we can consider it as a well established methodology that probably will commonly be adopted in the future and will substitute the event based approach in the last years simplified versions of continuous modeling were implemented for small i e with a contributing area smaller than few hundreds of km2 and ungauged i e lacking of runoff observations basins demonstrating that also in such challenging conditions the continuous framework can provide an added value to the practitioners grimaldi et al 2012a 2013a 2021 the challenge of such approach concerns its application using the same minimal input information typically used when employing the rational formula in this work we investigate the possibility to apply a specific and simplified continuous framework cosmo4sub continuous simulation model for small and ungauged basins grimaldi et al 2012a 2021 in selected ethiopian watersheds verifying if this model can improve the hydrologic hydraulic design procedure and overcome the diffused application of the rational formula indeed it is well known in literature e g grimaldi and petroselli 2014 that the rational formula although is a useful and widely used method presents severe limitations and provides minimal output information i e only the peak discharge however in ethiopia the rational formula is commonly adopted due to its simplicity although in some areas of the country it seems that there are enough observations for applying more advanced models for instance distributed rainfall runoff models like swat hec hms or hbv have been successfully applied desta and lemma 2017 worqlul et al 2018 zelelew and melesse 2018 goshime et al 2019 leta et al 2021 it is noteworthy that in all the aforementioned applications the rainfall input data set was always available only at daily scale and not with finer temporal resolution while other input data such as digital elevation model land use and soil type information were available at appropriate resolution based on this it seems that the rainfall observation is a potential bottleneck for implementing continuous schemes often characterized by the use of rainfall timeseries at higher e g hourly resolution this manuscript aims hence in answering the following questions what is the common procedure applied in ethiopia for estimating design hydrograph characteristics peak discharge flood volume flood duration and what are the available data for the practitioners is it possible to apply the cosmo4sub model as an alternative to the rational formula and to the event based approach in order to answer these questions we provide an overview of the hydrological procedures adopted in ethiopia and the related data availability section 2 then the rational formula an event based approach eba4sub event based approach for small and ungauged basins and the cosmo4sub model are applied and compared on four case studies sections 3 and 4 in section 5 results are illustrated and commented supporting the conclusions available in section 6 2 hydrological data availability and design procedure in ethiopia ethiopia is a federal democratic republic composed by 9 national regional states nrs i e amhara tigray afar oromia somali benishangul gumuz southern nations nationalities and peoples region snnpr gambella and harari and two administrative councils i e addis ababa and dire dawa in ethiopia the official authority for meteorological observation is the national meteorology agency nma http www ethiomet gov et that was established in 1980 although since 1946 some preliminary meteorological tasks were carried out by government offices mainly in the agricultural sector regional meteorological stations have been classified by nma as first class c1 second class c2 third class c3 and fourth class c4 stations c1 stations are synoptic stations and provide hourly observations e g rainfall air and soil temperature wind evaporation c2 stations are principal or indicative stations and provide observations every three hours c3 stations are ordinary stations where only three meteorological elements are observed maximum air temperature of the day minimum air temperature of the day and total rainfall amount c4 stations are rainfall recording stations where only the daily total rainfall amount is observed in table 1 a resume of meteorological stations is reported as it can be seen from table 1 in ethiopia there are 919 meteorological stations 884 listed as active and 167 18 9 of the total active are classified as c1 i e recording hourly cumulated rainfall the average number of years of observations is equal to 44 for stations c1 c2 and to 37 for stations c3 c4 confirming that large areas have only few years of data available tamalew and kemal 2016 regarding the spatial location of the meteorological stations fig 1 they are not regularly distributed throughout the country and in some large areas of the country e g afar and somali there are only few ones this circumstance confirms that the lack of meteorological data is one of the major problems when dealing with hydrological and hydraulic applications gebreigziabher 2020 indeed design hydrograph estimation for small and ungauged basins is a critical issue and reliable estimates of flood frequency in terms of peak flows and volumes remain a current challenge in developing countries like ethiopia gebremedhin 2017 moreover in water resources planning and in rainfall runoff relationship studies the accurate estimation of basin hydrologic response is the main concern of ethiopian hydrologists as a consequence such research topic has been very active in ethiopia and the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie research and development directorate identified that most of the rivers in the country are ungauged suggesting the development of improved tools and methods to estimate the design discharge of ungauged rivers from a scientific point of view recent literature shows a growing interest in using advanced hydraulic and hydrologic models in ethiopia erena et al 2018 employed the distributed flo 2d hydrodynamic model to identify flood prone villages but the availability of rainfall records obtained from the investigated meteorological stations was limited to daily scale making necessary the application of a rainfall disaggregation model chimdessa et al 2019 assessed the impact of land use and land cover lulc change on the didessa river flow and soil loss using swat model under historical and future climates employing lulc of the years 1986 2001 and 2015 that were independently combined with the historical climate to assess their individual impacts on river flow and soil loss adem et al 2020 investigated the hydrologic response of two watersheds in the headwaters of the blue nile using three different digital soil inventories and the widely used swat model dibaba et al 2020 used first cellular automata ca markov in idrisi software to predict the future lulc scenarios and the ensemble mean of four regional climate models and then the swat model to evaluate the watershed hydrological responses under separate and combined lulc and climate change from the practitioner point of view the rational formula is probably the most commonly used method to estimate the peak discharge in ethiopia employing rainfall data synthesized in the depth duration frequency ddf curves for instance erena and worku 2019 analyzed the dynamics of lulc and resulting surface runoff management for environmental flood hazard mitigation in case of dire dawa city the study was aimed to explore the hydrological impacts of lulc changes using the rational method and four decade based satellite imagery analyzed employing erdas imagine moreover the ethiopia road authority suggests the rational formula to estimate the peak flow to construct ditches canals and other different drainage structures for applying the rational formula the ddf curves are necessary however in the case of ethiopia the amount of available rainfall data at high time resolution was too sparse for developing accurate ddf curves and was insufficient to develop a frequency distribution plot for each rainfall period era 2013 zimale and beyene 2017 therefore the ethiopian road authority era developed ddf curves based on the disaggregation of the 24 h rainfall using several methods verifying their validity with short duration rainfall where available the ddf relationship curves are highly refereed material for the design of hydraulic structures and are the most used tools in drainage design for many engineering applications in the country zimale and beyene 2017 era 2013 classified the country in eight regions where rainfall is assumed homogenous fig 2 aggregating them in four macro areas for which zimale and beyene 2017 provided empirical equations in the form of intensity duration frequency idf curves reported as in the following 1 i 389 06 tr 0 22 t p 0 65 region a 1 a 4 2 i 336 98 tr 0 21 t p 0 65 region a 2 a 3 3 i 421 47 tr 0 21 t p 0 65 region b 1 b 2 c 4 i 432 32 tr 0 22 t p 0 65 region d where i is rainfall intensity mm h tr is the return period y and tp is the rainfall duration min it is noteworthy that idf and ddf curves are strictly related each other indeed a ddf curve represents the analytical relationship for a specified return period between cumulative rainfall depth and rainfall duration while an idf curve represents the analytical relationship for the same return period between rainfall intensity and rainfall duration since rainfall intensity is defined as the ratio between cumulative rainfall depth and rainfall duration multiplying the idf curve for rainfall duration allows obtaining the ddf curve and viceversa 3 materials the case study area investigated in the present manuscript is included in the upper blue nile river basin which starts at lake tana and crosses the ethiopia sudan border the topographic feature of the blue nile river basin is highlands hills valleys and occasional rock peaks alem et al 2019 the average annual rainfall varies between 1100 mm and 1800 mm sutcliffe and parks 1999 locally the climatic seasons are defined as the dry season bega from october to february a short rain period belg from march to may and a long rainy period kiremt from june to september with the highest rainfall occurring in july and august alem et al 2019 four small watersheds chemoga koga gulda and sede see fig 3 characterized by contributing areas in the range 211 349 km2 and which are part of the upper blue nile river basin and are included in the amhara regional state have been selected for comparing the approaches described in the section 4 the elevation of the case study watersheds was retrieved by using a 30 m resolution dem acquired from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm fig 4 the elevation of chemoga watershed ranges from 2362 to 3946 m above sea level m a s l koga from 1883 to 3140 m a s l gulda from 2021 to 3653 m a s l and sede from 2374 to 3520 m a s l among the selected watersheds chemoga has the highest elevation it originates from the chockie mountain which is also called the water tower of the upper blue nile basin gulda and sede watersheds are also originated from the chockie mountain and have high elevations while koga watershed which is located in a flat area in the lake tana basin has comparatively lower elevations the analyzed watersheds have different slope fig 5 ranging from 0 to above 45 the dominant slope of the investigated watersheds is between 10 and 25 it accounts for 47 97 44 29 42 34 and 43 13 of chemoga koga gulda and sede watersheds respectively sede and koga have larger areas with slope lower than 10 17 34 and 14 35 respectively while gulda has larger areas covered by slope greater than 45 the land cover of the investigated watersheds referred to 2016 and collected from amhara design and supervision works enterprise office is shown in fig 6 the upper nile basin dominant land use is agricultural land and it covers a large portion of all the investigated watersheds 75 9 90 7 87 2 and 75

watersheds have also high tree cover areas 13 5 12 4 and 10 5 respectively from fig 7 the dominant soil types in the chemoga watershed are pellic vertisols and chromic luvisols which cover about 47 and 35 respectively of the total area chromic luvisols and eutric nitisols cover the largest area about 56 and 29 of the total area respectively of the gulda watershed dystric gleysols cover the largest area 48 of the total area in the koga watershed and are followed by chromic vertisols which cover about 25 of the total area finally regarding sede watershed pellic vertisols cover the largest area about 74 of the total area followed by chromic luvisols that cover 12 of the total area each watershed was associated with the nearest meteorological stations chemoga to debre markos station koga to dangila station sede to motta station and gulda to dembecha station see fig 4 the four rainfall stations provide daily rainfall data from 1985 to 2020 and are c3 stations following the nma classification there are also streamflow gauge stations in each outlet but they were only recently installed and so they are unable to provide useful flow data for the present analysis the mean annual rainfall estimated at dangila dembecha debre markos and motta meteorological stations was 1569 mm 1385 mm 1341 mm and 1226 mm respectively the highest rainfall is recorded at dangila meteorological station while the lowest rainfall is recorded at motta meteorological station the mean monthly rainfall shows the highest record in july at dembecha and motta stations and in august at dangila and debre markos stations december january and february have low rainfall records based on the information obtained from all the stations since the four watersheds are included in same rainfall region a2 the ddf curves derived by eq 2 are represented by the following eq 5 5 h p 23 54 t r 0 21 t p 0 35 a t p n with a 23 54 t r 0 21 and n 0 35 and where h p is the cumulative rainfall depth mm t p the rainfall duration h n and a mm hn the ddf parameters based on the assumed return period tr y in the following table 2 we report a summary description of the used data input 4 methods 4 1 the rational formula the rational formula mulvaney 1851 is probably the most known and used worldwide method to estimate the design discharge for a catchment eq 6 6 q p c t h p t c a where q p is the peak discharge m3 s c t is runoff coefficient h p is the cumulative rainfall depth m t c is the basin concentration time s here estimated by the giandotti 1934 formula a is the watershed area m2 although the method is diffuse its drawbacks are well recognized and documented in literature grimaldi and petroselli 2014 the hydraulics manual used by the ethiopian road authority for the drainage design era 2013 suggests to include one adjustment coefficient in the eq 6 for better reproducing the infiltration processes in case of high intensity storms and for better characterizing the slope land use and land type in the runoff coefficient consequently the formulation adopted in this study is expressed by eq 7 7 q p c f c t h p t c a where h p is the cumulative rainfall depth m quantified through the ddf curve eq 5 t c is the concentration time s c f is a frequency factor function of return period c t c s c p c v is the adjusted runoff coefficient where c s is based on slope c p is based on soil permeability and c p is based on land use type such coefficients are estimated using the equation available in the ethiopian road authority manual table 5 9 era 2013 and using the information shown in fig 5 slope fig 6 land use and fig 7 soil type 4 2 eba4sub the event based rainfall runoff modeling eba4sub event based approach for small and ungauged basins model is an empirical conceptual rainfall runoff model that has been developed in recent years piscopia et al 2015 for estimating the design hydrograph it consists of three steps design hyetograph estimation excess rainfall estimation and excess rainfall runoff transformation in the first step the ddf function is used for quantifying the cumulative rainfall depth h p for different return periods t r assuming as critical rainfall duration the catchment concentration time t c then the chicago hyetograph is selected for determining the design rainfall temporal distribution petroselli et al 2020a 2020b as in the rational formula the giandotti formula for estimating the concentration time and the eq 5 representing the ddf function are used also in eba4sub application in the second step the excess rainfall is estimated using the cn4ga curve number for green ampt procedure grimaldi et al 2013b cn4ga is a mixed and automatic approach that combines the curve number cn method natural resources conservation service nrcs 2008 and the green ampt physically based infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 to estimate the excess rainfall temporal distribution starting from design rainfall in the present analysis we compared the three antecedent moisture condition amc classes i dry soil ii soil in average wetness conditions and iii wet soil the only parameter to be assessed in this step is the cn ranging from 0 no runoff the whole rainfall amount becomes infiltration to 100 no infiltration the whole rainfall amount becomes runoff that is quantified based on land use fig 6 and soil type fig 7 natural resources conservation service nrcs 2008 employing the original look up tables in the third and last step the excess rainfall runoff transformation is estimated applying the wfiuh width function based instantaneous unit hydrograph based on basin travel time distribution that is automatically calculated from dem flow paths and t c value in detail surface flow velocities are calculated based on local slopes and land cover employing empirical formulas for hillslope cells and calibrating river network cells ensuring that the projection of the wfiuh center of mass on the temporal axis is equal to the basin lag time that is expressed as 60 of t c natural resources conservation service nrcs 2008 petroselli and grimaldi 2018 in summary eba4sub needs the same input data as the rational formula the eba4sub peculiarity is to provide the entire design hydrograph using a procedure that reduces the subjectivity and the sensitivity of the rational formula grimaldi and petroselli 2014 4 3 storage the synthetic rainfall timeseries as described in the introduction a continuous rainfall runoff modeling needs as input a long synthetic rainfall scenario that is transformed in the corresponding runoff scenario in the present work we used the recently released storage stochastic rainfall generator model de luca et al 2020 de luca and petroselli 2021 grimaldi et al 2022 to create the long synthetic rainfall timeseries storage is a synthetic rainfall generator srg model able to reconstruct a long up to 500 years and high resolution up to 5 min rainfall timeseries based on limited raingauge observations storage is a modified version of the neyman scott rectangular pulses nsrp stochastic rainfall model burton et al 2010 in storage five parameters play a crucial role and they are represented by the mean values for the following random variables the waiting time assumed as exponentially distributed between the occurrences of two consecutive storms the number of rain cells also named as bursts or pulses in each storm this quantity is considered as a geometric random variable the waiting time assumed as exponentially distributed between the occurrences of a storm and of an associated cell the intensity and the duration both considered as exponentially distributed of each cell inside a storm storage introduces two main innovations as respect to the basic nsrp models first the parametric estimation is carried out by using aggregated data annual maxima rainfall annual and monthly cumulative rainfall annual number of wet days which are usually more available compared to the high resolution rainfall information which are commonly considered for calibration of the basic nsrp models second the seasonality is modeled using series of goniometric functions sine and cosine this approach makes storage strongly parsimonious as respect to the use of monthly or seasonal sets for parameters as it usually occurs for basic versions of nsrp models such characteristics allow storage to be particularly promising for reconstruction of rainfall fields in data scarce areas petroselli et al 2021 it must be highlighted that the proposed case study analysis is implemented under the hypothesis of stationary processes in fact authors retained that trend analysis for observed time series could be not reliable when case studies with scarce data like in this work are investigated 4 4 cosmo4sub the continuous rainfall runoff framework the continuous rainfall runoff modeling is here carried out by using cosmo4sub model with storage results as rainfall input cosmo4sub continuous simulation model for small and ungauged basin grimaldi et al 2012a 2021 2022 is the continuous version of eba4sub model and is characterized by four steps 1 the rainfall scenario simulation 2 the excess rainfall estimation 3 the excess rainfall runoff transformation 4 the design simulation strategy regarding the first step for the proposed application the rainfall timeseries is represented by 500 years at 15 min resolution generated by storage model in stationary conditions in particular each case study is associated with a reference raingauge and the observed rainfall data are used for simulating the corresponding rainfall timeseries regarding the second step a continuous version of cn4ga is implemented it needs an additional parameter compared to the event based version named separation time ts that represents the dry period that should be waited in order to consider independent the rainfall events so that the initial abstraction become again effective previous works suggest 24 h for ts value grimaldi et al 2012a 2021 so model parameters inherent to this step are essentially cn in amc ii condition and ts the continuous version of cn4ga procedure is able to automatically assess the amc condition based on the amount of rainfall occurred in the five antecedent days and to accordingly modify the cn ii value natural resources conservation service nrcs 2008 regarding the third step the same version of the wfiuh used in the eba4sub model was used the application of the first three steps of cosmo4sub allows obtaining a 500 year runoff timeseries from which the design simulation strategy step 4 of the model can be assessed here we selected the annual maxima of peak discharge and its related hydrograph moreover we determined the peak discharge return period relationship based on the empirical distribution according the following equation 8 j n 1 1 1 t r where j 1 n represents the jth observation of the samples arranged in ascending order an tr y the return period 4 5 the comparison analysis in order to evaluate if cosmo4sub model is appropriate in ethiopian watersheds ideally we should compare the simulated results with observed data or similar information grimaldi et al 2012a 2012b however when such benchmark is not available the only possible solution is to compare the results with the typically adopted approaches and to evaluate the differences consequently the described models are applied on the investigated case studies and evaluated comparing the design peak discharge related to the following tr values 2 5 10 20 50 100 and 200 years the comparison is based on different model configurations a rational formula b eba4sub for amc i ii and iii employing the regional ddf parameters c storage cosmo4sub continuous modeling approach each model is calibration free and uses the same input information ddf functions eq 5 dem slopes land use and soil type figs 4 7 except storage adopted as input for cosmo4sub that is calibrated using 1 the specific observed data for each raingauge extracted from the continuous daily time series i e daily annual maxima am series mean annual precipitation map mean values of seasonal precipitation december january february march april may june july august september october november mean annual number of wet days manwd 2 ddf curves provided by the ethiopian road authority with regional values of a and n quantified using eq 5 ideally storage should have been calibrated referring only to the raingauge observations however we preferred to use a mixed information source point 1 and 2 this is either because the amount of observed data at high time resolution are limited and also because the regionalized ddf curves are the official reference for ethiopian practitioners 5 results and discussion concerning storage calibration figs 8 and 9 show the obtained results for debre markos raingauge for sake of brevity results for the other stations are shown in appendix a the outcomes for all the investigated raingauges highlight a satisfying reproduction for annual rainfall values monthly seasonal component and ddf curves results depicted in figs 8 and 9 and in appendix a show that storage model can effectively be employed for modeling rainfall in ethiopia region also if few rainfall data are available focusing on the application of the rational formula the eba4sub model for the three amc classes and the cosmo4sub model on the four case studies the results are summarized in tables 3 and 4 and figs 10 12 in detail table 3 includes the contributing areas cn and tc values used in the three compared models while table 4 shows the runoff coefficient adopted in the rational formula application i e the product of c f c t in eq 7 fig 10 shows the comparison among the hydrograph peak values estimated for the seven return periods gray lines refer to the three amc classes included in the eba4sub framework and in practice they offer a complete overview of all possible results since the cn values span in a very wide range peak discharges resulting from the rational formula are always lower than the corresponding obtained with eba4sub in amc ii condition this expected behavior is due to the runoff coefficient indeed although it is adjusted it underestimates the excess rainfall for extreme storms due to the proportional relationship between gross rainfall and runoff concerning the peak discharge values obtained with cosmo4sub application they are included in the range of eba4sub amc ii and amc iii this is also expected since in the continuous modeling scheme the amc is variable and related to the rainfall amount collected in the five days before the storms this is one of the benefits of the continuous approach that allows to overcome the limitation of the event based and rational formula methods offering a more realistic representation of rainfall input the obtained results are coherent with the previous related literature for instance petroselli et al 2019 determined with cosmo4sub design peak discharges that were lower than the corresponding ones obtained with eba4sub in amc iii condition but higher than the corresponding ones obtained with eba4sub in amc ii condition and highlighted the critical role of amc and how subjective the event based approach is for the design hydrograph estimation moreover grimaldi et al 2012b compared the continuous modeling with event based approaches applied with amc ii they concluded that estimations from the continuous modeling are generally greater than the corresponding ones from event based approaches with differences for 100 year return period in the range 20 40 finally winter et al 2019 highlighted that peak discharge values obtained with a continuous modeling were systematically higher than event based ones in this last contribution the authors argued that the event based approaches could not fully account for the variability of possible flood events and that their use may lead to an underestimation of peak discharge in comparison to a continuous modeling this circumstance is particularly important in applications like flood mapping where the potential damages are influenced by both flood peak and runoff volume another added value provided by cosmo4sub model is related to the hydrograph attributes indeed while the rational formula provides only the peak discharge the event based and continuous approaches estimate also the flood hydrograph shape and the related characteristics such as total volume and duration it is true that after having estimated the design peak discharge with the rational formula it could be possible to employ synthetic equations e g natural resources conservation service nrcs 1986 in order to determine the design hydrograph ascending and descending limb but this procedure does not keep in account the basin geomorphic properties providing not realistic flood volume and duration for instance in fig 11 the design hydrographs for tr 100 years obtained with the rational formula and the triangular method natural resources conservation service nrcs 1986 for determining the hydrograph shape plus with eba4sub amc ii are shown for koga case study fig 11 shows also one of the cosmo4sub annual maxima hydrographs having a peak discharge similar to the design peak discharge that is shown in fig 10 looking at fig 11 differences in the hydrograph shape affecting flood duration and total volume are evident the rational method provides a hydrograph with a potentially unrealistic duration and volume in eba4sub it is evident the irregular shape of the design hydrograph due to the wfiuh geomorphological signature of the watershed circumstance that highlights the benefit offered by eba4sub as respect to the use of the rational formula a more realistic shape is offered by cosmo4sub due to the simulated storms indeed the continuous runoff time series allows to select the extreme floods that are not constrained to the critical rainfall definition as in the eba4sub model in order to provide a further visual evidence of this fig 12 shows all the maximum annual hydrographs in terms of peak discharge generated by cosmo4sub plus the seven design hydrographs generated by eba4sub amc ii this simple comparison allows to verify that the cosmo4sub results are coherent to the eba4sub and rational formula outputs indeed we expected that the rational formula underestimates the peak discharge for high return period compared to the eba4sub model amc ii and that the cosmo4sub peak discharges are within the range of eba4sub outputs obtained with amc ii and amc iii due to the automatic amc quantification from the input synthetic rainfall time series 6 conclusions the present work aims at verifying the potentiality in ethiopia to adopt more advanced procedures for estimating design hydrographs in small basins as respect to the use of the rational formula that is commonly used in the country indeed the review of the currently available hydrological information confirmed a limited amount of observed rainfall data and the absence of discharge observations circumstance that would justify the use of the rational formula hence a comparison among three rainfall runoff models has been performed for four case studies specifically the widely used rational formula an event based approach eba4sub model and a continuous framework specifically tailored for small and ungauged basins cosmo4sub model have been applied on chemoga koga gulda and sede catchments located in the upper blue nile basin for estimating the design hydrographs related to various return periods spanning in the range 2 200 years the comparison allows for verifying the behavior of advanced models as respect to the rational formula results are in line each other reproducing expected differences the underestimation of peak discharges resulting from rational formula and more realistic peak discharge values offered by cosmo4sub that can optimize the available rainfall information for identifying the soil moisture condition before the storm moreover the added values of the continuous framework is emphasized showing the variety of available hydrographs characterized by realistic shapes the obtained results support the conclusion that ethiopia has enough hydrological information for implementing simplified continuous modeling in the country however we realize that an effort could be made for improving the rainfall observations providing a more homogeneous raingauge network useful for updating the regional ddf curves parameters moreover the quality of the instrumentation for assuring sub daily monitoring crucial for rainfall simulation models could be enhanced as well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this
