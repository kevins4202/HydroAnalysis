10855,young non bearing olive trees were grown in drainage lysimeters and their water consumption was measured over two consecutive yearly experimental periods to analyze the effect ofseasonal variations on the basal crop coefficient kcb micro lysimeter measurements were used to quantify soil evaporation es and es was subtracted from evapotranspiration etc to determine transpiration monthly mean kcb were determined as etc es eto where eto is the fao pm grass reference evapotranspiration calculated from locally measured weather data the observed kcb value at mid season 0 38 was obtained in the fall months with 41 of canopy cover the mid season kcb when adjusted to the fao 56 standard climate was 0 43 seasonal patterns of kcb are presented and the kcb value during the mid season growth stage was found to be similar to those described in the literature for mediterranean climates variation of the basal crop coefficient was satisfactorily explained by measured canopy light interception fir and a linear regression model is presented for kcb as a function of fir keywords evapotranspiration crop coefficients soil water content irrigation requirements olea europea l 1 introduction olive trees have been historically cultivated as a dryland crop because of their high resistance to drought presently the use of irrigation for olives has expanded within the intensive arid production areas surrounding the mediterranean sea gucci and fereres 2012 this practice has been spurred by research showing that irrigation increases initial growth rates and ultimately produces higher olive yields than under rain fed conditions fernández and moreno 1999 girona et al 2002a moriana et al 2003 the traditional olive growing region is the mediterranean basin where spain italy and greece are the main producing countries recently argentina chile and australia among other countries have joined the olive production sector fao 2015 over the past decade olive production has steadily increased in uruguay due in part to its temperate and sub humid climate but also to the availability of land unsuitable for economic production of annual crops uruguay has a strategic advantage as an olive producing country because of its proximity and the establishment of trade agreements with large consumer markets like brazil the united states and canada asolur 2015 because of the rapid expansion of olive production in uruguay research is needed to develop crop management practices for its unique climatic conditions uruguay has a mean annual rainfall of 1200 mm but that rainfall exhibits high inter annual variability castaño et al 2011 with periods of excess rainfall interspersed with frequent drought periods thus appropriate irrigation management based on actual crop water requirements is a necessity most studies on the crop evapotranspiration etc soil water balance and irrigation of olive trees were developed in arid and semi arid climates local data of the seasonal variation of etc in olive plantations are essential for matching irrigation to meet the volume and frequency of the crop water requirements fao publication 24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 formalized the calculation of crop evapotranspiration as the product of a reference evapotranspiration eto and a crop coefficient this approach has been refined and expanded in subsequent publications allen et al 1998 jensen and allen 2016 eto was defined as the potential evapotranspiration from a well water grass surface under standardized field measurement conditions crop coefficients kc are the ratio between measured etc and eto the concept was derived under the assumption that weather effects on crop evapotranspiration are mostly explained by the variation in eto while kc is mostly a function of the type of vegetation and the evolution of the vegetation cover over a crop growing season this concept has allowed to extrapolate the use crop coefficients developed under particular agroclimatic conditions to other conditions for example in the absence of locally developed values approximate kc can be derived for local conditions using the algorithms and tables provided by allen et al 1998 however it is well understood that the kc for crops varies as a function of a the fraction of solar radiation intercepted by the canopy fir ayars et al 2003 girona et al 2011 testi et al 2004 williams and ayars 2005 b the proportion of wetted soil exposed to evaporation allen et al 1998 pereira 2004 and c stomatal conductance and its relationship with weather variables such as the vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed and temperature moriana et al 2002 villalobos et al 2000 2013 these variables are more likely to affect the determination of crop coefficients for orchard crops mainly because of the differences between tree canopy height and reference grass height and the differences in canopy architecture for different tree species and planting systems many olive researchers have assumed or proposed a constant kc of about 0 55 0 74 to estimate water requirements for irrigated plantations throughout the year in arid and semiarid climates goldhamer and dunai 1994 girona et al 2002a grattan et al 2006 others working under arid and semi arid conditions have reported a seasonal variation of kc with low values in summer months and high values in fall and spring months depending in which season the rains occur gucci and fereres 2012 orgaz and fereres 2008 testi et al 2006 most of these kc studies with olive have been carried out in andalusia spain and california usa where summers are hot dry and vapor pressure deficit can exceed 3 0 3 5 kpa these conditions are unlike those of uruguay where the daily mean temperature rarely exceeds 30 c and the maximum vapor pressure deficit rarely exceeds 2 0 kpa villalobos et al 2013 cautioned against the use of generalized kc values for fruit trees irrespective of environmental conditions or crop management practices puppo et al 2014 conducted an etc study with olive trees growing in lysimeters under full irrigation that study found a linear relationship between the crop coefficient for the summer months and the percentage of canopy cover while that relationship is valid only for the summer months and the wetting pattern of the drippers used in that study it can be extrapolated to other conditions by differentiating between the crop transpiration and water losses by soil evaporation i e by using the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 more precise estimates of etc are needed for high frequency irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 pereira 2004 especially in climates with frequent rains and in orchards with different canopy covers in which direct soil evaporation varies significantly fereres et al 2011 several authors have advocated the use of dual coefficients with transpiration estimated through the basal crop coefficient kcb and direct soil evaporation by the evaporation coefficient ke wright 1982 jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 er raki et al 2010 fereres et al 2011 the basal crop coefficient kcb is used to estimate evapotranspiration when the soil surface is dry while transpiration is not limited by the soil water deficit allen et al 1998 various authors indicated that characterizing evapotranspiration for olive trees is inherently difficult because of physiological mechanisms that help to protect the plant from water stress connor 2005 orgaz and fereres 2008 differences in canopy architecture resulting from different planting arrangements and plant densities crop management practices and even plant to plant variations are essential factors which may have a direct effect on kcb villalobos et al 2013 carr 2013 allen and pereira 2009 proposed a method that adjusts kcb with crop height and canopy cover and ultimately with the density coefficient kd which is also influenced by the canopy density ml and the stomatal closure fr paço et al 2019 reported successful application of the allen and pereira 2009 approach to mature olive orchards this study aims to refine the results of puppo et al 2014 and improve the resulting etc estimates for a wide range of olive orchard production conditions by removing the soil evaporation component from the total measured crop evapotranspiration and deriving basal crop coefficients for the humid climatic conditions of uruguay in addition the study seeks to verify the seasonal pattern of the kcb in a temperate sub humid climate and develop a predictive tool for kcb that can be used in practical irrigation management two modeling options were explored 1 by expressing kcb as a function of days past growth initiation dpgi and 2 by relating kcb to the midday light interception 2 materials and methods 2 1 location experiment description and irrigation a two year experiment was conducted at the national agriculture research institute inia las brujas experimental station 34 40 s 56 20 w altitude of 32 m above sea level young olive trees o europea l cv arbequina were planted on september 14 2010 in drainage lysimeters according to the protocol described by puppo et al 2014 several studies have used precision weighing lysimeters to determine water consumption in woody plants including peach pear and apple trees ayars et al 2003 bryla et al 2003 girona et al 2002b 2004 2010 johnson et al 2000 2004 weighing lysimeters provide highly accurate and reliable daily evapotranspiration data drainage lysimeters are less precise but can provide reasonable average data over a time span of 7 15 days when calculated by water balance and evapotranspiration estimation between two drainage occurrences puppo et al 2014 several researchers have used drainage lysimeters to determine etc in deciduous fruit trees boland et al 1993 2000 iancu 1997 stevenson 1989 recent studies on evapotranspiration of olive trees using lysimeter measurements include ben gal et al 2010 agam et al 2013 2014 puppo et al 2014 the experimental units consisted of three fiberglass drainage lysimeters 1 9 m long x 0 9 m wide x 1 35 m deep lysimeters 1 2 and 3 equipped with 32 mm drain pipes connected to their drainage collection box the drainage tubes were installed under an 8 to 10 cm gravel layer and covered with a 0 4 mm thick geotextile layer to prevent clogging lysimeters lys 1 and 3 were planted with two year old trees and lys 2 with a four year old tree data collection for the tree in lys 2 started on day 122 after planting this additional time was needed for this older tree to recover from planting stress and completely recover its foliage the etc of lysimeter grown trees was measured over two experimental periods 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 puppo et al 2014 for simplicity this article will refer to these two periods as years 1 and 2 respectively measuring crop evapotranspiration etc is difficult under high rainfall conditions as in uruguay hence the lysimeters were protected with a rain shelter consisting of a rail mounted steel structure completely enclosed above and on all sides with a dual pitched roof the shelter was 20 m long 11 m wide 8 5 m high along the center and 6 m high on the perimeter the shelter was mounted on a rail structure which allowed the roof to automatically close whenever a logged rain gauge sensor detected more than rainfall 3 mm of rainfall after rainfall had ceased the roof was re opened manually because the shelter blocks solar radiation and affects other parameters that influence etc data for days that the shelter was closed one day before and one after were excluded from the analysis trees were treated as individual units and were not shaded by neighboring plants i e the incoming solar radiation affected all trees equally aerodynamic effects were also considered to equally influence the individual trees puppo et al 2014 in this sense allen et al 2011 indicated that in humid and sub humid climates the evapotranspiration process is more heavily influenced by the net radiation availability than by aerodynamic effects lysimeters were surrounded by a 30 m by 40 m winter cereal crop alternated with an irrigated summer cereal crop located in a 446 ha fruit and vegetable orchard in addition the experimental conditions simulate the prevailing field environmental conditions of uruguay s productive olive groves which have inter row grass cover while strong advection effects are unlikely under the conditions of the study micro advection effects are possible due to the lower height of the surrounding vegetation each lysimeter was irrigated with three pressure compensating drip emitters installed in a straight line with a 0 63 m spacing across the mid section of the lysimeter the flow rate was 4 l h 1 for each emitter irrigation frequency was daily from october to may and once or twice a week from june to september irrigation scheduling was determined using the single crop coefficient kc methodology allen et al 1998 applied with local meteorological data to calculate the grass penman monteith eto allen et al 1998 daily climatic data were provided by an automatic meteorological station vantage pro 2 davis usa located at the inia las brujas experimental station 500 m away from the experimental site the climatic station was installed complying with the installation standards on a 20 by 20 m grass crop frequently cut without lack of water and surrounded by irrigated crops the same volume of water was applied to each lysimeter each irrigation water was applied in excess of the requirements of the young olive trees to ensure water drainage in the lysimeters the irrigation amount was determined as 0 7 times the daily eto where 0 7 is the kc for adult olive trees in high density as recommended by allen and pereira 2009 the drainage system located at the bottom of each lysimeter avoided anaerobic conditions that could occur due to excess water to the trees 2 2 soil characteristics the soil at the experimental station is classified as typic argiudoll according to the usda classification system and consists of four horizons soil textural and water retention parameters were field determined for each horizon casanova 2008 and are shown in table 1 2 3 determination of crop evapotranspiration etc crop evapotranspiration was calculated over 7 to 14 day periods as the residual of the water volume balance equation 1 e t c r d δ h s where etc is the actual crop evapotranspiration from the olive tree r is the irrigation volume d is the drainage volume and δhs is the change in soil water volume irrigation and drainage water volumes were recorded daily for each lysimeter changes in soil water contents were determined with a neutron probe campbell pacific nuclear corp model 503 ca usa using a 1 m long aluminum access tube placed at the center of each lysimeter 0 20 m away from the drip emitter line and halfway between two adjacent emitters the neutron probe was calibrated gravimetrically for each soil depth as reported in puppo et al 2014 using the methodology described by haverkamp et al 1984 measurements were taken bi weekly at depths of 0 20 0 40 0 60 and 0 80 m following the protocol described previously by puppo et al 2014 calculated etc did not include data from the periods when a the amount of available water decreased by more than 50 of the total available water taw b the amount of available water increased by more than 100 taw due to blockage of the drainage system in one or more lysimeters and c rainy days in conjunction with the days immediately before and after rain event rainy days correspond to the days when the lysimeter rain shelter roof automatically closed see section 2 1 this data quality control was imposed to eliminate etc measurements that could have been affected by anaerobic conditions and or reduced photosynthesis induced by shelter closure allen et al 1998 suggest etc for olive will be reduced due to water stress after the soil water depletion fraction of the taw for the root zone reaches 0 65 the lower limit of allowable soil water depletion imposed in our study 50 helps ensure that the etc data measured for trees were obtained under only non stressed soil water conditions the daily calculated volumetric etc i e l d 1 was averaged over 7 to 14 day periods and normalized by the area defined by the distances between lysimeter grown trees 2 5 m x 5 5 m to derive etc in mm d 1 in what follows this area will be referred to as the tree grid area this approach was used because the canopy of each tree and therefore the evaporating area exceeded the area of its lysimeters the etc was examined as a function of days past growth initiation dpgi where dpgi 1 corresponds to july 11 when olive evapotranspiration rates increase in response to vegetative growth and rising temperatures in the southern hemisphere 2 4 determination of kcb and ke coefficients micro lysimeters were installed within each lysimeter to determine soil evaporation es bonachela et al 2001 paço et al 2006 determination of soil evaporation allows calculation of the basal transpiration portion of etc by subtracting es from the measured etc the micro lysimeters consisted of pvc tubing 0 084 m inner diameter and 0 12 m long as described by bonachela et al 2001 with these dimensions 1 mm of evaporated water produces a 5 5 g weight difference the devices were buried flush with the ground surface removed and capped at their bottom the micro lysimeters were weighed over 7 consecutive days which is the maximum irrigation interval in this study the micro lysimeter measurements were conducted over two summer periods in 2013 in the first period dpgi 217 to dpgi 223 two micro lysimeters were installed in the exposed wetted fraction two in the shaded wetted fraction two at the dry edge of the wetted fraction and two at the exposed dry fraction in the second period dpgi 230 to dpgi 236 since the measured evaporation was found to be negligible in the dry and dry edge of the wetted fraction a second 7 day analysis was performed in which four micro lysimeters were placed in the exposed wetted fraction and four in the shaded wetted fraction the applied volume was 48 l and 36 l a day for the first and the second period respectively the resulting wetting fraction was 3 6 of the grid area the amount of water applied at each irrigation etox0 7 was enough to fully fill the surface soil layer to field capacity and to drain excess such that the depletion of the layer was returned to the same amount of water of the previous day in each instance thus the amount of water in the layer at the start of each drying cycle was the same with each irrigation the evolution of the soil evaporation coefficient ke with time was examined for both the exposed wetted fraction and the shaded wetted fraction a mean ke value was used for the period between two consecutive irrigations based on the micro lysimeter results the soil evaporation coefficient was normalized by the tree grid area taking into account the number of days between irrigations from the ke vs time function and was then calculated as follows 2 k e k e e f e w k e s f w in eq 2 few is the exposed wetted soil fraction of the tree grid area which is the surface that accounts for most of the evaporation allen et al 1998 fw is the shaded wetted soil fraction of the tree grid area ke e is the corresponding value of the evaporation coefficient throughout the period in between irrigations for the exposed wetted fraction and ke s is the corresponding value of the evaporation coefficient for the interval between irrigations for the shaded wetted fraction the normalized soil evaporation es was calculated as 3 e s k e e t o this result was then used to calculate the normalized kcb coefficient 4 k c b e t c e s e t o where etc and es are measured crop evapotranspiration for the olive trees and direct soil evaporation respectively as normalized for the tree grid area and eto is the fao pm reference evapotranspiration where units for all are expressed in mm d 1 monthly mean kcb values were determined for year 1 and year 2 the seasonal pattern of kcb were determined for both years as a function of dpgi a kcb fao 56 style model was developed from data of year 2 only and is described further in section 2 6 a similar model was not developed for year 1 because the etc was measured starting on planting date dpgi 66 and data were not collected for lys 2 until dpgi 188 due the time needed for this tree to recover transplant stress furthermore trees sizes for the lysimeters including height and canopy cover were very different until early in the second year 2 5 measurement of vegetative growth and midday canopy light interception canopy size measurements are needed to interpret the evapotranspiration measurements and adjust the evaporation coefficient estimates with time the longitudinal and transverse diameters and the height of the canopy of each tree were measured every three months the area of the canopy was calculated assuming a circular shape from the mean diameter and the canopy cover was calculated as the ratio between the area of the canopy m2 and the tree grid area 2 5 m x 5 5 m the trees were pruned at the same time on dpgi 360 july 5 2012 at the end of the second year and each tree was fertilized in the spring with 200 g of 46 0 0 n p k one of the goals of this study is to examine the relationship between kcb and a measure of crop canopy coverage to this end the fraction of canopy light interception fir was selected fir is defined as girona et al 2011 5 f i r 1 m e a n p a r v a l u e a t g r o u n d l e v e l p a r v a l u e a b o v e c a n o p y in this expression par is the canopy light interception of photosynthetically active radiation several authors have estimated the kc of fruit trees and olives as a function of either fir or canopy coverage ayars et al 2003 girona et al 2010 testi et al 2004 williams and ayars 2005 since olive trees have a lower density of leaves than other species of fruit trees such as apples and pears allen and pereira 2009 and since the olive pruning has the main objective to favor the entry of light through the canopy for which some branches are removed garcía ortiz et al 2008 the use of fir seems reasonable in comparison with the canopy cover which takes into account the size of canopy only par was measured at solar noon 60 min on clear days with a ceptometer decagon devices inc model lp 801 wa usa probe length 86 5 cm 30 readings were obtained for each lysimeter at pre defined locations covering the tree grid area as described by girona et al 2011 the ceptometer was located at ground level and in a horizontal position the above canopy par was measured by taking a reading with the ceptometer in an open place to ensure that ceptometer measurements correspond to solar noon they need to be corrected by the solar angle with respect to the zenith as detailed in the operator s manual decagon devices inc 2010 2 6 development of relationship for kcb as a function of dpgi and fir a commonly used approach for modeling kc or kcb is as a function of the growing season duration the variation of kcb with dpgi was fitted to a four segment linear model as suggested by fao 56 allen et al 1998 hunsaker et al 2002 2007 in this approach kcb is assumed as a constant during the first time interval kcb1 this is followed by a period of increasing kcb up to a constant value kcb2 which is maintained for another period of time kcb3 after which it decreased to kcb4 the parameters were estimated using least squares and solved with the excel solver tool as suggested by wraith and or 1998 6 for dpgi dpgit1 kcb1 constant for dpgit1 dpgi dpgit2 kcb2 dpgi dpgit1 b1 constant for dpgit2 dpgi dpgit3 kcb3 b1 dpgit3 dpgit2 constant for dpgit3 dpgi kcb4 b1 dpgit3 dpgit2 b2 dpgi dpgit3 constant where dpgit1 dpgit2 y dpgit3 are the ending days for initial stage t1 crop development stage t2 and mid season stage t3 respectively the coefficients b1 and b2 are the regression coefficients for the crop development and final stages respectively as mentioned previously since the first year etc measurements were limited and plant size was very heterogeneous the kcb dpgi relationship was solely modeled using data from the second year to evaluate the evolution of fir through time the fir data were fitted as a function of dpgi the fir measurements from the two years were combined and used to calibrate kcb as a function of fir using linear regression unlike the four segment kcb model the fir model does not require a complete yearly set of kcb data i e year 1 and is not time driven for the model fitting and validation a set of 46 observations adjustment set were chosen between the two years and the three lysimeters then validation was conducted with 15 randomly chosen observations which were not used in the linear regression calibration model the statistical distribution of the residuals was analyzed with the modified shapiro wilks test to verify the absence of bias and the normality of the residuals the measured kcb values were also adjusted as a function of canopy cover to allow a clearer comparison of our data with other reported values the adjustment was made using the relationship developed for almonds by fereres et al 1981 which has also been verified to apply to olive orchards fereres et al 2011 7 k r 0 0194 c c 2 2 8119 c c 1 008 here kr is the reduction coefficient and cc is the canopy cover this reduction coefficient can be used to determine the kcb at 100 canopy cover given the kcb value measured at a particular cc for example kcb at 25 kcb 100 x kr 100 allen and pereira 2009 proposed a procedure for estimating kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end values of various crops including orchards from effective fraction of ground cover measurements and canopy height thus it seems useful to compare the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end values generated in this study with values computed with the allen and pereira 2009 procedure based on the average ground cover and average canopy height measurements of the three trees of our study the ml and the mean leaf resistance values suggested by allen and pereira 2009 for olive trees was used the software infostat p di rienzo et al 2014 was used to develop the linear regression of the kcb fir model and to develop the four segment kcb dpgi model the models were considered satisfactory when the p value was 0 05 the distribution of residuals errors was analyzed using the shapiro wilk test provided as an option in the software residuals distribution was considered normal when the shapiro wilk p value was 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 environment conditions in figs 1 and 2 displays the weekly average eto and the weekly average vpd rs and ta data for year 1 and year 2 respectively eto and the measured weather variables exhibited similar patterns of variation as a function of dpgi and peak values during the two years of the study during year 1 peak eto fao pm values were recorded in the last week of december dpgi 164 171 with a weekly mean of 7 6 mm d 1 and daily values in that week ranging from 6 6 to 8 4 mm d 1 during year 2 the weekly mean eto peaked at 7 1 mm d 1 during the first week of january dpgi 177 184 with daily values varying between 5 6 and 9 1 mm d 1 comparison of data in figs 1 and 2 clearly suggest a strong correlation between eto and any of the measured weather variables the measurements confirm that high humidity and low temperature conditions prevail in uruguay and thus the eto is relatively low the highest weekly average vpd was 2 3 kpa in year 1 while all values were below 2 0 kpa in year 2 these values are lower than those reported by villalobos et al 2013 in the range of 2 7 3 3 kpa for eight experiments conducted in different locations in spain and california the maximum values of the average weekly temperature were 26 1 and 23 4 for year 1 and year 2 respectively in contrast grattan et al 2006 indicated that the summer temperature of california often exceeds 35 c testi et al 2004 reported peak monthly eto values of 6 6 to 7 1 mm d 1 for southern spain while grattan et al 2006 reported values from 6 6 to 6 8 mm d 1 for california the peak monthly mean eto measured in this study were about 5 15 lower 6 5 and 6 1 mm d 1 for december and january 2010 2011 and 5 5 and 6 2 mm d 1 for december and january 2011 2012 respectively mean weekly eto values were also calculated from climatic data collected for the years 1997 2018 in the same area where the experiment was undertaken data not shown evaluation showed that the total yearly eto measured in years 1 and 2 of our experiment exceeded the total eto determined in all other years in this time series except for one year hence the two experimental years can be characterized as years that experienced high atmospheric crop water demand for southern uruguay 3 2 evaporation coefficient ke the wetted area due to irrigation and measured in each lysimeter which remained almost constant because the amount of irrigation water was always in excess with respect to the water requirement of the plants but proportional to the atmospheric demand eto the area of the wetted spot ranged between 0 37 and 0 86 m2 where the largest value corresponded to lys 3 that had a smaller tree than the other lysimeters the proportion of few and fw was updated every 3 months when the size of the plants was recorded the shaded wetted soil fraction fw was 1 0 from the beginning of the experiment for the lys 1 and lys 2 while fw varied between 0 88 and 1 0 in lys 3 reaching the value 1 0 at the beginning of the second year table 2 shows the direct soil evaporation es values measured with the micro lysimeters as well as eto as a function of days past irrigation and are grouped by measurement type i e exposed wetted fraction as expected evaporation was negligible in the dry area and at the dry edge of the wetted fraction table 2 as previously found in evaporation studies for drip irrigated olives by bonachela et al 2001 it is clear that these surrounding dry areas within the lysimeter do not need to be considered for the calculation of kcb evaporation was greatest for exposed wetted fraction as expected one day past irrigation measured es values for the exposed wetted fraction were about 20 less than the eto for that day this reflects a significant amount of initial evaporation from the exposed emitter areas however daily es diminished quickly relative to eto thereafter starting at three days after the irrigation and until the end of the measurement period the evaporation rate from micro lysimeters in the shaded wetted fraction was close to the evaporation rate from micro lysimeters in the exposed wetted fraction table 2 fig 3 presents the resulting evaporation coefficients computed for the drying cycle after irrigation the available energy is together with the amount of water the main driver of the evaporation process hence it makes sense that the initial values of the ke and the rate of decrease were higher in the exposed wetted fraction than the shaded wetted fraction at the end of the 7 day drying cycle the ke mean values were very similar 0 22 and 0 21 for the exposed and shaded wetted fraction respectively the equations representing the solid lines in fig 3 are 8 a k e e 0 7516 d a y s 1 008 r 2 0 72 9 b k e s 0 6018 d a y s 0 64 r 2 0 70 the determination of es by the micro lysimeter data could slightly overestimate the evaporation klocke et al 1990 if this were the case we could be slightly underestimating the tree transpiration and the resulting adjusted kcb coefficients however the wetted soil fraction in our study from which direct evaporation would be produced was very small in relation to the tree grid area thus any overestimation of actual es had a small consequence on our transpiration estimates 3 3 canopy cover soil water content and crop evapotranspiration measurements canopy cover measurements for each year and lysimeter are shown in fig 4 the tree in lys 2 was 4 years old when transplanted while the other two plants were 2 years old this explains the differences in canopy size especially in year 1 in the second year tree canopies became more alike as the season progressed in year 1 tree canopy size measurements started on dpgi 177 while etc measurements started on dpgi 188 when the four year old tree had fully recovered its foliage density plant diameter and height measurements which are not shown followed the same trends in time as the canopy measurements and also produced larger values for the tree in lysimeter 2 fig 5 presents the volumetric soil water content measured with the neutron probes and averaged for the first 60 cm of the soil profile this is the depth where roots were concentrated in this soil the wilting point was 23 and the saturated soil was 50 some periods of water deficit or excess were experienced during year 1 and those data were discarded from the analysis the figure shows that during the second year the water content was maintained at 50 or above for all but a few instances for lys 1 in which depletions was slightly above 50 depletion occasionally measured soil water content slightly exceeded field capacity for lys 3 in particular depletion was above 50 during the period of highest etc demand in year 2 for all three lysimeters as 65 depletion is considered the critical level for olive water stress allen et al 1998 we submit that etc measurements presented below were obtained under well watered conditions overall these results suggest that the number of emitters used and their location within the lysimeters did not affect the availability of water to the plants as was previously indicated the applied volume for each irrigation was expected to fully satisfy the crop water demand etc was measured starting on the planting date dpgi 66 in year 1 except in lys 2 which began on dpgi 188 in year 2 measurements were obtained throughout the entire year fig 6 shows the mean daily crop evapotranspiration values measured for each month and lysimeter note that etc peaked in january in both years dpgi 175 205 when eto fig 1 also attained maximum values larger etc values were measured during the second year of the study in response to higher trees and therefore canopy growth than in year 1 the relatively small values of etc in comparison with eto fig 1 are a consequence of the relatively small canopy in relationship to the grid area despite the difference in tree size similar etc values were measured for all trees during most months the tree in lysimeter 3 produced the smallest etc values during the development period consistent with the fact that it was also the tree with the smallest canopy 3 4 basal crop coefficient kcb fig 7 presents the resulting kcb and ke coefficients peak kcb values were recorded between dpgi 280 and dpgi 321 fall both years while minimum kcb values were recorded in late winter and early spring of the second year which spanned the full annual cycle of the olive trees this seasonal pattern of kcb agrees with the pattern reported by gucci and fereres 2012 who indicated that the relative transpiration described by kcb of olive trees shows a marked annual variation with minimum values in spring and maximum values in early fall the difference between the periods corresponding to the maximum eto values fig 1 and the maximum kcb values figs 7 and 8 determined low values of etc respect to eto values in year 1 the computed kcb values differed substantially among trees these differences however do not appear to be related to tree canopy size as lys 1 produced larger kcb values than lys 2 in year 2 the kcb values for the three trees were in better agreement with each other and results were related to tree canopy cover with peak kcb values varying between 0 37 and 0 52 fig 7 these maximum kcb values are like to those reported by villalobos et al 2000 in the mediterranean 0 44 to 0 48 for olive trees with 40 canopy cover and to the value recommended by allen and pereira 2009 0 55 for a canopy cover of 50 the ke values did not exhibit the same strong seasonality as kcb fig 7 note also that the ke values determined in this analysis were an order of magnitude smaller than the kcb values and that larger ke values were determined for the tree with the smallest canopy es was small in comparison with etc because the wetted section was small relative to the tree grid area hence despite high ke values measured in the wetted section fig 2 ke mean monthly values normalized for the tree grid were small fig 7 and nearly constant both years between 0 01 and 0 03 fig 7 although the kcb data shows some scatter due to tree size variation the olive kcb data for year 2 were described satisfactorily with the fao 56 segmented crop coefficient model after allen et al 1998 as shown in fig 8 the calculations produced an r2 of 0 83 and a mean squared error mse of 0 0021 also as shown in fig 8 the scatter of measured kcb data about the predicted curve or residuals are fairly uniform for all three trees despite the age difference for the lys 2 tree the trees had low initial kcb values up to dpgi 54 after which kcb increased linearly up to dpgi 284 crop development stage at the rate given by the regression coefficient b1 0 0013 day 1 the kcb remained fairly constant up to dpgi 325 mid season stage and then declined sharply during dpgi from 325 to 365 at a rate given by the regression coefficient b2 0 004 day 1 the trees also reached their maximum size approximately at the mid season stage with a mean ground cover of 41 fig 4 however the mid season stage was short 30 days compared to the length 60 days or more of this stage reported for some annual crops hunsaker et al 2007 yang et al 2016 and for deciduous fruit trees snyder et al 2000 ayars et al 2003 other authors have suggested that the kcb value of perennial trees and particularly olive trees is controlled by stomatal conductance villalobos et al 2000 moriana et al 2002 than by increasing foliar area fereres et al 2011 this may be a factor contributing to the short duration of the mid season kcb stage the kcb values measured in this study are comparable to values measured in other studies lópez olivari et al 2016 conducted a two year evapotranspiration study with olives planted at very high density in the maule region in chile that study site is located at nearly the same latitude as this study but with semiarid climate conditions those authors reported maximum kcb mid values of 0 28 and 0 31 for canopy cover of 29 and 31 respectively working also with drip irrigated olives testi et al 2004 reported a kc of 0 30 for periods without rain and when the soil surface was dry under these conditions the coefficient reported by these authors can be regarded as equivalent to kcb however those results were measured when canopy cover was only 25 hence to compare the kcb values measured in this study with those of testi et al 2004 the kcb data were adjusted considering canopy cover and using eq 7 according to this adjustment the kcb for our trees at 100 canopy cover would be 0 46 which is close to the kcb value of testi et al 2004 0 52 when adjusted at 100 canopy cover it should be noted that comparisons between our results and those of previous studies are based on non standardized kcb values as those reports did not use the fao 56 standardization procedure using our average measured weather data and crop heights shown in table 3 our observed kcb values for mid season and end of season were adjusted to the standard climatic conditions of fao 56 i e rhmin 45 and u2 2 m s the resulting values are kcb mid std 0 43 and kcb end std 0 27 these are smaller than the tabulated kcb values presented in fao 56 0 55 0 65 0 65 respectively for olives trees the standardized values in fao 56 were observed for more mature trees having canopy cover 40 60 3 5 estimating basal crop coefficient from effective fraction of ground cover and height results of kcb derived from ground cover and canopy height measurements allen and pereira 2009 are shown in table 3 the predicted kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end were larger than our fao 56 kcb values derived from measurements especially kcb for the initial stage which was only 0 08 however these differences in kcb seems reasonable given the relatively young trees and the humid conditions of this experiment under which etc was measured also differences in kcb could be due to the estimation of the stomatal closure factor fr with the equation suggested by allen et al 1998 into account the mean leaf resistance rl the slope saturation vapor pressure vs air t curve δ and psychrometric constant γ the results of table 3 were calculated with published values of stomatal conductance working with data from a super high plant density olive orchard in a dry sub humid climate paço et al 2019 calibrated the values of fr through comparing the allen and pereira 2009 kcb values with the kcb calculated from dual kc approach 3 6 relationship between fraction of canopy light interception fir and kcb fig 9 presents the fir measurements as a function of dpgi as expected fir values exhibited seasonal patterns that are somewhat related to the canopy cover measurements illustrated in fig 4 note however that fir and canopy measurements differed substantially among trees in year 1 the tree with the largest canopy in lys 2 obtained relatively small changes in fir values after dpgi 200 while the tree with the smallest canopy in lys 3 exhibited the largest change in fir during the year and ultimately the largest fir values at about dpgi 300 in year 1 in year 2 fir for the tree in lys 1 was higher than others starting around dpgi 150 and continuing to dpgi 280 thus during summer in year 2 lys 1 had higher fir but lower canopy cover than lys 2 fig 4 as was noted earlier the measured etc was similar among plants in the second year despite differences in canopy cover altogether these fir results suggest that leaf density was very different among the trees and that canopy cover may provide an incomplete measure of canopy contribution to evapotranspiration therefore examining kcb as a function of fir can be justified fig 10 shows kcb as a function of fir the scatter in the data appears to increase with increasing fir nevertheless the results do suggest there is linear relationship between kcb and fir the regression equation is represented by the solid line in fig 10 r2 0 66 n 46 10 k c b 0 0317 1 2081 f i r according to this model fir explained 66 of the variation in kcb for the validation set the computed r2 was 64 regression line not shown the residuals of both the regression and validation kcb vs fir data sets were examined and found to be normally distributed for the validation data set estimation errors varied from 0 117 and 0 118 kcb fig 11 the mean error of the estimated kcb as a function of fir values was 0 008 and the 95 of these errors were less than 0 115 previous studies have examined the relationship between kcb and fir for other perennial crops ayars et al 2003 evaluated this relationship for peach trees in california and found using a 5 year data set they obtained a strong linear relationship between kc and fir r2 0 86 the relationship was improved r2 0 93 when the component of direct soil evaporation was eliminated from the kc coefficient girona et al 2011 evaluated fir in apple and pear orchards in contrast with ayars et al 2003 these authors determined an exponential relationship between kc and fir for apples r2 0 91 but did not develop a relationship for pears due to the wide scatter of the data girona et al 2011 attributed these contrary results to differences between species in canopy porosity and stomatal sensitivity to vpd in an experiment with young olive trees in southern spain testi et al 2004 fitted a linear regression between kc in dry soil conditions essentially kcb and canopy cover which is related to fir consideration of the contrasting results obtained in previous studies and the limitations of this study particularly that measurements were obtained for less than two full years our findings suggest that fir can potentially serve as a tool for estimating kcb but that the proposed relationship cannot be used in practice without additional measurements on the other hand it is important to note that while the relationship of kcb as a function of dpgi could vary between years in response to different durations of the growth stages management practices etc the relationship of kcb as a function of fir could potentially be valid from year to year 3 7 accuracy estimates the kcb relationships developed in this study were evaluated by comparing the observed with the estimated transpiration the observed transpiration t were calculated as the averaged of the t measurements for each stage growth and for each lysimeter the estimated transpiration were calculated as te kcb x eto where eto was determined as the mean value for each growth stage the kcb estimates were presented as a function of dpgi method 1 as a function of fir method 2 and with the procedure of allen and pereira 2009 method 3 in method 1 kcb estimates were developed by accounting for the duration of the growth stages according to fig 8 and then a mean value was calculated for each stage the coefficients used in the method 3 are those of table 3 the kcb of the crop development stage was found by averaging the kcb ini and kcb mid values likewise the late season kcb was determined as the average value of kcb mid and kcb end results are summarized in table 4 differences between the observed and estimated transpiration were similar with methods 1 and 2 errors computed with the allen and pereira procedure 2009 were larger which is to be expected because the relationships of methods 1 and 2 were obtained from the observed data the maximum difference between observed transpiration and estimated transpiration with method 1 and method 2 was 0 18 mm 18 error for the crop development stage considering that in commercial orchards all plants are irrigated with the same target despite very large variability in plant development the potential errors in estimating daily crop evapotranspiration with the proposed relationships do not seem very large 3 8 considerations about the studied kcb relationship this study was conducted using three containerized trees under non limiting water conditions in a sub humid climate previous studies on olive evapotranspiration i e testi et al 2004 er raki et al 2010 pôças et al 2015 have reported different approaches to evaluate this process in both young and well stablished orchards but under semi arid conditions despite this climatic difference the range of basal crop coefficients generated in this study is of similar magnitude to those reported by other authors and exhibit similar seasonal patterns evaporation losses compared to the values obtained in semi arid conditions were smaller under the conditions of this study mainly because of the small wetted area created by the drippers versus different irrigation methods clearly evaporation losses will be much greater than in the study under typical olive production conditions of uruguay with high rainfall procedures such as those proposed by pereira 2004 and allen et al 1998 will need to be used to develop evaporation estimates under typical production conditions on the other hand seasonal patterns of our measured kcb figs 7 and 8 should be to be close to those in well established and managed commercial orchards of about the same age as in our experiment in addition specific kcb values which will depend on the size of the tree could be obtained from the kcb fir relationship fig 10 if such data were available as mentioned earlier the proposed linear equation for kcb as a function of fir fig 10 appears to be a better method to predict the kcb coefficient than kcb as a function of dpgi fig 8 since the fir takes into account the size of the canopy and foliage density however at this point in time if can only be used within the range of fir values measured in this experiment 0 05 to 0 36 fig 10 4 conclusions one of the main doubts concerning to olive irrigation management in humid areas is whether the patterns of water demand would be similar to those obtained in semi arid zones these concerns become more tenuous when considering young olive trees these doubts became more extensible when it came to young plants the seasonal variation of the transpiration described by the basal crop coefficient kcb was confirmed in young olive trees under humid conditions this variation had a similar pattern to that reported for olive producing regions with mediterranean climate variation of the basal crop coefficient was satisfactorily explained by measured canopy light interception fir and a linear regression model was presented for kcb as a function of fir the proposed model could be used to improve kcb estimation for irrigation management purposes of young olive orchards additional research is needed to refine the kcb relationship between the fractions of radiation interception by the canopy development of reflection indices using remote sensors would also facilitate collection of canopy data for kcb estimation acknowledgments the present work was conducted in collaboration with national agriculture

10855,young non bearing olive trees were grown in drainage lysimeters and their water consumption was measured over two consecutive yearly experimental periods to analyze the effect ofseasonal variations on the basal crop coefficient kcb micro lysimeter measurements were used to quantify soil evaporation es and es was subtracted from evapotranspiration etc to determine transpiration monthly mean kcb were determined as etc es eto where eto is the fao pm grass reference evapotranspiration calculated from locally measured weather data the observed kcb value at mid season 0 38 was obtained in the fall months with 41 of canopy cover the mid season kcb when adjusted to the fao 56 standard climate was 0 43 seasonal patterns of kcb are presented and the kcb value during the mid season

interception fir and a linear regression model is presented for kcb as a function of fir keywords evapotranspiration crop coefficients soil water content irrigation requirements olea europea l 1 introduction olive trees have been historically cultivated as a dryland crop because of their high resistance to drought presently the use of irrigation for olives has expanded within the intensive arid production areas surrounding the mediterranean sea gucci and fereres 2012 this practice has been spurred by research showing that irrigation increases initial growth rates and ultimately produces higher olive yields than under rain fed conditions fernández and moreno 1999 girona et al 2002a moriana et al 2003 the traditional olive growing region is the mediterranean basin where spain italy and greece are the main producing countries recently argentina chile and australia among other countries have joined the olive production sector fao 2015 over the past decade olive production has steadily increased in uruguay due in part to its temperate and sub humid climate but also to the availability of land unsuitable for economic production of annual crops uruguay has a strategic advantage as an olive producing country because of its proximity and the establishment of trade agreements with large consumer markets like brazil the united states and canada asolur 2015 because of the rapid expansion of olive production in uruguay research is needed to develop crop management practices for its unique climatic conditions uruguay has a mean annual rainfall of 1200 mm but that rainfall exhibits high inter annual variability castaño et al 2011 with periods of excess rainfall interspersed with frequent drought periods thus appropriate irrigation management based on actual crop water requirements is a necessity most studies on the crop evapotranspiration etc soil water balance and irrigation of olive trees were developed in arid and semi arid climates local data of the seasonal variation of etc in olive plantations are essential for matching irrigation to meet the volume and frequency of the crop water requirements fao publication 24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 formalized the calculation of crop evapotranspiration as the product of a reference evapotranspiration eto and a crop coefficient this approach has been refined and expanded in subsequent publications allen et al 1998 jensen and allen 2016 eto was defined as the potential evapotranspiration from a well water grass surface under standardized field measurement conditions crop coefficients kc are the ratio between measured etc and eto the concept was derived under the assumption that weather effects on crop evapotranspiration are mostly explained by the variation in eto while kc is mostly a function of the type of vegetation and the evolution of the vegetation cover over a crop growing season this concept has allowed to extrapolate the use crop coefficients developed under particular agroclimatic conditions to other conditions for example in the absence of locally developed values approximate kc can be derived for local conditions using the algorithms and tables provided by allen et al 1998 however it is well understood that the kc for crops varies as a function of a the fraction of solar radiation intercepted by the canopy fir ayars et al 2003 girona et al 2011 testi et al 2004 williams and ayars 2005 b the proportion of wetted soil exposed to evaporation allen et al 1998 pereira 2004 and c stomatal conductance and its relationship with weather variables such as the vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed and temperature moriana et al 2002 villalobos et al 2000 2013 these variables are more likely to affect the determination of crop coefficients for orchard crops mainly because of the differences between tree canopy height and reference grass height and the differences in canopy architecture for different tree species and planting systems many olive researchers have assumed or proposed a constant kc of about 0 55 0 74 to estimate water requirements for irrigated plantations throughout the year in arid and semiarid climates goldhamer and dunai 1994 girona et al 2002a grattan et al 2006 others working under arid and semi arid conditions have reported a seasonal variation of kc with low values in summer months and high values in fall and spring months depending in which season the rains occur gucci and fereres 2012 orgaz and fereres 2008 testi et al 2006 most of these kc studies with olive have been carried out in andalusia spain and california usa where summers are hot dry and vapor pressure deficit can exceed 3 0 3 5 kpa these conditions are unlike those of uruguay where the daily mean temperature rarely exceeds 30 c and the maximum vapor pressure deficit rarely exceeds 2 0 kpa villalobos et al 2013 cautioned against the use of generalized kc values for fruit trees irrespective of environmental conditions or crop management practices puppo et al 2014 conducted an etc study with olive trees growing in lysimeters under full irrigation that study found a linear relationship between the crop coefficient for the summer months and the percentage of canopy cover while that relationship is valid only for the summer months and the wetting pattern of the drippers used in that study it can be extrapolated to other conditions by differentiating between the crop transpiration and water losses by soil evaporation i e by using the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 more precise estimates of etc are needed for high frequency irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 pereira 2004 especially in climates with frequent rains and in orchards with different canopy covers in which direct soil evaporation varies significantly fereres et al 2011 several authors have advocated the use of dual coefficients with transpiration estimated through the basal crop coefficient kcb and direct soil evaporation by the evaporation coefficient ke wright 1982 jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 er raki et al 2010 fereres et al 2011 the basal crop coefficient kcb is used to estimate evapotranspiration when the soil surface is dry while transpiration is not limited by the soil water deficit allen et al 1998 various authors indicated that characterizing evapotranspiration for olive trees is inherently difficult because of physiological mechanisms that help to protect the plant from water stress connor 2005 orgaz and fereres 2008 differences in canopy architecture resulting from different planting arrangements and plant densities crop management practices and even plant to plant variations are essential factors which may have a direct effect on kcb villalobos et al 2013 carr 2013 allen and pereira 2009 proposed a method that adjusts kcb with crop height and canopy cover and ultimately with the density coefficient kd which is also influenced by the canopy density ml and the stomatal closure fr paço et al 2019 reported successful application of the allen and pereira 2009 approach to mature olive orchards this study aims to refine the results of puppo et al 2014 and improve the resulting etc estimates for a wide range of olive orchard production conditions by removing the soil evaporation component from the total measured crop evapotranspiration and deriving basal crop coefficients for the humid climatic conditions of uruguay in addition the study seeks to verify the seasonal pattern of the kcb in a temperate sub humid climate and develop a predictive tool for kcb that can be used in practical irrigation management two modeling options were explored 1 by expressing kcb as a function of days past growth initiation dpgi and 2 by relating kcb to the midday light interception 2 materials and methods 2 1 location experiment description and irrigation a two year experiment was conducted at the national agriculture research institute inia las brujas experimental station 34 40 s 56 20 w altitude of 32 m above sea level young olive trees o europea l cv arbequina were planted on september 14 2010 in drainage lysimeters according to the protocol described by puppo et al 2014 several studies have used precision weighing lysimeters to determine water consumption in woody plants including peach pear and apple trees ayars et al 2003 bryla et al 2003 girona et al 2002b 2004 2010 johnson et al 2000 2004 weighing lysimeters provide highly accurate and reliable daily evapotranspiration data drainage lysimeters are less precise but can provide reasonable average data over a time span of 7 15 days when calculated by water balance and evapotranspiration estimation between two drainage occurrences puppo et al 2014 several researchers have used drainage lysimeters to determine etc in deciduous fruit trees boland et al 1993 2000 iancu 1997 stevenson 1989 recent studies on evapotranspiration of olive trees using lysimeter measurements include ben gal et al 2010 agam et al 2013 2014 puppo et al 2014 the experimental units consisted of three fiberglass drainage lysimeters 1 9 m long x 0 9 m wide x 1 35 m deep lysimeters 1 2 and 3 equipped with 32 mm drain pipes connected to their drainage collection box the drainage tubes were installed under an 8 to 10 cm gravel layer and covered with a 0 4 mm thick geotextile layer to prevent clogging lysimeters lys 1 and 3 were planted with two year old trees and lys 2 with a four year old tree data collection for the tree in lys 2 started on day 122 after planting this additional time was needed for this older tree to recover from planting stress and completely recover its foliage the etc of lysimeter grown trees was measured over two experimental periods 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 puppo et al 2014 for simplicity this article will refer to these two periods as years 1 and 2 respectively measuring crop evapotranspiration etc is difficult under high rainfall conditions as in uruguay hence the lysimeters were protected with a rain shelter consisting of a rail mounted steel structure completely enclosed above and on all sides with a dual pitched roof the shelter was 20 m long 11 m wide 8 5 m high along the center and 6 m high on the perimeter the shelter was mounted on a rail structure which allowed the roof to automatically close whenever a logged rain gauge sensor detected more than rainfall 3 mm of rainfall after rainfall had ceased the roof was re opened manually because the shelter blocks solar radiation and affects other parameters that influence etc data for days that the shelter was closed one day before and one after were excluded from the analysis trees were treated as individual units and were not shaded by neighboring plants i e the incoming solar radiation affected all trees equally aerodynamic effects were also considered to equally influence the individual trees puppo et al 2014 in this sense allen et al 2011 indicated that in humid and sub humid climates the evapotranspiration process is more heavily influenced by the net radiation availability than by aerodynamic effects lysimeters were surrounded by a 30 m by 40 m winter cereal crop alternated with an irrigated summer cereal crop located in a 446 ha fruit and vegetable orchard in addition the experimental conditions simulate the prevailing field environmental conditions of uruguay s productive olive groves which have inter row grass cover while strong advection effects are unlikely under the conditions of the study micro advection effects are possible due to the lower height of the surrounding vegetation each lysimeter was irrigated with three pressure compensating drip emitters installed in a straight line with a 0 63 m spacing across the mid section of the lysimeter the flow rate was 4 l h 1 for each emitter irrigation frequency was daily from october to may and once or twice a week from june to september irrigation scheduling was determined using the single crop coefficient kc methodology allen et al 1998 applied with local meteorological data to calculate the grass penman monteith eto allen et al 1998 daily climatic data were provided by an automatic meteorological station vantage pro 2 davis usa located at the inia las brujas experimental station 500 m away from the experimental site the climatic station was installed complying with the installation standards on a 20 by 20 m grass crop frequently cut without lack of water and surrounded by irrigated crops the same volume of water was applied to each lysimeter each irrigation water was applied in excess of the requirements of the young olive trees to ensure water drainage in the lysimeters the irrigation amount was determined as 0 7 times the daily eto where 0 7 is the kc for adult olive trees in high density as recommended by allen and pereira 2009 the drainage system located at the bottom of each lysimeter avoided anaerobic conditions that could occur due to excess water to the trees 2 2 soil characteristics the soil at the experimental station is classified as typic argiudoll according to the usda classification system and consists of four horizons soil textural and water retention parameters were field determined for each horizon casanova 2008 and are shown in table 1 2 3 determination of crop evapotranspiration etc crop evapotranspiration was calculated over 7 to 14 day periods as the residual of the water volume balance equation 1 e t c r d δ h s where etc is the actual crop evapotranspiration from the olive tree r is the irrigation volume d is the drainage volume and δhs is the change in soil water volume irrigation and drainage water volumes were recorded daily for each lysimeter changes in soil water contents were determined with a neutron probe campbell pacific nuclear corp model 503 ca usa using a 1 m long aluminum access tube placed at the center of each lysimeter 0 20 m away from the drip emitter line and halfway between two adjacent emitters the neutron probe was calibrated gravimetrically for each soil depth as reported in puppo et al 2014 using the methodology described by haverkamp et al 1984 measurements were taken bi weekly at depths of 0 20 0 40 0 60 and 0 80 m following the protocol described previously by puppo et al 2014 calculated etc did not include data from the periods when a the amount of available water decreased by more than 50 of the total available water taw b the amount of available water increased by more than 100 taw due to blockage of the drainage system in one or more lysimeters and c rainy days in conjunction with the days immediately before and after rain event rainy days correspond to the days when the lysimeter rain shelter roof automatically closed see section 2 1 this data quality control was imposed to eliminate etc measurements that could have been affected by anaerobic conditions and or reduced photosynthesis induced by shelter closure allen et al 1998 suggest etc for olive will be reduced due to water stress after the soil water depletion fraction of the taw for the root zone reaches 0 65 the lower limit of allowable soil water depletion imposed in our study 50 helps ensure that the etc data measured for trees were obtained under only non stressed soil water conditions the daily calculated volumetric etc i e l d 1 was averaged over 7 to 14 day periods and normalized by the area defined by the distances between lysimeter grown trees 2 5 m x 5 5 m to derive etc in mm d 1 in what follows this area will be referred to as the tree grid area this approach was used because the canopy of each tree and therefore the evaporating area exceeded the area of its lysimeters the etc was examined as a function of days past growth initiation dpgi where dpgi 1 corresponds to july 11 when olive evapotranspiration rates increase in response to vegetative growth and rising temperatures in the southern hemisphere 2 4 determination of kcb and ke coefficients micro lysimeters were installed within each lysimeter to determine soil evaporation es bonachela et al 2001 paço et al 2006 determination of soil evaporation allows calculation of the basal transpiration portion of etc by subtracting es from the measured etc the micro lysimeters consisted of pvc tubing 0 084 m inner diameter and 0 12 m long as described by bonachela et al 2001 with these dimensions 1 mm of evaporated water produces a 5 5 g weight difference the devices were buried flush with the ground surface removed and capped at their bottom the micro lysimeters were weighed over 7 consecutive days which is the maximum irrigation interval in this study the micro lysimeter measurements were conducted over two summer periods in 2013 in the first period dpgi 217 to dpgi 223 two micro lysimeters were installed in the exposed wetted fraction two in the shaded wetted fraction two at the dry edge of the wetted fraction and two at the exposed dry fraction in the second period dpgi 230 to dpgi 236 since the measured evaporation was found to be negligible in the dry and dry edge of the wetted fraction a second 7 day analysis was performed in which four micro lysimeters were placed in the exposed wetted fraction and four in the shaded wetted fraction the applied volume was 48 l and 36 l a day for the first and the second period respectively the resulting wetting fraction was 3 6 of the grid area the amount of water applied at each irrigation etox0 7 was enough to fully fill the surface soil layer to field capacity and to drain excess such that the depletion of the layer was returned to the same amount of water of the previous day in each instance thus the amount of water in the layer at the start of each drying cycle was the same with each irrigation the evolution of the soil evaporation coefficient ke with time was examined for both the exposed wetted fraction and the shaded wetted fraction a mean ke value was used for the period between two consecutive irrigations based on the micro lysimeter results the soil evaporation coefficient was normalized by the tree grid area taking into account the number of days between irrigations from the ke vs time function and was then calculated as follows 2 k e k e e f e w k e s f w in eq 2 few is the exposed wetted soil fraction of the tree grid area which is the surface that accounts for most of the evaporation allen et al 1998 fw is the shaded wetted soil fraction of the tree grid area ke e is the corresponding value of the evaporation coefficient throughout the period in between irrigations for the exposed wetted fraction and ke s is the corresponding value of the evaporation coefficient for the interval between irrigations for the shaded wetted fraction the normalized soil evaporation es was calculated as 3 e s k e e t o this result was then used to calculate the normalized kcb coefficient 4 k c b e t c e s e t o where etc and es are measured crop evapotranspiration for the olive trees and direct soil evaporation respectively as normalized for the tree grid area and eto is the fao pm reference evapotranspiration where units for all are expressed in mm d 1 monthly mean kcb values were determined for year 1 and year 2 the seasonal pattern of kcb were determined for both years as a function of dpgi a kcb fao 56 style model was developed from data of year 2 only and is described further in section 2 6 a similar model was not developed for year 1 because the etc was measured starting on planting date dpgi 66 and data were not collected for lys 2 until dpgi 188 due the time needed for this tree to recover transplant stress furthermore trees sizes for the lysimeters including height and canopy cover were very different until early in the second year 2 5 measurement of vegetative growth and midday canopy light interception canopy size measurements are needed to interpret the evapotranspiration measurements and adjust the evaporation coefficient estimates with time the longitudinal and transverse diameters and the height of the canopy of each tree were measured every three months the area of the canopy was calculated assuming a circular shape from the mean diameter and the canopy cover was calculated as the ratio between the area of the canopy m2 and the tree grid area 2 5 m x 5 5 m the trees were pruned at the same time on dpgi 360 july 5 2012 at the end of the second year and each tree was fertilized in the spring with 200 g of 46 0 0 n p k one of the goals of this study is to examine the relationship between kcb and a measure of crop canopy coverage to this end the fraction of canopy light interception fir was selected fir is defined as girona et al 2011 5 f i r 1 m e a n p a r v a l u e a t g r o u n d l e v e l p a r v a l u e a b o v e c a n o p y in this expression par is the canopy light interception of photosynthetically active radiation several authors have estimated the kc of fruit trees and olives as a function of either fir or canopy coverage ayars et al 2003 girona et al 2010 testi et al 2004 williams and ayars 2005 since olive trees have a lower density of leaves than other species of fruit trees such as apples and pears allen and pereira 2009 and since the olive pruning has the main objective to favor the entry of light through the canopy for which some branches are removed garcía ortiz et al 2008 the use of fir seems reasonable in comparison with the canopy cover which takes into account the size of canopy only par was measured at solar noon 60 min on clear days with a ceptometer decagon devices inc model lp 801 wa usa probe length 86 5 cm 30 readings were obtained for each lysimeter at pre defined locations covering the tree grid area as described by girona et al 2011 the ceptometer was located at ground level and in a horizontal position the above canopy par was measured by taking a reading with the ceptometer in an open place to ensure that ceptometer measurements correspond to solar noon they need to be corrected by the solar angle with respect to the zenith as detailed in the operator s manual decagon devices inc 2010 2 6 development of relationship for kcb as a function of dpgi and fir a commonly used approach for modeling kc or kcb is as a function of the growing season duration the variation of kcb with dpgi was fitted to a four segment linear model as suggested by fao 56 allen et al 1998 hunsaker et al 2002 2007 in this approach kcb is assumed as a constant during the first time interval kcb1 this is followed by a period of increasing kcb up to a constant value kcb2 which is maintained for another period of time kcb3 after which it decreased to kcb4 the parameters were estimated using least squares and solved with the excel solver tool as suggested by wraith and or 1998 6 for dpgi dpgit1 kcb1 constant for dpgit1 dpgi dpgit2 kcb2 dpgi dpgit1 b1 constant for dpgit2 dpgi dpgit3 kcb3 b1 dpgit3 dpgit2 constant for dpgit3 dpgi kcb4 b1 dpgit3 dpgit2 b2 dpgi dpgit3 constant where dpgit1 dpgit2 y dpgit3 are the ending days for initial stage t1 crop development stage t2 and mid season stage t3 respectively the coefficients b1 and b2 are the regression coefficients for the crop development and final stages respectively as mentioned previously since the first year etc measurements were limited and plant size was very heterogeneous the kcb dpgi relationship was solely modeled using data from the second year to evaluate the evolution of fir through time the fir data were fitted as a function of dpgi the fir measurements from the two years were combined and used to calibrate kcb as a function of fir using linear regression unlike the four segment kcb model the fir model does not require a complete yearly set of kcb data i e year 1 and is not time driven for the model fitting and validation a set of 46 observations adjustment set were chosen between the two years and the three lysimeters then validation was conducted with 15 randomly chosen observations which were not used in the linear regression calibration model the statistical distribution of the residuals was analyzed with the modified shapiro wilks test to verify the absence of bias and the normality of the residuals the measured kcb values were also adjusted as a function of canopy cover to allow a clearer comparison of our data with other reported values the adjustment was made using the relationship developed for almonds by fereres et al 1981 which has also been verified to apply to olive orchards fereres et al 2011 7 k r 0 0194 c c 2 2 8119 c c 1 008 here kr is the reduction coefficient and cc is the canopy cover this reduction coefficient can be used to determine the kcb at 100 canopy cover given the kcb value measured at a particular cc for example kcb at 25 kcb 100 x kr 100 allen and pereira 2009 proposed a procedure for estimating kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end values of various crops including orchards from effective fraction of ground cover measurements and canopy height thus it seems useful to compare the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end values generated in this study with values computed with the allen and pereira 2009 procedure based on the average ground cover and average canopy height measurements of the three trees of our study the ml and the mean leaf resistance values suggested by allen and pereira 2009 for olive trees was used the software infostat p di rienzo et al 2014 was used to develop the linear regression of the kcb fir model and to develop the four segment kcb dpgi model the models were considered satisfactory when the p value was 0 05 the distribution of residuals errors was analyzed using the shapiro wilk test provided as an option in the software residuals distribution was considered normal when the shapiro wilk p value was 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 environment conditions in figs 1 and 2 displays the weekly average eto and the weekly average vpd rs and ta data for year 1 and year 2 respectively eto and the measured weather variables exhibited similar patterns of variation as a function of dpgi and peak values during the two years of the study during year 1 peak eto fao pm values were recorded in the last week of december dpgi 164 171 with a weekly mean of 7 6 mm d 1 and daily values in that week ranging from 6 6 to 8 4 mm d 1 during year 2 the weekly mean eto peaked at 7 1 mm d 1 during the first week of january dpgi 177 184 with daily values varying between 5 6 and 9 1 mm d 1 comparison of data in figs 1 and 2 clearly suggest a strong correlation between eto and any of the measured weather variables the measurements confirm that high humidity and low temperature conditions prevail in uruguay and thus the eto is relatively low the highest weekly average vpd was 2 3 kpa in year 1 while all values were below 2 0 kpa in year 2 these values are lower than those reported by villalobos et al 2013 in the range of 2 7 3 3 kpa for eight experiments conducted in different locations in spain and california the maximum values of the average weekly temperature were 26 1 and 23 4 for year 1 and year 2 respectively in contrast grattan et al 2006 indicated that the summer temperature of california often exceeds 35 c testi et al 2004 reported peak monthly eto values of 6 6 to 7 1 mm d 1 for southern spain while grattan et al 2006 reported values from 6 6 to 6 8 mm d 1 for california the peak monthly mean eto measured in this study were about 5 15 lower 6 5 and 6 1 mm d 1 for december and january 2010 2011 and 5 5 and 6 2 mm d 1 for december and january 2011 2012 respectively mean weekly eto values were also calculated from climatic data collected for the years 1997 2018 in the same area where the experiment was undertaken data not shown evaluation showed that the total yearly eto measured in years 1 and 2 of our experiment exceeded the total eto determined in all other years in this time series except for one year hence the two experimental years can be characterized as years that experienced high atmospheric crop water demand for southern uruguay 3 2 evaporation coefficient ke the wetted area due to irrigation and measured in each lysimeter which remained almost constant because the amount of irrigation water was always in excess with respect to the water requirement of the plants but proportional to the atmospheric demand eto the area of the wetted spot ranged between 0 37 and 0 86 m2 where the largest value corresponded to lys 3 that had a smaller tree than the other lysimeters the proportion of few and fw was updated every 3 months when the size of the plants was recorded the shaded wetted soil fraction fw was 1 0 from the beginning of the experiment for the lys 1 and lys 2 while fw varied between 0 88 and 1 0 in lys 3 reaching the value 1 0 at the beginning of the second year table 2 shows the direct soil evaporation es values measured with the micro lysimeters as well as eto as a function of days past irrigation and are grouped by measurement type i e exposed wetted fraction as expected evaporation was negligible in the dry area and at the dry edge of the wetted fraction table 2 as previously found in evaporation studies for drip irrigated olives by bonachela et al 2001 it is clear that these surrounding dry areas within the lysimeter do not need to be considered for the calculation of kcb evaporation was greatest for exposed wetted fraction as expected one day past irrigation measured es values for the exposed wetted fraction were about 20 less than the eto for that day this reflects a significant amount of initial evaporation from the exposed emitter areas however daily es diminished quickly relative to eto thereafter starting at three days after the irrigation and until the end of the measurement period the evaporation rate from micro lysimeters in the shaded wetted fraction was close to the evaporation rate from micro lysimeters in the exposed wetted fraction table 2 fig 3 presents the resulting evaporation coefficients computed for the drying cycle after irrigation the available energy is together with the amount of water the main driver of the evaporation process hence it makes sense that the initial values of the ke and the rate of decrease were higher in the exposed wetted fraction than the shaded wetted fraction at the end of the 7 day drying cycle the ke mean values were very similar 0 22 and 0 21 for the exposed and shaded wetted fraction respectively the equations representing the solid lines in fig 3 are 8 a k e e 0 7516 d a y s 1 008 r 2 0 72 9 b k e s 0 6018 d a y s 0 64 r 2 0 70 the determination of es by the micro lysimeter data could slightly overestimate the evaporation klocke et al 1990 if this were the case we could be slightly underestimating the tree transpiration and the resulting adjusted kcb coefficients however the wetted soil fraction in our study from which direct evaporation would be produced was very small in relation to the tree grid area thus any overestimation of actual es had a small consequence on our transpiration estimates 3 3 canopy cover soil water content and crop evapotranspiration measurements canopy cover measurements for each year and lysimeter are shown in fig 4 the tree in lys 2 was 4 years old when transplanted while the other two plants were 2 years old this explains the differences in canopy size especially in year 1 in the second year tree canopies became more alike as the season progressed in year 1 tree canopy size measurements started on dpgi 177 while etc measurements started on dpgi 188 when the four year old tree had fully recovered its foliage density plant diameter and height measurements which are not shown followed the same trends in time as the canopy measurements and also produced larger values for the tree in lysimeter 2 fig 5 presents the volumetric soil water content measured with the neutron probes and averaged for the first 60 cm of the soil profile this is the depth where roots were concentrated in this soil the wilting point was 23 and the saturated soil was 50 some periods of water deficit or excess were experienced during year 1 and those data were discarded from the analysis the figure shows that during the second year the water content was maintained at 50 or above for all but a few instances for lys 1 in which depletions was slightly above 50 depletion occasionally measured soil water content slightly exceeded field capacity for lys 3 in particular depletion was above 50 during the period of highest etc demand in year 2 for all three lysimeters as 65 depletion is considered the critical level for olive water stress allen et al 1998 we submit that etc measurements presented below were obtained under well watered conditions overall these results suggest that the number of emitters used and their location within the lysimeters did not affect the availability of water to the plants as was previously indicated the applied volume for each irrigation was expected to fully satisfy the crop water demand etc was measured starting on the planting date dpgi 66 in year 1 except in lys 2 which began on dpgi 188 in year 2 measurements were obtained throughout the entire year fig 6 shows the mean daily crop evapotranspiration values measured for each month and lysimeter note that etc peaked in january in both years dpgi 175 205 when eto fig 1 also attained maximum values larger etc values were measured during the second year of the study in response to higher trees and therefore canopy growth than in year 1 the relatively small values of etc in comparison with eto fig 1 are a consequence of the relatively small canopy in relationship to the grid area despite the difference in tree size similar etc values were measured for all trees during most months the tree in lysimeter 3 produced the smallest etc values during the development period consistent with the fact that it was also the tree with the smallest canopy 3 4 basal crop coefficient kcb fig 7 presents the resulting kcb and ke coefficients peak kcb values were recorded between dpgi 280 and dpgi 321 fall both years while minimum kcb values were recorded in late winter and early spring of the second year which spanned the full annual cycle of the olive trees this seasonal pattern of kcb agrees with the pattern reported by gucci and fereres 2012 who indicated that the relative transpiration described by kcb of olive trees shows a marked annual variation with minimum values in spring and maximum values in early fall the difference between the periods corresponding to the maximum eto values fig 1 and the maximum kcb values figs 7 and 8 determined low values of etc respect to eto values in year 1 the computed kcb values differed substantially among trees these differences however do not appear to be related to tree canopy size as lys 1 produced larger kcb values than lys 2 in year 2 the kcb values for the three trees were in better agreement with each other and results were related to tree canopy cover with peak kcb values varying between 0 37 and 0 52 fig 7 these maximum kcb values are like to those reported by villalobos et al 2000 in the mediterranean 0 44 to 0 48 for olive trees with 40 canopy cover and to the value recommended by allen and pereira 2009 0 55 for a canopy cover of 50 the ke values did not exhibit the same strong seasonality as kcb fig 7 note also that the ke values determined in this analysis were an order of magnitude smaller than the kcb values and that larger ke values were determined for the tree with the smallest canopy es was small in comparison with etc because the wetted section was small relative to the tree grid area hence despite high ke values measured in the wetted section fig 2 ke mean monthly values normalized for the tree grid were small fig 7 and nearly constant both years between 0 01 and 0 03 fig 7 although the kcb data shows some scatter due to tree size variation the olive kcb data for year 2 were described satisfactorily with the fao 56 segmented crop coefficient model after allen et al 1998 as shown in fig 8 the calculations produced an r2 of 0 83 and a mean squared error mse of 0 0021 also as shown in fig 8 the scatter of measured kcb data about the predicted curve or residuals are fairly uniform for all three trees despite the age difference for the lys 2 tree the trees had low initial kcb values up to dpgi 54 after which kcb increased linearly up to dpgi 284 crop development stage at the rate given by the regression coefficient b1 0 0013 day 1 the kcb remained fairly constant up to dpgi 325 mid season stage and then declined sharply during dpgi from 325 to 365 at a rate given by the regression coefficient b2 0 004 day 1 the trees also reached their maximum size approximately at the mid season stage with a mean ground cover of 41 fig 4 however the mid season stage was short 30 days compared to the length 60 days or more of this stage reported for some annual crops hunsaker et al 2007 yang et al 2016 and for deciduous fruit trees snyder et al 2000 ayars et al 2003 other authors have suggested that the kcb value of perennial trees and particularly olive trees is controlled by stomatal conductance villalobos et al 2000 moriana et al 2002 than by increasing foliar area fereres et al 2011 this may be a factor contributing to the short duration of the mid season kcb stage the kcb values measured in this study are comparable to values measured in other studies lópez olivari et al 2016 conducted a two year evapotranspiration study with olives planted at very high density in the maule region in chile that study site is located at nearly the same latitude as this study but with semiarid climate conditions those authors reported maximum kcb mid values of 0 28 and 0 31 for canopy cover of 29 and 31 respectively working also with drip irrigated olives testi et al 2004 reported a kc of 0 30 for periods without rain and when the soil surface was dry under these conditions the coefficient reported by these authors can be regarded as equivalent to kcb however those results were measured when canopy cover was only 25 hence to compare the kcb values measured in this study with those of testi et al 2004 the kcb data were adjusted considering canopy cover and using eq 7 according to this adjustment the kcb for our trees at 100 canopy cover would be 0 46 which is close to the kcb value of testi et al 2004 0 52 when adjusted at 100 canopy cover it should be noted that comparisons between our results and those of previous studies are based on non standardized kcb values as those reports did not use the fao 56 standardization procedure using our average measured weather data and crop heights shown in table 3 our observed kcb values for mid season and end of season were adjusted to the standard climatic conditions of fao 56 i e rhmin 45 and u2 2 m s the resulting values are kcb mid std 0 43 and kcb end std 0 27 these are smaller than the tabulated kcb values presented in fao 56 0 55 0 65 0 65 respectively for olives trees the standardized values in fao 56 were observed for more mature trees having canopy cover 40 60 3 5 estimating basal crop coefficient from effective fraction of ground cover and height results of kcb derived from ground cover and canopy height measurements allen and pereira 2009 are shown in table 3 the predicted kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end were larger than our fao 56 kcb values derived from measurements especially kcb for the initial stage which was only 0 08 however these differences in kcb seems reasonable given the relatively young trees and the humid conditions of this experiment under which etc was measured also differences in kcb could be due to the estimation of the stomatal closure factor fr with the equation suggested by allen et al 1998 into account the mean leaf resistance rl the slope saturation vapor pressure vs air t curve δ and psychrometric constant γ the results of table 3 were calculated with published values of stomatal conductance working with data from a super high plant density olive orchard in a dry sub humid climate paço et al 2019 calibrated the values of fr through comparing the allen and pereira 2009 kcb values with the kcb calculated from dual kc approach 3 6 relationship between fraction of canopy light interception fir and kcb fig 9 presents the fir measurements as a function of dpgi as expected fir values exhibited seasonal patterns that are somewhat related to the canopy cover measurements illustrated in fig 4 note however that fir and canopy measurements differed substantially among trees in year 1 the tree with the largest canopy in lys 2 obtained relatively small changes in fir values after dpgi 200 while the tree with the smallest canopy in lys 3 exhibited the largest change in fir during the year and ultimately the largest fir values at about dpgi 300 in year 1 in year 2 fir for the tree in lys 1 was higher than others starting around dpgi 150 and continuing to dpgi 280 thus during summer in year 2 lys 1 had higher fir but lower canopy cover than lys 2 fig 4 as was noted earlier the measured etc was similar among plants in the second year despite differences in canopy cover altogether these fir results suggest that leaf density was very different among the trees and that canopy cover may provide an incomplete measure of canopy contribution to evapotranspiration therefore examining kcb as a function of fir can be justified fig 10 shows kcb as a function of fir the scatter in the data appears to increase with increasing fir nevertheless the results do suggest there is linear relationship between kcb and fir the regression equation is represented by the solid line in fig 10 r2 0 66 n 46 10 k c b 0 0317 1 2081 f i r according to this model fir explained 66 of the variation in kcb for the validation set the computed r2 was 64 regression line not shown the residuals of both the regression and validation kcb vs fir data sets were examined and found to be normally distributed for the validation data set estimation errors varied from 0 117 and 0 118 kcb fig 11 the mean error of the estimated kcb as a function of fir values was 0 008 and the 95 of these errors were less than 0 115 previous studies have examined the relationship between kcb and fir for other perennial crops ayars et al 2003 evaluated this relationship for peach trees in california and found using a 5 year data set they obtained a strong linear relationship between kc and fir r2 0 86 the relationship was improved r2 0 93 when the component of direct soil evaporation was eliminated from the kc coefficient girona et al 2011 evaluated fir in apple and pear orchards in contrast with ayars et al 2003 these authors determined an exponential relationship between kc and fir for apples r2 0 91 but did not develop a relationship for pears due to the wide scatter of the data girona et al 2011 attributed these contrary results to differences between species in canopy porosity and stomatal sensitivity to vpd in an experiment with young olive trees in southern spain testi et al 2004 fitted a linear regression between kc in dry soil conditions essentially kcb and canopy cover which is related to fir consideration of the contrasting results obtained in previous studies and the limitations of this study particularly that measurements were obtained for less than two full years our findings suggest that fir can potentially serve as a tool for estimating kcb but that the proposed relationship cannot be used in practice without additional measurements on the other hand it is important to note that while the relationship of kcb as a function of dpgi could vary between years in response to different durations of the growth stages management practices etc the relationship of kcb as a function of fir could potentially be valid from year to year 3 7 accuracy estimates the kcb relationships developed in this study were evaluated by comparing the observed with the estimated transpiration the observed transpiration t were calculated as the averaged of the t measurements for each stage growth and for each lysimeter the estimated transpiration were calculated as te kcb x eto where eto was determined as the mean value for each growth stage the kcb estimates were presented as a function of dpgi method 1 as a function of fir method 2 and with the procedure of allen and pereira 2009 method 3 in method 1 kcb estimates were developed by accounting for the duration of the growth stages according to fig 8 and then a mean value was calculated for each stage the coefficients used in the method 3 are those of table 3 the kcb of the crop development stage was found by averaging the kcb ini and kcb mid values likewise the late season kcb was determined as the average value of kcb mid and kcb end results are summarized in table 4 differences between the observed and estimated transpiration were similar with methods 1 and 2 errors computed with the allen and pereira procedure 2009 were larger which is to be expected because the relationships of methods 1 and 2 were obtained from the observed data the maximum difference between observed transpiration and estimated transpiration with method 1 and method 2 was 0 18 mm 18 error for the crop development stage considering that in commercial orchards all plants are irrigated with the same target despite very large variability in plant development the potential errors in estimating daily crop evapotranspiration with the proposed relationships do not seem very large 3 8 considerations about the studied kcb relationship this study was conducted using three containerized trees under non limiting water conditions in a sub humid climate previous studies on olive evapotranspiration i e testi et al 2004 er raki et al 2010 pôças et al 2015 have reported different approaches to evaluate this process in both young and well stablished orchards but under semi arid conditions despite this climatic difference the range of basal crop coefficients generated in this study is of similar magnitude to those reported by other authors and exhibit similar seasonal patterns evaporation losses compared to the values obtained in semi arid conditions were smaller under the conditions of this study mainly because of the small wetted area created by the drippers versus different irrigation methods clearly evaporation losses will be much greater than in the study under typical olive production conditions of uruguay with high rainfall procedures such as those proposed by pereira 2004 and allen et al 1998 will need to be used to develop evaporation estimates under typical production conditions on the other hand seasonal patterns of our measured kcb figs 7 and 8 should be to be close to those in well established and managed commercial orchards of about the same age as in our experiment in addition specific kcb values which will depend on the size of the tree could be obtained from the kcb fir relationship fig 10 if such data were available as mentioned earlier the proposed linear equation for kcb as a function of fir fig 10 appears to be a better method to predict the kcb coefficient than kcb as a function of dpgi fig 8 since the fir takes into account the size of the canopy and foliage density however at this point in time if can only be used within the range of fir values measured in this experiment 0 05 to 0 36 fig 10 4 conclusions one of the main doubts concerning to olive irrigation management in humid areas is whether the patterns of water demand would be similar to those obtained in semi arid zones these concerns become more tenuous when considering young olive trees these doubts became more extensible when it came to young plants the seasonal variation of the transpiration described by the basal crop coefficient kcb was confirmed in young olive trees under humid conditions this variation had a similar pattern to that reported for olive producing regions with mediterranean climate variation of the basal crop coefficient was satisfactorily explained by measured canopy light interception fir and a linear regression model was presented for kcb as a function of fir the proposed model could be used to improve kcb estimation for irrigation management purposes of young olive orchards additional research is needed to refine the kcb relationship between the fractions of radiation interception by the canopy development of reflection indices using remote sensors would also facilitate collection of canopy data for kcb estimation acknowledgments the present work was conducted in collaboration with national agriculture

10856,greenhouse and nursery growers consume up to 19 thousand gallons of water per acre per day implementation of water conservation technologies to mitigate water resource depletion is imperative but recent studies indicate that associated drought stress may enhance losses from root diseases the overall objective of this study was to evaluate and manage disease risks associated with reducing irrigation in commercial production of a containerized annual nursery crop poinsettia and to improve water use efficiency without increasing losses from root disease results from a two year commercial greenhouse trial of poinsettias indicate that minor reductions irrigation application vs the standard practice grower irrigation resulted in 9 4 water savings without affecting pythium root rot pythium aphanidermatum p 0 13 although pathogen recovery from roots was 20 higher under reduced irrigation when poinsettias were inoculated with p aphanidermatum in controlled greenhouse experiments plant health and pathogen infection incidence were unchanged when substrate volumetric water content vwc was reduced from 45 to 35 with a 13 8 reduction in irrigation volume however incidence of plant decline increased by 50 under 25 vwc and shoot growth was significantly lower p 0 0001 compared to plants under higher vwc when a plant growth promoting bacteria companion bacillus subtilis gb03 was added to infected plants shoot growth was significantly increased under the 45 vwc treatment p 0 05 these studies indicate that irrigation inputs can be decreased by an estimated 23 2 in the commercial greenhouse without affecting pythium root rot below a minimum irrigation threshold 25 vwc plant pathogen dynamics may be altered to favor root disease development addition of biological products may serve to mitigate the negative effects of reducing irrigation inputs to the authors knowledge this is the first commercial scale study to evaluate biotic risks of sensor network based

experimental design this study was conducted in 2015 and repeated in 2016 the experiment was conducted in a single greenhouse range with four independently controlled irrigation zones with approximately 600 plants in each zone two zones were allocated to each of the two treatments for a total of 1200 plants in each treatment in each year and 2400 plants across both years treatments consisted of i grower irrigation gi based under grower s standard irrigation practice and ii set point based sensor controlled irrigation sci based on predetermined volumetric water content vwc of the substrate for the grower irrigation gi treatment two irrigation zones were instrumented to monitor the soil volumetric water content vwc under the grower s standard irrigation practice in each zone two em50r data loggers meter group inc pullman wa were deployed at opposite ends of irrigation laterals to monitor vwc at the driest sections substrate vwcs gs1 meter group inc of four plants in each section were measured on a 5 min basis with the em50r data loggers for the duration of the study the gi treatment typically applied 2 irrigations of 3 min length per day the set point based sensor controlled irrigation sci treatment was set in two further irrigation zones at a predetermined set point vwc 48 in 2015 and 45 in 2016 that was selected by the grower as a standard practice in the nursery poinsettias are grown under high substrate vwc with frequent irrigations thus the threshold substrate vwc the grower selected for sci was relatively high in order to minimize any adverse effects of reduced soil moisture sensors and nodes were placed in a similar layout as described for the gi to monitor substrate vwc at the driest ends in addition one nr5 control node decagon devices inc was installed in each irrigation zone and was connected to the 24 v solenoid valve in the zone in order to provide irrigation control substrate vwc of five plants in proximity to the solenoid valves in each zone was measured using gs1 sensors on a 5 min basis using the nr5 nodes the vwc measurements were transmitted to a sensorweb software mayim llc pittsburgh pa and averaged on a 15 min basis irrigation was applied whenever the averaged vwc was below the predetermined set point vwc irrigation duration was limited to 1 5 min per event in order to minimize leaching and was repeated until the average vwc was at 45 in 2015 one flow meter model 40 badger meter milwaukee wi was installed on a representative lateral in one of the two irrigation zones of both the gi and sci treatments one flow meter treatment to estimate irrigation volume during 2016 one flow meter model 25 badger meter milwaukee wi was installed in every irrigation zone of the gi and sci treatments two flow meters treatment in order to account for irrigation volume difference arising in individual laterals due to water pressure differences as well as issues related with emitters 2 1 4 shoot decline monitoring starting two weeks after the experiment initiation disease development was monitored every two weeks for eight weeks plants were evaluated for pythium root rot symptoms which included stunting chlorosis wilting and defoliation lookabaugh et al 2015 symptomatic plants were flagged to quantify the total number of plants that developed symptoms at each date and over the course of the study plant growth and root rot analysis to evaluate specific effects of the irrigation treatment on plant growth and disease 10 symptomatic and 10 asymptomatic plants per irrigation treatment were analyzed from each irrigation treatment at the eight week time point data were collected for dry shoot biomass fresh root biomass and percent of the root system with rot these analyses were only conducted in 2016 shoots of each plant were cut from the base of the crown oven dried at 55 c for 5 days and then weighted root balls were removed from the pots and washed in tap water multiple times to remove the peat based medium cleaned roots were weighted fresh weight and visually assessed for the percent of the root system with brown to black discoloration or degradation dry weight was not recorded since roots were utilized in destructive pathogen infection assays below roots were cleaned further by rinsing them two times in 0 1 solution of tween 20 for 30 s and then surface disinfested in 70 ethanol for 15 s and washed with sterile distilled water for downstream studies 2 1 5 pathogen infection to evaluate pathogen presence in roots four randomly selected 1 cm cleaned root segments were placed on

maryland research greenhouse college park md using commercially produced poinsettias the main purpose of the study was to explore the potential to use set point based control to reduce water inputs to levels that were considered too high risk for the producer to use in commercial trials in addition since the pathogen could be introduced to plants directly inoculated under these controlled conditions this study also offered greater likelihood of detecting interactions between p aphanidermatum root rot and reduced irrigation inputs we evaluated three set point based sensor controlled irrigation sci treatments the well watered set point used in the commercial production experiments above 45 vwc a mid range substrate moisture sm treatment 35 vwc and a low range sm 25 vwc treatment selected based on criteria described below within each irrigation treatment we evaluated two pathogen treatments inoculated and non inoculated the studies were laid out in a randomized complete block split plot design with two blocks three irrigation treatments as main plots and inoculated or non inoculated plants as subplots each subplot had eight inoculated and eight non inoculated plants that were randomly distributed within the subplot the experiment was conducted twice experiment one was initiated on october 26 2016 and experiment two was initiated on november 2 2016 the experiments were conducted in a greenhouse range with raised benches of 48 2 17 7 cm length width size during the experiment daily mean temperature ranged from 13 7 to 27 3 c during experiment one and from 15 6 to 27 3 c during experiment two with a photoperiod of 10 h per day 2 2 2 plant material and maintenance poinsettia christmas eve red were initially grown at the commercial greenhouse in 15 cm diameter round black plastic pots containing 100 g potting medium 60 peat 40 perlite maintained under daily overhead irrigation and fertilized at each irrigation with 100 ppm nitrogen constant liquid feed 19 6 18 formulation at nine weeks old plants were brought to the university of maryland greenhouses allowed to recover from relocation for one week for experiment 1 and two weeks for experiment 2 and then used in experiments at 10 and 11 weeks old respectively 2 2 3 determining irrigation treatments a moisture release curve was developed for the 60 peat 40 perlite substrate used by the commercial nursery following the simplified evaporation method described by schindler et al 2010 using the device hyprop meter group inc pullman wa based on the moisture release curve fig 1 three vwc values were selected as set points for treatments these set points were 1 45 vwc well watered treatment 2 35 vwc mid range sm and 3 25 vwc low range sm treatment which corresponded to matric potential values of 6 8 kpa 15 6 kpa and 25 9 kpa respectively based on the moisture release curve fig 1 although data on poinsettias is lacking based on profiling of other containerized annuals 6 8 kpa corresponds with near optimal growth conditions 15 6 kpa corresponds with sub optimal conditions and 25 9 corresponds with near wilt conditions kiehl et al 1992 a custom calibration was made for the peat perlite media in order to convert raw values of gs1 capacitance sensors to corresponding volumetric water contents vwc cobos 2010 following the procedure outlined by cobos and chambers 2010 2 2 4 sensor network configuration a precision sensor network sensorweb software mayim llc pittsburgh pa was set up in order to provide irrigation control to implement desired treatments three irrigation laterals were laid out on each bench with corresponding laterals controlled by individual nr5 dc nodes decagon devices inc pullman wa the nr5 nodes were connected to dc latching solenoids baccarra geva israel on the irrigation manifold that was connected to a pressure regulated main line gs1 soil moisture sensors were inserted into the root zone by cutting a slit on the outside of each pot at approximately half of the pot height the sensors were pushed through the slit with the sensor prongs oriented horizontally and covered with the media to ensure contact pots were then resealed with waterproof plumbing tape sensors were placed in a total of eight plants per irrigation treatment across the two replications irrigation was delivered to individual plants using 300 ml min output spray stakes netafim usa fresno ca gs1 sensor data were recorded on a 5 min basis using em50r and nr5 dc data loggers decagon devices inc and transmitted to the sensorweb software where they were converted into soil vwc values using the custom calibration coefficients the irrigation treatment set points were entered into the irrigation scheduler of the sensorweb software as threshold values irrigation was applied to each treatment whenever the average vwc of eight gs1 sensors per treatment dropped below the corresponding set point irrigation duration was limited to 30 s per irrigation to reduce leaching from the media irrigation application for each treatment was measured using flow meters model 25 badger meter inc milwaukee wi connected to the nr5 dc nodes the irrigation treatments were implemented for a period of 6 weeks from beginning of november to mid december 2 2 5 inoculum preparation all experiments used pythium aphanidermatum isolate sl1167 recovered from the same commercial greenhouse facility del castillo múnera and swett 2017 the isolate was grown on 10 v8 medium for 7 days 12 12 h l d 20 c and then eight 1 cm diameter plugs of actively growing mycelia were added to 100 g twice autoclaved millet seeds with an antibiotic amendment 100 g millet 0 08 g asparagine 72 ml di water contained in mushroom bags rjg sales and supply new port richey fl infested millet was incubated at 20 c under constant uv light for two weeks and shaken every other day to allow even mycelial colonization del castillo múnera and hausbeck 2016 plants containing 100 g peat based medium were inoculated by adding 3 g of infested millet seeds into each of 3 cm deep evenly spaced wells in the substrate positioned 0 5 cm from the crown pathogen controls consisted of non inoculated plants under each irrigation treatment immediately following inoculation plants were placed under the different irrigation regimes 2 2 6 effect of bacillus subtilis gb03 companion on pathogen substrate moisture interactions to evaluate the potential for a plant growth promoter as a management tool to counter effects of reducing irrigation in plants exposed to a pathogen we used the same irrigation treatments as above and applied two biological treatments to p aphanidermatum inoculated plants 1 no biological or 2 bacillus subtilis gb03 companion growth products ltd ny within each subplot irrigation treatment in each block there were four plants allocated to each biological treatment the experiment was conducted twice on the same timeline as above irrigation scheduling and pathogen inoculation were conducted as described above bacillus subtilis gb03 companion inoculum was diluted to the recommended rate of 2 5 ml l using di water fifty milliliters of companion was applied as a drench to each pot seven days before plant inoculation and then reapplied every 14 days until experiment completion for a total of four applications for the no biological treatment nothing was applied 2 2 7 growth and shoot decline analyses shoot health was assessed at 7 day intervals from 7 to 49 and 56 days post inoculation dpi for experiments one and two respectively using a rating scale that encapsulated both abiotic drought stress associated and pathogen induced decline plants were visually assessed using a 1 5 scale where 1 no symptoms 2 cupping of lower leaves and slight plant stunting 3 moderate stunting leaf wilting and chlorosis 4 severe leaf wilting and or whole plant stunting 5 plant death lookabaugh et al 2015 the area under the disease progress curve audpc was estimated based on decline over time shaner and finney 1977 stem height of each plant was evaluated at the start and end of the study and used to calculate stem growth at the end of the experiment shoots of each plant were cut from the base of the crown oven dried at 55 c for 5 days and then weighted roots were removed from the pots washed under running tap water to initially remove the peat based medium and then washed multiple times in tap water contained in buckets the total root area was quantified using the image analysis software assess 2 0 lamari 2008 to estimate the root area roots were scanned and images were analyzed in asssess 2 0 by calibrating 1 cm2 of a real size ruler and then selecting the root tissue that was recognized and measured by software following a scale from 31 to 101 color hue del castillo múnera and hausbeck 2016 all the inoculated and non inoculated plants were assessed for p aphanidermatum colonization roots were processed and both morphological and molecular identification were performed as described above for the commercial greenhouse study 2 2 8 statistical analysis experiments and blocks were considered random variables irrigation and pathogen

2004 with the proc rank procedure and proc mixed of sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc a significance level of α 0 05 was used for all analyses 3 results 3 1 reducing irrigation inputs in a commercial greenhouse facility 3 1 1 sensor network efficacy and water use during 2015 the average substrate vwc for the gi treatment was 59 4 2 2 as compared to 54 5 1 8 vwc for the sci treatment the water savings of the sci treatment based on comparative flow meter data of one irrigation lateral in each irrigation treatment was 10 2 the gi treatment typically applied 2 irrigations of 3 min length per day the irrigation duration for the sci treatment was set for 1 5 min in order to allow laterals to pressurize and maintain uniformity during 2015 water savings of the sci treatment as compared to the gi treatment was 10 2 6376 gal vs 7104 gal per irrigation zone respectively table 1 during 2016 the average substrate vwc for the gi treatment was 54 2 1 6 as compared to 50 3 1 9 for the sci treatment water saving in the sci treatment was 8 6 5836 gal vs 6390 gal per irrigation zone table 2 comparison of irrigation application of the two treatments on a weekly basis shows that the sci treatment could apply more irrigation water depending on conditions this is because the sci treatment was able to adjust water application to meet plant needs based on the substrate moisture conditions one of the important advantages provided by sci as opposed to the time based irrigation systems such as the one followed under the gi treatment 3 1 2 disease development and plant growth cumulatively ten plants bay developed pythium root rot symptoms in 2015 and 52 in 2016 the number of symptomatic plants was similar in the gi and sci treatments for the two years combined p 0 137 fig 2 based on an approximation of 600 plants bay this was equivalent to about 0 02 and 0 08 loss due to pythium root rot in each of 2015 and 2016 based on surveys 1 2 plants developed symptoms every two weeks in 2015 and 2 6 in 2016 fig 2 plants were considered symptomatic if they were wilted or stunted and had discolored roots there was a significant difference in root rot severity between plants with symptomatic shoots average of 42 root system discolored and plants with asymptomatic shoots average of 3 35 of root system discolored p 0 001 table 3 supporting the inference that shoot decline was associated with root rot to evaluate effects of the irrigation treatment on root rot severity symptomatic plants were analyzed separately there was no difference in root rot severity between the gi and sci treatments p 0 754 results showed that the sci did not have a negative effect on root size nor increase the root rot disease symptoms nevertheless there was an effect of irrigation treatment on fresh shoot weight p 0 03 which was 21 lower in symptomatic plants under sci than symptomatic plants irrigated under the gi treatment there was no effect of irrigation treatment on fresh root weight p 0 16 table 3 n 10 3 1 3 pathogen confirmation pythium isolates were recovered from 10 of symptomatic plant irrigated under gi and from 30 of the plants under sci treatment n 10 based on molecular identification using the its region all the isolates recovered shared 100 identity with pythium ultimum kx260338 1 pythium spp were not recovered from any asymptomatic plants n 10 supplemental table 1 3 2 effect of reduced substrate moisture on pythium root rot under controlled conditions 3 2 1 substrate volumetric water content dynamics the substrate vwc for all three treatments were kept within a relatively low range of the corresponding set points by triggering irrigation whenever the threshold substrate vwc for the particular treatment was reached the average substrate vwc in the three treatments during the experimental period were 48 7 for the 45 vwc treatment 36 1 under 35 vwc and 29 1 under 25 vwc irrigation events were triggered with the most frequency in the well watered treatment and frequency decreased in the mid range sm and low range sm treatments the variation in substrate vwc of the three treatments during the experiment period is given in fig 3 as an example 3 2 2 irrigation volumes the irrigation water volume applied for the three treatments in the experiment is given in table 4 the 45 vwc treatment had the highest irrigation application volume with a total of 267 l used by all plants across the whole the experiment averaged across both experiments and 0 05 l plant day this was reduced by 13 8 to 228 l 0 043 l plant day at 35 vwc and by 40 0 to 160 l 0 03 l plant day at 25 vwc 3 2 3 shoot weight and growth dry shoot weight was not significantly affected by either pathogen p 0 231 or irrigation treatment p 0 209 table 5 however based on least square means significant difference lsd dry shoot biomass was significantly lower under 25 vwc compared to 45 vwc in non inoculated plants there was a similar trend for inoculated plants but differences were not significant table 5 shoot growth was significantly affected by pathogen treatment p 0 001 but there was no effect of irrigation treatment p 0 352 based on lsd means comparisons under both 35 and 25 vwc shoot growth was significantly lower in inoculated compared to non inoculated plants but there was no effect of pathogen treatment at 45 vwc table 5 reflecting a pattern in which disease effects are enhanced as vwc decreases 3 2 4 root weight and area neither irrigation treatment p 0 059 nor pathogen treatment p 0 362 had a significant effect on fresh root weight based on anova in lsd means comparison root biomass was significantly lower under 25 vwc compared to higher substrate moisture treatments this effect was consistent in both the inoculated and non inoculated plants table 5 reflecting an overall negative effect of the low range sm treatment on root growth pathogen treatment had a significant effect on root area p 0 004 reflecting significantly lower root area in inoculated than non inoculated plants under the 25 vwc treatment nevertheless there was no difference between inoculated and non inoculated plants at 45 and 35 vwc irrigation treatment was not significant based on anova p 0 112 but in lsd analysis root area was significantly lower under 25 vwc compared to 35 vwc in inoculated plants table 5 there were no differences in root area among irrigation treatments within the non inoculated plants these results further suggest a pattern in which higher moisture levels 45 and 35 vwc do not influence disease dynamics but lower irrigation inputs 25 vwc can enhance pathogen impacts on plant growth 3 2 5 shoot decline development the major shoot symptoms observed after 35 dpi included moderate stunting and wilting fig 4 shoot decline severity at the end of the experiment did not differ between irrigation treatments in either inoculated or non inoculated plants p 0 093 fig 5 pathogen effect on the audpc was significant reflecting the effect of p aphanidermatum on plant health p 0 001 but audpc was not affected by irrigation treatment p 0 530 table 5 the audpc values for inoculated plants under the three irrigation treatments were very similar an average of 64 3 0 47 across all irrigation treatments table 5 among the non inoculated plants the highest audpc was observed at 25 vwc but it was not significantly different from 45 and 35 vwc these results reflect in part the reduced severe disease symptoms in both trials the incidence of plants with shoot decline symptoms percent of plants showing moderate to severe shoot wilting varied significantly between inoculated and non inoculated plants p 0 005 within the inoculated treatment 62 and 50 more plants developed shoot symptoms in the low range sm irrigation treatment 25 vwc compared to well watered 45 vwc and mid range sm 35 vwc irrigation treatments respectively the non inoculated plants in the three irrigation treatments remained healthy during the entire experiment ranged from 1 25 for plants at 35 vwc to 1 62 for plants at 25 vwc at the final rating for each experiment with no evidence of drought symptoms p 0 206 fig 5 3 2 6 pathogen recovery pythium aphanidermatum was recovered from an average of 55 2 08 of inoculated plants across irrigation treatments recovery frequencies were similar between irrigation treatments p 0 896 resulting re isolations were confirmed as p aphanidermatum by morphological identification and its sequences from a sub set of isolates had 100 homology with that of the sl1167 isolate used for inoculations ky646467 ncbi no pythium spp were recovered from the non inoculated plants 3 3 effect of bacillus subtilis gb03 companion on pathogen substrate moisture interactions there was not a significant effect of biological treatment on shoot growth p 0 051 nevertheless across irrigation treatments shoot elongation was 25 greater in the bacillus subtilis gb03 treated plants compared to plants that were not treated with the biological table 6 there was a significant effect of biological treatment on both fresh root weight p 0 0009 and root area p 0 046 which were both was significantly greater in b subtilis gb03 treated plants compared to the no biological treatment table 6 there was also a significant irrigation biological treatment interaction for fresh root weight reflecting significantly greater biomass in the b subtilis gb03 treated plants at 45 vwc than the other two irrigation treatments p 0 019 table 6 together growth results suggest a pattern where b subtilis gb03 can enhance growth of pathogen infected plants on a reduced irrigation regime but this effect is lost when moisture levels go below a certain threshold there were no effects of biological treatment on disease incidence or disease development p 0 07 and p 0 651 respectively table 6 4 discussion commercial greenhouse studies with poinsettias indicate that set point controlled irrigation offers an accurate and reliable means to reduce irrigation inputs on a commercial scale without negatively affecting plant growth or disease development subsequent controlled studies of the potential to further reduce water inputs suggest that additional reduction to 35 vwc is possible without affecting plant growth or root rot severity in poinsettia in the commercial experiment where the reductions in irrigation inputs were minimal due to concerns of the collaborating producer the set points used for the sci treatment 48 vwc in 2015 and 45 in 2016 reduced water inputs on average by 9 4 compared to the grower standard gi in the controlled trials the 35 vwc treatment reduced water inputs by 13 8 compared to the 45 vwc treatment and still represented no risk to plant growth either through direct physiological effects on the plant or indirect effects on the pathogen plant interaction these results suggest that the commercial greenhouse could safely reduce irrigation inputs to lower substrate vwc to 35 resulting in up to 23 2 9 4 13 8 water savings without impacting plant growth or disease in controlled studies reducing inputs to 25 vwc had a negative physiological effect on shoot and root biomass in non infected plants these results can be explained as plant growth is negatively affected when roots are fully dehydrated it may be possible that poinsettia irrigated at 25 vwc were experiencing high root dehydration consequently affecting shoot growth also plant growth can be affected depending on the crop stage in which reduced irrigation is applied consistent with our results a reduced irrigation study conducted in the ornamentals lonicera periclymenu cornus alba and forsythia intermedia showed that a reduction in volumetric moisture content reduced shoot dry mass and shoot growth davies et al 2016 comparably cameron et al 1999 showed that deficit irrigation imposed in the rhododendron cultivar hoppy reduced shoot growth this low range sm treatment 25 vwc also had pythium root rot enhancing effects under pathogen pressure which resulted in reduced root size since this effect was not observed in non inoculated plants this is inferred to reflect an irrigation treatment pathogen interaction there was also a trend for reduced shoot growth and increased disease incidence in inoculated plants irrigated at 25 vwc these results are consistent with those of del castillo múnera et al 2019 in which impacts of the root rot pathogen phytophthora capsici were enhanced below a certain soil moisture threshold water stress induces production of abscisic acid which is known to inhibit production of plant defense compounds such as salicylic acid enhancing susceptibility to disease this biochemical antagonism might account for the observed increase in pythium root rot at low range sm however since this treatment resulted in direct reductions in plant growth it would be unlikely to be implemented and thus pathogen risks would be avoided no studies to our knowledge have explored the potential for b subtilis gb03 or any other plant growth promoting bacteria to mitigate impacts of the combined effects of reduced substrate moisture under pathogen pressure however in supported of this hypothesized role studies of the bacteria bacillus subtilis have shown effects in increasing plant biomass height and flower abundance in various crops fravel 2005 glick 2012 suárez et al 2011 zaidi et al 2006 and also suppressing pathogens including p aphanidermatum little et al 2003 nakkeeran et al 2006 consistent with our hypothesis the addition of the b subtilis gb03 product companion to inoculated plants significantly increased root biomass compared to non companion treated plants under reduced soil moisture 45 vwc bacillus subtilis gb03 also increased shoot growth across all treatments these results indicate that companion can mitigate negative effects of the pathogen and enhance growth under a reduced soil moisture scenario although this effect was not observed at lower soil moisture treatments suggesting a limited capacity of the bacteria to mitigate the negative effects of water stress on plant growth positive effects of b subtillus on growth may be due to growth enhancing effects of this bacterium studies have documented various growth enhancing mechanisms of b subtillus including plant hormone production arkhipova et al 2005 berg 2009 which may be at work in this system based on this interpretation the loss of treatment effect in the lower vwc treatments may reflect the inability of the bacteria to overcome the negative growth effects of the more severe water deficit conditions although studies of biological control of pythium root rot are conflicted little et al 2003 nakkeeran et al 2006 in some cases root rot has been reduced with the application of a biopesticide nakkeeran et al 2006 thus the suppressive effects of the b subtilis treatment may also be due at least in part to pathogen suppression as one of the limitations to this study pythium root rot severity on poinsettias was low in the commercial greenhouse and although incidence was higher in the controlled greenhouse studies only minor symptoms developed this may be due to the heavy fungicide treatment truban terraclor segway truban that was applied in these commercially produced plants to control pythium that likely inhibited the disease and potentially our ability to detect the pathogen in the roots another explanation for the low disease severity observed on the controlled greenhouse trials may be that pythium spp tend to affect seeds and seedlings rather than mature plants martin and loper 1999 moorman et al 2002 since plants in this study were inoculated at 10 11 weeks old they may have been more resistant to disease a better understanding of the effect of reduced irrigation in pathogen colonization can be achieved by collecting more plants in the case of the commercial study and evaluating the extent of root colonization in greater depth through increased root sampling and complimentary culture and molecular based quantitative methods to the authors knowledge this is one of the first commercial studies to evaluate disease risks associated with sensor network driven irrigation in containerized greenhouse plants this work can be used in downstream studies to evaluate other crops pathosytems and production environments to enable reductions in irrigation water inputs and secure water availability under a shrinking water supply scenario in seeking to extrapolate from this study to understand the effect of water availability on disease development in similar systems it will be critical to consider how these interactions might vary depending on the pathogen the host as well as the growth substrate pathogen considerations should factor in the developmental stages at which the host is susceptible to disease as well as the moisture requirements of the pathogens for instance reducing soil moisture in older plants significantly enhanced phytophthora root rot which attacks plants of all ages broders et al 2007 martin and loper 1999 but had only minor effects on pythium root rot which is primarily a seedling pathogen as another example oomycetes have a motile spore phase that relies on free soil moisture to disperse in soil and root infections can be suppressed by reducing soil moisture del castillo múnera et al 2019a conversely dispersal of most true fungi relies more typically on rain wind or incidental contact and would not necessarily be inhibited by reduced soil moisture host considerations should include such factors as tolerance to drought as well as susceptibility to disease for instance both this and previous studies examined relatively drought tolerant species and identified potential to reduce substrate moisture within increasing biotic risk del castillo múnera et al 2019a in more drought sensitive crops major substrate moisture reductions may not be possible without increasing disease risk conversely greater water use reductions may be possible in species or varieties that have greater drought tolerance substrate considerations should include such factors as the composition of the substrate particle size distribution and bulk density these determine the substrates air and water holding capacities as well as its moisture retention properties in addition substrate can affect both pathogen survival and growth as an example sandy substrates can be antagonistic to survival of phytophthora species duniway 1976 newhook et al 1981 5 conclusions a minor reduction in irrigation was possible by implementing a set point based sensor controlled irrigation system sci at a commercial facility water savings resulted in 9 4 compared with the standard grower irrigation system water savings of 9 4 at a commercial facility did not affect pythium root rot caused by pythium aphanidermatum in poinsettias although pathogen recovery was 20 higher under reduced irrigation than under the standard irrigation practice in the controlled greenhouse experiment plants artificially inoculated with p aphanidermatum remained healthy and pathogen infection incidence were not significantly different when irrigation treatments were reduced from 45 to 35 vwc water usage was reduced by 13 8 between these two treatments under the lowest irrigation treatment 25 vwc rates of plant decline were increased by 50 and shoot growth the primary yield target for poinsettias was significantly lower compared with the 45 and 35 vwc treatments in inoculated plants decline was not observed in non inoculated plants at lowest irrigation treatment and shoot growth was unaffected compared to higher substrate moisture treatments however 25 vwc did reduce root growth taken together reduced irrigation regimes had differential effects depending on whether the pathogen was present water reductions which did not apparently influence plant health in the absence of the pathogen could reduce growth and plant loss under pathogen pressure to counter these effects the addition of a plant growth promoting bacteria companion bacillus subtilis gb03 to pythium inoculated plants significantly increased the shoot growth under minor substrate moisture reductions 45 vwc this effect was not observed at lower irrigation treatments in conclusion commercial nursery and greenhouse operations can decrease water inputs in this study by up to 23 without influencing plant growth or disease but disease risks need to be addressed on a case by case basis prior to large scale alterations in irrigation regimes to avoid enhanced losses and potential epidemic triggers in addition to standard disease management approaches use of plant growth promoting biologics may be useful in countering disease risks under reduced irrigation regimes this work provides critical information to the production community on how to effectively approach water use reductions in poinsettia crops as well as a range of other containerized production systems including floricultural crops to the author s knowledge this is one of the first studies to evaluate disease risks of water use reductions and potential management options in floriculture production or in any greenhouse or nursery crop acknowledgements this research is based

10856,greenhouse and nursery growers consume up to 19 thousand gallons of water per acre per day implementation of water conservation technologies to mitigate water resource depletion is imperative but recent studies indicate that associated drought stress may enhance losses from root diseases the overall objective of this study was to evaluate and manage disease risks associated with reducing irrigation in commercial production of a containerized annual nursery crop poinsettia and to improve water use efficiency without increasing losses from root disease results from a two year commercial greenhouse trial of poinsettias indicate that minor reductions irrigation application vs the standard practice grower irrigation resulted in 9 4 water savings without affecting pythium root rot pythium aphanidermatum p 0 13 although pathogen recovery from roots was 20 higher under reduced irrigation when poinsettias were inoculated with p aphanidermatum in controlled greenhouse experiments plant health and pathogen infection incidence were unchanged when substrate volumetric water content vwc was reduced from 45 to 35 with a 13 8 reduction in irrigation volume however incidence of plant decline increased by 50 under 25 vwc and shoot growth was significantly lower p 0 0001 compared to plants under higher vwc when a plant growth promoting bacteria companion bacillus subtilis gb03 was added to infected plants shoot growth was significantly increased under the 45 vwc treatment p 0 05 these studies indicate that irrigation inputs can be decreased by an estimated 23 2 in the commercial greenhouse without affecting pythium root rot below a minimum irrigation threshold 25 vwc plant pathogen dynamics may be altered to favor root disease development addition of biological products may serve to mitigate the negative effects of reducing irrigation inputs to the authors knowledge this is the first commercial scale study to evaluate biotic risks of sensor network based

greenhouses floriculture 1 introduction agriculture accounts for 60 of the fresh water used in the world connor 2015 lea cox et al 2013 in the united states water used for irrigation in the agricultural and horticultural sectors accounts for 33 of the total water used in the country maupin et al 2014 usda 2017 one of the agricultural sectors that relies most heavily on availability of high quality ground or municipal water is the nursery and greenhouse industry fulcher and fernandez 2013 lamm et al 2017 which in many cases are closed production systems that cannot benefit from precipitation a nursery at the peak of a growing season can consume from 14 to 19 thousand gallons of water per acre per day fulcher and fernandez 2013 nationally climate change events are shrinking water supplies by shifting precipitation patterns to reduce snowpack western us as well as spring and summer rainfall eastern us elliott et al 2014 piao et al 2010 vörösmarty et al 2010 reduced availability of surface water is driving increased reliance on ground water for irrigation hamilton and helsel 1995 lea cox et al 2013 which can be of poor quality and limited supply water conservation technologies such as sensor based irrigation systems offer a reliable tool to reduce water inputs in nurseries and greenhouses allowing producers to adapt to increasing water use constraints reduced irrigation techniques e g deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying aim to impose a mild stress on the crop for all or part of the developmental process costa et al 2007 dos santos et al 2003 lea cox et al 2013 using these methods irrigation inputs can be substantially reduced below grower standards without detectable effects on yields cameron et al 1999 cameron et al 2008 costa et al 2007 davies et al 2016 however growers remain hesitant to adopt reduced irrigation approaches due in part to concerns that losses from diseases might be greater when water inputs are reduced and plant stress is increased lamm et al 2017 in the greenhouse and nursery industry root rot diseases caused by the oomycetes phytophthora and pythium spp are one of the major limiting factors for producers del castillo múnera et al 2019b erwin and ribeiro 1996 leonberger et al 2013 parke et al 2014 schwingle et al 2007 warfield et al 2008 weiland 2011 oomycete diseases are favored by standing water and excessive irrigation given that water is crucial for sporangia dispersal and differentiation bryla and linderman 2007 granke et al 2009 hausbeck and lamour 2004 parke et al 2014 however low water availability can predispose the plants to oomycete pathogens making them more susceptible to infection bostock et al 2014 cook and papendick 1972 duniway 1976 macdonald 1982 in evaluating such risks using a containerized tomato phytophthora capsici model system del castillo múnera et al 2019 found that although pathogen colonization and disease incidence could be enhanced under low substrate moisture and when applied earlier in plant development moderate reductions later in plant development had minor or no negative effects indicating potential to reduce water inputs without enhancing disease losses the overall objective of this study was to translate these findings to enable adaptive water use in commercial containerized nursery systems by evaluating risks specifically we evaluated the effects of sensor based irrigation in poinsettia production disease analysis focused on pythium root rot caused by pythium aphanidermatum this is a recurrent disease that affects poinsettia production in greenhouses across the us and was previously confirmed to occur in the nursery under study del castillo múnera and hausbeck 2016 del castillo múnera and swett 2017 lookabaugh et al 2015 moorman et al 2002 stephens and powell 1982 weiland 2011 the specific objectives of this study were to i evaluate effects of a minor substrate moisture reduction on root disease development in poinsettias in a commercial greenhouse ii evaluate the maximum moisture reductions possible without reducing yield or exacerbating pythium root rot in greenhouse grown poinsettias comparing 45 35 and 25 vwc and iii test the hypothesis that plant growth enhancing bacteria can mitigate disease impacts on yield under reduced substrate moisture scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 reducing irrigation inputs in a commercial greenhouse facility effects on water use yield and disease 2 1 1 commercial facility we collaborated with a 600 000 sq foot commercial greenhouse operation in carroll county maryland to implement a set point based sensor controlled irrigation system in poinsettia this grower represents one of the major poinsettia producers in the mid atlantic growing over 25 cultivars between the months of august and november one of the recurrent pathogens isolated from poinsettia grown in this greenhouse was pythium aphanidermatum del castillo múnera and swett 2017 and preliminary surveys in 2015 indicated that it was the dominant oomycete pathogen contributing to poinsettia root rot recovered from 77 of symptomatic plants del castillo múnera and swett 2017 2 1 2 plant material and plant maintenance in the commercial trial we evaluated set point based sensor controlled irrigation sci in 11 week old poinsettia viking red growing in 20 cm diameter 3 8 l round plastic pots containing a peat perlite substrate 60 peat 40 perlite plants were drip irrigated and fertilized at every irrigation event with 100 ppm nitrogen constant liquid feed 19 6 18 they were treated with a fungicide regime of truban 8 oz 100 gal and terraclor 8 oz 100 gal at early propagation stage segway 3 oz 100 gal and truban were also applied at the end of the crop cycle 2 1 3 experimental design this study was conducted in 2015 and repeated in 2016 the experiment was conducted in a single greenhouse range with four independently controlled irrigation zones with approximately 600 plants in each zone two zones were allocated to each of the two treatments for a total of 1200 plants in each treatment in each year and 2400 plants across both years treatments consisted of i grower irrigation gi based under grower s standard irrigation practice and ii set point based sensor controlled irrigation sci based on predetermined volumetric water content vwc of the substrate for the grower irrigation gi treatment two irrigation zones were instrumented to monitor the soil volumetric water content vwc under the grower s standard irrigation practice in each zone two em50r data loggers meter group inc pullman wa were deployed at opposite ends of irrigation laterals to monitor vwc at the driest sections substrate vwcs gs1 meter group inc of four plants in each section were measured on a 5 min basis with the em50r data loggers for the duration of the study the gi treatment typically applied 2 irrigations of 3 min length per day the set point based sensor controlled irrigation sci treatment was set in two further irrigation zones at a predetermined set point vwc 48 in 2015 and 45 in 2016 that was selected by the grower as a standard practice in the nursery poinsettias are grown under high substrate vwc with frequent irrigations thus the threshold substrate vwc the grower selected for sci was relatively high in order to minimize any adverse effects of reduced soil moisture sensors and nodes were placed in a similar layout as described for the gi to monitor substrate vwc at the driest ends in addition one nr5 control node decagon devices inc was installed in each irrigation zone and was connected to the 24 v solenoid valve in the zone in order to provide irrigation control substrate vwc of five plants in proximity to the solenoid valves in each zone was measured using gs1 sensors on a 5 min basis using the nr5 nodes the vwc measurements were transmitted to a sensorweb software mayim llc pittsburgh pa and averaged on a 15 min basis irrigation was applied whenever the averaged vwc was below the predetermined set point vwc irrigation duration was limited to 1 5 min per event in order to minimize leaching and was repeated until the average vwc was at 45 in 2015 one flow meter model 40 badger meter milwaukee wi was installed on a representative lateral in one of the two irrigation zones of both the gi and sci treatments one flow meter treatment to estimate irrigation volume during 2016 one flow meter model 25 badger meter milwaukee wi was installed in every irrigation zone of the gi and sci treatments two flow meters treatment in order to account for irrigation volume difference arising in individual laterals due to water pressure differences as well as issues related with emitters 2 1 4 shoot decline monitoring starting two weeks after the experiment initiation disease development was monitored every two weeks for eight weeks plants were evaluated for pythium root rot symptoms which included stunting chlorosis wilting and defoliation lookabaugh et al 2015 symptomatic plants were flagged to quantify the total number of plants that developed symptoms at each date and over the course of the study plant growth and root rot analysis to evaluate specific effects of the irrigation treatment on plant growth and disease 10 symptomatic and 10 asymptomatic plants per irrigation treatment were analyzed from each irrigation treatment at the eight week time point data were collected for dry shoot biomass fresh root biomass and percent of the root system with rot these analyses were only conducted in 2016 shoots of each plant were cut from the base of the crown oven dried at 55 c for 5 days and then weighted root balls were removed from the pots and washed in tap water multiple times to remove the peat based medium cleaned roots were weighted fresh weight and visually assessed for the percent of the root system with brown to black discoloration or degradation dry weight was not recorded since roots were utilized in destructive pathogen infection assays below roots were cleaned further by rinsing them two times in 0 1 solution of tween 20 for 30 s and then surface disinfested in 70 ethanol for 15 s and washed with sterile distilled water for downstream studies 2 1 5 pathogen infection to evaluate pathogen presence in roots four randomly selected 1 cm cleaned root segments were placed on v8 medium amended with pimaricin 0 4 ml l ampicillin 0 25 g l rifampicin 0 01 g l and pentachloronitrobenzene 0 05 g l parp jeffers and martin 1986 pythium spp were initially confirmed by microscopic observations of oogonia van der plaats niterink 1981 and a subset of putative pythium isolates recovered from each treatment were identified by the amplification of the internal transcribed spacer its region molecular identification was performed with the primers its 1 and its 4 white et al 1990 using 1 gotaq green master mix promega madison wi amplifications were performed on a c1000 touch thermal cycler bio rad hercules ca resulting sequences were assembled using clc work bench qiagen inc germantown md and compared with a local database of its sequences obtained from the research collection of andre levesque at bold data portal ratnasingham and hebert 2007 2 1 6 statistical analysis to evaluate differences in the number of symptomatic plants per irrigation treatment years 2015 2016 and irrigation zones were considered random variables irrigation treatment was considered a fixed variable number of symptomatic plants was analyzed by anova using the proc mixed procedure of sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc to evaluate the physiological effect of irrigation treatment in symptomatic and asymptomatic plants at the end of the experiment in 2016 irrigation zones were considered random variables irrigation and plant symptom status were considered fixed variables fresh root and shoot weight and percent root discoloration in diseased plants were analyzed by anova using the proc mixed procedure of sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc residual normal distribution was tested using normality plots and the shapiro wilk test to analyze the percent of the root system with rot data were squared root transformed prior to analysis analysis of variance was evaluated using a type iii test treatment means were further compared using least square means significant difference lsd test at α 0 05 2 2 maximizing moisture reductions in commercially produced poinsettias under controlled conditions 2 2 1 experimental design the controlled greenhouse study was conducted at the university of maryland research greenhouse college park md using commercially produced poinsettias the main purpose of the study was to explore the potential to use set point based control to reduce water inputs to levels that were considered too high risk for the producer to use in commercial trials in addition since the pathogen could be introduced to plants directly inoculated under these controlled conditions this study also offered greater likelihood of detecting interactions between p aphanidermatum root rot and reduced irrigation inputs we evaluated three set point based sensor controlled irrigation sci treatments the well watered set point used in the commercial production experiments above 45 vwc a mid range substrate moisture sm treatment 35 vwc and a low range sm 25 vwc treatment selected based on criteria described below within each irrigation treatment we evaluated two pathogen treatments inoculated and non inoculated the studies were laid out in a randomized complete block split plot design with two blocks three irrigation treatments as main plots and inoculated or non inoculated plants as subplots each subplot had eight inoculated and eight non inoculated plants that were randomly distributed within the subplot the experiment was conducted twice experiment one was initiated on october 26 2016 and experiment two was initiated on november 2 2016 the experiments were conducted in a greenhouse range with raised benches of 48 2 17 7 cm length width size during the experiment daily mean temperature ranged from 13 7 to 27 3 c during experiment one and from 15 6 to 27 3 c during experiment two with a photoperiod of 10 h per day 2 2 2 plant material and maintenance poinsettia christmas eve red were initially grown at the commercial greenhouse in 15 cm diameter round black plastic pots containing 100 g potting medium 60 peat 40 perlite maintained under daily overhead irrigation and fertilized at each irrigation with 100 ppm nitrogen constant liquid feed 19 6 18 formulation at nine weeks old plants were brought to the university of maryland greenhouses allowed to recover from relocation for one week for experiment 1 and two weeks for experiment 2 and then used in experiments at 10 and 11 weeks old respectively 2 2 3 determining irrigation treatments a moisture release curve was developed for the 60 peat 40 perlite substrate used by the commercial nursery following the simplified evaporation method described by schindler et al 2010 using the device hyprop meter group inc pullman wa based on the moisture release curve fig 1 three vwc values were selected as set points for treatments these set points were 1 45 vwc well watered treatment 2 35 vwc mid range sm and 3 25 vwc low range sm treatment which corresponded to matric potential values of 6 8 kpa 15 6 kpa and 25 9 kpa respectively based on the moisture release curve fig 1 although data on poinsettias is lacking based on profiling of other containerized annuals 6 8 kpa corresponds with near optimal growth conditions 15 6 kpa corresponds with sub optimal conditions and 25 9 corresponds with near wilt conditions kiehl et al 1992 a custom calibration was made for the peat perlite media in order to convert raw values of gs1 capacitance sensors to corresponding volumetric water contents vwc cobos 2010 following the procedure outlined by cobos and chambers 2010 2 2 4 sensor network configuration a precision sensor network sensorweb software mayim llc pittsburgh pa was set up in order to provide irrigation control to implement desired treatments three irrigation laterals were laid out on each bench with corresponding laterals controlled by individual nr5 dc nodes decagon devices inc pullman wa the nr5 nodes were connected to dc latching solenoids baccarra geva israel on the irrigation manifold that was connected to a pressure regulated main line gs1 soil moisture sensors were inserted into the root zone by cutting a slit on the outside of each pot at approximately half of the pot height the sensors were pushed through the slit with the sensor prongs oriented horizontally and covered with the media to ensure contact pots were then resealed with waterproof plumbing tape sensors were placed in a total of eight plants per irrigation treatment across the two replications irrigation was delivered to individual plants using 300 ml min output spray stakes netafim usa fresno ca gs1 sensor data were recorded on a 5 min basis using em50r and nr5 dc data loggers decagon devices inc and transmitted to the sensorweb software where they were converted into soil vwc values using the custom calibration coefficients the irrigation treatment set points were entered into the irrigation scheduler of the sensorweb software as threshold values irrigation was applied to each treatment whenever the average vwc of eight gs1 sensors per treatment dropped below the corresponding set point irrigation duration was limited to 30 s per irrigation to reduce leaching from the media irrigation application for each treatment was measured using flow meters model 25 badger meter inc milwaukee wi connected to the nr5 dc nodes the irrigation treatments were implemented for a period of 6 weeks from beginning of november to mid december 2 2 5 inoculum preparation all experiments used pythium aphanidermatum isolate sl1167 recovered from the same commercial greenhouse facility del castillo múnera and swett 2017 the isolate was grown on 10 v8 medium for 7 days 12 12 h l d 20 c and then eight 1 cm diameter plugs of actively growing mycelia were added to 100 g twice autoclaved millet seeds with an antibiotic amendment 100 g millet 0 08 g asparagine 72 ml di water contained in mushroom bags rjg sales and supply new port richey fl infested millet was incubated at 20 c under constant uv light for two weeks and shaken every other day to allow even mycelial colonization del castillo múnera and hausbeck 2016 plants containing 100 g peat based medium were inoculated by adding 3 g of infested millet seeds into each of 3 cm deep evenly spaced wells in the substrate positioned 0 5 cm from the crown pathogen controls consisted of non inoculated plants under each irrigation treatment immediately following inoculation plants were placed under the different irrigation regimes 2 2 6 effect of bacillus subtilis gb03 companion on pathogen substrate moisture interactions to evaluate the potential for a plant growth promoter as a management tool to counter effects of reducing irrigation in plants exposed to a pathogen we used the same irrigation treatments as above and applied two biological treatments to p aphanidermatum inoculated plants 1 no biological or 2 bacillus subtilis gb03 companion growth products ltd ny within each subplot irrigation treatment in each block there were four plants allocated to each biological treatment the experiment was conducted twice on the same timeline as above irrigation scheduling and pathogen inoculation were conducted as described above bacillus subtilis gb03 companion inoculum was diluted to the recommended rate of 2 5 ml l using di water fifty milliliters of companion was applied as a drench to each pot seven days before plant inoculation and then reapplied every 14 days until experiment completion for a total of four applications for the no biological treatment nothing was applied 2 2 7 growth and shoot decline analyses shoot health was assessed at 7 day intervals from 7 to 49 and 56 days post inoculation dpi for experiments one and two respectively using a rating scale that encapsulated both abiotic drought stress associated and pathogen induced decline plants were visually assessed using a 1 5 scale where 1 no symptoms 2 cupping of lower leaves and slight plant stunting 3 moderate stunting leaf wilting and chlorosis 4 severe leaf wilting and or whole plant stunting 5 plant death lookabaugh et al 2015 the area under the disease progress curve audpc was estimated based on decline over time shaner and finney 1977 stem height of each plant was evaluated at the start and end of the study and used to calculate stem growth at the end of the experiment shoots of each plant were cut from the base of the crown oven dried at 55 c for 5 days and then weighted roots were removed from the pots washed under running tap water to initially remove the peat based medium and then washed multiple times in tap water contained in buckets the total root area was quantified using the image analysis software assess 2 0 lamari 2008 to estimate the root area roots were scanned and images were analyzed in asssess 2 0 by calibrating 1 cm2 of a real size ruler and then selecting the root tissue that was recognized and measured by software following a scale from 31 to 101 color hue del castillo múnera and hausbeck 2016 all the inoculated and non inoculated plants were assessed for p aphanidermatum colonization roots were processed and both morphological and molecular identification were performed as described above for the commercial greenhouse study 2 2 8 statistical analysis experiments and blocks were considered random variables irrigation and pathogen treatments were considered fixed variables replicate experiments were pooled and analyzed together in the absence of a significant experiment treatment interaction for a total of four blocks and four plants treatment combination block the variables dry shoot weight shoot elongation fresh root weight root area audpc were analyzed using anova and means comparisons were conducted based on least square means significant difference lsd the variable disease incidence was square root transformed prior to analysis disease severity data were analyzed using a non parametric analysis shah and madden 2004 with the proc rank procedure and proc mixed of sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc a significance level of α 0 05 was used for all analyses 3 results 3 1 reducing irrigation inputs in a commercial greenhouse facility 3 1 1 sensor network efficacy and water use during 2015 the average substrate vwc for the gi treatment was 59 4 2 2 as compared to 54 5 1 8 vwc for the sci treatment the water savings of the sci treatment based on comparative flow meter data of one irrigation lateral in each irrigation treatment was 10 2 the gi treatment typically applied 2 irrigations of 3 min length per day the irrigation duration for the sci treatment was set for 1 5 min in order to allow laterals to pressurize and maintain uniformity during 2015 water savings of the sci treatment as compared to the gi treatment was 10 2 6376 gal vs 7104 gal per irrigation zone respectively table 1 during 2016 the average substrate vwc for the gi treatment was 54 2 1 6 as compared to 50 3 1 9 for the sci treatment water saving in the sci treatment was 8 6 5836 gal vs 6390 gal per irrigation zone table 2 comparison of irrigation application of the two treatments on a weekly basis shows that the sci treatment could apply more irrigation water depending on conditions this is because the sci treatment was able to adjust water application to meet plant needs based on the substrate moisture conditions one of the important advantages provided by sci as opposed to the time based irrigation systems such as the one followed under the gi treatment 3 1 2 disease development and plant growth cumulatively ten plants bay developed pythium root rot symptoms in 2015 and 52 in 2016 the number of symptomatic plants was similar in the gi and sci treatments for the two years combined p 0 137 fig 2 based on an approximation of 600 plants bay this was equivalent to about 0 02 and 0 08 loss due to pythium root rot in each of 2015 and 2016 based on surveys 1 2 plants developed symptoms every two weeks in 2015 and 2 6 in 2016 fig 2 plants were considered symptomatic if they were wilted or stunted and had discolored roots there was a significant difference in root rot severity between plants with symptomatic shoots average of 42 root system discolored and plants with asymptomatic shoots average of 3 35 of root system discolored p 0 001 table 3 supporting the inference that shoot decline was associated with root rot to evaluate effects of the irrigation treatment on root rot severity symptomatic plants were analyzed separately there was no difference in root rot severity between the gi and sci treatments p 0 754 results showed that the sci did not have a negative effect on root size nor increase the root rot disease symptoms nevertheless there was an effect of irrigation treatment on fresh shoot weight p 0 03 which was 21 lower in symptomatic plants under sci than symptomatic plants irrigated under the gi treatment there was no effect of irrigation treatment on fresh root weight p 0 16 table 3 n 10 3 1 3 pathogen confirmation pythium isolates were recovered from 10 of symptomatic plant irrigated under gi and from 30 of the plants under sci treatment n 10 based on molecular identification using the its region all the isolates recovered shared 100 identity with pythium ultimum kx260338 1 pythium spp were not recovered from any asymptomatic plants n 10 supplemental table 1 3 2 effect of reduced substrate moisture on pythium root rot under controlled conditions 3 2 1 substrate volumetric water content dynamics the substrate vwc for all three treatments were kept within a relatively low range of the corresponding set points by triggering irrigation whenever the threshold substrate vwc for the particular treatment was reached the average substrate vwc in the three treatments during the experimental period were 48 7 for the 45 vwc treatment 36 1 under 35 vwc and 29 1 under 25 vwc irrigation events were triggered with the most frequency in the well watered treatment and frequency decreased in the mid range sm and low range sm treatments the variation in substrate vwc of the three treatments during the experiment period is given in fig 3 as an example 3 2 2 irrigation volumes the irrigation water volume applied for the three treatments in the experiment is given in table 4 the 45 vwc treatment had the highest irrigation application volume with a total of 267 l used by all plants across the whole the experiment averaged across both experiments and 0 05 l plant day this was reduced by 13 8 to 228 l 0 043 l plant day at 35 vwc and by 40 0 to 160 l 0 03 l plant day at 25 vwc 3 2 3 shoot weight and growth dry shoot weight was not significantly affected by either pathogen p 0 231 or irrigation treatment p 0 209 table 5 however based on least square means significant difference lsd dry shoot biomass was significantly lower under 25 vwc compared to 45 vwc in non inoculated plants there was a similar trend for inoculated plants but differences were not significant table 5 shoot growth was significantly affected by pathogen treatment p 0 001 but there was no effect of irrigation treatment p 0 352 based on lsd means comparisons under both 35 and 25 vwc shoot growth was significantly lower in inoculated compared to non inoculated plants but there was no effect of pathogen treatment at 45 vwc table 5 reflecting a pattern in which disease effects are enhanced as vwc decreases 3 2 4 root weight and area neither irrigation treatment p 0 059 nor pathogen treatment p 0 362 had a significant effect on fresh root weight based on anova in lsd means comparison root biomass was significantly lower under 25 vwc compared to higher substrate moisture treatments this effect was consistent in both the inoculated and non inoculated plants table 5 reflecting an overall negative effect of the low range sm treatment on root growth pathogen treatment had a significant effect on root area p 0 004 reflecting significantly lower root area in inoculated than non inoculated plants under the 25 vwc treatment nevertheless there was no difference between inoculated and non inoculated plants at 45 and 35 vwc irrigation treatment was not significant based on anova p 0 112 but in lsd analysis root area was significantly lower under 25 vwc compared to 35 vwc in inoculated plants table 5 there were no differences in root area among irrigation treatments within the non inoculated plants these results further suggest a pattern in which higher moisture levels 45 and 35 vwc do not influence disease dynamics but lower irrigation inputs 25 vwc can enhance pathogen impacts on plant growth 3 2 5 shoot decline development the major shoot symptoms observed after 35 dpi included moderate stunting and wilting fig 4 shoot decline severity at the end of the experiment did not differ between irrigation treatments in either inoculated or non inoculated plants p 0 093 fig 5 pathogen effect on the audpc was significant reflecting the effect of p aphanidermatum on plant health p 0 001 but audpc was not affected by irrigation treatment p 0 530 table 5 the audpc values for inoculated plants under the three irrigation treatments were very similar an average of 64 3 0 47 across all irrigation treatments table 5 among the non inoculated plants the highest audpc was observed at 25 vwc but it was not significantly different from 45 and 35 vwc these results reflect in part the reduced severe disease symptoms in both trials the incidence of plants with shoot decline symptoms percent of plants showing moderate to severe shoot wilting varied significantly between inoculated and non inoculated plants p 0 005 within the inoculated treatment 62 and 50 more plants developed shoot symptoms in the low range sm irrigation treatment 25 vwc compared to well watered 45 vwc and mid range sm 35 vwc irrigation treatments respectively the non inoculated plants in the three irrigation treatments remained healthy during the entire experiment ranged from 1 25 for plants at 35 vwc to 1 62 for plants at 25 vwc at the final rating for each experiment with no evidence of drought symptoms p 0 206 fig 5 3 2 6 pathogen recovery pythium aphanidermatum was recovered from an average of 55 2 08 of inoculated plants across irrigation treatments recovery frequencies were similar between irrigation treatments p 0 896 resulting re isolations were confirmed as p aphanidermatum by morphological identification and its sequences from a sub set of isolates had 100 homology with that of the sl1167 isolate used for inoculations ky646467 ncbi no pythium spp were recovered from the non inoculated plants 3 3 effect of bacillus subtilis gb03 companion on pathogen substrate moisture interactions there was not a significant effect of biological treatment on shoot growth p 0 051 nevertheless across irrigation treatments shoot elongation was 25 greater in the bacillus subtilis gb03 treated plants compared to plants that were not treated with the biological table 6 there was a significant effect of biological treatment on both fresh root weight p 0 0009 and root area p 0 046 which were both was significantly greater in b subtilis gb03 treated plants compared to the no biological treatment table 6 there was also a significant irrigation biological treatment interaction for fresh root weight reflecting significantly greater biomass in the b subtilis gb03 treated plants at 45 vwc than the other two irrigation treatments p 0 019 table 6 together growth results suggest a pattern where b subtilis gb03 can enhance growth of pathogen infected plants on a reduced irrigation regime but this effect is lost when moisture levels go below a certain threshold there were no effects of biological treatment on disease incidence or disease development p 0 07 and p 0 651 respectively table 6 4 discussion commercial greenhouse studies with poinsettias indicate that set point controlled irrigation offers an accurate and reliable means to reduce irrigation inputs on a commercial scale without negatively affecting plant growth or disease development subsequent controlled studies of the potential to further reduce water inputs suggest that additional reduction to 35 vwc is possible without affecting plant growth or root rot severity in poinsettia in the commercial experiment where the reductions in irrigation inputs were minimal due to concerns of the collaborating producer the set points used for the sci treatment 48 vwc in 2015 and 45 in 2016 reduced water inputs on average by 9 4 compared to the grower standard gi in the controlled trials the 35 vwc treatment reduced water inputs by 13 8 compared to the 45 vwc treatment and still represented no risk to plant growth either through direct physiological effects on the plant or indirect effects on the pathogen plant interaction these results suggest that the commercial greenhouse could safely reduce irrigation inputs to lower substrate vwc to 35 resulting in up to 23 2 9 4 13 8 water savings without impacting plant growth or disease in controlled studies reducing inputs to 25 vwc had a negative physiological effect on shoot and root biomass in non infected plants these results can be explained as plant growth is negatively affected when roots are fully dehydrated it may be possible that poinsettia irrigated at 25 vwc were experiencing high root dehydration consequently affecting shoot growth also plant growth can be affected depending on the crop stage in which reduced irrigation is applied consistent with our results a reduced irrigation study conducted in the ornamentals lonicera periclymenu cornus alba and forsythia intermedia showed that a reduction in volumetric moisture content reduced shoot dry mass and shoot growth davies et al 2016 comparably cameron et al 1999 showed that deficit irrigation imposed in the rhododendron cultivar hoppy reduced shoot growth this low range sm treatment 25 vwc also had pythium root rot enhancing effects under pathogen pressure which resulted in reduced root size since this effect was not observed in non inoculated plants this is inferred to reflect an irrigation treatment pathogen interaction there was also a trend for reduced shoot growth and increased disease incidence in inoculated plants irrigated at 25 vwc these results are consistent with those of del castillo múnera et al 2019 in which impacts of the root rot pathogen phytophthora capsici were enhanced below a certain soil moisture threshold water stress induces production of abscisic acid which is known to inhibit production of plant defense compounds such as salicylic acid enhancing susceptibility to disease this biochemical antagonism might account for the observed increase in pythium root rot at low range sm however since this treatment resulted in direct reductions in plant growth it would be unlikely to be implemented and thus pathogen risks would be avoided no studies to our knowledge have explored the potential for b subtilis gb03 or any other plant growth promoting bacteria to mitigate impacts of the combined effects of reduced substrate moisture under pathogen pressure however in supported of this hypothesized role studies of the bacteria bacillus subtilis have shown effects in increasing plant biomass height and flower abundance in various crops fravel 2005 glick 2012 suárez et al 2011 zaidi et al 2006 and also suppressing pathogens including p aphanidermatum little et al 2003 nakkeeran et al 2006 consistent with our hypothesis the addition of the b subtilis gb03 product companion to inoculated plants significantly increased root biomass compared to non companion treated plants under reduced soil moisture 45 vwc bacillus subtilis gb03 also increased shoot growth across all treatments these results indicate that companion can mitigate negative effects of the pathogen and enhance growth under a reduced soil moisture scenario although this effect was not observed at lower soil moisture treatments suggesting a limited capacity of the bacteria to mitigate the negative effects of water stress on plant growth positive effects of b subtillus on growth may be due to growth enhancing effects of this bacterium studies have documented various growth enhancing mechanisms of b subtillus including plant hormone production arkhipova et al 2005 berg 2009 which may be at work in this system based on this interpretation the loss of treatment effect in the lower vwc treatments may reflect the inability of the bacteria to overcome the negative growth effects of the more severe water deficit conditions although studies of biological control of pythium root rot are conflicted little et al 2003 nakkeeran et al 2006 in some cases root rot has been reduced with the application of a biopesticide nakkeeran et al 2006 thus the suppressive effects of the b subtilis treatment may also be due at least in part to pathogen suppression as one of the limitations to this study pythium root rot severity on poinsettias was low in the commercial greenhouse and although incidence was higher in the controlled greenhouse studies only minor symptoms developed this may be due to the heavy fungicide treatment truban terraclor segway truban that was applied in these commercially produced plants to control pythium that likely inhibited the disease and potentially our ability to detect the pathogen in the roots another explanation for the low disease severity observed on the controlled greenhouse trials may be that pythium spp tend to affect seeds and seedlings rather than mature plants martin and loper 1999 moorman et al 2002 since plants in this study were inoculated at 10 11 weeks old they may have been more resistant to disease a better understanding of the effect of reduced irrigation in pathogen colonization can be achieved by collecting more plants in the case of the commercial study and evaluating the extent of root colonization in greater depth through increased root sampling and complimentary culture and molecular based quantitative methods to the authors knowledge this is one of the first commercial studies to evaluate disease risks associated with sensor network driven irrigation in containerized greenhouse plants this work can be used in downstream studies to evaluate other crops pathosytems and production environments to enable reductions in irrigation water inputs and secure water availability under a shrinking water supply scenario in seeking to extrapolate from this study to understand the effect of water availability on disease development in similar systems it will be critical to consider how these interactions might vary depending on the pathogen the host as well as the growth substrate pathogen considerations should factor in the developmental stages at which the host is susceptible to disease as well as the moisture requirements of the pathogens for instance reducing soil moisture in older plants significantly enhanced phytophthora root rot which attacks plants of all ages broders et al 2007 martin and loper 1999 but had only minor effects on pythium root rot which is primarily a seedling pathogen as another example oomycetes have a motile spore phase that relies on free soil moisture to disperse in soil and root infections can be suppressed by reducing soil moisture del castillo múnera et al 2019a conversely dispersal of most true fungi relies more typically on rain wind or incidental contact and would not necessarily be inhibited by reduced soil moisture host considerations should include such factors as tolerance to drought as well as susceptibility to disease for instance both this and previous studies examined relatively drought tolerant species and identified potential to reduce substrate moisture within increasing biotic risk del castillo múnera et al 2019a in more drought sensitive crops major substrate moisture reductions may not be possible without increasing disease risk conversely greater water use reductions may be possible in species or varieties that have greater drought tolerance substrate considerations should include such factors as the composition of the substrate particle size distribution and bulk density these determine the substrates air and water holding capacities as well as its moisture retention properties in addition substrate can affect both pathogen survival and growth as an example sandy substrates can be antagonistic to survival of phytophthora species duniway 1976 newhook et al 1981 5 conclusions a minor reduction in irrigation was possible by implementing a set point based sensor controlled irrigation system sci at a commercial facility water savings resulted in 9 4 compared with the standard grower irrigation system water savings of 9 4 at a commercial facility did not affect pythium root rot caused by pythium aphanidermatum in poinsettias although pathogen recovery was 20 higher under reduced irrigation than under the standard irrigation practice in the controlled greenhouse experiment plants artificially inoculated with p aphanidermatum remained healthy and pathogen infection incidence were not significantly different when irrigation treatments were reduced from 45 to 35 vwc water usage was reduced by 13 8 between these two treatments under the lowest irrigation treatment 25 vwc rates of plant decline were increased by 50 and shoot growth the primary yield target for poinsettias was significantly lower compared with the 45 and 35 vwc treatments in inoculated plants decline was not observed in non inoculated plants at lowest irrigation treatment and shoot growth was unaffected compared to higher substrate moisture treatments however 25 vwc did reduce root growth taken together reduced irrigation regimes had differential effects depending on whether the pathogen was present water reductions which did not apparently influence plant health in the absence of the pathogen could reduce growth and plant loss under pathogen pressure to counter these effects the addition of a plant growth promoting bacteria companion bacillus subtilis gb03 to pythium inoculated plants significantly increased the shoot growth under minor substrate moisture reductions 45 vwc this effect was not observed at lower irrigation treatments in conclusion commercial nursery and greenhouse operations can decrease water inputs in this study by up to 23 without influencing plant growth or disease but disease risks need to be addressed on a case by case basis prior to large scale alterations in irrigation regimes to avoid enhanced losses and potential epidemic triggers in addition to standard disease management approaches use of plant growth promoting biologics may be useful in countering disease risks under reduced irrigation regimes this work provides critical information to the production community on how to effectively approach water use reductions in poinsettia crops as well as a range of other containerized production systems including floricultural crops to the author s knowledge this is one of the first studies to evaluate disease risks of water use reductions and potential management options in floriculture production or in any greenhouse or nursery crop acknowledgements this research is based

10857,over the past 20 years marketplace demand for corn has prompted many farmers in the red river valley rrv of the north to include more corn in their crop rotations with a very flat topography and heavy clayey soils the rrv can have shallow water tables in the spring and fall but can be dry in the summer due to these field conditions some farmers have installed subsurface drainage sd systems with structures for controlled drainage cd manage the water table in a field and subirrigation si add water to the field via the sd system to improve corn production in a cd si field an eddy covariance system was used to measure and quantify energy flux components along with soil moisture content swc and water table depth wtd measurements during four corn growing seasons in 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 the results show that the average swc in 2012 was significantly different from the other three years the swc and wtd in 2016 were more stable compared to the other years the cd practice had a positive effect during a wet year in 2013 which resulted in 26 7 higher yield than the county average during the dry growing season of 2017 the use of subirrigation resulted in 6 6 higher yield than the county average the corn evapotranspiration totals eta were 468 476 551 and 537 mm for 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively the average crop coefficients were 0 49 0 73 0 88 0 86 and 0 69 for the initial development tasseling reproductive and maturity stages respectively they were calculated from the daily eta values only from days with more than 45 of total available water in the root zone and the asce ewri standardized grass based reference evapotranspiration this study showed that the sd along with the cd si system can be used for optimal water management of field corn during both wet and dry years keywords corn controlled drainage subirrigation eddy covariance yield crop coefficient 1 introduction corn is an important cereal crop in the united states with over 385 million metric tons of production in 2016 2017 us grains council 2019 which accounts for about one third of global corn production the planted area for grain corn in north dakota has increased from about 334 000 ha in 1997 to over 1 3 million ha in 2017 usda nass 2017 the increased demand has prompted many farmers to grow more corn in north dakota and particularly in the red river valley rrv of the north higher yields have been achieved due to improvements in farming technology and improved corn hybrids the rrv area has some of the most productive soils in the us but the near flat topography heavy clayey soils and increased salinity can hinder corn production due to a shallow water table and seasonal waterlogging conditions in spring and fall one of the most effective practices to aid in earlier planting and later harvest is to utilize a subsurface drainage sd the sd system employs buried perforated pipes to drain excess water and lower the water table in the soil profile wang et al 2004 water table management in agricultural fields can be improved by adding structures for controlled drainage cd to the sd system which may also include a subirrigation si aspect using a weir or stop log in an outlet structure cd controls the time and amount of drainage outflow and keeps water table depths at a desired level the si system is defined as the application of irrigation water below the ground surface by raising the water table within or near the root zone asabe standards 2015 in recent years si has become a supplementary component for drainage water management strategies by adding water through the sd system and control devices jia et al 2017 hence the combination of cd and si cd si can provide an optimal soil water condition to enhance crop production while various studies reported yield increases for different crops using cd si i e tomatoes soybeans and corn questions remain regarding the effect of drainage water management via a cd si system on corn performance such as the relationship between soil water content water table depth and evapotranspiration et during the crop growing season among all factors i e soil properties weather variability and salinity et plays a dominant role in crop production and is a critical factor in the hydrological cycle accurately determining the actual crop et eta which is the plants actual use of water in a cd si field can reveal crop water status and provide water management information to enhance crop production kandel et al 2013 sharma and minhas 2005 and improve nitrogen use efficiency mejia et al 2000 therefore quantifying the eta in field conditions could be a practical way to make appropriate decisions under cd si water management and evaluate the use of cd si on various crop stages several methods are available to measure daily eta directly some of the most used methods are ground based such as soil water balance and lysimeter djaman and irmak 2013 niaghi et al 2015 others are above ground methods including eddy covariance niaghi and jia 2017 niaghi et al 2019 shi et al 2008 surface renewal rosa and tanny 2015 bowen ratio energy balance shi et al 2008 uddin et al 2013 and remote sensing technology nagler et al 2005 niaghi 2014 since eta is an important component of water balance and hydrologic studies considerable research efforts have attempted to estimate the eta from weather data allen et al 1998 therefore eta can be indirectly determined from the reference evapotranspiration etref calculated from weather data and the recommended crop coefficient kc at various stages of the specified crop the kc represents regional climate characteristics crop type plant density phenology soil water status and other parameters anderson et al 2017 and should be developed for each study region numerous studies both in the past and ongoing are or have been conducted to evaluate different approaches for estimating eta at the field scale anapalli et al 2018 o brien et al 2018 majnooni heris et al 2013 however studies conducted under the cd si condition are limited to develop the kc values for each region accurately measured eta at the field scale is necessary the eddy covariance ec system is regarded as the most accurate method for in situ eta measurement at scales of 0 1 1 km rana and katerji 2000 the ec has been successfully used to measure eta over different crop fields and forest lands facchi et al 2013 baker and griffis 2005 for decades when using the ec method for energy balance research the sum of sensible heat h and latent heat le fluxes is about 10 30 less than the available energy rn g where rn is net radiation and g is soil heat flux russell et al 2015 twine et al 2000 suggested one way to close the energy balance was to assume that the h was measured correctly with a sonic anemometer and then solve for le as the residual in the energy balance equation le rn g h this procedure was also used by chávez et al 2009 niaghi et al 2019 and payero and irmak 2013 for the le calculation rijal et al 2012 used an ec system in a field with cd treatment to develop new kc values for corn in the rrv based on data from one year due to climate corn hybrids and variable farming practices one year data will likely not fully represent the variability of eta and kc therefore their range and fluctuation remain unclear exacerbating the problem other studies that have provided the regional kc values were conducted several decades ago e g steele et al 1996 stegman 1986 since then corn hybrids have evolved from conventional to modified hybrids with different water use and water stress characteristics payero and irmak 2013 the overall objective of this study was to estimate corn eta in a field for four years under cd si management but with various climate conditions and different corn hybrids the specific objectives were to 1 analyze the effect of cd si on soil water content and water table depth 2 analyze daily diurnal and cumulative energy fluxes during various corn growing stages 3 evaluate the crop yield along with the estimated eta and 4 develop new crop coefficients at various growing stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 field description the experiment was conducted in the rrv on an agricultural field located in the buffalo river watershed in clay county west central minnesota 46 59 20 n 96 41 06 w with an altitude of 271 m above sea level fig 1 the area of the field was 54 6 ha but only 16 6 ha in the middle section of the field was studied where the south and the north areas served as buffer areas kolars et al 2019 the soil in the study area was characterized as poorly drainable containing a bearden silt loam 50 of the total area an overly silty clay loam 27 of the area and a colvin silty clay loam 23 of the area with an impermeable layer at about 3 m depth jia et al 2017 the sd system was installed in august 2010 with 12 2 m spacing 0 91 m of average tile depth on a 0 1 grade with a drainage coefficient of 9 5 mm day jia et al 2017 the diameter of the drainage main was 254 mm along the west side of the field a second main line 152 mm diameter corrugated non perforated pipe was installed for si water delivery purposes at the higher elevation east end of the field to account for slow flow caused by the flat topography and the small size of the laterals 76 2 mm thus both irrigation and drainage followed the same flow path and direction with different flow periods during the season irrigation water for si was provided by gravity flow from a storage tank located at the north side of the field while si was applied one section at a time to the three sections in the field kolars et al 2019 the water delivery pipe to the south side of the field had an uphill grade resulting in 0 6 m elevation difference jia et al 2017 between the base of the storage tank and the end of the irrigation delivery pipe a water pump was used to fill the tank from the legal ditch on the north side of the field and was monitored during the entire irrigation period using a current sensor the volume and flow rate of the si water for the middle section was measured with an inline propeller meter mccrometer hemet california corn was grown in 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 while soybean was planted in 2014 and sugarbeets in 2015 corn row spacing was 76 cm with a plant spacing of about 10 cm emergence occurred within an average of 10 days after planting dap and the emergence date was estimated from images taken by an automatic in situ camera the nitrogen fertilizer was applied as top dressing at the emergence stage according to the farmer corn height was measured weekly from the soil surface to the highest point of the arch of the uppermost leaf tip pointing downward the grain was harvested with approximately 15 moisture although the exact date changed each year hybrid planting emergence and harvesting dates fertilizer rate si water application and maximum crop heights during the four study years are shown in table 1 2 2 monitoring climate variables soil moisture and water table depth the climate at the study site was categorized as sub humid with short and mild summer long term average temperature of 19 8 c and cold winter average temperature of 8 5 c with average annual rainfall between 533 and 635 mm according to north dakota agricultural weather network ndawn 2018 data a weather station onset corporation pocasset ma was used near the ec system to collect daily rainfall air temperature and relative humidity data a standard tipping bucket rain gauge that recorded rain events and amounts with 0 25 mm accuracy was located on an independent support 2 5 m above the ground the off season october may precipitation was obtained from the minnesota state climatology office for morken township mn dnr 2019 soil water by volume and soil temperature were measured at 30 min intervals by pairs of hydra probe ii sensors stevens water monitoring systems inc portland or located on tile within 1 m of a tile and between two tiles 5 2 m from the nearest tile at 5 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 cm depths the average volumes of soil water at two locations were used to compare the statistical difference of the swc for each month of the study year for statistical analysis one way anova and bonferroni holm test were used kraus 2014 based on a hyprop and wp4 experiment for each 30 cm of soil profile roy et al 2018 the average volumetric soil water contents swc at field capacity fc 1 3 bar permanent wilting point pwp 15 bar and saturation for the 0 90 cm soil layer were 41 17 and 53 4 respectively the management allowed depletion was set at 55 of the total available water recommended by fao56 allen et al 1998 and was used as an indicator for a well watered crop the total available water taw is the difference between the swc in the root zone at the fc and the pwp allen et al 1998 thus taw was used to determine the number of days for crops without water stressed conditions when estimating the kc values therefore the days where the swc was less than 45 of taw the corn was considered to be stressed and were eliminated from the kc calculations the wtd was monitored using a pair of observation wells 2 m deep installed near the ec system located on tile and between the tiles similar to the paired soil moisture sensors the wtds were measured automatically by water level transducers model u 20 001 01 onset computer pocasset ma at 1 h intervals the automatically measured wtds were adjusted using manually measured wtds on a monthly basis also the measured wtds were corrected for barometric pressure and air temperature compensation as recommended by the manufacturer the barometric pressure was measured for a period of time but was later eliminated due to limited space on the datalogger the measured barometric pressure between the field and the ndawn site were compared and did not show significant differences since the ndawn station was located 13 7 km from the study site therefore the ndawn measured values were used for barometric pressure compensation due to the short distance and flat topography kolars et al 2019 2 3 measuring evapotranspiration and energy fluxes to monitor the energy fluxes an ec station campbell scientific inc logan utah was placed at the center of the cd si field with 400 m fetch distance in all directions fig 1 the ec system consisted of a quick response three dimensional sonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa pointed in the predominant wind direction northwestern coupled with a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa to measure the wind speed and vapor density fluctuations respectively the net radiometer model q7 1 rebs campbell scientific inc was oriented in a southerly direction and was kept 1 5 m above the crop canopy during the initial stages of the crop growing season as the corn height increased the sensor was raised to keep it 1 m above the crop canopy the csat3 sonic anemometer and kh20 gas analyzer were installed on the tower with a maximum height of 3 m due to the tower height limitation the instruments were kept approximately 0 4 m above the canopy when corn reached its maximum height as a rule of thumb for agricultural weather stations the ec system should be kept at least 1 m above the crop canopy asabe standard 2004 to avoid any site aridity effects however for a humid region with high wind speed conditions during most of the time the instrumentation height would have minimal effect to the flux measurement jia et al 2007 additional 10 hz flux data analysis also revealed that the shapes of the spectral and co spectral analysis were valid the cr3000 datalogger recorded signals from these instruments at a frequency of 10 hz were corrected for wind speed rotation based on double rotation and detrending by block method time lags using maximum covariance approaches spike effect plausibiliy range of 5 standard deviations and amplitude resolution with range variation as 7 standard deviations while the corrected data were averaged over 30 minute intervals two 12 v direct current deep cycle rechargeable marine batteries were connected in parallel and recharged by two solar panels model sp70 l campbell scientific inc logan ut usa which powered the ec system even in cloudy and cold climate conditions the two batteries were placed inside a sealed box with small holes drilled only allowing wires to be extended outside the box in this way it prevented animal damage and impacts from weather events a pair of self calibrating soil heat flux plates hfp01sc l campbell scientific inc were used in 2012 and 2013 due to frequent sensor malfunctions they were replaced with a pair of hft3 l soil heat flux plates rebs soil heat flux plate campbell scientific inc in the 2016 and 2017 study years these soil heat flux plates were installed in the ground at 8 cm with 0 5 m distance to reduce the spatial variability and two soil thermocouples were placed 2 and 6 cm above each of the soil heat flux plates for soil heat storage correction a pair of soil water content reflectometers model cs616 campbell sci inc logan ut usa were installed at 5 and 15 cm depths outside and between the soil heat flux plates using the ec system the land surface exchange fluxes derived from all sensors were averaged to 30 min including incoming shortwave solar radiation rs rn le h and g all in units of w m 2 due to various source of errors in flux measurement by the ec which can be related to weather conditions site properties or system maintenance weekly site visits were made to download the data for post processing the measured rn was also corrected for wind effects the g was calculated from the two soil heat flux plates and corrected based on a pair of soil temperature sensors and water content reflectometers to account for the stored heat above the soil heat flux plate the 30 min collected h values by the csat3 were corrected for coordinate rotation and sonic temperature moreover because of the widely recognized energy balance closure problem in ec measurements the 30 min energy fluxes were screened to keep the daytime rn 0 w m 2 data in the analysis days with rain events greater than 10 mm were not considered in the eta and kc calculations niaghi et al 2019 the daily eta values were calculated by summing up the 30 min calculated eta from the calculated residual le values details associated with meteorological and calculation procedures of the flux were reported previously niaghi et al 2019 2 4

widely used and accepted method to calculate etref subedi et al 2017 based on grass reference crop eto or alfalfa etr daily kc values based on grass kco and alfalfa kcr were derived as a ratio of

and jensen haise equations denoted as s jh and based on jensen and haise 1963 3 results and discussion 3 1 water table and soil moisture relations rain amounts and distribution timing and volumetric swc for the two soil layers 0 30 cm and 45 90 cm as a function of dap are shown in fig 2 the fc pwp and 45 taw lines indicate the swc condition and water accessible to the crop furthermore the wtds on tile and between drainage tiles during the corn growing season in 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 2 the lowest amount of in season may october 182 mm and off season october 2011 april 2012 198 mm precipitation was recorded in 2012 the lowest swc with an average of 0 28 m3 m 3 was observed in the 0 30 cm and 45 90 cm soil layers in 2012 with increasing crop water requirements and root development the swc dropped to below 45 taw in both 0 30 cm and 45 90 cm soil layers however the swc in deeper layers was close to 45 taw line for a longer time without receiving moisture from either rainfall or through the si application despite drought conditions in 2012 and low amounts of rainfall the mild slope of swc reduction for 45 90 cm soil layer revealed that the capillary rise and possible contribution of the deeper wtd could contribute to crop water requirement beltrão et al 1996 fidantemiz et al 2019 niaghi et al 2019 in 2013 the swc went above the fc line due to heavy rain events at the initial and development corn stages fig 3 shows the sudden wtd reduction from about 60 cm to 140 cm below the surface due to the sd system after the first heavy rain event in 2013 the mild slope of the reduction in wtd from 51 dap to about 80 dap after a heavy rain event showed the cd ability that kept the swc above 45 taw to meet crop water requirement crop development and non uniform distribution of rain in 2013 caused a shortage in water supply from 90 to 100 dap however utilizing the si system on august 3 88 dap kept the swc above the 45 taw and reduced the effect of limited swc on the crop growth the amount of off season precipitation from 2012 to 2013 winter was about 332 mm mn dnr 2019 that recharged the wtd and helped with better crop growth in 2013 in 2016 in addition to a uniform distribution of rainfall 322 mm off season precipitation from the 2015 2016 winter season was stored in the soil profile a small depth of water 5 4 mm was applied through the si system between september 2 and 6 129 and 133 dap to keep the swc near the fc point or to test the si system performance jia et al 2017 despite a good amount of rainfall and wtd recharge the wtd was not measured in the range of observation wells depth 2 m during the early growing season of 2017 due to sufficient stored water in the soil profile from the off season precipitation 334 mm the swc was near the fc point at the shallower depth 0 30 cm and above the fc line in the deeper layer 45 90 cm of the soil profile early in the season therefore application of cd was necessary to keep the infiltrated water in the soil profile for a longer time with the first heavy rain event on 50 dap the swc increased for the 0 30 cm and 45 90 cm soil layers and the wtd was raised from 190 cm to 140 cm below the soil surface at 59 dap water was applied to the field through the si system to keep swc near the fc point as the corn grew water uptake caused the wtd to drop from 140 cm to 190 cm and decreased the swc to below the fc point for the days when the swc of the 0 30 cm layer was below the 45 taw the deeper layers had enough moisture to support the crop water requirement since they stayed above the 45 taw until the end of the growing season table 2 summarizes the monthly differences of the volumetric swc for all study years obtained from one way anova and bonferroni holm tests kraus 2014 the table shows a diagonal matrix with upper triangle for the surface soil 0 30 cm and lower triangle for the deeper layer 45 90 cm respectively among the study years almost all months during the 2012 growing season had significant differences p 0 05 in swc with other study years and experienced a lower swc drier condition than the other years due to the lowest amount of rainfall despite a 97 mm difference of in season rainfall between 2013 and 2016 the statistical analysis showed non significant swc differences between the 2013 and 2016 study years furthermore with 296 mm of in season rainfall in 2017 it showed a non significant swc difference with 2016 for may july and august therefore this implied that the off season precipitation had an important effect on soil moisture recharge and thus on crop growth during the growing season to study the wtd swc and energy flux partitioning effect on crop performance the growing season in each year was divided into five stages initial development tasseling reproductive and maturity fig 3 summarizes the cumulative amounts of in season rainfall for each stage while fig 4 summarizes the analysis of swc and wtd as boxplots for the five growing stages of the four study years the range of swc variation for the 0 30 cm soil layer was higher than that for the deeper soil profile in all four years this range was 0 22 0 22 0 15 and 0 20 m3 m 3for the 0 30 cm soil layer and 0 11 0 20 0 10 and 0 18 m3 m3 for the 45 90 cm soil layer in 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 respectively the wtd in 2012 had the lowest fluctuation of about 4 3 cm and 9 2 cm for on tile and between tile locations respectively these ranges were 17 8 cm and 12 6 cm for on tile and between tiles in 2016 the largest range of variation was observed in 2013 due to the recharged soil profile with pronounced off season precipitation early snow melting and several rain events during the growing season the shallowest wtd in 2013 was observed as 117 cm for on tile and 81 cm for between tile locations respectively the wtd variation was high during tasseling stage in 2017 due to the application of si and the wtd fluctuation for both on tile and between tile locations were about 54 cm application of si and rain events decreased the wtd from the soil surface during the development and tasseling stages in 2017 the si application also recharged the soil profile and increased the potential for capillary rise the swc and wtd analysis showed that the highest swc was found in 2013 during the development stage and the wtd was about 110 cm from the soil surface in the tasseling stage the swc was similar in 2013 2016 and 2017 but the wtd in 2013 and 2017 was closer to the soil surface than that in 2016 during the reproductive stage the highest swc was found in 2016 during the maturity stage a higher swc variability was found in 2013 for the 45 90 cm soil layer overall 2016 experienced more stable swc and wtd than all other study years and 2013 had the highest range of swc and wtd fluctuations the swcs in 2013 and 2016 were always above the 45 taw for all growing stages indicating that they had the optimal condition for crop growth a field study by mejia et al 2000 found that corn yield was greater in the cd plots than that in the free drainage plots ghane et al 2012 reported an average 6 increase on corn yield due to the cd practice in northwest ohio in addition jia et al 2014 found that a cd si field had 10 higher yield than the cd field ng et al 2002 reported a 64 increase in corn yield by using a cd si system cooper et al 1991 found a 58 yield advantage for a cd si system over a non irrigated field overall different studies have shown the advantages of the cd and si application for crop production however depending on the climate and regional and land characteristics the effect could be different for this current study according to the swc and wtd observations the best crop yield was observed in 2013 wet year due to the cd practice and in 2017 dry year due to the si application as expected 3 2 energy fluxes all measured energy fluxes rn g and h and the calculated le using the residual approach showed high day to day fluctuations due to weather conditions crop stages canopy coverage and soil water availability due to the drought condition in 2012 the gap between the estimated le and rn was the highest among all four years crop stress and lack of water in 2012 decreased the le rn g ratio therefore the remaining available energy rn g enhanced the measured h and g values and increased the h rn g ratio the measured energy fluxes in 2013 were affected by rain events swc and wtd daily energy flux pattern also showed high variation for the estimated le and h among the four seasons this variation was related to the swc or the wtd fluctuation or the variation in the climate condition by following the growing season with rain events and following the crop to reproductive and maturity stages in 2013 the estimated le and h become similar in terms of ratio to the available energy the daily trend of measured fluxes in 2016 illustrated an increase in the estimated le and decrease in measured h from planting to the reproductive stages among the study years the highest partitioned energy to le was in 2016 at crop maturity the estimated le was reduced and the h was increased keeping the swc near the fc point using the cd practice until 60 dap resulted in a greater le estimate in 2017 with the le rn g ratios 0 57 and 0 68 in may and june respectively after the si application the water was held in the soil profile with the cd practice therefore the cd si provided benefits over an extended period that might enhance the le and the le rn g ratio table 3 summarizes the average measured energy components for each month 3 2 1 diurnal and growth stage processes fig 5 shows the diurnal pattern of the energy flux components for each stage of the study years the le h and g showed a parabolic pattern during the various growing stages corresponding to the diurnal rn changes the effect of different planting dates in each year resulted in different peaks and trends of the energy fluxes based on the diurnal comparison in the initial stage a higher rn value was measured in the early time of the day 12 pm in 2016 and 2017 but delayed in 2012 and 2013 2 pm due to the late planting dates table 1 the higher estimated le value was measured at the initial stage in 2016 due to the higher rn value and longer day time as well as a higher swc the other study years showed a similar trend for estimated le and h values at the initial stage of the crop growth during the development stage higher amounts of rainfall in 2013 led to a near saturation point of swc which increased the estimated le compared to the other study years the longer duration of rn in the development stage was observed in 2012 and 2016 however due to the limited swc in 2012 the estimated le was not as high as in 2016 the tasseling stage is critical for corn yield since the yield components of ear and kernel number can no longer be increased by the plant growth and the potential size of the kernel is defined in this stage ransom and endres 2019 thus optimal soil water conditions should be provided to obtain better crop performance in the tasseling stage the swc was limited during the tasseling stage in 2012 fig 2 compared to the other study years despite the sufficient swc in 2013 the average daily estimated le was less than that in 2016 and 2017 this indicated that both swc and rn had higher effects on the estimated le during the reproductive stage the highest and lowest les were measured in 2017 and 2013 respectively the estimated le was the lowest in 2013 due to the rainy days and cloudy conditions as the crop approached the maturity stage the estimated le decreased and most of the available energy was partitioned into h and g however due to the optimal swc at maturity and reproductive stages in 2017 and higher rn than the other study years the estimated le was higher and therefore the crop growth was also better 3 2 2 cumulative energy fluxes fig 6 shows the cumulative energy fluxes versus dap for the study years the difference between the cumulative le and h illustrated how well the available energy had partitioned between the le and the h in 2012 the highest cumulative rn 4377 mj m 2 and the lowest cumulative le 2320 mj m 2 was observed in 2013 the cumulative rn 3698 mj m 2 was lower than the all other study years due to cloudy conditions and several rain events although it had the lowest cumulative rn the slope of cumulative le 14 3 mj m 2 d 1 and h 6 5 mj m 2 d 1 in 2013 was higher than that in 2017 le 13 5 mj m 2 d 1 h 6 3 mj m 2 d 1 the highest cumulative le was observed in 2016 2507 mj m 2 that led to better crop growth and yield in comparison with the other study years the highest slope of the estimated le was observed in 2016 16 6 mj m 2 d 1 which was related with the potential eta for all of the study years regardless of the weather conditions partitioning of available energy to h was more positive during the early season than the later season following crop development increased demand for water and ground surface coverage by vegetation the measured h and g values were reduced to minimal rates however this reduction in h and g was higher in years with higher swc and available energy than that in the other years therefore during crop development tasseling and reproductive stages most of the available energy was partitioned into le instead of h and g application of si showed a significant impact on keeping the swc above the 45 taw threshold the time of the si application showed the most important impact on le according to the measured fluxes its diurnal analysis and its cumulative product of the energy components the cd practice was effective especially when the swc remained near the fc point at the development and tasseling stages furthermore the si application during the maturity stage is important and can influence crop yields stegman 1986 and increase corn kernel moisture before harvesting 3 3 evapotranspiration the daily eta values were calculated by summing up the 30 min estimated le data fig 7 shows the estimated eta calculated eto and etr for the growing season of the study years as it was expected in all of the study years the eta rate was increased by increasing canopy cover throughout the season from cold spring to warm summer and then decreased in the fall season after crop maturity the highest eta rates were observed in june and july when corn was at tasseling and reproductive stages with a complete cover over the soil surface table 4 summarizes the cumulative eta along with the yield and the county average yield for the study region although the energy flux components and meteorological analysis in 2013 showed less suitable conditions for crop production than that in 2016 the optimal swc due to sd and cd might have resulted in a higher yield 26 7 than the county average yield on the other hand due to several heavy rain events in 2013 most farm lands had ponding and waterlogging problems that caused a lower county yield at the study site sd prevented the land from a ponding situation in 2013 fig 4 and enhanced the crop productivity in 2012 a perforated irrigation water delivery main was used for the si system which led to the inability to supply enough water during the drought conditions in addition a late season corn variety 93 day instead of a typical 85 day maturity corn variety in this region was planted which resulted in poor germinations that could be visually observed jia et al 2014 in the spring of 2012 in 2013 due to heavy rainfall events in june the field benefited from the cd practices because additional water was held in the soil profile instead of flowing away another study in 2013 in the same region showed that an undrained field was under waterlogged conditions for a long period of time and a lower crop yield was obtained due to the wet conditions jia et al 2014 further jia et al 2014 observed that more than 75 of drainage water was kept in the field due to the cd practices compared to the drainage outflow from a conventional drainage field despite 29 less rainfall in 2016 than that in 2013 the highest yield was measured in 2016 uniform distribution and sufficient rainfall at tasseling and development stages in 2016 enhanced the crop production furthermore the cd practices kept the soil moisture near the fc and increased crop productivity not only did our study have the highest yield in 2016 but also the county average had the best yield compared to all other study years this indicated the growing season in 2016 had the best conditions for crop production in terms of available energy soil moisture storage and weather condition the rainfall amount and weather conditions in 2012 and 2017 were similar however because of 12 mm si application and 334 mm off season precipitation the crop growth increased in the 2017 development stage application of si at high water demand periods caused a greater eta in 2017 compared to that in the 2012 growing season more irrigation was applied in september and early october 2017 to increase the soil moisture but the amount was not significant and did not affect the yield in 2017 instead it might benefit the yield in 2018 3 4 crop coefficients the highest kcr and kco values for the study years occurred between 80 and 90 dap which was between late july and early august rapid increases of kc were observed after the rainfall and si application fig 8 shows the calculated kco and kcr for days with swc 45 taw for the study years the developed kco reasonably followed the fao56 recommended kco curve for corn in 2016 and 2017 but not in 2012 and 2013 although all the years were screened for swc greater than 45 taw the best fit was observed in 2016 that had the highest cumulative le and near the fc point of swc during high water demand stages of crop growth this manner was similar for the calculated kcr in 2016 that matches better with the s p polynomial curve overall the calculated kco and kcr values for the field with cd si in all study years followed in a similar manner as the recommended fao56 and previously developed polynomial curves however the swc was not the only factor limiting the crop productivity the energy flux analysis in the previous section showed that it had the highest rn values in 2012 but limited swc condition although the swc was not limited in 2013 the cumulative rn was less than that in 2016 and 2017 the combined higher cumulative rn and higher partitioned available energy to le in 2016 and 2017 resulted in higher crop yield the comparison between the calculated kcr and the developed kcr by the s p method showed a good agreement similar to this study the kcr values developed by steele et al 1996 included non stressed and stressed crop conditions for example prunty and montgomery 1991 water balance data for 1985 1988 later used by steele et al 1996 included non stressed conditions of 30 40 depletion of soil water throughout the season as well as 70 depletions early in the season and 60 late in the season the water stress conditions imposed by prunty and montgomery 1991 did not cause yield reductions for the initial growing stage a significant difference was observed between the kcr values from steele et al 1996 and the calculated kcr values in this study this could be due to the weaknesses of single kc or developed polynomial curve approach for initial crop stage in which the crop did not cover the soil surface and a significant amount of evaporation was taken into account to the measured eta value fig 9 shows the median average and first second and thirds quartiles of calculated kco and kcr for each 10 days the highest average kco and kcr occurred at 90 dap late july and early august because of the variable climate conditions during the four study years the deviation of the calculated kc was considerable the median and the average kcr and kco values during the mid season were nearly the same with a symmetric distribution which implied that the measured results are not skewed with outliers for the early and late season the mean is greater than the median which indicated the distribution was skewed to the right and most of the calculated values were slightly lower than the average value table 5 shows that the calculated kco and kcr after screening with the swc for each growing stage agreed well with the reported kc values from the previous studies in the region furthermore for irrigation scheduling purposes the polynomial equation developed based on daily obtained kc values are also provided in table 5 in comparison with the previously reported kco and kcr values steele et al 1996 the calculated kc values were higher during the early and late growing seasons irmak et al 2008 also observed significant energy loss during both early and late stages of crop development thus development of the single kc from energy flux components which was the method used in current study might not be the best option to use for the early and late growing season when crop canopy incompletely covers the surface or crop leaves are dropping during senescence stages the result of this study showed that the cd si treatment produced higher yield than the county averages in 2013 and 2017 the calculated kc with the cd si practices were lower than the fao56 recommended values and the kc values by steele et al 1996 therefore the cd si practices has the capability to provide optimal moisture for the highest crop production 4 conclusion energy balance and evapotranspiration rates were measured in a corn field with controlled drainage and subirrigation practices using an eddy covariance system during the 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in the red river valley soil water content water table depth and precipitation were also monitored for the growing season and the off season the off season precipitation recharged the soil profile and was beneficial for better crop growth in spring the application of controlled drainage and subirrigation kept the soil water content in optimal conditions during the growing season the measured energy fluxes showed that the application of subirrigation enhanced the measured evapotranspiration rates the largest benefit of controlled drainage and subirrigation practices was found in a wet year 2013 and dry year 2017 with more available energy for crop production and optimal soil water status the crop yield in 2016 was the highest among all other years the corn evapotranspiration rates were 468 476 551 and 537 mm for 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively crop coefficient curves were developed using the estimated evapotranspiration rates screened for days with more than 45 of total available water in the corn root zone and the standardized reference evapotranspiration equations the grass reference based crop coefficients were 0 49 0 73 0 88 0 86 and 0 69 for initial development tasseling reproductive and maturity stages respectively this study showed that a good drainage water management with controlled drainage and subirrigation

10857,over the past 20 years marketplace demand for corn has prompted many farmers in the red river valley rrv of the north to include more corn in their crop rotations with a very flat topography and heavy clayey soils the rrv can have shallow water tables in the spring and fall but can be dry in the summer due to these field conditions some farmers have installed subsurface drainage sd systems with structures for controlled drainage cd manage the water table in a field and subirrigation si add water to the field via the sd system to improve corn production in a cd si field an eddy covariance system was used to measure and quantify energy flux components along with soil moisture content swc and water table depth wtd measurements during four corn growing seasons in 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 the results show that the average swc in 2012 was significantly different from the other three years the swc and wtd in 2016 were more stable compared to the other years the cd practice had a positive effect during a wet year in 2013 which resulted in 26 7 higher yield than the county average during the dry growing season of 2017 the use of subirrigation resulted in 6 6 higher yield than the county average the corn evapotranspiration totals eta were 468 476 551 and 537 mm for 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively the average crop coefficients were 0 49 0 73 0 88 0 86 and 0 69 for the initial development tasseling reproductive and maturity stages respectively they were calculated from the daily eta values only from days with more than 45 of total available water in the root zone and the asce ewri standardized grass based reference evapotranspiration this study showed that the sd along with the cd si system can be used for optimal water management of field corn during both wet and dry years keywords corn controlled drainage subirrigation eddy covariance yield crop coefficient 1 introduction corn is an important cereal crop in the united states with over 385 million metric tons of production in 2016 2017 us grains council 2019 which accounts for about one third of global corn production the planted area for grain corn in north dakota has increased from about 334 000 ha in 1997 to over 1 3 million ha in 2017 usda nass 2017 the increased demand has prompted many farmers to grow more corn in north dakota and particularly in the red river valley rrv of the north higher yields have been achieved due to improvements in farming technology and improved corn hybrids the rrv area has some of the most productive soils in the us but the near flat topography heavy clayey soils and increased salinity can hinder corn production due to a shallow water table and seasonal waterlogging conditions in spring and fall one of the most effective practices to aid in earlier planting and later harvest is to utilize a subsurface drainage sd the sd system employs buried perforated pipes to drain excess water and lower the water table in the soil profile wang et al 2004 water table management in agricultural fields can be improved by adding structures for controlled drainage cd to the sd system which may also include a subirrigation si aspect using a weir or stop log in an outlet structure cd controls the time and amount of drainage outflow and keeps water table depths at a desired level the si system is defined as the application of irrigation water below the ground surface by raising the water table within or near the root zone asabe standards 2015 in recent years si has become a supplementary component for drainage water management strategies by adding water through the sd system and control devices jia et al 2017 hence the combination of cd and si cd si can provide an optimal soil water condition to enhance crop production while various studies reported yield increases for different crops using cd si i e tomatoes soybeans and corn questions remain regarding the effect of drainage water management via a cd si system on corn performance such as the relationship between soil water content water table depth and evapotranspiration et during the crop growing season among all factors i e soil properties weather variability and salinity et plays a dominant role in crop production and is a critical factor in the hydrological cycle accurately determining the actual crop et eta which is the plants actual use of water in a cd si field can reveal crop water status and provide water management information to enhance crop production kandel et al 2013 sharma and minhas 2005 and improve nitrogen use efficiency mejia et al 2000 therefore quantifying the eta in field conditions could be a practical way to make appropriate decisions under cd si water management and evaluate the use of cd si on various crop stages several methods are available to measure daily eta directly some of the most used methods are ground based such as soil water balance and lysimeter djaman and irmak 2013 niaghi et al 2015 others are above ground methods including eddy covariance niaghi and jia 2017 niaghi et al 2019 shi et al 2008 surface renewal rosa and tanny 2015 bowen ratio energy balance shi et al 2008 uddin et al 2013 and remote sensing technology nagler et al 2005 niaghi 2014 since eta is an important component of water balance and hydrologic studies considerable research efforts have attempted to estimate the eta from weather data allen et al 1998 therefore eta can be indirectly determined from the reference evapotranspiration etref calculated from weather data and the recommended crop coefficient kc at various stages of the specified crop the kc represents regional climate characteristics crop type plant density phenology soil water status and other parameters anderson et al 2017 and should be developed for each study region numerous studies both in the past and ongoing are or have been conducted to evaluate different approaches for estimating eta at the field scale anapalli et al 2018 o brien et al 2018 majnooni heris et al 2013 however studies conducted under the cd si condition are limited to develop the kc values for each region accurately measured eta at the field scale is necessary the eddy covariance ec system is regarded as the most accurate method for in situ eta measurement at scales of 0 1 1 km rana and katerji 2000 the ec has been successfully used to measure eta over different crop fields and forest lands facchi et al 2013 baker and griffis 2005 for decades when using the ec method for energy balance research the sum of sensible heat h and latent heat le fluxes is about 10 30 less than the available energy rn g where rn is net radiation and g is soil heat flux russell et al 2015 twine et al 2000 suggested one way to close the energy balance was to assume that the h was measured correctly with a sonic anemometer and then solve for le as the residual in the energy balance equation le rn g h this procedure was also used by chávez et al 2009 niaghi et al 2019 and payero and irmak 2013 for the le calculation rijal et al 2012 used an ec system in a field with cd treatment to develop new kc values for corn in the rrv based on data from one year due to climate corn hybrids and variable farming practices one year data will likely not fully represent the variability of eta and kc therefore their range and fluctuation remain unclear exacerbating the problem other studies that have provided the regional kc values were conducted several decades ago e g steele et al 1996 stegman 1986 since then corn hybrids have evolved from conventional to modified hybrids with different water use and water stress characteristics payero and irmak 2013 the overall objective of this study was to estimate corn eta in a field for four years under cd si management but with various climate conditions and different corn hybrids the specific objectives were to 1 analyze the effect of cd si on soil water content and water table depth 2 analyze daily diurnal and cumulative energy fluxes during various corn growing stages 3 evaluate the crop yield along with the estimated eta and 4 develop new crop coefficients at various growing stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 field description the experiment was conducted in the rrv on an agricultural field located in the buffalo river watershed in clay county west central minnesota 46 59 20 n 96 41 06 w with an altitude of 271 m above sea level fig 1 the area of the field was 54 6 ha but only 16 6 ha in the middle section of the field was studied where the south and the north areas served as buffer areas kolars et al 2019 the soil in the study area was characterized as poorly drainable containing a bearden silt loam 50 of the total area an overly silty clay loam 27 of the area and a colvin silty clay loam 23 of the area with an impermeable layer at about 3 m depth jia et al 2017 the sd system was installed in august 2010 with 12 2 m spacing 0 91 m of average tile depth on a 0 1 grade with a drainage coefficient of 9 5 mm day jia et al 2017 the diameter of the drainage main was 254 mm along the west side of the field a second main line 152 mm diameter corrugated non perforated pipe was installed for si water delivery purposes at the higher elevation east end of the field to account for slow flow caused by the flat topography and the small size of the laterals 76 2 mm thus both irrigation and drainage followed the same flow path and direction with different flow periods during the season irrigation water for si was provided by gravity flow from a storage tank located at the north side of the field while si was applied one section at a time to the three sections in the field kolars et al 2019 the water delivery pipe to the south side of the field had an uphill grade resulting in 0 6 m elevation difference jia et al 2017 between the base of the storage tank and the end of the irrigation delivery pipe a water pump was used to fill the tank from the legal ditch on the north side of the field and was monitored during the entire irrigation period using a current sensor the volume and flow rate of the si water for the middle section was measured with an inline propeller meter mccrometer hemet california corn was grown in 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 while soybean was planted in 2014 and sugarbeets in 2015 corn row spacing was 76 cm with a plant spacing of about 10 cm emergence occurred within an average of 10 days after planting dap and the emergence date was estimated from images taken by an automatic in situ camera the nitrogen fertilizer was applied as top dressing at the emergence stage according to the farmer corn height was measured weekly from the soil surface to the highest point of the arch of the uppermost leaf tip pointing downward the grain was harvested with approximately 15 moisture although the exact date changed each year hybrid planting emergence and harvesting dates fertilizer rate si water application and maximum crop heights during the four study years are shown in table 1 2 2 monitoring climate variables soil moisture and water table depth the climate at the study site was categorized as sub humid with short and mild summer long term average temperature of 19 8 c and cold winter average temperature of 8 5 c with average annual rainfall between 533 and 635 mm according to north dakota agricultural weather network ndawn 2018 data a weather station onset corporation pocasset ma was used near the ec system to collect daily rainfall air temperature and relative humidity data a standard tipping bucket rain gauge that recorded rain events and amounts with 0 25 mm accuracy was located on an independent support 2 5 m above the ground the off season october may precipitation was obtained from the minnesota state climatology office for morken township mn dnr 2019 soil water by volume and soil temperature were measured at 30 min intervals by pairs of hydra probe ii sensors stevens water monitoring systems inc portland or located on tile within 1 m of a tile and between two tiles 5 2 m from the nearest tile at 5 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 cm depths the average volumes of soil water at two locations were used to compare the statistical difference of the swc for each month of the study year for statistical analysis one way anova and bonferroni holm test were used kraus 2014 based on a hyprop and wp4 experiment for each 30 cm of soil profile roy et al 2018 the average volumetric soil water contents swc at field capacity fc 1 3 bar permanent wilting point pwp 15 bar and saturation for the 0 90 cm soil layer were 41 17 and 53 4 respectively the management allowed depletion was set at 55 of the total available water recommended by fao56 allen et al 1998 and was used as an indicator for a well watered crop the total available water taw is the difference between the swc in the root zone at the fc and the pwp allen et al 1998 thus taw was used to determine the number of days for crops without water stressed conditions when estimating the kc values therefore the days where the swc was less than 45 of taw the corn was considered to be stressed and were eliminated from the kc calculations the wtd was monitored using a pair of observation wells 2 m deep installed near the ec system located on tile and between the tiles similar to the paired soil moisture sensors the wtds were measured automatically by water level transducers model u 20 001 01 onset computer pocasset ma at 1 h intervals the automatically measured wtds were adjusted using manually measured wtds on a monthly basis also the measured wtds were corrected for barometric pressure and air temperature compensation as recommended by the manufacturer the barometric pressure was measured for a period of time but was later eliminated due to limited space on the datalogger the measured barometric pressure between the field and the ndawn site were compared and did not show significant differences since the ndawn station was located 13 7 km from the study site therefore the ndawn measured values were used for barometric pressure compensation due to the short distance and flat topography kolars et al 2019 2 3 measuring evapotranspiration and energy fluxes to monitor the energy fluxes an ec station campbell scientific inc logan utah was placed at the center of the cd si field with 400 m fetch distance in all directions fig 1 the ec system consisted of a quick response three dimensional sonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa pointed in the predominant wind direction northwestern coupled with a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa to measure the wind speed and vapor density fluctuations respectively the net radiometer model q7 1 rebs campbell scientific inc was oriented in a southerly direction and was kept 1 5 m above the crop canopy during the initial stages of the crop growing season as the corn height increased the sensor was raised to keep it 1 m above the crop canopy the csat3 sonic anemometer and kh20 gas analyzer were installed on the tower with a maximum height of 3 m due to the tower height limitation the instruments were kept approximately 0 4 m above the canopy when corn reached its maximum height as a rule of thumb for agricultural weather stations the ec system should be kept at least 1 m above the crop canopy asabe standard 2004 to avoid any site aridity effects however for a humid region with high wind speed conditions during most of the time the instrumentation height would have minimal effect to the flux measurement jia et al 2007 additional 10 hz flux data analysis also revealed that the shapes of the spectral and co spectral analysis were valid the cr3000 datalogger recorded signals from these instruments at a frequency of 10 hz were corrected for wind speed rotation based on double rotation and detrending by block method time lags using maximum covariance approaches spike effect plausibiliy range of 5 standard deviations and amplitude resolution with range variation as 7 standard deviations while the corrected data were averaged over 30 minute intervals two 12 v direct current deep cycle rechargeable marine batteries were connected in parallel and recharged by two solar panels model sp70 l campbell scientific inc logan ut usa which powered the ec system even in cloudy and cold climate conditions the two batteries were placed inside a sealed box with small holes drilled only allowing wires to be extended outside the box in this way it prevented animal damage and impacts from weather events a pair of self calibrating soil heat flux plates hfp01sc l campbell scientific inc were used in 2012 and 2013 due to frequent sensor malfunctions they were replaced with a pair of hft3 l soil heat flux plates rebs soil heat flux plate campbell scientific inc in the 2016 and 2017 study years these soil heat flux plates were installed in the ground at 8 cm with 0 5 m distance to reduce the spatial variability and two soil thermocouples were placed 2 and 6 cm above each of the soil heat flux plates for soil heat storage correction a pair of soil water content reflectometers model cs616 campbell sci inc logan ut usa were installed at 5 and 15 cm depths outside and between the soil heat flux plates using the ec system the land surface exchange fluxes derived from all sensors were averaged to 30 min including incoming shortwave solar radiation rs rn le h and g all in units of w m 2 due to various source of errors in flux measurement by the ec which can be related to weather conditions site properties or system maintenance weekly site visits were made to download the data for post processing the measured rn was also corrected for wind effects the g was calculated from the two soil heat flux plates and corrected based on a pair of soil temperature sensors and water content reflectometers to account for the stored heat above the soil heat flux plate the 30 min collected h values by the csat3 were corrected for coordinate rotation and sonic temperature moreover because of the widely recognized energy balance closure problem in ec measurements the 30 min energy fluxes were screened to keep the daytime rn 0 w m 2 data in the analysis days with rain events greater than 10 mm were not considered in the eta and kc calculations niaghi et al 2019 the daily eta values were calculated by summing up the 30 min calculated eta from the calculated residual le values details associated with meteorological and calculation procedures of the flux were reported previously niaghi et al 2019 2 4

widely used and accepted method to calculate etref subedi et al 2017 based on grass reference crop eto or alfalfa etr daily kc values based on grass kco and alfalfa kcr were derived as a ratio of daily estimated eta by ec and daily calculated etref etr and eto allen et al 1998 the derived kco curves for dap were adjusted using relative humidity and wind speed for the study region as

and jensen haise equations denoted as s jh and based on jensen and haise 1963 3 results and discussion 3 1 water table and soil moisture relations rain amounts and distribution timing and volumetric swc for the two soil layers 0 30 cm and 45 90 cm as a function of dap are shown in fig 2 the fc pwp and 45 taw lines indicate the swc condition and water accessible to the crop furthermore the wtds on tile and between drainage tiles during the corn growing season in 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 2 the lowest amount of in season may october 182 mm and off season october 2011 april 2012 198 mm precipitation was recorded in 2012 the lowest swc with an average of 0 28 m3 m 3 was observed in the 0 30 cm and 45 90 cm soil layers in 2012 with increasing crop water requirements and root development the swc dropped to below 45 taw in both 0 30 cm and 45 90 cm soil layers however the swc in deeper layers was close to 45 taw line for a longer time without receiving moisture from either rainfall or through the si application despite drought conditions in 2012 and low amounts of rainfall the mild slope of swc reduction for 45 90 cm soil layer revealed that the capillary rise and possible contribution of the deeper wtd could contribute to crop water requirement beltrão et al 1996 fidantemiz et al 2019 niaghi et al 2019 in 2013 the swc went above the fc line due to heavy rain events at the initial and development corn stages fig 3 shows the sudden wtd reduction from about 60 cm to 140 cm below the surface due to the sd system after the first heavy rain event in 2013 the mild slope of the reduction in wtd from 51 dap to about 80 dap after a heavy rain event showed the cd ability that kept the swc above 45 taw to meet crop water requirement crop development and non uniform distribution of rain in 2013 caused a shortage in water supply from 90 to 100 dap however utilizing the si system on august 3 88 dap kept the swc above the 45 taw and reduced the effect of limited swc on the crop growth the amount of off season precipitation from 2012 to 2013 winter was about 332 mm mn dnr 2019 that recharged the wtd and helped with better crop growth in 2013 in 2016 in addition to a uniform distribution of rainfall 322 mm off season precipitation from the 2015 2016 winter season was stored in the soil profile a small depth of water 5 4 mm was applied through the si system between september 2 and 6 129 and 133 dap to keep the swc near the fc point or to test the si system performance jia et al 2017 despite a good amount of rainfall and wtd recharge the wtd was not measured in the range of observation wells depth 2 m during the early growing season of 2017 due to sufficient stored water in the soil profile from the off season precipitation 334 mm the swc was near the fc point at the shallower depth 0 30 cm and above the fc line in the deeper layer 45 90 cm of the soil profile early in the season therefore application of cd was necessary to keep the infiltrated water in the soil profile for a longer time with the first heavy rain event on 50 dap the swc increased for the 0 30 cm and 45 90 cm soil layers and the wtd was raised from 190 cm to 140 cm below the soil surface at 59 dap water was applied to the field through the si system to keep swc near the fc point as the corn grew water uptake caused the wtd to drop from 140 cm to 190 cm and decreased the swc to below the fc point for the days when the swc of the 0 30 cm layer was below the 45 taw the deeper layers had enough moisture to support the crop water requirement since they stayed above the 45 taw until the end of the growing season table 2 summarizes the monthly differences of the volumetric swc for all study years obtained from one way anova and bonferroni holm tests kraus 2014 the table shows a diagonal matrix with upper triangle for the surface soil 0 30 cm and lower triangle for the deeper layer 45 90 cm respectively among the study years almost all months during the 2012 growing season had significant differences p 0 05 in swc with other study years and experienced a lower swc drier condition than the other years due to the lowest amount of rainfall despite a 97 mm difference of in season rainfall between 2013 and 2016 the statistical analysis showed non significant swc differences between the 2013 and 2016 study years furthermore with 296 mm of in season rainfall in 2017 it showed a non significant swc difference with 2016 for may july and august therefore this implied that the off season precipitation had an important effect on soil moisture recharge and thus on crop growth during the growing season to study the wtd swc and energy flux partitioning effect on crop performance the growing season in each year was divided into five stages initial development tasseling reproductive and maturity fig 3 summarizes the cumulative amounts of in season rainfall for each stage while fig 4 summarizes the analysis of swc and wtd as boxplots for the five growing stages of the four study years the range of swc variation for the 0 30 cm soil layer was higher than that for the deeper soil profile in all four years this range was 0 22 0 22 0 15 and 0 20 m3 m 3for the 0 30 cm soil layer and 0 11 0 20 0 10 and 0 18 m3 m3 for the 45 90 cm soil layer in 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 respectively the wtd in 2012 had the lowest fluctuation of about 4 3 cm and 9 2 cm for on tile and between tile locations respectively these ranges were 17 8 cm and 12 6 cm for on tile and between tiles in 2016 the largest range of variation was observed in 2013 due to the recharged soil profile with pronounced off season precipitation early snow melting and several rain events during the growing season the shallowest wtd in 2013 was observed as 117 cm for on tile and 81 cm for between tile locations respectively the wtd variation was high during tasseling stage in 2017 due to the application of si and the wtd fluctuation for both on tile and between tile locations were about 54 cm application of si and rain events decreased the wtd from the soil surface during the development and tasseling stages in 2017 the si application also recharged the soil profile and increased the potential for capillary rise the swc and wtd analysis showed that the highest swc was found in 2013 during the development stage and the wtd was about 110 cm from the soil surface in the tasseling stage the swc was similar in 2013 2016 and 2017 but the wtd in 2013 and 2017 was closer to the soil surface than that in 2016 during the reproductive stage the highest swc was found in 2016 during the maturity stage a higher swc variability was found in 2013 for the 45 90 cm soil layer overall 2016 experienced more stable swc and wtd than all other study years and 2013 had the highest range of swc and wtd fluctuations the swcs in 2013 and 2016 were always above the 45 taw for all growing stages indicating that they had the optimal condition for crop growth a field study by mejia et al 2000 found that corn yield was greater in the cd plots than that in the free drainage plots ghane et al 2012 reported an average 6 increase on corn yield due to the cd practice in northwest ohio in addition jia et al 2014 found that a cd si field had 10 higher yield than the cd field ng et al 2002 reported a 64 increase in corn yield by using a cd si system cooper et al 1991 found a 58 yield advantage for a cd si system over a non irrigated field overall different studies have shown the advantages of the cd and si application for crop production however depending on the climate and regional and land characteristics the effect could be different for this current study according to the swc and wtd observations the best crop yield was observed in 2013 wet year due to the cd practice and in 2017 dry year due to the si application as expected 3 2 energy fluxes all measured energy fluxes rn g and h and the calculated le using the residual approach showed high day to day fluctuations due to weather conditions crop stages canopy coverage and soil water availability due to the drought condition in 2012 the gap between the estimated le and rn was the highest among all four years crop stress and lack of water in 2012 decreased the le rn g ratio therefore the remaining available energy rn g enhanced the measured h and g values and increased the h rn g ratio the measured energy fluxes in 2013 were affected by rain events swc and wtd daily energy flux pattern also showed high variation for the estimated le and h among the four seasons this variation was related to the swc or the wtd fluctuation or the variation in the climate condition by following the growing season with rain events and following the crop to reproductive and maturity stages in 2013 the estimated le and h become similar in terms of ratio to the available energy the daily trend of measured fluxes in 2016 illustrated an increase in the estimated le and decrease in measured h from planting to the reproductive stages among the study years the highest partitioned energy to le was in 2016 at crop maturity the estimated le was reduced and the h was increased keeping the swc near the fc point using the cd practice until 60 dap resulted in a greater le estimate in 2017 with the le rn g ratios 0 57 and 0 68 in may and june respectively after the si application the water was held in the soil profile with the cd practice therefore the cd si provided benefits over an extended period that might enhance the le and the le rn g ratio table 3 summarizes the average measured energy components for each month 3 2 1 diurnal and growth stage processes fig 5 shows the diurnal pattern of the energy flux components for each stage of the study years the le h and g showed a parabolic pattern during the various growing stages corresponding to the diurnal rn changes the effect of different planting dates in each year resulted in different peaks and trends of the energy fluxes based on the diurnal comparison in the initial stage a higher rn value was measured in the early time of the day 12 pm in 2016 and 2017 but delayed in 2012 and 2013 2 pm due to the late planting dates table 1 the higher estimated le value was measured at the initial stage in 2016 due to the higher rn value and longer day time as well as a higher swc the other study years showed a similar trend for estimated le and h values at the initial stage of the crop growth during the development stage higher amounts of rainfall in 2013 led to a near saturation point of swc which increased the estimated le compared to the other study years the longer duration of rn in the development stage was observed in 2012 and 2016 however due to the limited swc in 2012 the estimated le was not as high as in 2016 the tasseling stage is critical for corn yield since the yield components of ear and kernel number can no longer be increased by the plant growth and the potential size of the kernel is defined in this stage ransom and endres 2019 thus optimal soil water conditions should be provided to obtain better crop performance in the tasseling stage the swc was limited during the tasseling stage in 2012 fig 2 compared to the other study years despite the sufficient swc in 2013 the average daily estimated le was less than that in 2016 and 2017 this indicated that both swc and rn had higher effects on the estimated le during the reproductive stage the highest and lowest les were measured in 2017 and 2013 respectively the estimated le was the lowest in 2013 due to the rainy days and cloudy conditions as the crop approached the maturity stage the estimated le decreased and most of the available energy was partitioned into h and g however due to the optimal swc at maturity and reproductive stages in 2017 and higher rn than the other study years the estimated le was higher and therefore the crop growth was also better 3 2 2 cumulative energy fluxes fig 6 shows the cumulative energy fluxes versus dap for the study years the difference between the cumulative le and h illustrated how well the available energy had partitioned between the le and the h in 2012 the highest cumulative rn 4377 mj m 2 and the lowest cumulative le 2320 mj m 2 was observed in 2013 the cumulative rn 3698 mj m 2 was lower than the all other study years due to cloudy conditions and several rain events although it had the lowest cumulative rn the slope of cumulative le 14 3 mj m 2 d 1 and h 6 5 mj m 2 d 1 in 2013 was higher than that in 2017 le 13 5 mj m 2 d 1 h 6 3 mj m 2 d 1 the highest cumulative le was observed in 2016 2507 mj m 2 that led to better crop growth and yield in comparison with the other study years the highest slope of the estimated le was observed in 2016 16 6 mj m 2 d 1 which was related with the potential eta for all of the study years regardless of the weather conditions partitioning of available energy to h was more positive during the early season than the later season following crop development increased demand for water and ground surface coverage by vegetation the measured h and g values were reduced to minimal rates however this reduction in h and g was higher in years with higher swc and available energy than that in the other years therefore during crop development tasseling and reproductive stages most of the available energy was partitioned into le instead of h and g application of si showed a significant impact on keeping the swc above the 45 taw threshold the time of the si application showed the most important impact on le according to the measured fluxes its diurnal analysis and its cumulative product of the energy components the cd practice was effective especially when the swc remained near the fc point at the development and tasseling stages furthermore the si application during the maturity stage is important and can influence crop yields stegman 1986 and increase corn kernel moisture before harvesting 3 3 evapotranspiration the daily eta values were calculated by summing up the 30 min estimated le data fig 7 shows the estimated eta calculated eto and etr for the growing season of the study years as it was expected in all of the study years the eta rate was increased by increasing canopy cover throughout the season from cold spring to warm summer and then decreased in the fall season after crop maturity the highest eta rates were observed in june and july when corn was at tasseling and reproductive stages with a complete cover over the soil surface table 4 summarizes the cumulative eta along with the yield and the county average yield for the study region although the energy flux components and meteorological analysis in 2013 showed less suitable conditions for crop production than that in 2016 the optimal swc due to sd and cd might have resulted in a higher yield 26 7 than the county average yield on the other hand due to several heavy rain events in 2013 most farm lands had ponding and waterlogging problems that caused a lower county yield at the study site sd prevented the land from a ponding situation in 2013 fig 4 and enhanced the crop productivity in 2012 a perforated irrigation water delivery main was used for the si system which led to the inability to supply enough water during the drought conditions in addition a late season corn variety 93 day instead of a typical 85 day maturity corn variety in this region was planted which resulted in poor germinations that could be visually observed jia et al 2014 in the spring of 2012 in 2013 due to heavy rainfall events in june the field benefited from the cd practices because additional water was held in the soil profile instead of flowing away another study in 2013 in the same region showed that an undrained field was under waterlogged conditions for a long period of time and a lower crop yield was obtained due to the wet conditions jia et al 2014 further jia et al 2014 observed that more than 75 of drainage water was kept in the field due to the cd practices compared to the drainage outflow from a conventional drainage field despite 29 less rainfall in 2016 than that in 2013 the highest yield was measured in 2016 uniform distribution and sufficient rainfall at tasseling and development stages in 2016 enhanced the crop production furthermore the cd practices kept the soil moisture near the fc and increased crop productivity not only did our study have the highest yield in 2016 but also the county average had the best yield compared to all other study years this indicated the growing season in 2016 had the best conditions for crop production in terms of available energy soil moisture storage and weather condition the rainfall amount and weather conditions in 2012 and 2017 were similar however because of 12 mm si application and 334 mm off season precipitation the crop growth increased in the 2017 development stage application of si at high water demand periods caused a greater eta in 2017 compared to that in the 2012 growing season more irrigation was applied in september and early october 2017 to increase the soil moisture but the amount was not significant and did not affect the yield in 2017 instead it might benefit the yield in 2018 3 4 crop coefficients the highest kcr and kco values for the study years occurred between 80 and 90 dap which was between late july and early august rapid increases of kc were observed after the rainfall and si application fig 8 shows the calculated kco and kcr for days with swc 45 taw for the study years the developed kco reasonably followed the fao56 recommended kco curve for corn in 2016 and 2017 but not in 2012 and 2013 although all the years were screened for swc greater than 45 taw the best fit was observed in 2016 that had the highest cumulative le and near the fc point of swc during high water demand stages of crop growth this manner was similar for the calculated kcr in 2016 that matches better with the s p polynomial curve overall the calculated kco and kcr values for the field with cd si in all study years followed in a similar manner as the recommended fao56 and previously developed polynomial curves however the swc was not the only factor limiting the crop productivity the energy flux analysis in the previous section showed that it had the highest rn values in 2012 but limited swc condition although the swc was not limited in 2013 the cumulative rn was less than that in 2016 and 2017 the combined higher cumulative rn and higher partitioned available energy to le in 2016 and 2017 resulted in higher crop yield the comparison between the calculated kcr and the developed kcr by the s p method showed a good agreement similar to this study the kcr values developed by steele et al 1996 included non stressed and stressed crop conditions for example prunty and montgomery 1991 water balance data for 1985 1988 later used by steele et al 1996 included non stressed conditions of 30 40 depletion of soil water throughout the season as well as 70 depletions early in the season and 60 late in the season the water stress conditions imposed by prunty and montgomery 1991 did not cause yield reductions for the initial growing stage a significant difference was observed between the kcr values from steele et al 1996 and the calculated kcr values in this study this could be due to the weaknesses of single kc or developed polynomial curve approach for initial crop stage in which the crop did not cover the soil surface and a significant amount of evaporation was taken into account to the measured eta value fig 9 shows the median average and first second and thirds quartiles of calculated kco and kcr for each 10 days the highest average kco and kcr occurred at 90 dap late july and early august because of the variable climate conditions during the four study years the deviation of the calculated kc was considerable the median and the average kcr and kco values during the mid season were nearly the same with a symmetric distribution which implied that the measured results are not skewed with outliers for the early and late season the mean is greater than the median which indicated the distribution was skewed to the right and most of the calculated values were slightly lower than the average value table 5 shows that the calculated kco and kcr after screening with the swc for each growing stage agreed well with the reported kc values from the previous studies in the region furthermore for irrigation scheduling purposes the polynomial equation developed based on daily obtained kc values are also provided in table 5 in comparison with the previously reported kco and kcr values steele et al 1996 the calculated kc values were higher during the early and late growing seasons irmak et al 2008 also observed significant energy loss during both early and late stages of crop development thus development of the single kc from energy flux components which was the method used in current study might not be the best option to use for the early and late growing season when crop canopy incompletely covers the surface or crop leaves are dropping during senescence stages the result of this study showed that the cd si treatment produced higher yield than the county averages in 2013 and 2017 the calculated kc with the cd si practices were lower than the fao56 recommended values and the kc values by steele et al 1996 therefore the cd si practices has the capability to provide optimal moisture for the highest crop production 4 conclusion energy balance and evapotranspiration rates were measured in a corn field with controlled drainage and subirrigation practices using an eddy covariance system during the 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in the red river valley soil water content water table depth and precipitation were also monitored for the growing season and the off season the off season precipitation recharged the soil profile and was beneficial for better crop growth in spring the application of controlled drainage and subirrigation kept the soil water content in optimal conditions during the growing season the measured energy fluxes showed that the application of subirrigation enhanced the measured evapotranspiration rates the largest benefit of controlled drainage and subirrigation practices was found in a wet year 2013 and dry year 2017 with more available energy for crop production and optimal soil water status the crop yield in 2016 was the highest among all other years the corn evapotranspiration rates were 468 476 551 and 537 mm for 2012 2013 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively crop coefficient curves were developed using the estimated evapotranspiration rates screened for days with more than 45 of total available water in the corn root zone and the standardized reference evapotranspiration equations the grass reference based crop coefficients were 0 49 0 73 0 88 0 86 and 0 69 for initial development tasseling reproductive and maturity stages respectively this study showed that a good drainage water management with controlled drainage and subirrigation

10858,accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto is required in many fields e g irrigation scheduling design agricultural water management crop growth modeling and drought assessment nevertheless reliable estimation of eto is difficult when lack of complete or long term meteorological data at the target station this study evaluated the efficiency of a new tree based soft computing model light gradient boosting machine lightgbm for estimating daily et0 using limited local target station and external cross station meteorological data from 49 weather stations in humid subtropical region of china including 16 in jiangxi province and other 33 in the region the performance of lightgbm was compared with the tree based m5 model tree m5tree and random forests rf as well as four empirical models hargreaves samani tabari makkink and trabert eight input combinations of daily meteorological data including maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity hr wind speed at 2 m height u2 extraterrestrial solar radiation ra and global solar radiation rs calculated from sunshine duration n for the period 2001 2015 were used to test the models the results showed that lightgbm was superior to m5tree and rf in local applications under all input combinations during testing with average root mean square error rmse of 0 08 0 58 mm d 1 0 11 0 62 mm d 1 and 0 13 0 60 mm d 1 respectively m5tree performed slightly better than rf under input combinations 6 8 whereas rf outperformed m5tree under the other input combinations however all three soft computing models produced much better daily eto estimates than the corresponding empirical models with the same input variables rs was the most influential meteorological variable for daily eto estimation in this region followed by tmax and tmin hr and finally u2 in external applications lightgbm also generally performed better than the rf m5tree and empirical models soft computing models developed with meteorological data from station 57894 having the most similar climatic characteristics to the other stations gave satisfactory eto estimates for the 15 cross stations in jiangxi province even for the other 33 stations across the humid subtropical region of china lightgbm was proved to be efficient and exhibit good generalization capability in both local and external applications which was thus recommended as an alternative model for daily eto estimation keywords reference evapotranspiration penman monteith equation machine learning tree based model light gradient boosting machine cross station 1 introduction quantitative determination of reference crop evapotranspiration eto is necessary in many fields e g irrigation scheduling design water resources management crop growth modeling and drought assessment feng et al 2016 2017 wu et al 2019a however direct measurement of eto is difficult time consuming and costly irmak et al 2003 the alternative procedure is to estimate eto from local readily available meteorological variables the concept of potential evapotranspiration etp was originated from the penman combination based method penman 1948 for the practical reasons eto was proposed in the 1970s as an alternative to the term etp many other empirical models such as temperature based radiation based and mass transfer based models have been developed and modified for estimating eto the fao 56 penman monteith equation fao 56 pm has been recommended as a standard method for estimation of eto around the world by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao the fao 56 pm equation requires many climatic parameters such as net radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity however some of these input variables may not be available for a given location in developing countries in particular the quality of data and difficulties in collecting all the required meteorological parameters can pose serious constraints on the application of fao 56 pm model for instance the china meteorological administration only runs 130 radiation stations and the existing methods for estimating solar radiation from weather data are not accurate enough in many parts of china fan et al 2020 in addition although wind speed prediction has been extensively studied in non agricultural fields yang and wang 2018 talaat et al 2019 there is insufficient evidence that these methods are suitable for eto estimation when the fao 56 pm method cannot be implemented for a particular area the utilization of simplified temperature based radiation based or mass transfer based methods is a common choice the core idea of temperature based empirical models is to reduce the input data as much as possible according to regional climate characteristics on the premise that the impact on prediction accuracy is not very large hargreaves and samani hargreaves and samani 1985 combined the original eto equation introduced by hargreaves hargreaves 1975 and another equation hargreaves and samani 1982 to estimate solar radiation based on temperature data due to its simple structure and high precision in many regions of the world the application of hargreaves samani model has become increasingly popular among the empirical models shahidian et al 2013 heydari and heydari 2014 shiri et al 2015a 2015b almorox and grieser 2016 feng et

neural network grnn for estimating eto in sichuan of china with only temperature data as inputs they found that both models had better prediction accuracy in local and cross station applications while rf was slightly superior to grnn the rf model coupled with wavelet method improved the prediction accuracy of eto when using input variables same as those of mass transfer empirical models shiri 2018 due to the best combination of estimation accuracy model stability and computational efficiency the tree based extreme gradient boosting xgboost and gradient boosting decision tree gbdt were recommended for estimation of daily eto in china fan et al 2018b light gradient boosting machine lightgbm is an improved version of gradient learning framework based on decision trees and the idea of

the prediction accuracy of the lightgbm model against two traditional tree based soft computing models i e m5tree and rf along with four commonly used empirical models hargreaves samani tabari makkink and trabert for estimation of daily eto and 3 to further investigate the potential of the proposed empirical and soft computing models for estimating daily eto using external cross station meteorological data 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and input combinations of meteorological variables the present study was carried out in the humid subtropical region of china including 16 weather stations in jiangxi province of china and other 33 weather stations across the region fig 1 jiangxi province was surrounded by mountains on three sides except north with plains in the north and hills in the center station 58506 has the highest elevation which is located on the top of a mountain table 1 sums up the geographical and meteorological information of the 16 stations in jiangxi province of china the corresponding information of other 33 weather stations across the region is given in table s1 continuous daily meteorological data during the period 2001 2015 were collected in this study including daily maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin sunshine duration n relative humidity hr wind speed at 2 m height u2 and extraterrestrial solar radiation ra global solar radiation rs was calculated from n using the angstrom prescott model according to fan et al 2019a meteorological data were provided and quality controlled by the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration it can be seen from table 1 that station 58506 and 58634 experienced relatively lower annual mean tmax 16 3 c and 19 6 c respectively and tmin 9 6 c and 11 7 c respectively compared with those at the other stations 22 4 24 9 c and 13 1 16 8 c respectively lower annual mean n 3 4 h d 1 but higher rh 86 4 was observed at station 58634 relative to those at the other stations 4 0 5 4 h d 1and 71 2 80 8 respectively however stations 58506 3 6 m s 1 and 58715 2 6 m s 1 received relatively higher annual mean u2 than the other stations 1 0 2 0 m s 1 the lowest annual mean et0 1 8 mm d 1 was obtained at station 58634 in jiangxi province as a result of low n and high rh while the other 15 stations had comparable annual mean et0 2 2 2 7 mm d 1 a comparison of tables s1 and 1 indicated that the values of meteorological variables over the other 33 weather stations across the humid subtropical region of china were generally similar to those in jiangxi province but larger differences occurred due to much longer distances among the stations for instance larger eto values 3 3 mm d 1 were observed at stations 56651 56666 56959 56985 and 59758 the observed meteorological data from 2001 to 2015 were divided into two datasets the first dataset 2001 2010 was used to calibrate train the four empirical models and the three soft computing models while the second dataset 2011 2015 was used to test the developed models it can be seen from table 1 that the differences between the meteorological values during training and testing at each weather station did not vary greatly in this study eight input combinations based on air temperature and other meteorological variables were considered as inputs to the three soft computing models table 2 2 2 fao 56 penman monteith equation fao 56 pm according to the fao 56 pm equation allen et al 1998 eto mm d 1 was calculated as 1 e t o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn mj m 2 d 1 is the net radiation at the crop surface which is usually calculated by rs g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 ta is the mean daily air temperature c u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es and ea are the saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively δ is the slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the air psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g can be neglected at a daily time step as in this study details of the fao 56 pm equation can be found in allen et al allen et al 1998 2 3 simplified empirical models for estimating reference evapotranspiration four simplified empirical models i e hargreaves samani makkink tabari and trabert were used for estimating eto to compare the performances of the three soft computing models these models were chosen based on the number of required meteorological inputs and their wide applicability to varying climates and regions the idea of hargreaves samani model came from the christiansen christiansen 1968 equation and the most popular version was hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 2 e t o h s a r a δ t b t m e a n c where a b and c are the fitted coefficients the makkink model makkink 1957 for estimating eto using only rs and tmean data can be expressed as 3 e t o m a k a δ δ γ r s λ b where a and b are the fitted coefficients the tabari model tabari et al 2012 is a linear regression model and can be written as 4 e t o t a b a r s b t max c t min d where a b c and d are the fitted coefficients as mentioned before mass transfer based models utilize the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere the trabert model trabert 1896 is one of the commonly used model forms 5 e t o t r a a u 2 e s e a where a is the fitted coefficient 2 4 tree based soft computing models for estimating reference evapotranspiration 2 4 1 m5 model tree m5tree model tree is a kind of generalized regression tree which can extract information and rules from training data pourzangbar et al 2017 the method is to divide the input domain into several sub domains and establish a linear multivariate regression model solution for each subdomain the final solution is the set of these subdomain solutions model trees have multiple subclasses based on different segmentation strategies m5tree is one of the most commonly used tree based models which takes standard deviation reduction sdr as the segmentation criterion to split the input dataset and generate the final solution m5tree takes a top down approach using the if then rules firstly the input data point is entered into the root node according to the rule of segmentation criterion the tree is divided into several branches the process of selecting split nodes and generating branches continues until all data are sorted in the form of linear multivariate regression the solution of branch subdomain is then calculated on the leaf node of branch finally pruning is essential which can helps to reduce overfitting for branches where the sdr is truly small more information about m5tree can be found in quinlan 1992 2 4 2 random forests rf random forest is an integrated soft computing model based on many classification and regression tree cart developed by breiman 2001 the rf model has been proven to have high predictive accuracy and high tolerance for outliers and noise it can also evaluate the relationship between covariables and dependent variables calculate the relative importance of covariables and in turn can be used for feature selecting the rf model generates n data sets with duplicate samples from the original data set for each dataset it establishes an unpruned classification or regression tree for the regression problem the final result is the average of all the tree results however for the classification problem the final classification result is selected by all trees voting detailed information on the rf model is given by breiman 2001 2 4 3 light gradient boosting machine lightgbm lightgbm is a gradient learning framework based on decision tree and the idea of boosting ke et al 2017 which is introduced in detail here since it is a relatively new model its main difference from the xgboost model is that it uses histogram based algorithms to speed up the training process reduce memory consumption and employ a leaf wise growth strategy with depth constraints the basic idea of histogram algorithm is to discretize continuous floating point eigenvalues into k bins and construct a histogram with a width of k histogram algorithm does not need extra storage of pre sorted results and also can save the value after the discretization of features which is generally enough to store with 8 bit integer and the memory consumption can be reduced to 1 8 of the original this rough partitioning does not reduce the accuracy of the model since the decision tree is a weak study model it is not important whether the segmentation point is accurate or not the coarser segmentation points also have regularization effect which can effectively prevent overfitting the growth strategy of a decision tree is called level wise which is an inefficient algorithm because it treats the leaves of the same layer resulting in a large amount of unnecessary memory consumption leaf wise is a more effective strategy which finds the leaves with the highest branching gain each time from all the leaves and then goes through the branching cycle therefore compared with the horizontal direction the blade can reduce more errors and obtain better precision with the same number of times of segmentation the downside of leaf orientation is that it can grow deeper decision trees and produce overfitting therefore lightgbm adds a maximum depth limit to the top of the leaf to prevent overfitting while ensuring high efficiency the schematic diagram of level wise and leaf wise tree growth strategies is shown in fig 2 the detailed calculation procedures of lightgbm are described as follows sun et al 2018 for the given training dataset x x i y i i 1 m lightgbm is aimed to search an approximation f ˆ x to the function f x for minimizing expected values of specific

trees are defined as w q x q 1 2 n where n represents the number of tree leaves q is the decision rule of trees and w is a vector denoting the sample weights of leaf nodes the model is then trained in

parameter optimization in local applications the temperature based hargreaves samani radiation based tabari and makkink and mass transfer based trabert empirical models were used to estimate daily eto at each station of the 16 stations in jiangxi province these empirical models were calibrated by the fao 56 pm eto as reference lightgbm rf and m5tree were then trained and tested using meteorological data from the 16 target stations which were further compared with the four empirical models to evaluate the performance of empirical and soft computing models in external cross station applications eto at each of the 16 target stations was estimated by models developed with data from the other 15 stations in addition station 57894 was taken as an example by assuming that this station lacked previous meteorological data given that input combinations 1 and 4 are the most common combinations for daily eto estimation the soft computing models developed based on these two combinations from the other 15 stations were used to predict daily eto at station 57894 which had the most similar climatic characteristics to the other stations finally to further evaluate the performance of the proposed models in larger areas with similar climates the soft computing models developed with meteorological data from station 57894 under the input combinations 1 and 4 were used to estimate daily eto at other 33 weather stations across the humid subtropical region of china as shown in fig 1 in this study the rf model was implemented in the r package named randomforest while the m5tree model was implemented in the matlab package named m5primelab the lightgbm package was developed by microsoft which can be downed at https github com microsoft lightgbm the coefficients of the four empirical models were attained by the least squares approach while the main parameters of the three soft computing models were optimized with the grid search method for m5tree the model parameters of minimum leaf size mls and minimum parents size mps were optimized with mls ranging from 5 to 25 at 5 intervals and mps as 2 times of mls for rf the number of trees nt and maximum depth of the tree mdt were optimized with nt ranging from 100 to 1000 at 100 intervals and mtd ranging from 3 to 15 at 3 intervals for lightgbm nt and mdt were optimized with nt ranging from 100 to 500 at 100 intervals and mtd ranging from 3 to 15 at 3 intervals the learning was set to 0 05 basically all combinations of parameters were tried and the one with the best accuracy was chosen as the optimal parameter combination 2 6 statistical indices three commonly used statistical indices were used to assess the prediction accuracy of models fan et al 2018a 2019b wu et al 2019b ma et al 2019 including the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse defined as follow 14 r 2 i 1 m e t i o e t o m e a n e t i e e t e m e a n i 1 m e t i o e t o m e a n 2 i 1 m e t i e e t e m e a n 2 2 15 r m s e 1 m i 1 m e t i e e t i o 16 n r m s e r m s e e t o m e a n where etio and etie are the eto value at i th time step estimated by fao 56 pm equation and the other model respectively eto mean and ete mean are the mean eto values estimated by fao 56 pm equation and the other model respectively greater r2 means high prediction accuracy while smaller rmse and nrmse indicate better model performances 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of empirical and soft computing models in local target station applications 3 1 1 local application of empirical models table 3 represents mean values of r2 rmse and nrmse of the four empirical models averaged over the 16 stations in jiangxi province during training and testing overall the statistical results of empirical models showed small differences between the training and testing stages in the testing stage the tabari model yielded the highest r2 0 94 but lowest rmse 0 39 mm d 1 and nrmse 0 16 followed by the makkink r2 0 93 rmse 0 40 mm d 1 and nrsme 0 17 and hargreaves samani r2 0 77 rmse 0 72 mm d 1 and nrsme 0 31 models the trabert model r2 0 37 rmse 1 24 mm d 1 and nrsme 0 52 performed worst and it was thus not recommend for estimation of eto in this region r2 rmse and nrmse values of the four empirical models for daily eto estimation at each of the 16 stations during testing are given in fig 3 it can be seen from the figure that the statistical results fluctuated among the studied stations but following the same trends the trabert model performed worst at all 16 stations followed by the hargreaves samani model the tabari model was slightly better than the makkink model at most stations the highest rmse value was obtained at station 58506 in most cases which can be largely attributed to the low data quality caused by the large variations of meteorological variables as a result of much higher elevation at station 58506 1165 3 m compared with the other stations most 150 0 m according to rmse values station 57894 showed the minimal errors among the empirical models however station 59102 achieved the least nrmse the difference between rmse and nrmse results can be attributed to the different characteristics of the indices where nrmse considered the reference mean value fao 56 pm eto in this study on the basis of rmse while stations with larger eto values tended to achieve higher rmse fig 4 represents the scatter plots between eto values obtained by the fao 56 pm equation and four empirical models at station 58606 nachang as the provincial capital of jiangxi province during testing as an example the scatter of tabari model was more evenly distributed between 0 and 8 0 mm d 1 and underestimated eto when values were less than 3 0 mm d 1 and greater than 7 0 mm d 1 the makkink model showed more scattered points than the tabari model and had slight underestimation the hargreaves samani model significantly overestimated eto when values were less than 2 0 mm d 1 and mildly underestimated eto when values were greater than 6 5 mm d 1 the scatter of the trabert model showed cluster with only a few scattered points around the trend line therefore it can be concluded that the radiation based models tabari and makkink models present the most accurate results among the four empirical models high performances of radiation based models have been also reported by tabari et al 2016 chatzithomas and alexandris 2015 and feng et al 2017 in addition since the hargreaves samani model only requires temperature data acceptable results can be still obtained in areas lacking complete meteorological elements 3 1 2 local application of soft computing models table 4 presents mean values of r2 rmse and nrmse averaged over the 16 stations for the three soft computing models under the eight input combinations during training and testing r2 rmse and nrmse values of the three soft computing models at each of the 16 stations during testing is given in fig 5 r2 rmse and nrmse values of lightgbm ranged 0 85 1 00 0 08 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 03 0 24 during testing respectively the corresponding values were 0 83 1 00 0 1 0 62 mm d 1 and 0 05 0 26 for m5tree while they varied 0 84 0 99 0 13 0 60 mm d 1 and 0 06 0 25 for rf respectively it can been seen from tables 4 and fig 5 that lightgbm exhibited lower statistical errors than rf and m5treeduring testing while rf showed better prediction accuracy during training lightgbm was superior to m5tree and rf under all input combinations rmse values of m5tree and rf were decreased by 0 10 9 and 2 6 7 3 compared with those of lightgbm in the testing stage respectively while the corresponding nrmse values were decreased by 1 1 11 6 and 2 7 8 1 respectively the prediction accuracy of m5tree was worse than that of rf under the input combinations 1 5 while it showed slightly better performance than rf under the input combinations 6 8 at most stations fig 5 ra is a geographical parameter related only to latitude and day of year it has been found that adding this information to the soft computing models can improve the prediction accuracy of models feng et al 2017 in this study the input combination 1 tmax tmin and ra yielded acceptable eto estimates taking lightgbm as an example r2 rmse and nrmse values were 0 85 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 24 respectively when replacing ra with u2 hr or rs under the input combinations 2 4 the models sometimes gave better performance with decreases in rmse by 0 2 14 7 and 113 0 for lgbm2 lgbm3 and lgbm4 compared with lgbm1 it seems that u2 and ra contributed equivalently for estimating daily eto in this region therefore when only air temperature and wind speed data are available wind speed can be ignored considering the high costs of wind speed measurements in addition rs was found to be the most crucial meteorological factor for estimating daily eto in this region which was similar to the findings by fan et al 2018b in wuhan and guangzhou of china and by feng et al 2017 in sichuan of china however this was different from the reported results by mattar 2018 in egypt where wind speed was more important information and adding it to temperature based models significantly decreased rmse from 10 20 to 0 58 mm d 1 however adding rs data only slightly improved the prediction accuracy of eto in egypt mattar 2018 and burkina faso traore and guven 2013 these differences were largely attributed to the fact that the dominant meteorological variables for eto estimation and their contributions to eto significantly differed in various climatic regions feng et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 the input combinations 5 7 included three meteorological factors and performed differently from each other the input combination 7 with rs data achieved ideal results taking lgbm6 and lgbm7 as examples r2 values were greater than 0 98 rmse values less than 0 25 mm d 1 and nrmse values less than 0 10 although lgbm5 did not perform as well as lgbm6 and lgbm7 it did perform better than lgbm2 and lgbm3 with the decrease in rmse by 8 16 and 21 3 respectively there was no significant improvement by adding u2 or hr to the input combination 4 lgbm4 but hr was found to be slightly better than u2 for improving the performance of daily eto estimation this further indicated that the most important meteorological factor for estimation of daily eto in this humid subtropical region was rs followed by tmax and tmin hr and finally u2 the input combination 8 had the same input weather factors as the fao 56 pm formula except that some intermediate variables were missing e g es and ea this combination lacked the prospect in practical applications since the reference fao 56 pm model can be directly applied in this situation but it can reflect the model capability to simulate nonlinear processes the results showed that the three soft computing models perfectly simulated the nonlinear process of eto estimation among the models lightgbm exhibited the best modeling capability rmse values were less than 0 10 mm d 1 at all 16 stations except station 58626 figs 6 8 present eto values estimated by the three soft computing models against fao 56 pm reference values under the eight input combinations there were clear differences among the three soft computing models under the eight input combinations the fitting slopes of the input combinations 1 5 were between 0 85 and 0 97 indicating a certain degree of underestimation in addition the data points were more scattered than those under the input combination 8 however input combinations 6 8 had very little underestimation and the data points were closely distributed around the trend line 3 1 3 comparison of empirical and soft computing models the performances of the four empirical models for estimating daily eto were further compared with their corresponding soft computing models with the same input variables table 5 this section only discussed how each model behaved in the testing period as the results of these models have been given above under the input combination of tmax tmin and ra lgbm1 was superior to the other models compared with lgbm1 rmse and nrmse of m5tree1 rf1 and hargreaves samani models were increased by 7 0 4 5 25 9 and 6 6 4 5 and 25 5 respectively under the input combination of tmax tmin and rs lgbm4 performed slightly better than rf4 and much better than m5tree4 tabari and makkink models compared with lgbm4 rmse and nrmse of rf4 m5tree4 tabari and makkink models were increased by 2 6 7 4 43 0 48 9 and 2 7 7 1 43 4 48 7 respectively when the input data were tmax tmin hr and u2 lgbm5 was the best performing model compared with lgbm5 rmse and nrmse of rf5 m5tree5 trabert models were increased by 3 8 10 9 175 and 3 7 11 6 175 respectively obviously trabert model was not suitable for estimating daily eto in this region as a result of much high statistical errors however a comparison of the soft computing and trabert models indicates that there is great potential to estimate daily eto based on these information air temperature wind speed and relative humidity how to obtain explicit expression to describe the nonlinear process of eto based on tmax tmin hr and u2 needs to be further studied in general soft computing models especially lightgbm showed much better prediction accuracy than empirical models under the above three input combinations in the studied region 3 2 performances of empirical and soft computing models in external cross station applications 3 2 1 external application of empirical models to evaluate the performance of empirical models for estimation of eto in external applications eto was estimated at each of the 16 target stations using empirical models developed with data from the other 15 stations the obtained rmse values of the four empirical models for estimating daily eto are presented in tables s2 s5 similar to local applications tabari model produced the lowest average rmse 0 42 mm d 1 followed by makkink 0 43 mm d 1 and hargreaves samani 0 85 mm d 1 models as expected trabert model performed worst with very large average rmse of 1 27 mm d 1 however those average rmse values of various empirical models in external applications were quite similar to the corresponding values obtained in local applications rmse 0 39 0 72 0 40 and 1 24 mm d 1 for tabari hargreaves samani makkink and trabert respectively indicating that estimation of eto using empirical models developed with meteorological data observed from cross stations is desirable in this humid subtropical region 3 2 2 external application of soft computing models the statistical results of three soft computing models for estimation of eto at the target station 57894 using models developed with data from the other 15 stations in jiangxi province under the input combinations 1 and 4 are presented in tables 6 and 7 r2 rmse and nrmse values of lightgbm under the input combination 1 ranged 0 72 0 85 0 44 0 89 mm d 1 and 0 24 0 49 during testing respectively the corresponding values were 0 52 0 83 0 47 1 21 mm d 1 and 0 26 0 90 for m5tree and 0 64 0 83 0 46 1 06 mm d 1 and 0 25 0 58 for rf respectively similar results were also obtained by the three models under the input combination 4 as can be seen from the above results lightgbm performed significantly better than the other two soft computing models compared with local applications the statistical errors of m5tree under the input combination 1 in cross station applications were increased by 44 154 the average rmse value obtained with models developed using data from station 57799 under the input combination 1 was only 8 9 higher than that obtained in the local application besides developed models with data from stations 57793 57896 57993 and 58527 also yielded no more than 15 increase in rmse under the input combination 4 station 57598 was the most suitable cross station with the relative increase in rmse of 34 this indicates that the distance between two stations is not necessarily the most important factor for cross station applications whereas the similarity of meteorological variables between the two stations actually determines the performance of models with external meteorological data of course the degree of similarity in meteorological variables generally decreases with the increasing distance between two stations lu et al 2018 but it is not always the case eto was further estimated at each of the 16 target stations by soft computing models developed with data from the other 15 stations under the input combinations 1 and 4 the obtained rmse values of the three soft computing models are presented in tables s5 s11 as shown in the tables the average rmse of lightgbm under the input combinations 1 was 0 68 mm d 1 and 0 33 mm d 1 which was 6 7 4 5 and 4 9 3 2 lower than those of m5tree and rf and 20 0 lower than that of hargreaves samani model respectively it is clear that lightgbm generally performed better than the other two tree based models followed by hargreaves samani model the lowest rmse of lightgbm 0 64 mm d 1 and rf 0 68 mm d 1 under the input combination 1 was obtained at station 57894 which had the most similar climatic characteristics to the other stations besides m5tree was superior to these models with rmse of only 0 60 mm d 1 based on station 57894 under the input combination 4 similar results were achieved where lightgbm was generally superior to m5tree and rf followed by tabari and makkink models with average rmse values of 0 30 0 33 0 35 0 42 and 0 43 mm d 1 respectively although the most suitable station changed to station 57793 for lightgbm 0 30 mm d 1 and rf 0 31 mm d 1 m5tree 0 24 mm d 1 developed using data from station 57894 still yielded the lowest rmse obviously the proposed soft computing models especially lightgbm outperformed their corresponding empirical models under the input combinations 1 and 4 the most appropriate model to represent the whole region did not correspond to lightgbm but m5tree however the developed lightgbm and rf models with data from stations 57894 also yielded relatively low errors this may be due to the better meteorological data quality at station 57894 and its small climatic differences compared with the other 15 stations therefore it was recommended to use soft computing models developed with data from station 57894 to estimate eto in the humid subtropical jiangxi province which can greatly simplify the complexity of collecting data from more stations for modeling with ideal prediction accuracy however the developed lightgbm rf and m5tree models with data from stations 58506 produced the worst results in all cases which has been mainly caused by the largest differences in meteorological variables especially the much lower air temperatures and larger wind speed compared with the other 15 stations table 1 this further confirmed that the performance of models with external meteorological data is largely dependent on the similarity of meteorological variables between the cross stations to further evaluate the performance of the proposed soft computing models in larger areas with similar climates lightgbm rf and m5tree developed with meteorological data from station 57894 under the input combinations 1 and 4 were used to estimate daily eto at other 33 weather stations across the humid subtropical region of china as shown in fig 1 as shown in table 8 average rmse of lightgbm under the input combinations 1 was 0 90 and 0 62 mm d 1 which was 10 6 17 0 and 9 2 17 0 lower than those of m5tree and rf respectively this further confirmed that lightgbm was superior to rf and m5tree for estimation of daily eto even applied in much larger regions than where they were developed however much larger emse values 1 1 mm d 1 were obtained at some stations under the input combination 1 with tmax tmin and ra as inputs such as stations 56651 56778 56985 58265 58362 59964 and 59758 table s1 these are largely attributed to the greater differences in meteorological characteristics between station 57894 and these stations station mostly as a result of longer distances between the stations however the performance of soft computing models in external applications was more favorable and stable when more influential meteorological variables were included under the input combination 4 with tmax tmin and rs as inputs in recent years it has become increasingly popular to use meteorological data from neighboring stations for estimating eto at the target station shiri et al 2015a 2015b lu et al 2018 this strategy has been approved to work well in various climates around the world including southwestern china feng et al 2017 the proposed lightgbm model is thus highly recommended to estimate daily eto in the humid subtropical regions of china and even in other regions around the world with similar climates when lack of local meteorological data generally a long previous dataset are required to develop lightgbm and the other two soft computing models which may limit the use of this methodology in many areas however it is found here that it is still possible to obtain satisfactory eto estimates at a target station using models developed with data from cross stations with similar meteorological characteristics when previous local data are missing or not available which can greatly promote the application of the proposed lightgbm model for estimation of daily eto in data scare regions 4 conclusions this study assessed the performance of the new tree based lightgbm model for estimating daily eto using local and external data from 49 weather stations in the humid subtropical region of china the tree based m5tree and rf along with four empirical models hargreaves samani tabari makkink and trabert were also compared based on eight input combinations of daily meteorological data such as maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity hr and wind speed at 2 m height u2 and global solar radiation rs during 2001 2015 the results showed that lightgbm generally outperformed m5tree and rf in both local and external applications all of which produced much better daily eto estimates than the empirical models with the same model inputs soft computing models developed with meteorological data from station 57894 gave satisfactory eto estimates for the other 15 stations in jiangxi province even for other 33 stations across the humid subtropical region of china this will provide a new way to simplify the regional model development with meteorological data from as few weather stations as possible in a specific region lightgbm was thus highly recommended as an efficient alternative model for daily eto estimation however the proposed lightgbm model was only tested in the humid subtropical region of china in the present study and its applicability in other climates or across various climatic regions

10858,accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto is required in many fields e g irrigation scheduling design agricultural water management crop growth modeling and drought assessment nevertheless reliable estimation of eto is difficult when lack of complete or long term meteorological data at the target station this study evaluated the efficiency of a new tree based soft computing model light gradient boosting machine lightgbm for estimating daily et0 using limited local target station and external cross station meteorological data from 49 weather stations in humid subtropical region of china including 16 in jiangxi province and other 33 in the region the performance of lightgbm was compared with the tree based m5 model tree m5tree and random forests rf as well as four empirical models hargreaves samani tabari makkink and trabert eight input combinations of daily meteorological data including maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity hr wind speed at 2 m height u2 extraterrestrial solar radiation ra and global solar radiation rs calculated from sunshine duration n for the period 2001 2015 were used to test the models the results showed that lightgbm was superior to m5tree and rf in local applications under all input combinations during testing with average root mean square error rmse of 0 08 0 58 mm d 1 0 11 0 62 mm d 1 and 0 13 0 60 mm d 1 respectively m5tree performed slightly better than rf under input combinations 6 8 whereas rf outperformed m5tree under the other input combinations however all three soft computing models produced much better daily eto estimates than the corresponding empirical models with the same input variables rs was the most influential meteorological variable for daily eto estimation in this region followed by tmax and tmin hr and finally u2 in external applications lightgbm also generally performed better than the rf m5tree and empirical models soft computing models developed with meteorological data from station 57894 having the most similar climatic characteristics to the other stations gave satisfactory eto estimates for the 15 cross stations in jiangxi province even for the other 33 stations across the humid subtropical region of china lightgbm was proved to be efficient and exhibit good generalization capability in both local and external applications which was thus recommended as an alternative model for daily eto estimation keywords reference evapotranspiration penman monteith equation machine learning tree based model light gradient boosting machine cross station 1 introduction quantitative determination of reference crop evapotranspiration eto is necessary in many fields e g irrigation scheduling design water resources management crop growth modeling and drought assessment feng et al 2016 2017 wu et al 2019a however direct measurement of eto is difficult time consuming and costly irmak et al 2003 the alternative procedure is to estimate eto from local readily available meteorological variables the concept of potential evapotranspiration etp was originated from the penman combination based method penman 1948 for the practical reasons eto was proposed in the 1970s as an alternative to the term etp many other empirical models such as temperature based radiation based and mass transfer based models have been developed and modified for estimating eto the fao 56 penman monteith equation fao 56 pm has been recommended as a standard method for estimation of eto around the world by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao the fao 56 pm equation requires many climatic parameters such as net radiation wind speed air temperature and relative humidity however some of these input variables may not be available for a given location in developing countries in particular the quality of data and difficulties in collecting all the required meteorological parameters can pose serious constraints on the application of fao 56 pm model for instance the china meteorological administration only runs 130 radiation stations and the existing methods for estimating solar radiation from weather data are not accurate enough in many parts of china fan et al 2020 in addition although wind speed prediction has been extensively studied in non agricultural fields yang and wang 2018 talaat et al 2019 there is insufficient evidence that these methods are suitable for eto estimation when the fao 56 pm method cannot be implemented for a particular area the utilization of simplified temperature based radiation based or mass transfer based methods is a common choice the core idea of temperature based empirical models is to reduce the input data as much as possible according to regional climate characteristics on the premise that the impact on prediction accuracy is not very large hargreaves and samani hargreaves and samani 1985 combined the original eto equation introduced by hargreaves hargreaves 1975 and another equation hargreaves and samani 1982 to estimate solar radiation based on temperature data due to its simple structure and high precision in many regions of the world the application of hargreaves samani model has become increasingly popular among the empirical models shahidian et al 2013 heydari and heydari 2014 shiri et al 2015a 2015b almorox and grieser 2016 feng et

of the physical process of water vapor transfer from the evaporating surface to the atmosphere in the eddy motion these methods obtained satisfactory results under the simulated water surface

neural network grnn for estimating eto in sichuan of china with only temperature data as inputs they found that both models had better prediction accuracy in local and cross station applications while rf was slightly superior to grnn the rf model coupled with wavelet method improved the prediction accuracy of eto when using input variables same as those of mass transfer empirical models shiri 2018 due to the best combination of estimation accuracy model stability and computational efficiency the tree based extreme gradient boosting xgboost and gradient boosting decision tree gbdt were recommended for estimation of daily eto in china fan et al 2018b light gradient boosting machine lightgbm is an improved version of gradient learning framework based on decision trees and the idea of

hydrological studies especially in eto modeling besides the estimation of eto for a target station is always difficult when long term local data are missing or unavailable especially in china and other developing countries in this situation data supplement from neighboring stations are needed for estimation of local eto wang et al 2017a 2017b karimi et al 2017 thus the objectives of the present study are 1 to explore the capability of the new lightgbm model for estimating daily eto with limited local meteorological data in the humid subtropical jiangxi province of china 2 to compare the prediction accuracy of the lightgbm model against two traditional tree based soft computing models i e m5tree and rf along with four commonly used empirical models hargreaves samani tabari makkink and trabert for estimation of daily eto and 3 to further investigate the potential of the proposed empirical and soft computing models for estimating daily eto using external cross station meteorological data 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and input combinations of meteorological variables the present study was carried out in the humid subtropical region of china including 16 weather stations in jiangxi province of china and other 33 weather stations across the region fig 1 jiangxi province was surrounded by mountains on three sides except north with plains in the north and hills in the center station 58506 has the highest elevation which is located on the top of a mountain table 1 sums up the geographical and meteorological information of the 16 stations in jiangxi province of china the corresponding information of other 33 weather stations across the region is given in table s1 continuous daily meteorological data during the period 2001 2015 were collected in this study including daily maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin sunshine duration n relative humidity hr wind speed at 2 m height u2 and extraterrestrial solar radiation ra global solar radiation rs was calculated from n using the angstrom prescott model according to fan et al 2019a meteorological data were provided and quality controlled by the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration it can be seen from table 1 that station 58506 and 58634 experienced relatively lower annual mean tmax 16 3 c and 19 6 c respectively and tmin 9 6 c and 11 7 c respectively compared with those at the other stations 22 4 24 9 c and 13 1 16 8 c respectively lower annual mean n 3 4 h d 1 but higher rh 86 4 was observed at station 58634 relative to those at the other stations 4 0 5 4 h d 1and 71 2 80 8 respectively however stations 58506 3 6 m s 1 and 58715 2 6 m s 1 received relatively higher annual mean u2 than the other stations 1 0 2 0 m s 1 the lowest annual mean et0 1 8 mm d 1 was obtained at station 58634 in jiangxi province as a result of low n and high rh while the other 15 stations had comparable annual mean et0 2 2 2 7 mm d 1 a comparison of tables s1 and 1 indicated that the values of meteorological variables over the other 33 weather stations across the humid subtropical region of china were generally similar to those in jiangxi province but larger differences occurred due to much longer distances among the stations for instance larger eto values 3 3 mm d 1 were observed at stations 56651 56666 56959 56985 and 59758 the observed meteorological data from 2001 to 2015 were divided into two datasets the first dataset 2001 2010 was used to calibrate train the four empirical models and the three soft computing models while the second dataset 2011 2015 was used to test the developed models it can be seen from table 1 that the differences between the meteorological values during training and testing at each weather station did not vary greatly in this study eight input combinations based on air temperature and other meteorological variables were considered as inputs to the three soft computing models table 2 2 2 fao 56 penman monteith equation fao 56 pm according to the fao 56 pm equation allen et al 1998 eto mm d 1 was calculated as 1 e t o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn mj m 2 d 1 is the net radiation at the crop surface which is usually calculated by rs g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 ta is the mean daily air temperature c u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es and ea are the saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa respectively δ is the slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the air psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g can be neglected at a daily time step as in this study details of the fao 56 pm equation can be found in allen et al allen et al 1998 2 3 simplified empirical models for estimating reference evapotranspiration four simplified empirical models i e hargreaves samani makkink tabari and trabert were used for estimating eto to compare the performances of the three soft computing models these models were chosen based on the number of required meteorological inputs and their wide applicability to varying climates and regions the idea of hargreaves samani model came from the christiansen christiansen 1968 equation and the most popular version was hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 2 e t o h s a r a δ t b t m e a n c where a b and c are the fitted coefficients the makkink model makkink 1957 for estimating eto using only rs and tmean data can be expressed as 3 e t o m a k a δ δ γ r s λ b where a and b are the fitted coefficients the tabari model tabari et al 2012 is a linear regression model and can be written as 4 e t o t a b a r s b t max c t min d where a b c and d are the fitted coefficients as mentioned before mass transfer based models utilize the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere the trabert model trabert 1896 is one of the commonly used model forms 5 e t o t r a a u 2 e s e a where a is the fitted coefficient 2 4 tree based soft computing models for estimating reference evapotranspiration 2 4 1 m5 model tree m5tree model tree is a kind of generalized regression tree which can extract information and rules from training data pourzangbar et al 2017 the method is to divide the input domain into several sub domains and establish a linear multivariate regression model solution for each subdomain the final solution is the set of these subdomain solutions model trees have multiple subclasses based on different segmentation strategies m5tree is one of the most commonly used tree based models which takes standard deviation reduction sdr as the segmentation criterion to split the input dataset and generate the final solution m5tree takes a top down approach using the if then rules firstly the input data point is entered into the root node according to the rule of segmentation criterion the tree is divided into several branches the process of selecting split nodes and generating branches continues until all data are sorted in the form of linear multivariate regression the solution of branch subdomain is then calculated on the leaf node of branch finally pruning is essential which can helps to reduce overfitting for branches where the sdr is truly small more information about m5tree can be found in quinlan 1992 2 4 2 random forests rf random forest is an integrated soft computing model based on many classification and regression tree cart developed by breiman 2001 the rf model has been proven to have high predictive accuracy and high tolerance for outliers and noise it can also evaluate the relationship between covariables and dependent variables calculate the relative importance of covariables and in turn can be used for feature selecting the rf model generates n data sets with duplicate samples from the original data set for each dataset it establishes an unpruned classification or regression tree for the regression problem the final result is the average of all the tree results however for the classification problem the final classification result is selected by all trees voting detailed information on the rf model is given by breiman 2001 2 4 3 light gradient boosting machine lightgbm lightgbm is a gradient learning framework based on decision tree and the idea of boosting ke et al 2017 which is introduced in detail here since it is a relatively new model its main difference from the xgboost model is that it uses histogram based algorithms to speed up the training process reduce memory consumption and employ a leaf wise growth strategy with depth constraints the basic idea of histogram algorithm is to discretize continuous floating point eigenvalues into k bins and construct a histogram with a width of k histogram algorithm does not need extra storage of pre sorted results and also can save the value after the discretization of features which is generally enough to store with 8 bit integer and the memory consumption can be reduced to 1 8 of the original this rough partitioning does not reduce the accuracy of the model since the decision tree is a weak study model it is not important whether the segmentation point is accurate or not the coarser segmentation points also have regularization effect which can effectively prevent overfitting the growth strategy of a decision tree is called level wise which is an inefficient algorithm because it treats the leaves of the same layer resulting in a large amount of unnecessary memory consumption leaf wise is a more effective strategy which finds the leaves with the highest branching gain each time from all the leaves and then goes through the branching cycle therefore compared with the horizontal direction the blade can reduce more errors and obtain better precision with the same number of times of segmentation the downside of leaf orientation is that it can grow deeper decision trees and produce overfitting therefore lightgbm adds a maximum depth limit to the top of the leaf to prevent overfitting while ensuring high efficiency the schematic diagram of level wise and leaf wise tree growth strategies is shown in fig 2 the detailed calculation procedures of lightgbm are described as follows sun et al 2018 for the given training dataset x x i y i i 1 m lightgbm is aimed to search an approximation f ˆ x to the function f x for minimizing expected values of specific loss functions l y f x 6 f ˆ x arg min f e y x l y f x lightgbm will integrate many t regression trees t 1 t f t x for approximating the eventual model defined as 7 f t x t 1 t f t x the regression trees are defined as w q x q 1 2 n where n represents the number of tree leaves q is the decision rule of trees and w is a vector denoting the sample weights of leaf nodes the model is then trained in

parameter optimization in local applications the temperature based hargreaves samani radiation based tabari and makkink and mass transfer based trabert empirical models were used to estimate daily eto at each station of the 16 stations in jiangxi province these empirical models were calibrated by the fao 56 pm eto as reference lightgbm rf and m5tree were then trained and tested using meteorological data from the 16 target stations which were further compared with the four empirical models to evaluate the performance of empirical and soft computing models in external cross station applications eto at each of the 16 target stations was estimated by models developed with data from the other 15 stations in addition station 57894 was taken as an example by assuming that this station lacked previous meteorological data given that input combinations 1 and 4 are the most common combinations for daily eto estimation the soft computing models developed based on these two combinations from the other 15 stations were used to predict daily eto at station 57894 which had the most similar climatic characteristics to the other stations finally to further evaluate the performance of the proposed models in larger areas with similar climates the soft computing models developed with meteorological data from station 57894 under the input combinations 1 and 4 were used to estimate daily eto at other 33 weather stations across the humid subtropical region of china as shown in fig 1 in this study the rf model was implemented in the r package named randomforest while the m5tree model was implemented in the matlab package named m5primelab the lightgbm package was developed by microsoft which can be downed at https github com microsoft lightgbm the coefficients of the four empirical models were attained by the least squares approach while the main parameters of the three soft computing models were optimized with the grid search method for m5tree the model parameters of minimum leaf size mls and minimum parents size mps were optimized with mls ranging from 5 to 25 at 5 intervals and mps as 2 times of mls for rf the number of trees nt and maximum depth of the tree mdt were optimized with nt ranging from 100 to 1000 at 100 intervals and mtd ranging from 3 to 15 at 3 intervals for lightgbm nt and mdt were optimized with nt ranging from 100 to 500 at 100 intervals and mtd ranging from 3 to 15 at 3 intervals the learning was set to 0 05 basically all combinations of parameters were tried and the one with the best accuracy was chosen as the optimal parameter combination 2 6 statistical indices three commonly used statistical indices were used to assess the prediction accuracy of models fan et al 2018a 2019b wu et al 2019b ma et al 2019 including the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse defined as follow 14 r 2 i 1 m e t i o e t o m e a n e t i e e t e m e a n i 1 m e t i o e t o m e a n 2 i 1 m e t i e e t e m e a n 2 2 15 r m s e 1 m i 1 m e t i e e t i o 16 n r m s e r m s e e t o m e a n where etio and etie are the eto value at i th time step estimated by fao 56 pm equation and the other model respectively eto mean and ete mean are the mean eto values estimated by fao 56 pm equation and the other model respectively greater r2 means high prediction accuracy while smaller rmse and nrmse indicate better model performances 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of empirical and soft computing models in local target station applications 3 1 1 local application of empirical models table 3 represents mean values of r2 rmse and nrmse of the four empirical models averaged over the 16 stations in jiangxi province during training and testing overall the statistical results of empirical models showed small differences between the training and testing stages in the testing stage the tabari model yielded the highest r2 0 94 but lowest rmse 0 39 mm d 1 and nrmse 0 16 followed by the makkink r2 0 93 rmse 0 40 mm d 1 and nrsme 0 17 and hargreaves samani r2 0 77 rmse 0 72 mm d 1 and nrsme 0 31 models the trabert model r2 0 37 rmse 1 24 mm d 1 and nrsme 0 52 performed worst and it was thus not recommend for estimation of eto in this region r2 rmse and nrmse values of the four empirical models for daily eto estimation at each of the 16 stations during testing are given in fig 3 it can be seen from the figure that the statistical results fluctuated among the studied stations but following the same trends the trabert model performed worst at all 16 stations followed by the hargreaves samani model the tabari model was slightly better than the makkink model at most stations the highest rmse value was obtained at station 58506 in most cases which can be largely attributed to the low data quality caused by the large variations of meteorological variables as a result of much higher elevation at station 58506 1165 3 m compared with the other stations most 150 0 m according to rmse values station 57894 showed the minimal errors among the empirical models however station 59102 achieved the least nrmse the difference between rmse and nrmse results can be attributed to the different characteristics of the indices where nrmse considered the reference mean value fao 56 pm eto in this study on the basis of rmse while stations with larger eto values tended to achieve higher rmse fig 4 represents the scatter plots between eto values obtained by the fao 56 pm equation and four empirical models at station 58606 nachang as the provincial capital of jiangxi province during testing as an example the scatter of tabari model was more evenly distributed between 0 and 8 0 mm d 1 and underestimated eto when values were less than 3 0 mm d 1 and greater than 7 0 mm d 1 the makkink model showed more scattered points than the tabari model and had slight underestimation the hargreaves samani model significantly overestimated eto when values were less than 2 0 mm d 1 and mildly underestimated eto when values were greater than 6 5 mm d 1 the scatter of the trabert model showed cluster with only a few scattered points around the trend line therefore it can be concluded that the radiation based models tabari and makkink models present the most accurate results among the four empirical models high performances of radiation based models have been also reported by tabari et al 2016 chatzithomas and alexandris 2015 and feng et al 2017 in addition since the hargreaves samani model only requires temperature data acceptable results can be still obtained in areas lacking complete meteorological elements 3 1 2 local application of soft computing models table 4 presents mean values of r2 rmse and nrmse averaged over the 16 stations for the three soft computing models under the eight input combinations during training and testing r2 rmse and nrmse values of the three soft computing models at each of the 16 stations during testing is given in fig 5 r2 rmse and nrmse values of lightgbm ranged 0 85 1 00 0 08 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 03 0 24 during testing respectively the corresponding values were 0 83 1 00 0 1 0 62 mm d 1 and 0 05 0 26 for m5tree while they varied 0 84 0 99 0 13 0 60 mm d 1 and 0 06 0 25 for rf respectively it can been seen from tables 4 and fig 5 that lightgbm exhibited lower statistical errors than rf and m5treeduring testing while rf showed better prediction accuracy during training lightgbm was superior to m5tree and rf under all input combinations rmse values of m5tree and rf were decreased by 0 10 9 and 2 6 7 3 compared with those of lightgbm in the testing stage respectively while the corresponding nrmse values were decreased by 1 1 11 6 and 2 7 8 1 respectively the prediction accuracy of m5tree was worse than that of rf under the input combinations 1 5 while it showed slightly better performance than rf under the input combinations 6 8 at most stations fig 5 ra is a geographical parameter related only to latitude and day of year it has been found that adding this information to the soft computing models can improve the prediction accuracy of models feng et al 2017 in this study the input combination 1 tmax tmin and ra yielded acceptable eto estimates taking lightgbm as an example r2 rmse and nrmse values were 0 85 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 24 respectively when replacing ra with u2 hr or rs under the input combinations 2 4 the models sometimes gave better performance with decreases in rmse by 0 2 14 7 and 113 0 for lgbm2 lgbm3 and lgbm4 compared with lgbm1 it seems that u2 and ra contributed equivalently for estimating daily eto in this region therefore when only air temperature and wind speed data are available wind speed can be ignored considering the high costs of wind speed measurements in addition rs was found to be the most crucial meteorological factor for estimating daily eto in this region which was similar to the findings by fan et al 2018b in wuhan and guangzhou of china and by feng et al 2017 in sichuan of china however this was different from the reported results by mattar 2018 in egypt where wind speed was more important information and adding it to temperature based models significantly decreased rmse from 10 20 to 0 58 mm d 1 however adding rs data only slightly improved the prediction accuracy of eto in egypt mattar 2018 and burkina faso traore and guven 2013 these differences were largely attributed to the fact that the dominant meteorological variables for eto estimation and their contributions to eto significantly differed in various climatic regions feng et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 the input combinations 5 7 included three meteorological factors and performed differently from each other the input combination 7 with rs data achieved ideal results taking lgbm6 and lgbm7 as examples r2 values were greater than 0 98 rmse values less than 0 25 mm d 1 and nrmse values less than 0 10 although lgbm5 did not perform as well as lgbm6 and lgbm7 it did perform better than lgbm2 and lgbm3 with the decrease in rmse by 8 16 and 21 3 respectively there was no significant improvement by adding u2 or hr to the input combination 4 lgbm4 but hr was found to be slightly better than u2 for improving the performance of daily eto estimation this further indicated that the most important meteorological factor for estimation of daily eto in this humid subtropical region was rs followed by tmax and tmin hr and finally u2 the input combination 8 had the same input weather factors as the fao 56 pm formula except that some intermediate variables were missing e g es and ea this combination lacked the prospect in practical applications since the reference fao 56 pm model can be directly applied in this situation but it can reflect the model capability to simulate nonlinear processes the results showed that the three soft computing models perfectly simulated the nonlinear process of eto estimation among the models lightgbm exhibited the best modeling capability rmse values were less than 0 10 mm d 1 at all 16 stations except station 58626 figs 6 8 present eto values estimated by the three soft computing models against fao 56 pm reference values under the eight input combinations there were clear differences among the three soft computing models under the eight input combinations the fitting slopes of the input combinations 1 5 were between 0 85 and 0 97 indicating a certain degree of underestimation in addition the data points were more scattered than those under the input combination 8 however input combinations 6 8 had very little underestimation and the data points were closely distributed around the trend line 3 1 3 comparison of empirical and soft computing models the performances of the four empirical models for estimating daily eto were further compared with their corresponding soft computing models with the same input variables table 5 this section only discussed how each model behaved in the testing period as the results of these models have been given above under the input combination of tmax tmin and ra lgbm1 was superior to the other models compared with lgbm1 rmse and nrmse of m5tree1 rf1 and hargreaves samani models were increased by 7 0 4 5 25 9 and 6 6 4 5 and 25 5 respectively under the input combination of tmax tmin and rs lgbm4 performed slightly better than rf4 and much better than m5tree4 tabari and makkink models compared with lgbm4 rmse and nrmse of rf4 m5tree4 tabari and makkink models were increased by 2 6 7 4 43 0 48 9 and 2 7 7 1 43 4 48 7 respectively when the input data were tmax tmin hr and u2 lgbm5 was the best performing model compared with lgbm5 rmse and nrmse of rf5 m5tree5 trabert models were increased by 3 8 10 9 175 and 3 7 11 6 175 respectively obviously trabert model was not suitable for estimating daily eto in this region as a result of much high statistical errors however a comparison of the soft computing and trabert models indicates that there is great potential to estimate daily eto based on these information air temperature wind speed and relative humidity how to obtain explicit expression to describe the nonlinear process of eto based on tmax tmin hr and u2 needs to be further studied in general soft computing models especially lightgbm showed much better prediction accuracy than empirical models under the above three input combinations in the studied region 3 2 performances of empirical and soft computing models in external cross station applications 3 2 1 external application of empirical models to evaluate the performance of empirical models for estimation of eto in external applications eto was estimated at each of the 16 target stations using empirical models developed with data from the other 15 stations the obtained rmse values of the four empirical models for estimating daily eto are presented in tables s2 s5 similar to local applications tabari model produced the lowest average rmse 0 42 mm d 1 followed by makkink 0 43 mm d 1 and hargreaves samani 0 85 mm d 1 models as expected trabert model performed worst with very large average rmse of 1 27 mm d 1 however those average rmse values of various empirical models in external applications were quite similar to the corresponding values obtained in local applications rmse 0 39 0 72 0 40 and 1 24 mm d 1 for tabari hargreaves samani makkink and trabert respectively indicating that estimation of eto using empirical models developed with meteorological data observed from cross stations is desirable in this humid subtropical region 3 2 2 external application of soft computing models the statistical results of three soft computing models for estimation of eto at the target station 57894 using models developed with data from the other 15 stations in jiangxi province under the input combinations 1 and 4 are presented in tables 6 and 7 r2 rmse and nrmse values of lightgbm under the input combination 1 ranged 0 72 0 85 0 44 0 89 mm d 1 and 0 24 0 49 during testing respectively the corresponding values were 0 52 0 83 0 47 1 21 mm d 1 and 0 26 0 90 for m5tree and 0 64 0 83 0 46 1 06 mm d 1 and 0 25 0 58 for rf respectively similar results were also obtained by the three models under the input combination 4 as can be seen from the above results lightgbm performed significantly better than the other two soft computing models compared with local applications the statistical errors of m5tree under the input combination 1 in cross station applications were increased by 44 154 the average rmse value obtained with models developed using data from station 57799 under the input combination 1 was only 8 9 higher than that obtained in the local application besides developed models with data from stations 57793 57896 57993 and 58527 also yielded no more than 15 increase in rmse under the input combination 4 station 57598 was the most suitable cross station with the relative increase in rmse of 34 this indicates that the distance between two stations is not necessarily the most important factor for cross station applications whereas the similarity of meteorological variables between the two stations actually determines the performance of models with external meteorological data of course the degree of similarity in meteorological variables generally decreases with the increasing distance between two stations lu et al 2018 but it is not always the case eto was further estimated at each of the 16 target stations by soft computing models developed with data from the other 15 stations under the input combinations 1 and 4 the obtained rmse values of the three soft computing models are presented in tables s5 s11 as shown in the tables the average rmse of lightgbm under the input combinations 1 was 0 68 mm d 1 and 0 33 mm d 1 which was 6 7 4 5 and 4 9 3 2 lower than those of m5tree and rf and 20 0 lower than that of hargreaves samani model respectively it is clear that lightgbm generally performed better than the other two tree based models followed by hargreaves samani model the lowest rmse of lightgbm 0 64 mm d 1 and rf 0 68 mm d 1 under the input combination 1 was obtained at station 57894 which had the most similar climatic characteristics to the other stations besides m5tree was superior to these models with rmse of only 0 60 mm d 1 based on station 57894 under the input combination 4 similar results were achieved where lightgbm was generally superior to m5tree and rf followed by tabari and makkink models with average rmse values of 0 30 0 33 0 35 0 42 and 0 43 mm d 1 respectively although the most suitable station changed to station 57793 for lightgbm 0 30 mm d 1 and rf 0 31 mm d 1 m5tree 0 24 mm d 1 developed using data from station 57894 still yielded the lowest rmse obviously the proposed soft computing models especially lightgbm outperformed their corresponding empirical models under the input combinations 1 and 4 the most appropriate model to represent the whole region did not correspond to lightgbm but m5tree however the developed lightgbm and rf models with data from stations 57894 also yielded relatively low errors this may be due to the better meteorological data quality at station 57894 and its small climatic differences compared with the other 15 stations therefore it was recommended to use soft computing models developed with data from station 57894 to estimate eto in the humid subtropical jiangxi province which can greatly simplify the complexity of collecting data from more stations for modeling with ideal prediction accuracy however the developed lightgbm rf and m5tree models with data from stations 58506 produced the worst results in all cases which has been mainly caused by the largest differences in meteorological variables especially the much lower air temperatures and larger wind speed compared with the other 15 stations table 1 this further confirmed that the performance of models with external meteorological data is largely dependent on the similarity of meteorological variables between the cross stations to further evaluate the performance of the proposed soft computing models in larger areas with similar climates lightgbm rf and m5tree developed with meteorological data from station 57894 under the input combinations 1 and 4 were used to estimate daily eto at other 33 weather stations across the humid subtropical region of china as shown in fig 1 as shown in table 8 average rmse of lightgbm under the input combinations 1 was 0 90 and 0 62 mm d 1 which was 10 6 17 0 and 9 2 17 0 lower than those of m5tree and rf respectively this further confirmed that lightgbm was superior to rf and m5tree for estimation of daily eto even applied in much larger regions than where they were developed however much larger emse values 1 1 mm d 1 were obtained at some stations under the input combination 1 with tmax tmin and ra as inputs such as stations 56651 56778 56985 58265 58362 59964 and 59758 table s1 these are largely attributed to the greater differences in meteorological characteristics between station 57894 and these stations station mostly as a result of longer distances between the stations however the performance of soft computing models in external applications was more favorable and stable when more influential meteorological variables were included under the input combination 4 with tmax tmin and rs as inputs in recent years it has become increasingly popular to use meteorological data from neighboring stations for estimating eto at the target station shiri et al 2015a 2015b lu et al 2018 this strategy has been approved to work well in various climates around the world including southwestern china feng et al 2017 the proposed lightgbm model is thus highly recommended to estimate daily eto in the humid subtropical regions of china and even in other regions around the world with similar climates when lack of local meteorological data generally a long previous dataset are required to develop lightgbm and the other two soft computing models which may limit the use of this methodology in many areas however it is found here that it is still possible to obtain satisfactory eto estimates at a target station using models developed with data from cross stations with similar meteorological characteristics when previous local data are missing or not available which can greatly promote the application of the proposed lightgbm model for estimation of daily eto in data scare regions 4 conclusions this study assessed the performance of the new tree based lightgbm model for estimating daily eto using local and external data from 49 weather stations in the humid subtropical region of china the tree based m5tree and rf along with four empirical models hargreaves samani tabari makkink and trabert were also compared based on eight input combinations of daily meteorological data such as maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity hr and wind speed at 2 m height u2 and global solar radiation rs during 2001 2015 the results showed that lightgbm generally outperformed m5tree and rf in both local and external applications all of which produced much better daily eto estimates than the empirical models with the same model inputs soft computing models developed with meteorological data from station 57894 gave satisfactory eto estimates for the other 15 stations in jiangxi province even for other 33 stations across the humid subtropical region of china this will provide a new way to simplify the regional model development with meteorological data from as few weather stations as possible in a specific region lightgbm was thus highly recommended as an efficient alternative model for daily eto estimation however the proposed lightgbm model was only tested in the humid subtropical region of china in the present study and its applicability in other climates or across various climatic regions remains to be explored besides the parameters of lightgbm were optimized by the traditional grid search method and the hybridization of lightgbm model with bio inspired optimization algorithms e g cuckoo search algorithm and flower pollination algorithm should be explored to further improve its prediction accuracy acknowledgements this study was jointly supported by the foundation of

delta ms delta is one of the major agricultural production regions in the usa average annual precipitation of this region is about 1300 mm of which only about 30 is received during the core crop growing periods from april to august saseendran et al 2016a kebede et al 2014 soybean glycine max l cotton gossypium hirsutum l rice oryza sativa l and corn zea mays l are staple crops grown while soybean represents the most irrigated acreage 53 the remaining 47 is shared between rice corn cotton and aquaculture heatherly 2014 powers 2007 rainfall received during the crop season is also characterized by large inter and intra seasonal variabilities in amounts and temporal distributions leading to unstable crop yield returns anapalli et al 2016b for optimum farm returns currently over sixty percent of all the crops grown in the ms delta are irrigated the shallow mississippi ms river valley alluvial aquifer provides most of these water powers 2007 clark and hart 2009 overexploitation of this aquifer for water withdrawal for example irrigating crops is causing its rapid decline threatening sustainability of irrigated agriculture in this region lacking scientific research that integrates location and crop specific water demand information with available water resources for agricultural water management is ascribed to be one of the key reasons for this disturbing trend dalin et al 2017 heatherly 2014 clark and hart 2009 for reversing this aquifer decline for sustainable irrigated agriculture exact estimation of the water use or evapotranspiration et requirements of staple crops in this area is essential for guiding withdrawal of the right amount of water for irrigations commensurate with the aquifer s natural recharge levels et for a particular agroclimatic region can be derived using various methods for example soil water balance measurements field lysimeters eddy covariance ec residual energy balance eb bowen ratio energy balance br sap flow measurements and plant chambers shi et al 2008 wilson et al 2001 anapalli et al 2018a b however for crop irrigation scheduling applications et is often required at locations where such measurements may not be readily available also highly technical expensive facilities like large lysimeters and ec instrumentation are nonviable to have at every location where crops are cultivated as is maintaining them for long term data collection in this context state of the science agricultural system models are cheap viable and widely accepted tools for developing location specific et data for irrigation scheduling and developing crop et response functions for predicting crop response to irrigation water okada et al 2015 saseendran et al 2015a b mcnider et al 2015 in this context the root zone water quality model v2 rzwqm2 is a process oriented agricultural system model that was developed for simulating the effects of tillage crop residue water fertilizers and crop management practices on et crop production and water quality ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2009 saseendran et al 2014 the csm ceres maize csm cropgro soybean csm cropgro cotton are among the various crop modules available for simulations in rzwqm2 for simulations of corn soybean and cotton crops respectively ma et al 2006 and 2009 hoogenboom et al 1991 jones et al 2003 several studies rigorously tested and combined the rzwqm2 with short term 3 to 4 year and long term 14 to 17 year field research conducted around the world for managing dryland and irrigated cropping systems sadhukhan et al 2019 ma et al 2003 saseendran et al 2014a b 2005 2009 alves and cameira 2002 saseendran et al 2013 improved the water stress factor for photosynthesis and related processes in rzwqm2 and achieved improved simulations of water dynamics in agricultural systems so this version of the model was used for simulating et in this study notwithstanding there was only a study reported in the literature focused on assessing the accuracies of the et simulations by rzwqm2 against field measured data as measured using large lysimeters grown to corn in a semi arid climate saseendran et al 2016c kimball et al 2019 reported extensive differences among cropping system models in corn et simulations in an international agricultural system model intercomparison and improvement project agmip in that work a single station experiment in a tile drained soil in the midwest usa was used but there were no attempts to simulate tile water nitrogen interactions in the models also as pointed out in earlier works one of the reasons that attributed for the divergence among models in simulations of et in the kimball et al 2019 study was the unavailability of detailed crop growth and development and et data that are prerequisite for extensive testing and improvement of those et modules used in the cropping systems models farahani and bausch 1995 farahani and ahuja 1996 so in order to validate and improve et simulations there is a need for further cautious evaluation of et simulations of system models with quality measured data for example from large weighing lysimeters or ec systems saseendran et al 2016c the objective of this study was to evaluate the et simulations of rzwqm2 against eddy covariance and energy balance estimates of corn soybean and cotton et in clay soils in a humid climate of

silking stages were simulated within 2 and 0 days and physiological maturity stage between 4 and 3 days from the measured number of days after planting seeds in the experiment anapalli et al 2018b

days to seedling emergence flowering and physiological maturity were also reasonable with errors within 5 and 1 days from the measured values some flood events and rodent related damages to sensor cables rendered soil water measurements sporadic or unusable however with the few measurements available the error in simulations of soil water at 15 30 and 60 cm depths across the three years and

method for estimating et which is based on the eddy transport theories representing the lower boundary layer of the atmosphere is known to have inherent inaccuracies due to both theoretical and sensor limitations in measurements data analysis and interpretation mauder and foken 2011 gao et al 2017 leuning et al 2012 liu et al 2017 mauder et al 2007 these limitations are often reported in the literature as an energy balance closure problem ebc the inability of the total measured or computed energy output turbulent fluxes of sensible h and latent heat l energies to balance the total measured or computed input energies net solar radiation rn ground heat flux go and energy used in photosynthesis sph in the system in order to quantify the degree of uncertainty in the measured et

anapalli et al 2018b in this study first we analyzed ec data for et in 30 min time periods and then their cumulative values over daily time periods were calculated and compared with simulated daily et outputs from rzwqm2 the ebr achieved on a daily basis in corn soybean and cotton varied between 0 88 12 of the input energy was unaccounted for in the output energies from the system in soybean in 2016 and 0 98 2 of the energy unaccounted for in cotton in 2018 fig 2 the ebr computed for the same data in half hour time periods exhibited ebrs between 0 84 and 0 88 data not shown ebr reported from across fluxnet research sites in various climate regimes across the world varied between 0 70 and 0 90 wilson et al 2001 in our study no crop or season specific trends in the computed ebr were noted crop wise ebr varied between 0 9 and 0 94 across years in soybean in 2016 and 2017 0 96 in corn in 2017 between 0 92 and 0 98 in cotton across 2017 and 2018 fig 2 from our analysis it is evident that the uncertainties in measured etec in corn soybean and cotton should at the location of this study reflect uncertainties between 2 and 12 averaging 7 as reflected in the ebr leuning et al 2012 observed that the ebr computed over daily time periods can be better than those computed over half hourly time periods as temporary storages and their releases of heat energy within the copping system cancel out over diurnal periods anderson and wang 2014 reported ebrs between 0 75 and 1 05 in irrigated sugarcane fields in maui hawaii usa under varying atmospheric turbulence and advection conditions the ebrs achieved in corn soybean and cotton in our study therefore are comparable to and better than those reported by anderson and wang 2014 coefficient of determination of the computed ebr in our study were between 0 85 and 0 96 across the three crops and three crop seasons fig 2 3 3 comparison between eb or ec estimated and simulated et 3 3 1 comparison between estimated eb eteb and simulated et ets the eteb estimates in corn and soybean in 2016 were compared with ets simulated by rzwqm2 in figs 3 and 4 the rmses in daily et simulations were 0 14 cm in both corn and soybean in the same year figs 3a and 4 a comparing other rzwqm2 simulations with lysimetric et data collected in corn under both rainfed and irrigated conditions in a semi arid environment anapalli et al 2016a and zhang et al 2018 reported rmses between 0 1 and 0 15 cm these results show that both the eb estimates of corn and soybean et and the rzwqm2 simulated values are comparable to literature reported data the rrmse of these daily simulations were 28 in corn and 25 in soybean errors of these magnitude can be a deterrent in using these simulation outputs of et for computing irrigation water requirements for managing limited water irrigation in these cropping systems in irrigated agriculture especially in the ms delta farmers look for a non rainy period of a week or more for water stress to develop to make an irrigation decision so we examined the error structure in simulated et in comparison with eteb at weekly intervals the rrmses of weekly et simulations in both corn and soybean were found to be reduced to 14 which is a more tolerable accuracy level for irrigation applications figs 3b and 4 b annually eteb deviated from ets with pd of 11 in 2016 both crops were irrigated twice during the cropping season and each irrigation added 3 cm totaling 6 cm of water seasonally this supplemented the rainfall realized during the same time period for stress free plant growth in the case of corn r rainfall i irrigation was 57 cm against an eteb estimate of 67 cm fig 3c as we had not noticed any significant drought stress in the crop at any time during the crop season we assume that the 10 cm shortage in the r i for this crop in this season was compensated by water drawn from the soil water storage the seasonal 133 days from seedling emergence to harvest totals of corn ets eteb r i and eto were 60 67 57 and 55 cm respectively in the case of 2016 soybean starting from the 37th day after seedling emergence due to inclement weather conditions ec data could not be collected during the initial 36 days after planting the seasonal cumulative 85 days ets and eteb were 43 and 48 cm respectively fig 4c the pd of the ets from eteb was 11 in the case of corn and 10 in the case of soybean in 2016 figs 3c and 4 c 3 3 2 comparison between etec and ets etec measurements were available in soybean in 2016 and 2017 corn in 2017 and cotton in 2017 and 2018 figs 5 9 in general simulated ets corresponded better with ec estimated et than eb estimated et discussed above across corn soybean and cotton and their cropping seasons in 2016 2107 and 2018 this is possibly due to the fact that the ec method has less uncertainty compared to eb methods in their abilities to quantify et in cropping systems in this area rmse of daily soybean ets when compared against etec in 2016 was 0 09 cm fig 5a and in 2017 was 0 13 cm fig 6 a rmse of simulated corn et only one crop season s ec data was available for comparison during the 2017 crop season was 0 13 cm fig 7 a in the case of cotton in 2017 and 2018 rmses of et simulations were 0 11 and 0 10 cm respectively these errors in ets simulations were equal to or less than the accuracies in ets when compared with lysimeter et data in a semiarid climate anapalli et al 2016b zhang et al 2018 this also means that the accuracies of the et quantified using the ec method in this study are comparable to those measured using the lysimeters the above daily ets simulations across eb soybean and corn in 2016 ec soybean in 2016 and 2017 ec corn in 2017 and ec cotton in 2017 and 2018 had rrmses values of 28 25 21 34 32 37 and 30 figs 3a 4 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 a and 9 a respectively nonetheless when these simulations were accumulated weekly a time interval more practical in irrigation applications rrmses were reduced to 14 14 11 14 17 15 and 16 figs 3b 4 b 5 b 6 b 7 b 8 b and 9 b respectively as discussed above the uncertainties in quantifying etec expressed as ebr for these crops during these crop seasons varied between 2 and 12 considering these inherent uncertainties in et quantified using the ec method the accuracies in ets simulations obtained in this study are within an acceptable range for irrigation applications in the humid climate of this location the seasonal cumulative eto in general were comparable in amount with eteb or etec estimates of corn soybean and cotton et across corn soybean and cotton crops and their cropping seasons in 2016 2017 and 2018 figs 3c 4 c 5 c 6 c 7 c 8 c and 9 c across the three crops and cropping seasons ets were in general lower than eto but closer in magnitude to eteb or etec simulations were with pd percentage difference between cumulative seasonal ets and etec or eteb of 8 and 8 in soybean in 2016 and 2017 respectively figs 5c 6 c 3 in corn in 2017 fig 7c and 9 and 8 in cotton in 2017 and 2018 figs 8c and 9 c the higher level of accuracy in simulations of seasonal cumulative et requirements of the three crops renders the rzwqm2 model an excellent tool for strategic irrigation planning in the region in the absence of measured data eto is generally used as a surrogative of et for crop irrigation demand applications for this reason the simulated ets is a better candidate for irrigation water management applications in the event measured data are lacking estimated seasonal total eteb was higher than eto and ets in both corn and soybean in 2016 figs 3c and 4 c this can probably be due to the fact that in the residual eb approach all the energy inputs excepting what was used in ground heat flux in sensible heat and in canopy photosynthesis were assumed to fully contribute to latent heat energy flux or et anapalli et al 2018 it is possible that this assumption has led to some overestimation in eteb estimations in the case of etec estimations except in soybean in 2016 where etec was higher than eteb fig 5c all the etec estimates were higher than ets figs 6c 7 c 8 c and 9 c 4 conclusions adequate supply of water for meeting the et demand is critical to crop production the rzwqm2 an agricultural system model can simulate et at a location of interest from commonly measured weather and crop management data we simulated the corn soybean and cotton et across 2016 2017 and 2018 crop seasons using rzwqm2 and assessed accuracies of these simulations by comparing them with et quantified from eb and ec methods weekly et simulations in corn soybean and cotton cropping systems were accurate enough for their use in irrigation water management decision support in the climate of the lower ms delta region seasonally deviations of simulated et from those estimated from ec and eb methods across the three crops and crop seasons were within 11 this level of accuracy renders the rzwqm2 model an excellent tool for strategic irrigation planning in the region in the absence of measured data eto potential et for a grass reference crop was generally used as a surrogative of et without verifications of its accuracies in quantifying et in climates and soils for crop irrigation water management in this context the simulated et is suitable for generating crop irrigation water requirement information for water resources planning

systems in a predominantly clay soil under humid climate in the lower mississippi ms delta usa in 2016 2017 and 2018 energy balance eb and eddy covariance ec methods were used for measuring et the

shuttleworth and wallace sw model water infiltration into the soil was simulated using the green and ampt approach and its further movement in soil layers and contributions to soil evaporation using richard s equation across the three crops and their crop seasons simulated daily et deviated from ec and eb estimates with rmses between 0 09 and 0 14 cm and rrmses between 21 and 37 on a weekly basis accuracies in simulated et ets improved significantly with rrmses between 9 and 17 and on a seasonal basis rrmses were between 9 and 11 the imbalance in incoming and outgoing energies accounted in the ec system varied between 2 to 12 taking this uncertainty in estimated et into account the accuracies in weekly and seasonal et simulations were reasonable for their use in irrigation management at these time scales keywords irrigation water management cropping system model eddy covariance energy balance evapotranspiration reference crop evapotranspiration 1 introduction the lower mississippi delta ms delta is one of the major agricultural production regions in the usa average annual precipitation of this region is about 1300 mm of which only about 30 is received during the core crop growing periods from april to august saseendran et al 2016a kebede et al 2014 soybean glycine max l cotton gossypium hirsutum l rice oryza sativa l and corn zea mays l are staple crops grown while soybean represents the most irrigated acreage 53 the remaining 47 is shared between rice corn cotton and aquaculture heatherly 2014 powers 2007 rainfall received during the crop season is also characterized by large inter and intra seasonal variabilities in amounts and temporal distributions leading to unstable crop yield returns anapalli et al 2016b for optimum farm returns currently over sixty percent of all the crops grown in the ms delta are irrigated the shallow mississippi ms river valley alluvial aquifer provides most of these water powers 2007 clark and hart 2009 overexploitation of this aquifer for water withdrawal for example irrigating crops is causing its rapid decline threatening sustainability of irrigated agriculture in this region lacking scientific research that integrates location and crop specific water demand information with available water resources for agricultural water management is ascribed to be one of the key reasons for this disturbing trend dalin et al 2017 heatherly 2014 clark and hart 2009 for reversing this aquifer decline for sustainable irrigated agriculture exact estimation of the water use or evapotranspiration et requirements of staple crops in this area is essential for guiding withdrawal of the right amount of water for irrigations commensurate with the aquifer s natural recharge levels et for a particular agroclimatic region can be derived using various methods for example soil water balance measurements field lysimeters eddy covariance ec residual energy balance eb bowen ratio energy balance br sap flow measurements and plant chambers shi et al 2008 wilson et al 2001 anapalli et al 2018a b however for crop irrigation scheduling applications et is often required at locations where such measurements may not be readily available also highly technical expensive facilities like large lysimeters and ec instrumentation are nonviable to have at every location where crops are cultivated as

available for simulations in rzwqm2 for simulations of corn soybean and cotton crops respectively ma et al 2006 and 2009 hoogenboom et al 1991 jones et al 2003 several studies rigorously tested and combined the rzwqm2 with short term 3 to 4 year and long term 14 to 17 year field research conducted around the world for managing dryland and irrigated cropping systems sadhukhan et al 2019 ma et al 2003 saseendran et al 2014a b 2005 2009 alves and cameira 2002 saseendran et al 2013 improved the water stress factor for photosynthesis and related processes in rzwqm2 and achieved improved simulations of water dynamics in agricultural systems so this version of the model was used for simulating et in this study notwithstanding there was only a study reported in the literature focused on assessing the accuracies of the et simulations by rzwqm2 against field measured data as measured using large lysimeters grown to corn in a semi arid climate saseendran et al 2016c kimball et al 2019 reported extensive differences among cropping system models in corn et simulations in an international agricultural system model intercomparison and improvement project agmip in that work a single station experiment in a tile drained soil in the midwest usa was used but there were no attempts to simulate tile water nitrogen interactions in the models also as pointed out in earlier works one of the reasons that attributed for the divergence among models in simulations of et in the kimball et al 2019 study was the unavailability of detailed crop growth and development and et data that are prerequisite for extensive testing and improvement of those et modules used in the cropping systems models farahani and bausch 1995 farahani and ahuja 1996 so in order to validate and improve et simulations there is a need for further cautious evaluation of et simulations of system models with quality measured data for example from large weighing lysimeters or ec systems saseendran et al 2016c the objective of this study was to evaluate the et simulations of rzwqm2 against eddy covariance and energy balance estimates of corn soybean and cotton et in clay soils in a humid climate of

silking stages were simulated within 2 and 0 days and physiological maturity stage between 4 and 3 days from the measured number of days after planting seeds in the experiment anapalli et al 2018b

days to seedling emergence flowering and physiological maturity were also reasonable with errors within 5 and 1 days from the measured values some flood events and rodent related damages to sensor cables rendered soil water measurements sporadic or unusable however with the few measurements available the error in simulations of soil water at 15 30 and 60 cm depths across the three years and

between the energy inputs and outputs ebr energy balance ratio were used as a measure of this uncertainty liu et al 2017 in the eb method for quantifying et the ebr is always assumed to be one as all the energy available that is rn go sph h within the system was accounted for calculating le flux from the cropping system le the latent heat of vaporization of water represents the et from the system anapalli et al 2018b in this study first we analyzed ec data for et in 30 min time periods and then their cumulative values over daily time periods were calculated and compared with simulated daily et outputs from rzwqm2 the ebr achieved on a daily basis in corn soybean and cotton varied between 0 88 12 of the input energy was unaccounted for in the output energies from the system in soybean in 2016 and 0 98 2 of the energy unaccounted for in cotton in 2018 fig 2 the ebr computed for the same data in half hour time periods exhibited ebrs between 0 84 and 0 88 data not shown ebr reported from across fluxnet research sites in various climate regimes across the world varied between 0 70 and 0 90 wilson et al 2001 in our study no crop or season specific trends in the computed ebr were noted crop wise ebr varied between 0 9 and 0 94 across years in soybean in 2016 and 2017 0 96 in corn in 2017 between 0 92 and 0 98 in cotton across 2017 and 2018 fig 2 from our analysis it is evident that the uncertainties in measured etec in corn soybean and cotton should at the location of this study reflect uncertainties between 2 and 12 averaging 7 as reflected in the ebr leuning et al 2012 observed that the ebr computed over daily time periods can be better than those computed over half hourly time periods as temporary storages and their releases of heat energy within the copping system cancel out over diurnal periods anderson and wang 2014 reported ebrs between 0 75 and 1 05 in irrigated sugarcane fields in maui hawaii usa under varying atmospheric turbulence and advection conditions the ebrs achieved in corn soybean and cotton in our study therefore are comparable to and better than those reported by anderson and wang 2014 coefficient of determination of the computed ebr in our study were between 0 85 and 0 96 across the three crops and three crop seasons fig 2 3 3 comparison between eb or ec estimated and simulated et 3 3 1 comparison between estimated eb eteb and simulated et ets the eteb estimates in corn and soybean in 2016 were compared with ets simulated by rzwqm2 in figs 3 and 4 the rmses in daily et simulations were 0 14 cm in both corn and soybean in the same year figs 3a and 4 a comparing other rzwqm2 simulations with lysimetric et data collected in corn under both rainfed and irrigated conditions in a semi arid environment anapalli et al 2016a and zhang et al 2018 reported rmses between 0 1 and 0 15 cm these results show that both the eb estimates of corn and soybean et and the rzwqm2 simulated values are comparable to literature reported data the rrmse of these daily simulations were 28 in corn and 25 in soybean errors of these magnitude can be a deterrent in using these simulation outputs of et for computing irrigation water requirements for managing limited water irrigation in these cropping systems in irrigated agriculture especially in the ms delta farmers look for a non rainy period of a week or more for water stress to develop to make an irrigation decision so we examined the error structure in simulated et in comparison with eteb at weekly intervals the rrmses of weekly et simulations in both corn and soybean were found to be reduced to 14 which is a more tolerable accuracy level for irrigation applications figs 3b and 4 b annually eteb deviated from ets with pd of 11 in 2016 both crops were irrigated twice during the cropping season and each irrigation added 3 cm totaling 6 cm of water seasonally this supplemented the rainfall realized during the same time period for stress free plant growth in the case of corn r rainfall i irrigation was 57 cm against an eteb estimate of 67 cm fig 3c as we had not noticed any significant drought stress in the crop at any time during the crop season we assume that the 10 cm shortage in the r i for this crop in this season was compensated by water drawn from the soil water storage the seasonal 133 days from seedling emergence to harvest totals of corn ets eteb r i and eto were 60 67 57 and 55 cm respectively in the case of 2016 soybean starting from the 37th day after seedling emergence due to inclement weather conditions ec data could not be collected during the initial 36 days after planting the seasonal cumulative 85 days ets and eteb were 43 and 48 cm respectively fig 4c the pd of the ets from eteb was 11 in the case of corn and 10 in the case of soybean in 2016 figs 3c and 4 c 3 3 2 comparison between etec and ets etec measurements were available in soybean in 2016 and 2017 corn in 2017 and cotton in 2017 and 2018 figs 5 9 in general simulated ets corresponded better with ec estimated et than eb estimated et discussed above across corn soybean and cotton and their cropping seasons in 2016 2107 and 2018 this is possibly due to the fact that the ec method has less uncertainty compared to eb methods in their abilities to quantify et in cropping systems in this area rmse of daily soybean ets when compared against etec in 2016 was 0 09 cm fig 5a and in 2017 was 0 13 cm fig 6 a rmse of simulated corn et only one crop season s ec data was available for comparison during the 2017 crop season was 0 13 cm fig 7 a in the case of cotton in 2017 and 2018 rmses of et simulations were 0 11 and 0 10 cm respectively these errors in ets simulations were equal to or less than the accuracies in ets when compared with lysimeter et data in a semiarid climate anapalli et al 2016b zhang et al 2018 this also means that the accuracies of the et quantified using the ec method in this study are comparable to those measured using the lysimeters the above daily ets simulations across eb soybean and corn in 2016 ec soybean in 2016 and 2017 ec corn in 2017 and ec cotton in 2017 and 2018 had rrmses values of 28 25 21 34 32 37 and 30 figs 3a 4 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 a and 9 a respectively nonetheless when these simulations were accumulated weekly a time interval more practical in irrigation applications rrmses were reduced to 14 14 11 14 17 15 and 16 figs 3b 4 b 5 b 6 b 7 b 8 b and 9 b respectively as discussed above the uncertainties in quantifying etec expressed as ebr for these crops during these crop seasons varied between 2 and 12 considering these inherent uncertainties in et quantified using the ec method the accuracies in ets simulations obtained in this study are within an acceptable range for irrigation applications in the humid climate of this location the seasonal cumulative eto in general were comparable in amount with eteb or etec estimates of corn soybean and cotton et across corn soybean and cotton crops and their cropping seasons in 2016 2017 and 2018 figs 3c 4 c 5 c 6 c 7 c 8 c and 9 c across the three crops and cropping seasons ets were in general lower than eto but closer in magnitude to eteb or etec simulations were with pd percentage difference between cumulative seasonal ets and etec or eteb of 8 and 8 in soybean in 2016 and 2017 respectively figs 5c 6 c 3 in corn in 2017 fig 7c and 9 and 8 in cotton in 2017 and 2018 figs 8c and 9 c the higher level of accuracy in simulations of seasonal cumulative et requirements of the three crops renders the rzwqm2 model an excellent tool for strategic irrigation planning in the region in the absence of measured data eto is generally used as a surrogative of et for crop irrigation demand applications for this reason the simulated ets is a better candidate for irrigation water management applications in the event measured data are lacking estimated seasonal total eteb was higher than eto and ets in both corn and soybean in 2016 figs 3c and 4 c this can probably be due to the fact that in the residual eb approach all the energy inputs excepting what was used in ground heat flux in sensible heat and in canopy photosynthesis were assumed to fully contribute to latent heat energy flux or et anapalli et al 2018 it is possible that this assumption has led to some overestimation in eteb estimations in the case of etec estimations except in soybean in 2016 where etec was higher than eteb fig 5c all the etec estimates were higher than ets figs 6c 7 c 8 c and 9 c 4 conclusions adequate supply of water for meeting the et demand is critical to crop production the rzwqm2 an agricultural system model can simulate et at a location of interest from commonly measured weather and crop management data we simulated the corn soybean and cotton et across 2016 2017 and 2018 crop seasons using rzwqm2 and assessed accuracies of these simulations by comparing them with et quantified from eb and ec methods weekly et simulations in corn soybean and cotton cropping systems were accurate enough for their use in irrigation water management decision support in the climate of the lower ms delta region seasonally deviations of simulated et from those estimated from ec and eb methods across the three crops and crop seasons were within 11 this level of accuracy renders the rzwqm2 model an excellent tool for strategic irrigation planning in the region in the absence of measured data eto potential et for a grass reference crop was generally used as a surrogative of et without verifications of its accuracies in quantifying et in climates and soils for crop irrigation water management in this context the simulated et is suitable for generating crop irrigation water requirement information for water resources planning
