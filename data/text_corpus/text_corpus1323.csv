6615,transpiration tr is influenced by environmental factors vegetation properties and anthropogenic management the effect of environmental factors on tr are taking place from two aspects evaporative demand i e potential evapotranspiration pet and water supply i e soil water soil water is one of the most important factors that limit plant transpiration in terrestrial ecosystems especially in semi arid and arid regions investigating the relationship between tr and soil water is crucial for an improved understanding of plant survival strategies and predicting hydrological cycles and water resources under climate change although the relationships of soil water and tr have been widely studied the independent effects of soil water on tr are difficult to separate because soil water and pet occur concurrently under natural conditions this study carried out field observations of sapflow density meteorological factors and soil water in a black locust robinia pseudoacacia plantation in the semi arid loess plateau of china this information was used to develop a model integrating the daily pet and relative extractable soil water rew an index that represents the available soil water tr 0 27 pet 0 02 pet2 0 32 1 e 5 70 rew the model fitted the measured data well r2 0 65 and rmse 0 06 mm day 1 we found that the daily tr increased as the rew increased under varying pet levels additionally the independent effects of soil water on tr were analysed using the factorial experiment analysis method the rew was manipulated and pet varied naturally during the measurements to separate the independent effects of the rew on tr the results showed that tr increased with the rew during the study period at a rate of 0 53 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew when the rew 0 4 and 0 09 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew beyond the threshold rew 0 4 tr increased by 27 3 mm 43 7 compared to the controlled tr observed pet and lowest rew due to the effects of increasing rew ranging from 0 14 0 81 during the study period growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 furthermore canopy level stomatal conductance was calculated using a simplified inverted penman monteith equation the reference canopy level stomatal conductance gsref which represents the gs capacity and its sensitivity to soil water showed an increasing response with increasing rew which is the possible reason for the tr dynamics with the rew our study provided an improved understanding of the soil water tr relationship and predicted effects of climate change on tree water use although the method required abundant field observation data we have provided a feasible method of accurately quantifying the independent contribution of soil water on forest tr keywords soil water potential evapotranspiration evaporative demand transpiration semi arid region 1 introduction transpiration tr is the process by which water is transferred from soil to the atmosphere through plants and represents the key link coupling terrestrial water cycling and energy balance ungar et al 2013 kumagai et al 2014 on a global scale tr plays an important role in water balance and accounts for more than 60 of the evapotranspiration et in terrestrial ecosystems jasechko et al 2013 tr is influenced by environmental factors vegetation properties leaf area index tree age density root characteristics etc and anthropogenic management thinning pruning angstmann et al 2012 raz yaseef et al 2012 alcorn et al 2013 environmental factors have significant impacts on tr and these impacts have been widely studied at the leaf tree and stand scales kumagai et al 2008 ghimire et al 2014 shimizu et al 2015 the environmental factors that affect tr include soil water air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation oren and pataki 2001 o brien et al 2004 these factors can be divided into two aspects according to the underlying mechanisms naithani et al 2012 grossiord et al 2017 one aspect is evaporative demand which includes solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed all of which drive the transpiration process as well as potential evapotranspiration pet which is a compound index that characterizes the local meteorological and evaporative conditions jiao et al 2016b li et al 2017b the other aspect is the water supply i e soil water which provides available water for plant transpiration naithani et al 2012 ungar et al 2013 the relative extractable soil water is an index that represents the soil water available for plants granier et al 1999 granier et al 2000 numerous studies showed that water stress to plants occurred when rew value declined less than a threshold of 0 4 granier et al 1999 mackay et al 2012 ecosystem water stress is frequently characterized by the decline in soil water availability because soil water is important for plant growth and vegetation productivity dymond et al 2017 especially in semi arid and arid regions with deep groundwater levels climate change is expected to induce stress on forest evaporation processes and productivity by reducing the available water due to low precipitation and warming allen et al 2015 which could exert negative impacts on tr and thus result in variations in hydrological cycling and water resources previous studies have consistently concluded that increased atmospheric evaporative demand promotes tr which can be expressed via linear or non linear exponential and polynomial functions for different plants in different climatic regions o brien et al 2004 ghimire et al 2014 grossiord et al 2017 however studies on the effects of increased soil water on tr have not reached consistent conclusions this is possibly related to root distribution soil water variations and effects of climate on tr kume et al 2007 kumagai et al 2008 brito et al 2015 several studies found that tr increases as the soil water increases lagergren and lindroth 2002 chang et al 2014 ji et al 2016 while others found that tr initially increases rapidly and then gradually decreases after its maximum soil water reaches a threshold which is expressed as a polynomial function of soil water zhao and liu 2010 several studies reported that clear relationships do not occur between tr and soil water kumagai et al 2008 brito et al 2015 therefore investigating the relationship between plant transpiration and soil water is crucial for an improved understanding of plant survival strategies and the effects of vegetation on water resources angstmann et al 2013 furthermore to improve the predictions of plant responses to climate change and the alteration of hydrological cycles in the future it is essential to identify the independent effects of soil water on tr mackay et al 2012 kreuzwieser and rennenberg 2014 which will provided a better understanding of the variations in forest water use in water limited regions under climate change regimes li et al 2017b however soil water and pet occurs concurrently under natural conditions thus it is difficult to disentangle the independent effects of soil water under natural conditions to address the aforementioned problems precipitation manipulation experiments and potted experiments have been frequently used to investigate the responses to soil water stress fisher et al 2007 poorter et al 2012 in precipitation manipulation experiments soil water levels can be manipulated while using a fixed atmospheric demand between different treatments therefore the relative effects of atmospheric demand on tr were eliminated such a method has been successfully used in different forests rain forests deciduous forests and coniferous forests in various regions around the world fisher et al 2007 mackay et al 2012 poorter et al 2012 however precipitation exclusion experiments are unsuitable for forests with complex topography which has resulted in knowledge gaps about the various responses of forests in mountainous regions moreover potted experiments with plants and seedlings under experimental field conditions may not represent the true responses of mature forests poorter et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to develop a method that examines the relationship between tr and soil water under natural conditions to reflect the true response of plants to the single stress of soil water the semi arid area in the chinese loess plateau is the deepest loess deposit in the world and it has a depth greater than 100 m fu et al 2017 the groundwater level ranges from 30 m to 100 m below the surface yang et al 2012 jia et al 2013 plant roots cannot access the ground water thus soil water is the main water source for plants fang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 therefore soil water in the root zone largely determines plant growth and survival in this region wang et al 2017 fang et al 2017 found that three shrubs increased nocturnal transpiration to meet water demand under soil drought in this region soil erosion is the most serious environmental problem in this region wang et al 2011 black locust robinia pseudoacacia is a deciduous tree species native to north america and one of the most ecologically important species due to its essential role in erosion reduction soil improvement and carbon sequestration wang et al 2011 and it was widely planted on the slopes of the semi arid area in the chinese loess plateau after the implementation of the grain for green programme in 1999 jiao et al 2016a however severe soil desiccation occurred in the black locust plantations which exerted negative impacts on plant growth and regional water resources wang et al 2010 compared with the native quercus liaotungensis and armeniaca sibirica black locust was more vulnerable to be influenced by soil water conditions du et al 2011 additionally the temporal dynamics of soil water are markedly influenced by rainfall resulting in a wide range of soil moisture values at the annual monthly and daily scales especially under climate change regimes with low precipitation zhang et al 2018 therefore disentangling the independent effect of soil water on tr is crucial for improving the knowledge of the adaptation of exotic plantations which is beneficial to predict the effects of climate change on ecologically sustainable development in this water limited region in this study we conducted field observations of tr soil water content and meteorological factors in a black locust plantation in the semi arid chinese loess plateau the rew was calculated based on the soil water field capacity and wilting point in the study plantation subsequently we established a model integrating the effects of pet and rew on tr on a daily scale based on the model the independent contribution of soil water on tr was investigated using a factorial experiment method specifically our objectives were to 1 develop an integrated model to describe the pet rew tr relationship and 2 investigate the independent effects of soil water on tr 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

than 58 of the rainfall is concentrated between july and september fig 2 the growing season is from may to september for most deciduous plants in this region at the study site a nearly 30 year old black locust plantation was studied in the catchment the plantation is located on the south slope aspect and the middle slope position at an altitude of 1179 m the density of the plantation is 1300

plantation the monthly leaf area index lai of the black locust trees ranged from 1 9 in september 2016 to 2 6 in july 2015 fig 3 the mean field capacity was 0 161 m3 m 3 and the mean wilting point was 0 058 m3 m 3 in the soil profile from the study stand and these values were derived from the soil water retention curve 2 2 sap flow measurements in two consecutive growing seasons in 2015 and 2016 thermal dissipation probes tdp were used to measure the sap flux density fd m3 m 2 s 1 in six trees table 1 the tdp consisted of two needles at 10 mm in length and 1 2 mm in diameter the upper needle was a heater and the below needle was a reference the probes contained a copper constantan thermocouple junction supplied with 1 5 w of power to install the probes a 4 cm wide and 10 cm tall section of bark from the stem was removed at a height of 1 3 m above ground level the needles were inserted into the sapwood at the north aspect of the stem reflective bubble wrap was wrapped around the tree stem where the tdp probe was installed to prevent the sun from shining on the measured area the temperature difference between the needles was sampled every 60 s and recorded every 30 min with a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa the fd was calculated based on the temperature difference between the needles using the formula established by granier 1987 the stand sap flux density js

samples from 22 trees adjacent to the study plot jiao et al 2018 calibration was conducted according to jiao et al 2016b if the sapwood thickness was less than the needle length 2 3 meteorological variables and soil water measurements meteorological variables were simultaneously monitored with the sap flow measurements an automatic weather station was installed in the open area of the catchment

instruments were all installed 2 m above ground level precipitation p mm was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge te525 texas electronics inc dallas tx usa these data were recorded every 30 min with a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa in the study plot ec 5 sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa were used to measure the volumetric soil water content swc m3 m 3 at various soil depths 10 20 40 60 80 100 120 150 and 180 cm data were recorded at 30 min intervals with a hobo weather station logger h21 onset computer corp bourne ma usa the relative extractable soil water rew is calculated as follows 3 rew swc s w c w sw c fc s w c w where swcw is the wilting point 0 058 m3 m 3 and swcfc is the field capacity 0 161 m3 m 3 and these values were derived from the soil water retention curve the fao penman monteith equation was used to estimate the daily potential evapotranspiration pet mm during the study period according to the following formula allen et al 1998 4 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of the saturation water vapor pressure at air temperature ta kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 which is assumed to be negligible on a daily scale γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa u2 is the mean wind speed m s 1 at a 2 m height and ta is the air temperature at a 2 m height the input parameters were measured by the automatic weather station 2 4 canopy level stomatal conductance estimation the canopy level stomatal conductance gs mm s 1 for the plantation was calculated using a simplified inverted penman monteith equation as follows 5 gs 1000 k g ta t r vpd where tr kg m 2 s 1 is the daily stand transpiration of the plantation and kg kpa m3 kg 1 is the conductance coefficient as a function of ta which accounts for the temperature effects on the psychrometric constant latent heat of vaporization specific heat of air at a constant pressure and air density grossiord et al 2017 kg can be expressed as follows phillips and oren 1998 6 k g 115 8 0 4236 t a to calculate gs the thermodynamic variables were based on the average values during daylight hours phillips and oren 1998 additionally tr was summed over 24 h but divided by daylight hours only komatsu et al 2012 specifically daylight hours were assumed to be the period between 6 00 am and 7 00 pm in the yangjuangou catchment during the growing season for this study furthermore data recorded on rainy days and days with a vpd 0 2 kpa were excluded kumagai et al 2008 2 5 model development in this study we used the upper boundary line approach developed by li et al 2017b to establish the tr rew pet model which provides a feasible method of describing the combined effects of soil water and pet the boundary line approach is based on the hypothesis that the line connecting the data points at the outer margin of the data depicts the functional dependency between the two factors schmidt et al 2000 namely tr and rew first the responses of tr to rew were investigated the upper boundary line was determined to present the tr rew relationship without interference and it was expressed using the formula as follows li et al 2017b 7 tr t r max 1 e a r e w where trmax mm is the constant maximum of tr with increasing rew and a is the parameter trmax and a could be regressed by the boundary line points according to schmidt et al 2000 in addition all data were divided into 4 classes at the pet interval of 1 mm day 1 pet 3 4 pet 5 5 pet 6 and pet 6 to examine whether the tr rew relationship was applicable to the varied pet conditions the tr rew relationships at different pet levels were expressed using the formula 7 the parameters were fit with the data in each pet classes li et al 2017b second an integrated model for tr was developed the relationship between trmax and the median of the pet petm mm at the daily scale in each class was quantified by a nonlinear regression 8 t r max b p e t m 2 c p e t m d where b c and d are parameters trmax is quantified based on the tr rew regression in each pet level in this study the fitted trmax petm relationship was as follows fig 4 trmax 0 07 petm 2 0 64 petm 0 87 r2 0 99 n 4 to develop a model that reflects the coupling effects of rew and pet on tr formula 7 and formula 8 were combined into an integrated model 9 tr b p e t 2 c p e t d 1 e a r e w all parameters in the above formula were nonlinearly fit with all available data at the daily scale 2 6 factorial experiments in this study the factorial experiment method was used to evaluate the independent contributions of the rew to tr the factorial experiment method has been widely used to separate the independent effects of multi factors on evaporative fluxes zhang et al 2015 jin et al 2017 the rew was manipulated and pet varied naturally during the measurements to separate the independent effects of the rew on tr in this study first a controlled tr model simulation was driven by the lowest rew value i e rew 0 135 on july 19 2015 and the pet values measured during the study period 10 f c o n t r o l b p e t 2 c p e t d 1 e a r e w min where rewmin is the minimum rew value observed in the study plot during the study period second the modelled tr can be calculated using formula 9 and the measured rew and pet values third the difference between the calculated simulation with measured data and the controlled simulation was compared to reflect the impacts of the rew on tr changes in the tr compared with the controlled tr δtr were calculated as follows 11 δ t r f r e w f c o n t r o l where f rew is the modelled tr when the rew is manipulated i e 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and pet is the value observed at the daily scale the percent change of tr was calculated as follows 12 percent c h a n g e o f t r δ t r f control 100 2 7 statistical analyses the model simulations of tr were assessed based on three criteria root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and mean bias bias to analyse the effects of swc on gs and determine the controls of gs on tr a logarithmic equation was fitted to gs and vpd under different swc classes oren et al 1999 13 gs g s r e f m ln v p d where gsref is the reference conductance at vpd 1 0 kpa and m describes the sensitivity of gs to vpd the parameter gsref is expected to decline with reduced precipitation and soil moisture indicating a soil water limitation to gs granier et al 2000 all statistical analyses used the spss software package version 11 5 for windows spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 soil water and potential evapotranspiration during the consecutive growing seasons in 2015 and 2016 the total p was 180 1 mm and 432 6 mm respectively fig 5 due to the impact of rainfall the mean soil water at a depth of 0 180 cm in the 2016 growing season was higher than that in 2015 fig 5 with levels of 0 100 and 0 094 m3 m 3 respectively the average daily swc value had a wide range from 0 086 0 132 m3 m 3 in 2015 and 0 086 0 147 m3 m 3 in 2016 in the vertical profile the swc at a depth of 0 100 cm was higher than that in layers deeper than 100 cm fig 6 the temporal dynamic of swc at a depth of 0 100 cm was tightly related to the pulse of rainfall the swc at a depth of 120 180 cm was relatively stable in both the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons which indicated that deep soil water was rarely impacted by rainfall the daily pet initially increased and subsequently decreased in each growing season fig 5 the average daily pet was 4 26 mm day 1 in 2015 and 4 21 mm day 1 in 2016 indicating that the atmospheric demand was relatively lower under humid conditions with abundant rainfall the daily pet also ranged widely from 6 84 mm to 1 27 mm during the study period 3 2 model for transpiration in both growing seasons the temporal variations in daily tr showed a similar trend in which tr increased at the beginning of the growing season and then declined to the minimal level at the end of the growing season tr varied greatly within the growing seasons and ranged from 0 49 mm day 1 to 0 03 mm day 1 in 2015 and from 0 49 mm day 1 to 0 05 mm day 1 in 2016 the maximum tr values occurred on 8 june 2015 and 21 july 2016 the upper boundary line showed that tr increased as the rew increased during the study period fig 7 the regressions of tr rew at varied pet levels showed that r2 of each regression was higher than 0 30 except for the pet 3 level fig 7 and table 2 which is related to the limited available data in the pet 3 level these results reflected that the tr rew relationship fit almost all levels of pet based on formulas 7 9 a model integrating pet and rew for tr was estimated with the measured data the model can be expressed as follows 14 tr 0 129 p e t 0 106 1 e 11 150 r e w a comparison of the estimated tr using the above model with the measured tr generated values of r2 0 65 rmse 0 06 mm day 1 and bias 0 005 mm day 1 fig 8 these results showed that the model could accurately estimate tr in the black locust plantation 3 3 effects of rew on tr tr increased sharply with rew when the rew value was less than a threshold of 0 4 as the rew increased beyond the threshold tr increased slowly and reached a maximum the increasing rate of tr with rew within the threshold 0 4 was 0 53 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew which was higher than the rate of 0 09 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew beyond the threshold fig 9 the controlled tr was calculated based on the rew at the lowest level 0 135 and pet measured during the study period using formula 14 the total value of the controlled tr was 62 5 mm for the entire study period the total value of the modelled tr as measured rew and pet was 89 8 mm for the whole study period table 2 compared to the controlled tr at lowest soil water condition the total tr increased by 27 3 mm 43 7 due to the effects of rew ranging from 0 14 0 81 during the study period 3 4 canopy level stomatal conductance the gs declined as the vpd increased during the entire study period fig 10 a according to formula 13 the relationships between gs and vpd under various rew levels were established the gsref was derived from the gs vpd relationships and increased as the rew increased indicating soil water limitations on gs fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 establishing the relationship between tr and swc atmospheric evaporative demand and soil water availability are factors that control forest transpiration semi arid and arid areas feature water storage which increases the importance of soil water in the control of forest tr therefore the relationship between soil water and tr was thoroughly investigated in these water limited areas the relationship was directly established based on observations of sapflow and the root zone soil water which can be expressed as linear logistic and polynomial functions table 3 for example ji et al 2016 found that tr by the shrub nitraria tangutorum linearly increased with the soil water content in the badain jaran desert of northwestern china under the same environmental conditions tr presented a polynomial pattern response to soil water for haloxylon ammodendron and calligonum mongolicum ji et al 2016 these results revealed that differences in species characteristic represented one of the possible factors underlying the response patterns of tr to soil water studies have also shown that tr presents a logistic type response to soil water lagergren and lindroth 2002 chang et al 2014 however other studies have shown that a clear and strong relationship between tr and soil water cannot be easily established based on field data from multiple forests kumagai et al 2008 ghimire et al 2014 which was possibly due to several reasons first the water source for plant uptake is determined by the distribution of roots and soil moisture in the soil profile although the soil water was highly spatially and temporally heterogeneous in forests kume et al 2007 brito et al 2015 for example tree water uptake occurred in the deep soil layers as the drought length increased and the limited root depth could even result in a negative response of tr to moist soil conditions bréda et al 1995 kumagai et al 2008 also implied that a clear relationship could not be established between tr and soil water because of the water uptake that occurred in the deep soil layers however deep soil moisture was not continuously monitored in these studies second researchers have generally believed that tr is driven by pet but limited by soil water li et al 2017b however it is difficult to disentangle the relative impacts of soil water from environmental factors because they are mostly correlated grossiord et al 2017 for example zhao et al 2006 found that tr was primarily controlled by pet under higher soil water conditions but that tr was limited by rew when the soil water declined to a low level in an acacia mangium forest in this study to examine the independent effects of soil water on tr we have considered both the soil water in the whole soil zone and the pet conditions more than 90 of the fine roots are concentrated in the 2 m soil profile li et al 2005 therefore we detected the temporal variations and spatial distributions of soil water in the entire root zone in the black locust plantation the spatial and temporal variations in swc were evident during the study period figs 5 and 6 moreover following the investigation method of li et al 2017b for the coupling effects of pet and rew on tr in a larch plantation in northwestern china we developed a model for tr with pet and rew to accurately estimate tr in black locust plantations fig 7 more importantly the model provided a method for examining the rew tr relationship with continuous field data 4 2 effects of rew on tr based on the model we found that tr in the black locust plantation might increase with increasing soil water under unchanged evaporative demand fig 7 the parameter gsref is expected to decline with reduced precipitation and soil moisture indicating a soil water limitation to gs granier et al 2000 therefore in this study gsref was used to analyse the variation in the stomatal controls on tr among different soil water conditions novick et al 2016 found that the gsref for different vegetation increased with increasing soil water tr was strongly limited by the soil moisture when soil water deficits occurred the possible reason for the observed decrease in tr with soil drying is related to the decline in gsref during soil water depletion fig 10 stomatal conductance closure occurs to avoid hydraulic system failure when soil moisture drops with relatively unchanged pet oren et al 1999 grossiord et al 2017 and this represents an important mechanism in plants under drought conditions novick et al 2016 in this study the dynamics of tr under various swc conditions were similar to the dynamics of gsref which indicated that gs tightly regulated tr in the black locust plantation the stomata closure resulted in a decline in tr as the soil water decreased in the black locust plantation 4 3 prediction of tr responses to climate change in this region the spatial and temporal variation in et has been widely investigated under changes in vegetation and climate in the loess plateau feng et al 2012 jin et al 2017 and the results have provided implications for ecological restoration and water resource management feng et al 2016 as a dominant component of et tr and its temporal dynamics have not been extensively studied in this region in contrast soil water has been widely monitored using different methods including field observation and remote sensing at different temporal and spatial scales in this region wang et al 2010 feng et al 2017 our results have provided an approach to predicting the dynamics of tr in black locust plantations under different soil water conditions based on soil water data the effects of climate change will lead to altered precipitation patterns as well as increased temperature in many regions of the world grossiord et al 2017 soil water stress is expected to worsen due to the combined effects of low precipitation and warming precipitation decreased at a rate of 0 99 mm yr 1 and the temperature increased annually by an average of 0 02 from 1951 2008 in the loess plateau lü et al 2012 indicating a warmer and drier climate over the past several decades the drought frequency and severity in this region are increasing as a result of global warming sun et al 2015 liu et al 2019 which could increase stress to forests because of the associated reduction in soil water availability and changes in atmospheric evaporative demand vpd in this study our results implied that tr in the black locust plantation could decrease with increasing drought under climate change conditions consequently the carbon acquisition and growth of the black locust trees could also be suppressed novick et al 2016 emphasized that the atmospheric evaporative demand which is directly related to vpd is increasingly important for ecosystem water and showed that carbon fluxes and hydrological cycles changed due to stomatal closure under increasing vpd extreme precipitation events have occurred frequently in this region in recent years li et al 2017a found that extremely high precipitation was tightly correlated with el nino events and occurred in the year following el nino events for example the total rainfall in yan an in 2013 was 959 mm which was much higher than the mean annual precipitation from 1951 2012 530 mm li 2017 although extreme precipitation events could have induced severe soil erosion landslides and damage to dams cao et al 2015 wei et al 2015 the soil water storage was adequately recharged our results indicated that transpiration from the black locust plantation would increase with soil water recharge thus more water could diffuse to atmosphere from soil through plants which contributes to evapotranspiration additionally the increased rate of tr would decrease with increases in soil water therefore the response of transpiration and soil water to extreme precipitation events should be clarified in the future 5 conclusions forest transpiration is driven by pet and limited by soil water due to pet and soil water occurring concurrently under natural conditions it is difficult to disentangle the independent effects of soil water on tr in this study we developed a method of estimating the independent impact of soil water on forest tr based on data from continuous observations using the upper boundary line method a tr model that integrates pet and rew was established and it was well fit to almost all pet levels to examine the independent effects of soil water on tr the rew was manipulated while the pet varied naturally during the measurements and the integrated tr model showed that tr increased with increasing rew during study period the rate of tr increase within a rew threshold 0 53 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew was higher than that beyond the threshold 0 09 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew under the natural pet condition tr increased by 43 7 due to the effects of increasing rew compared to the lowest rew during the study period this response pattern of tr to soil water was mainly controlled by canopy stomatal conductance due to its cessation under dry soil conditions our study provides a feasible method of investigating the response pattern of tr to soil water and accurately quantifying the independent contributions

6615,transpiration tr is influenced by environmental factors vegetation properties and anthropogenic management the effect of environmental factors on tr are taking place from two aspects evaporative demand i e potential evapotranspiration pet and water supply i e soil water soil water is one of the most important factors that limit plant transpiration in terrestrial ecosystems especially in semi arid and arid regions investigating the relationship between tr and soil water is crucial for an improved understanding of plant survival strategies and predicting hydrological cycles and water resources under climate change although the relationships of soil water and tr have been widely studied the independent effects of soil water on tr are difficult to separate because soil water and pet occur concurrently under natural conditions this study carried out field observations of sapflow density meteorological factors and soil water in a black locust robinia pseudoacacia plantation in the semi arid loess plateau of china this information was used to develop a model integrating the daily pet and relative extractable soil water rew an index that represents the available soil water tr 0 27 pet 0 02 pet2 0 32 1 e 5 70 rew the model fitted the measured data well r2 0 65 and rmse 0 06 mm day 1 we found that the daily tr increased as the rew increased under varying pet levels additionally the independent effects of soil water on tr were analysed using the factorial experiment analysis method the rew was manipulated and pet varied naturally during the measurements to separate the independent effects of the rew on tr the results showed that tr increased with the rew during the study period at a rate of 0 53 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew when the rew 0 4 and 0 09 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew beyond the threshold rew 0 4 tr increased by 27 3 mm 43 7 compared to the controlled tr observed pet and lowest rew due to the effects of increasing rew ranging from 0 14 0 81 during the study period growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 furthermore canopy level stomatal conductance was calculated using a simplified inverted penman monteith equation the reference canopy level stomatal conductance gsref which represents the gs capacity and its sensitivity to soil water showed an increasing response with increasing rew which is the possible reason for the tr dynamics with the rew our study provided an improved understanding of the soil water tr relationship and predicted effects of climate change on tree water use although the method required abundant field observation data we have provided a feasible method of accurately quantifying the independent contribution of soil water on forest tr keywords soil water potential evapotranspiration evaporative demand transpiration semi arid region 1 introduction transpiration tr is the process by which water is transferred from soil to the atmosphere through plants and represents the key link coupling terrestrial water cycling and energy balance ungar et al 2013 kumagai et al 2014 on a global scale tr plays an important role in water balance and accounts for more than 60 of the evapotranspiration et in terrestrial ecosystems jasechko et al 2013 tr is influenced by environmental factors vegetation properties leaf area index tree age density root characteristics etc and anthropogenic management thinning pruning angstmann et al 2012 raz yaseef et al 2012 alcorn et al 2013 environmental factors have significant impacts on tr and these impacts have been widely studied at the leaf tree and stand scales kumagai et al 2008 ghimire et al 2014 shimizu et al 2015 the environmental factors that affect tr include soil water air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation oren and pataki 2001 o brien et al 2004 these factors can be divided into two aspects according to the underlying mechanisms naithani et al 2012 grossiord et al 2017 one aspect is evaporative demand which includes solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed all of which drive the transpiration process as well as potential evapotranspiration pet which is a compound index that characterizes the local meteorological and evaporative conditions jiao et al 2016b li et al 2017b the other aspect is the water supply i e soil water which provides available water for plant transpiration naithani et al 2012 ungar et al 2013 the relative extractable soil water is an index that represents the soil water available for plants granier et al 1999 granier et al 2000 numerous studies showed that water stress to plants occurred when rew value declined less than a threshold of 0 4 granier et al 1999 mackay et al 2012 ecosystem water stress is frequently characterized by the decline in soil water availability because soil water is important for plant growth and vegetation productivity dymond et al 2017 especially in semi arid and arid regions with deep groundwater levels climate change is expected to induce stress on forest evaporation processes and productivity by reducing the available water due to low precipitation and warming allen et al 2015 which could exert negative impacts on tr and thus result in variations in hydrological cycling and water resources previous studies have consistently concluded that increased atmospheric evaporative demand promotes tr which can be expressed via linear or non linear exponential and polynomial functions for different plants in different climatic regions o brien et al 2004 ghimire et al 2014 grossiord et al 2017 however studies on the effects of increased soil water on tr have not reached consistent conclusions this is possibly related to root distribution soil water variations and effects of climate on tr kume et al 2007 kumagai et al 2008 brito et al 2015 several studies found that tr increases as the soil water increases lagergren and lindroth 2002 chang et al 2014 ji et al 2016 while others found that tr initially increases rapidly and then gradually decreases after its maximum soil water reaches a threshold which is expressed as a polynomial function of soil water zhao and liu 2010 several studies reported that clear relationships do not occur between tr and soil water kumagai et al 2008 brito et al 2015 therefore investigating the relationship between plant transpiration and soil water is crucial for an improved understanding of plant survival strategies and the effects of vegetation on water resources angstmann et al 2013 furthermore to improve the predictions of plant responses to climate change and the alteration of hydrological cycles in the future it is essential to identify the independent effects of soil water on tr mackay et al 2012 kreuzwieser and rennenberg 2014 which will provided a better understanding of the variations in forest water use in water limited regions under climate change regimes li et al 2017b however soil water and pet occurs concurrently under natural conditions thus it is difficult to disentangle the independent effects of soil water under natural conditions to address the aforementioned problems precipitation manipulation experiments and potted experiments have been frequently used to investigate the responses to soil water stress fisher et al 2007 poorter et al 2012 in precipitation manipulation experiments soil water levels can be manipulated while using a fixed atmospheric demand between different treatments therefore the relative effects of atmospheric demand on tr were eliminated such a method has been successfully used in different forests rain forests deciduous forests and coniferous forests in various regions around the world fisher et al 2007 mackay et al 2012 poorter et al 2012 however precipitation exclusion experiments are unsuitable for forests with complex topography which has resulted in knowledge gaps about the various responses of forests in mountainous regions moreover potted experiments with plants and seedlings under experimental field conditions may not represent the true responses of mature forests poorter et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to develop a method that examines the relationship between tr and soil water under natural conditions to reflect the true response of plants to the single stress of soil water the semi arid area in the chinese loess plateau is the deepest loess deposit in the world and it has a depth greater than 100 m fu et al 2017 the groundwater level ranges from 30 m to 100 m below the surface yang et al 2012 jia et al 2013 plant roots cannot access the ground water thus soil water is the main water source for plants fang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 therefore soil water in the root zone largely determines plant growth and survival in this region wang et al 2017 fang et al 2017 found that three shrubs increased nocturnal transpiration to meet water demand under soil drought in this region soil erosion is the most serious environmental problem in this region wang et al 2011 black locust robinia pseudoacacia is a deciduous tree species native to north america and one of the most ecologically important species due to its essential role in erosion reduction soil improvement and carbon sequestration wang et al 2011 and it was widely planted on the slopes of the semi arid area in the chinese loess plateau after the implementation of the grain for green programme in 1999 jiao et al 2016a however severe soil desiccation occurred in the black locust plantations which exerted negative impacts on plant growth and regional water resources wang et al 2010 compared with the native quercus liaotungensis and armeniaca sibirica black locust was more vulnerable to be influenced by soil water conditions du et al 2011 additionally the temporal dynamics of soil water are markedly influenced by rainfall resulting in a wide range of soil moisture values at the annual monthly and daily scales especially under climate change regimes with low precipitation zhang et al 2018 therefore disentangling the independent effect of soil water on tr is crucial for improving the knowledge of the adaptation of exotic plantations which is beneficial to predict the effects of climate change on ecologically sustainable development in this water limited region in this study we conducted field observations of tr soil water content and meteorological factors in a black locust plantation in the semi arid chinese loess plateau the rew was calculated based on the soil water field capacity and wilting point in the study plantation subsequently we established a model integrating the effects of pet and rew on tr on a daily scale based on the model the independent contribution of soil water on tr was investigated using a factorial experiment method specifically our objectives were to 1 develop an integrated model to describe the pet rew tr relationship and 2 investigate the independent effects of soil water on tr 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

than 58 of the rainfall is concentrated between july and september fig 2 the growing season is from may to september for most deciduous plants in this region at the study site a nearly 30 year old black locust plantation was studied in the catchment the plantation is located on the south slope aspect and the middle slope position at an altitude of 1179 m the density of the plantation is 1300 trees ha 1 the understory vegetation consists of the grass species artemisia sacrorum and periploca sepium which have a mean cover of 25 fig 1d the canopy cover is approximately 0 80 on this plantation the monthly leaf area index lai of the black locust trees ranged from 1 9 in september 2016 to 2 6 in july 2015 fig 3 the mean field capacity was 0 161 m3 m 3 and the mean wilting point was 0 058 m3 m 3 in the soil profile from the study stand and these values were derived from the soil water retention curve 2 2 sap flow measurements in two consecutive growing seasons in 2015 and 2016 thermal dissipation probes tdp were used to measure the sap flux density fd m3 m 2 s 1 in six trees table 1 the tdp consisted of two needles at 10 mm in length and 1 2 mm in diameter the upper needle was a heater and the below needle was a reference the probes contained a copper constantan thermocouple junction supplied with 1 5 w of power to install the probes a 4 cm wide and 10 cm tall section of bark from the stem was removed at a height of 1 3 m above ground level the needles were inserted into the sapwood at the north aspect of the stem reflective bubble wrap was wrapped around the tree stem where the tdp probe was installed to prevent the sun from shining on the measured area the temperature difference between the needles was sampled every 60 s and recorded every 30 min with a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa the fd was calculated based on the temperature difference between the needles using the formula established by granier 1987 the stand sap flux density js

samples from 22 trees adjacent to the study plot jiao et al 2018 calibration was conducted according to jiao et al 2016b if the sapwood thickness was less than the needle length 2 3 meteorological variables and soil water measurements meteorological variables were simultaneously monitored with the sap flow measurements an automatic weather station was installed in the open area of the catchment

instruments were all installed 2 m above ground level precipitation p mm was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge te525 texas electronics inc dallas tx usa these data were recorded every 30 min with a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa in the study plot ec 5 sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa were used to measure the volumetric soil water content swc m3 m 3 at various soil depths 10 20 40 60 80 100 120 150 and 180 cm data were recorded at 30 min intervals with a hobo weather station logger h21 onset computer corp bourne ma usa the relative extractable soil water rew is calculated as follows 3 rew swc s w c w sw c fc s w c w where swcw is the wilting point 0 058 m3 m 3 and swcfc is the field capacity 0 161 m3 m 3 and these values were derived from the soil water retention curve the fao penman monteith equation was used to estimate the daily potential evapotranspiration pet mm during the study period according to the following formula allen et al 1998 4 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of the saturation water vapor pressure at air temperature ta kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 g is the soil

wind speed m s 1 at a 2 m height and ta is the air temperature at a 2 m height the input parameters were measured by the automatic weather station 2 4 canopy level stomatal conductance estimation the canopy level stomatal conductance gs mm s 1 for the plantation was calculated using a simplified inverted penman monteith equation as follows 5 gs 1000 k g ta t r vpd where tr kg m 2 s 1 is the daily stand transpiration of the plantation and kg kpa m3 kg 1 is the conductance coefficient as a function of ta which accounts for the temperature effects on the psychrometric constant latent heat of vaporization specific heat of air at a constant pressure and air density grossiord et al 2017 kg can be expressed as follows phillips and oren 1998 6 k g 115 8 0 4236 t a to calculate gs the thermodynamic variables were based on the average values during daylight hours phillips and oren 1998 additionally tr was summed over 24 h but divided by daylight hours only komatsu et al 2012 specifically daylight hours were assumed to be the period between 6 00 am and 7 00 pm in the yangjuangou catchment during the growing season for this study furthermore data recorded on rainy days and days with a vpd 0 2 kpa were excluded kumagai et al 2008 2 5 model development in this study we used the upper boundary line approach developed by li et al 2017b to establish the tr rew pet model which provides a feasible method of describing the combined effects of soil water and pet the boundary line approach is based on the hypothesis that the line connecting the data points at the outer margin of the data depicts the functional dependency between the two factors schmidt et al 2000 namely tr and rew first the responses of tr to rew were investigated the upper boundary line was determined to present the tr rew relationship without interference and it was expressed using the formula as follows li et al 2017b 7 tr t r max 1 e a r e w where trmax mm is the constant maximum of tr with increasing rew and a is the parameter trmax and a could be regressed by the boundary line points according to schmidt et al 2000 in addition all data were divided into 4 classes at the pet interval of 1 mm day 1 pet 3 4 pet 5 5 pet 6 and pet 6 to examine whether the tr rew relationship was applicable to the varied pet conditions the tr rew relationships at different pet levels were expressed using the formula 7 the parameters were fit with the data in each pet classes li et al 2017b second an integrated model for tr was developed the relationship between trmax and the median of the pet petm mm at the daily scale in each class was quantified by a nonlinear regression 8 t r max b p e t m 2 c p e t m d where b c and d are parameters trmax is quantified based on the tr rew regression in each pet level in this study the fitted trmax petm relationship was as follows fig 4 trmax 0 07 petm 2 0 64 petm 0 87 r2 0 99 n 4 to develop a model that reflects the coupling effects of rew and pet on tr formula 7 and formula 8 were combined into an integrated model 9 tr b p e t 2 c p e t d 1 e a r e w all parameters in the above formula were nonlinearly fit with all available data at the daily scale 2 6 factorial experiments in this study the factorial experiment method was used to evaluate the independent contributions of the rew to tr the factorial experiment method has been widely used to separate the independent effects of multi factors on evaporative fluxes zhang et al 2015 jin et al 2017 the rew was manipulated and pet varied naturally during the measurements to separate the independent effects of the rew on tr in this study first a controlled tr model simulation was driven by the lowest rew value i e rew 0 135 on july 19 2015 and the pet values measured during the study period 10 f c o n t r o l b p e t 2 c p e t d 1 e a r e w min where rewmin is the minimum rew value observed in the study plot during the study period second the modelled tr can be calculated using formula 9 and the measured rew and pet values third the difference between the calculated simulation with measured data and the controlled simulation was compared to reflect the impacts of the rew on tr changes in the tr compared with the controlled tr δtr were calculated as follows 11 δ t r f r e w f c o n t r o l where f rew is the modelled tr when the rew is manipulated i e 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and pet is the value observed at the daily scale the percent change of tr was calculated as follows 12 percent c h a n g e o f t r δ t r f control 100 2 7 statistical analyses the model simulations of tr were assessed based on three criteria root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and mean bias bias to analyse the effects of swc on gs and determine the controls of gs on tr a logarithmic equation was fitted to gs and vpd under different swc classes oren et al 1999 13 gs g s r e f m ln v p d where gsref is the reference conductance at vpd 1 0 kpa and m describes the sensitivity of gs to vpd the parameter gsref is expected to decline with reduced precipitation and soil moisture indicating a soil water limitation to gs granier et al 2000 all statistical analyses used the spss software package version 11 5 for windows spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 soil water and potential evapotranspiration during the consecutive growing seasons in 2015 and 2016 the total p was 180 1 mm and 432 6 mm respectively fig 5 due to the impact of rainfall the mean soil water at a depth of 0 180 cm in the 2016 growing season was higher than that in 2015 fig 5 with levels of 0 100 and 0 094 m3 m 3 respectively the average daily swc value had a wide range from 0 086 0 132 m3 m 3 in 2015 and 0 086 0 147 m3 m 3 in 2016 in the vertical profile the swc at a depth of 0 100 cm was higher than that in layers deeper than 100 cm fig 6 the temporal dynamic of swc at a depth of 0 100 cm was tightly related to the pulse of rainfall the swc at a depth of 120 180 cm was relatively stable in both the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons which indicated that deep soil water was rarely impacted by rainfall the daily pet initially increased and subsequently decreased in each growing season fig 5 the average daily pet was 4 26 mm day 1 in 2015 and 4 21 mm day 1 in 2016 indicating that the atmospheric demand was relatively lower under humid conditions with abundant rainfall the daily pet also ranged widely from 6 84 mm to 1 27 mm during the study period 3 2 model for transpiration in both growing seasons the temporal variations in daily tr showed a similar trend in which tr increased at the beginning of the growing season and then declined to the minimal level at the end of the growing season tr varied greatly within the growing seasons and ranged from 0 49 mm day 1 to 0 03 mm day 1 in 2015 and from 0 49 mm day 1 to 0 05 mm day 1 in 2016 the maximum tr values occurred on 8 june 2015 and 21 july 2016 the upper boundary line showed that tr increased as the rew increased during the study period fig 7 the regressions of tr rew at varied pet levels showed that r2 of each regression was higher than 0 30 except for the pet 3 level fig 7 and table 2 which is related to the limited available data in the pet 3 level these results reflected that the tr rew relationship fit almost all levels of pet based on formulas 7 9 a model integrating pet and rew for tr was estimated with the measured data the model can be expressed as follows 14 tr 0 129 p e t 0 106 1 e 11 150 r e w a comparison of the estimated tr using the above model with the measured tr generated values of r2 0 65 rmse 0 06 mm day 1 and bias 0 005 mm day 1 fig 8 these results showed that the model could accurately estimate tr in the black locust plantation 3 3 effects of rew on tr tr increased sharply with rew when the rew value was less than a threshold of 0 4 as the rew increased beyond the threshold tr increased slowly and reached a maximum the increasing rate of tr with rew within the threshold 0 4 was 0 53 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew which was higher than the rate of 0 09 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew beyond the threshold fig 9 the controlled tr was calculated based on the rew at the lowest level 0 135 and pet measured during the study period using formula 14 the total value of the controlled tr was 62 5 mm for the entire study period the total value of the modelled tr as measured rew and pet was 89 8 mm for the whole study period table 2 compared to the controlled tr at lowest soil water condition the total tr increased by 27 3 mm 43 7 due to the effects of rew ranging from 0 14 0 81 during the study period 3 4 canopy level stomatal conductance the gs declined as the vpd increased during the entire study period fig 10 a according to formula 13 the relationships between gs and vpd under various rew levels were established the gsref was derived from the gs vpd relationships and increased as the rew increased indicating soil water limitations on gs fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 establishing the relationship between tr and swc atmospheric evaporative demand and soil water availability are factors that control forest transpiration semi arid and arid areas feature water storage which increases the importance of soil water in the control of forest tr therefore the relationship between soil water and tr was thoroughly investigated in these water limited areas the relationship was directly established based on observations of sapflow and the root zone soil water which can be expressed as linear logistic and polynomial functions table 3 for example ji et al 2016 found that tr by the shrub nitraria tangutorum linearly increased with the soil water content in the badain jaran desert of northwestern china under the same environmental conditions tr presented a polynomial pattern response to soil water for haloxylon ammodendron and calligonum mongolicum ji et al 2016 these results revealed that differences in species characteristic represented one of the possible factors underlying the response patterns of tr to soil water studies have also shown that tr presents a logistic type response to soil water lagergren and lindroth 2002 chang et al 2014 however other studies have shown that a clear and strong relationship between tr and soil water cannot be easily established based on field data from multiple forests kumagai et al 2008 ghimire et al 2014 which was possibly due to several reasons first the water source for plant uptake is determined by the distribution of roots and soil moisture in the soil profile although the soil water was highly spatially and temporally heterogeneous in forests kume et al 2007 brito et al 2015 for example tree water uptake occurred in the deep soil layers as the drought length increased and the limited root depth could even result in a negative response of tr to moist soil conditions bréda et al 1995 kumagai et al 2008 also implied that a clear relationship could not be established between tr and soil water because of the water uptake that occurred in the deep soil layers however deep soil moisture was not continuously monitored in these studies second researchers have generally believed that tr is driven by pet but limited by soil water li et al 2017b however it is difficult to disentangle the relative impacts of soil water from environmental factors because they are mostly correlated grossiord et al 2017 for example zhao et al 2006 found that tr was primarily controlled by pet under higher soil water conditions but that tr was limited by rew when the soil water declined to a low level in an acacia mangium forest in this study to examine the independent effects of soil water on tr we have considered both the soil water in the whole soil zone and the pet conditions more than 90 of the fine roots are concentrated in the 2 m soil profile li et al 2005 therefore we detected the temporal variations and spatial distributions of soil water in the entire root zone in the black locust plantation the spatial and temporal variations in swc were evident during the study period figs 5 and 6 moreover following the investigation method of li et al 2017b for the coupling effects of pet and rew on tr in a larch plantation in northwestern china we developed a model for tr with pet and rew to accurately estimate tr in black locust plantations fig 7 more importantly the model provided a method for examining the rew tr relationship with continuous field data 4 2 effects of rew on tr based on the model we found that tr in the black locust plantation might increase with increasing soil water under unchanged evaporative demand fig 7 the parameter gsref is expected to decline with reduced precipitation and soil moisture indicating a soil water limitation to gs granier et al 2000 therefore in this study gsref was used to analyse the variation in the stomatal controls on tr among different soil water conditions novick et al 2016 found that the gsref for different vegetation increased with increasing soil water tr was strongly limited by the soil moisture when soil water deficits occurred the possible reason for the observed decrease in tr with soil drying is related to the decline in gsref during soil water depletion fig 10 stomatal conductance closure occurs to avoid hydraulic system failure when soil moisture drops with relatively unchanged pet oren et al 1999 grossiord et al 2017 and this represents an important mechanism in plants under drought conditions novick et al 2016 in this study the dynamics of tr under various swc conditions were similar to the dynamics of gsref which indicated that gs tightly regulated tr in the black locust plantation the stomata closure resulted in a decline in tr as the soil water decreased in the black locust plantation 4 3 prediction of tr responses to climate change in this region the spatial and temporal variation in et has been widely investigated under changes in vegetation and climate in the loess plateau feng et al 2012 jin et al 2017 and the results have provided implications for ecological restoration and water resource management feng et al 2016 as a dominant component of et tr and its temporal dynamics have not been extensively studied in this region in contrast soil water has been widely monitored using different methods including field observation and remote sensing at different temporal and spatial scales in this region wang et al 2010 feng et al 2017 our results have provided an approach to predicting the dynamics of tr in black locust plantations under different soil water conditions based on soil water data the effects of climate change will lead to altered precipitation patterns as well as increased temperature in many regions of the world grossiord et al 2017 soil water stress is expected to worsen due to the combined effects of low precipitation and warming precipitation decreased at a rate of 0 99 mm yr 1 and the temperature increased annually by an average of 0 02 from 1951 2008 in the loess plateau lü et al 2012 indicating a warmer and drier climate over the past several decades the drought frequency and severity in this region are increasing as a result of global warming sun et al 2015 liu et al 2019 which could increase stress to forests because of the associated reduction in soil water availability and changes in atmospheric evaporative demand vpd in this study our results implied that tr in the black locust plantation could decrease with increasing drought under climate change conditions consequently the carbon acquisition and growth of the black locust trees could also be suppressed novick et al 2016 emphasized that the atmospheric evaporative demand which is directly related to vpd is increasingly important for ecosystem water and showed that carbon fluxes and hydrological cycles changed due to stomatal closure under increasing vpd extreme precipitation events have occurred frequently in this region in recent years li et al 2017a found that extremely high precipitation was tightly correlated with el nino events and occurred in the year following el nino events for example the total rainfall in yan an in 2013 was 959 mm which was much higher than the mean annual precipitation from 1951 2012 530 mm li 2017 although extreme precipitation events could have induced severe soil erosion landslides and damage to dams cao et al 2015 wei et al 2015 the soil water storage was adequately recharged our results indicated that transpiration from the black locust plantation would increase with soil water recharge thus more water could diffuse to atmosphere from soil through plants which contributes to evapotranspiration additionally the increased rate of tr would decrease with increases in soil water therefore the response of transpiration and soil water to extreme precipitation events should be clarified in the future 5 conclusions forest transpiration is driven by pet and limited by soil water due to pet and soil water occurring concurrently under natural conditions it is difficult to disentangle the independent effects of soil water on tr in this study we developed a method of estimating the independent impact of soil water on forest tr based on data from continuous observations using the upper boundary line method a tr model that integrates pet and rew was established and it was well fit to almost all pet levels to examine the independent effects of soil water on tr the rew was manipulated while the pet varied naturally during the measurements and the integrated tr model showed that tr increased with increasing rew during study period the rate of tr increase within a rew threshold 0 53 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew was higher than that beyond the threshold 0 09 mm day 1 per 0 1 rew under the natural pet condition tr increased by 43 7 due to the effects of increasing rew compared to the lowest rew during the study period this response pattern of tr to soil water was mainly controlled by canopy stomatal conductance

6616,there is lack of knowledge in assimilation of multi sensor multi modal water temperature observations into hydrodynamic models of shallow rivers specifically a how does accuracy of shallow river model improve after assimilation of in situ and remotely sensed temperature observations and b how can data from disparate sensors and sources be assimilated into the prediction model without significant increase in computational burden multi sensor multi modal observations used in this study are obtained from in situ monitoring devices in the river with limited spatial coverage but dense temporal resolution and from landsat 7 satellite that has better spatial coverage but limited temporal coverage use of remotely sensed observations from satellites poses the challenge that the physical region represented by satellite data does not directly correspond with the physical domain of the river simulated in hydrodynamic models satellites detects the skin water temperature whereas numerical models estimate the bulk temperature in the surface layer that may be multiple meters in thickness furthermore for rivers narrower than the resolution of satellite data the temperature of each cell represents the weighted average temperature of land and water these factors introduce biases into the updated numerical model thereby impeding appropriate management of temperature water quality and aquatic ecology we implemented an efficient ensemble kalman filter method using latin hypercube sampling to assimilate multi sensor water temperature observations into the hydrodynamic model of the lower klamath river located in northern california assimilation of remote sensing data from landsat 7 improved the model prediction for the entire river the average spatial error was reduced from 2 59 c to 0 66 c i e 75 improvement in situ data assimilation reduced the error at the observation location however error in the water temperature predicted by the updated model reverted in less than two days to the same level as that of an un updated model on the other hand it is not computationally efficient to assimilate all of the available data into the model as they become available in order to overcome these challenges in situ data were adaptively assimilated into the model whenever the error exceeded a maximum allowable error adaptive assimilation of in situ data for the lower klamath river application occurred one to three times per day and reduced the average daily error up to 58 compared to assimilation of in situ data only once each day keywords data assimilation ensemble kalman filter in situ data latin hypercube remote sensing data 1 introduction water temperature is a critical factor that influences biological and chemical activity in rivers and lakes generally aquatic organisms tend to prefer a range of water temperatures for sustaining their metabolism and if temperatures deviate significantly from this preferred range then major mortality occurs poikliothermic organisms such as salmonid fishes are particularly vulnerable salmonids prefer cold water streams and different species have different thermal tolerances richter and kolmes 2005 biotic factors such as disease progression are exacerbated by higher temperature juvenile salmonid fishes in the klamath river oregon and california are more prone to infection resulting in a high incidence of mortality when river temperature reaches 15 18 c in late spring bartholomew and foott 2010 abiotic factors such as dissolved oxygen which is required by aquatic life that are dependent on aerobic environments for survival is also dependent on water temperature and can decrease in concentration when temperature increases similarly kinetics of multiple other reactive chemical contaminants are also dependent on water temperature leading to undesirable water quality problems and deterioration in health of aquatic life schnoor 1996 chapra 2008 babbar sebens et al 2013 it is therefore important to generate accurate temperature predictions since these in turn inform epidemiological and predictive water quality fish migration and phenology models commonly used for identifying appropriate fish health and water quality management decisions typical methods in water temperature monitoring include a range of remote sensing as well as in situ techniques observations from satellites provide spatially dense but temporally limited data whereas in situ sensors may provide temporally continuous data at a limited number of locations remotely sensed water surface temperatures can be extracted from landsat satellites e g landsat 4 5 thematic mapper tm landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor tirs landsat 7 is the most stable and accurately calibrated satellite irish 2000 hence water temperature measured by landsat 7 etm band 6 with 60 m resampled to 30 m resolution and repeat cycle of 16 days was used in this study however using satellite data to measure water temperature of inland water bodies can pose challenges especially when the grid resolution is larger than or similar to the size of the water body for rivers and streams narrower than the spatial resolution of remotely sensed measured temperature may represent a weighted average temperature of river banks and water moreover impermeability of the water column to electromagnetic radiation limits the physical domain actually observed by satellites for example satellites such as landsat 7 are able to only detect the skin temperature and this skin temperature is not directly comparable to the bulk temperature of the surface layer of a water column modeled within a numerical hydrodynamic model donlon et al 2002 javaheri et al 2016a temperature of the skin of a water body is also directly affected by solar radiation as well as direct interaction with the atmosphere and may be cooler or warmer than the bulk temperature of the first few meters of water below the surface while adjustment techniques have been proposed to remove the bias from water skin temperature data collected via satellites for lakes reservoirs and oceans javaheri et al 2016a reynolds et al 2002 donlon et al 2002 this relationship has not been determined for shallow rivers besides the challenges related to data resolution and mismatch between monitored and modeled physical domains numerical models using multiple types of datasets may also be significantly influenced by different sources of errors including approximation and truncation uncertain model inputs and assumptions biases in measuring devices and human error data assimilation da a model maintenance approach enables modelers to update an operational model s state variables dynamically based on information learned from incoming new observations of the modeled system while also taking into account the multiple sources of uncertainty in the underlying model and observations data assimilation has been successfully used in several water resources problems such ocean water temperature ezer and mellor 1997 keppenne and rienecker 2003 troccoli and haines 1999 aquatic contaminants seo et al 2003 dorigo et al 2007 soil moisture ottlé and vidal madjar 1994 pauwels et al 2001 ines et al 2013 and snow cover dong et al 2005 slater and clark 2006 javaheri et al 2016a assimilated remote sensing water temperature obtained from landsat 5 thematic mapper tm satellite into a hydrodynamic model of eagle creek reservoir located in central indiana they proposed a bias adjustment procedure for remote sensing data and found that adjusting before assimilation of new incoming data into the model not only improved the model efficiency with respect to satellite data but it also reduced the error in comparison to in situ data since the fate transport and mixing processes of lakes and rivers can be significantly different e g shallow rivers have significant mixing processes leading to negligible temperature stratification in the water column it is unknown whether similar adjustment assimilation techniques would help improve prediction of water column temperature in shallow rivers additionally there is no previous study that has reported whether assimilation of heterogeneous data from different monitoring technologies and sensors into a numerical hydrodynamic model of a river would help i keep the errors in temperature predictions below the maximum acceptable errors and ii whether such an assimilation is possible with low computational burden when large amounts of incoming data are available e g in situ measurements taken every few minutes in this study we have proposed a data assimilation methodology that takes advantage of temperature observations coming from different monitoring sources and an efficient ensemble kalman filter technique based on latin hypercube sampling method this new methodology was applied to a hydrodynamic model of lower klamath river located in northern california in order to investigate the following research questions 1 when in situ water temperature observations are assimilated into a hydrodynamic model of a river how is model accuracy affected in comparison to incoming remote sensing data 2 when remote sensing data derived from satellites are used for assimilation how does it affect the model accuracy when results of the updated model are compared with in situ data 3 how can an adaptive data assimilation approach take advantage of both monitoring technologies and assimilate them into the prediction model in a computationally efficient manner and in order to improve the overall model accuracy i e spatial and temporal the klamath river is a managed hydrologic system with competing interests for water use javaheri et al 2018 refined models that are able to accurately predict changes in water temperature with high resolution are critical for this system because temperature predictions are used to routinely inform potential impacts from modified flow in the river system the remainder of this paper is organized in multiple sections section 2 explains the case study and data collection extracting water temperature from landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm band 6 the hydrodynamic model and the proposed data assimilation formulation section 3 describes the results of the proposed adaptive data assimilation framework and finally section 4 describes the overall conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 study the klamath river emanates from the upper klamath lake in the cascade mountains flows through southern oregon and northern california and into the pacific ocean the total length of river is about 410 km and it is divided into upper and lower klamath river at iron gate dam igd this study is focused on the lower klamath river fig 1 starting from igd at river kilometer rkm 304 to the seiad valley sv rkm 205 rmk is measured from the ocean the lower klamath basin is steep and rocky with a complex terrain generally covered by forest except in the drainage areas of its tributaries the shasta and scott rivers among the several tributaries draining the lower klamath basin to the river the shasta and scott rivers have the highest flow flows at igd vary during the year december and january usually being the months with the highest flow and june to september the lowest 2 2 overall proposed data assimilation methodology fig 2 illustrates the summary of the methodology proposed in this study water temperature data were obtained from two monitoring technologies i e in situ data and satellite data spectral radiance from satellite images were converted to land surface temperature step 1 in fig 2 section 2 3 and the bias from satellite observation was removed as described in section 2 3 1 step 2 the hydrodynamic model was created and calibrated through step 3 in fig 2 using available meteorological and bathymetry data flow data at usgs stations fig 1 and water temperature in situ data at seiad valley station section 2 4 and javaheri et al 2016b since an ensemble kalman filter was used to update the model state variables using in situ and remote sensing observations section 2 5 ensembles were created by perturbing the inputs and model initial conditions via a latin hypercube sampling method step 4 section 2 5 1 the spread of ensembles was estimated using root mean square error ratio step 5 section 2 5 2 in situ and remote sensing data were assimilated separately steps 6 and 8 into the model and the model accuracy was then estimated through steps 7 and 9 sections 3 2 and 3 3 model accuracy estimated in step 7 was used to address objective 1 whereas model accuracy estimated in step 9 was used to address objective 2 the adaptive data assimilation objective 3 is done through steps 8 12 is described in section 3 4 2 3 temperature data in situ water column temperature data are collected every 15 min at downstream seiad valley station these data were used for model calibration as well as for data assimilation the remotely sensed water temperature data were obtained from landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm band 6 remote sensing temperature datasets were selected for three different dates during the year with no cloud cover may 23rd july 1st and september 19th of 2015 these dates were chosen because of the differences in temperature range observed in the river during these months and because these days overlap the period when salmon activity is significant the spectral radiance from satellite images was converted into at satellite brightness temperature bt by planck s law 1 bt k 2 l n k 1 l λ 1 where k1 and k2 are the calibration constants as 666 09 watts m 2 ster 1 μm 1 and 1282 71 kelvin respectively and l λ is spectral radiance which is estimated by 2 l λ m l q cal a l where ml is band specific multiplicative rescaling factor qcal are quantized and calibrated standard product pixel values and al is band specific additive rescaling factor the brightness temperature at the satellite is converted to land surface temperature lst by artis and carnahan 1982 3 l s t b t 1 w b t p l n e where w is wavelength of emitted radiance 10 4 12 5 μm p is a constant 14380 and e is land surface emissivity estimated the emissivity of water is 0 98 and lst represents the skin water temperature of river to assimilate remote sensing data approximately 200 sampling locations along the river were selected at random half of these sampling locations were used as training locations to implement the ensemble kalman filter data assimilation and the other half were used for testing the efficiency of data assimilation method since cell size of temperature raster in some river locations is larger than the river width the measurements of those cells were removed from the observations because they represent the weighted average temperature of land and water also as discussed earlier remote sensing data represent the skin temperature of water which is affected by solar radiation and wind hence the bias from satellite data should be removed before data assimilation 2 3 1 bias removal satellite data and in situ observation collected at the same time were compared at seiad valley station since in situ data are available only at seiad valley the difference between remote sensing data and in situ data at this location was subtracted from remote sensing data for the entire length of river to remove the observation bias 2 4 simulation model this study used the environmental fluid dynamic code efdc tetra tech 2009 for modeling of river hydrodynamics and temperature efdc is a three dimensional surface water modeling system for hydrodynamic water quality and sediment toxic contaminant simulations originally developed at the virginia institute of marine science to model estuarine systems it has been widely used subsequently to model flow characteristics and processes in different types of water bodies such as rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands and coastal ocean regions hamrick and wu 1997 arifin et al 2016 efdc solves the equations of continuity and momentum as well as transport equations to estimate the dynamics and temperature respectively tetra tech 2009 it supports cartesian and curvilinear orthogonal horizontal coordinates and can create sigma stretched vertical coordinates craig 2005 grid size and time step for this study were determined by considering the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the model was built using curvilinear coordinate and sigma stretched vertical coordinates the final model grid included 1270 longitudinal gridpoints 5 lateral gridpoints and 3 layers 1270 5 3 the model was run with a time step of 2 s considering stability and the computational burden constraints 2 5 ensemble kalman filter algorithm the ensemble kalman filter enkf first introduced by evensen 1994 was used as the data assimilation technique in this study this method is effective for assimilating data in higher order nonlinear models this method assumes that if we denote x k as a vector of state variables and y k as a vector of measurements the relationship between these vectors and the hydrodynamic numerical model f may be described as 4 x k f x k 1 u k 1 w k 5 y k h k x k v k where u k is the input vector w k is the uncertainty due to error in model v k is the vector of measurement errors h k is the linearized observation transformation matrix and the subscript k indicates the time step the method also estimates the forecast error covariance p f and uses it to update the state variables since the true values for state variables are unknown for most real world applications the method uses the ensemble average x k as its estimate of the true state 6 p k f 1 n 1 i 1 n x k f x k x k f x k t the updated state vector is taken to be a linear combination of model predictions and measurements 7 x k a x k f k k y k ε h k x k f note that a white noise ε is added to the vector of observations y k for each ensemble member to avoid the systematic error underestimation burgers et al 1998 in eq 7 k k is kalman gain estimated as follows 8 k k p k f h k t h k p k f h k t r k 1 where r k is the covariance matrix of observations in order to avoid the problems such as inbreeding filter divergence and spurious correlations due to undersampling methods for covariance inflation and covariance localization were applied inbreeding describes a situation in which the covariance matrix is underestimated due to small number of ensemble members filter divergence is a consequence of inbreeding and in cases in which the covariance is severely underestimated observations will have negligible impact on the final assimilation product spurious correlations between model states that are not physically related can occur as a result of sampling variability in the calculation of empirical correlations from the ensemble so the state variables are impacted by observations that are physically remote petrie 2008 application of covariance inflation and localization methods transform the updating eq 7 to the one below eq 9 9 x k a x k f ρ o λ k p k f h k t ρ o h k λ k p k f h k t μ k r k 1 y k ε h k x k f where λk and μk are inflation factors for forecast and observation covariance respectively o is the schur product and ρ is the correlation function petrie 2008 javaheri et al 2016a 2 5 1 latin hypercube sampling typically enkf uses a monte carlo approach to sample the variables randomly among their distribution range in this study instead of monte carlo latin hypercube sampling was selected to increase the efficiency annan et al 2005 xie and zhang 2010 the latin hypercube sampling method mckay et al 1979 iman and conover 1980 mckay 1988 is based on monte carlo simulation but instead of random sampling approach it uses a stratified sampling approach this method divides the distribution of each parameter into n equal probability intervals each with a probability of occurrence equal to 1 n then for each parameter each interval is sampled once this method is robust and requires fewer ensemble members than straightforward monte carlo methods 2 5 2 estimation of ensemble spread the performance of the enkf is highly dependent on the quality of ensemble generation ensembles are created by perturbing the forcing data if ensembles have too much spread the covariance matrix of the model may be over predicted and if ensembles have too little spread the covariance matrix may be underestimated a simple method was introduced by anderson 2001 to evaluate the amount of forcing data perturbation according to this method root mean square error rmse ratio ra is the ratio of the time averaged rmse of the ensemble mean r 1 to the mean rmse of the ensemble members r 2 moradkhani et al 2005 10 ra r 1 r 2 11 r 1 1 t t 1 t 1 n i 1 n x t i y t i 2 12 r 2 1 n i 1 n 1 t t 1 t x t i y t i 2 where n is ensemble size and t is period of analysis the normalized rmse ratio nrr is calculated 13 nrr ra e r a where e ra is the expected value of the ra and can be estimated as murphy 1988 14 e r a n 1 2 n optimum value for nrr should be close to unity nrr 1 indicates that ensemble spread is too small while nrr 1 shows that ensemble spread is too big moradkhani et al 2005 3 results the calibrated model of the lower klamath river from january 1st to april 30th 2015 was described in javaheri et al 2016b the calibrated model predicted the water temperature of a river with root mean square errors of 0 88 c when compared with in situ data collected at downstream seiad valley station fig 1 even though the rmse is small the error is big at maximum and minimum daily temperature up to 3 c the period of may 1st to september 31st was selected as data assimilation period for both remote sensing and in situ measurements 3 1 ensemble generation the distribution of each input parameter was divided into 30 intervals and each interval was sampled only once the most sensitive parameters in calculating the water temperature of shallow rivers include inflow temperature air temperature solar radiation wind speed flowrate and wet bulb temperature javaheri et al 2018 these model inputs were perturbed to generate the ensemble members fig 3 illustrates the variation of normalized rmse ratios for different perturbation factors it was found that with 15 distribution range for input parameters and 30 ensemble members nrr is 1 013 which is very close to unity 3 2 assimilation of in situ temperature data using ensemble kalman filter the bias in remote sensing observations from landsat 7 was removed and then the unbiased observations were used for remote sensing data assimilation rsda and model validation after in situ data assimilation in order to evaluate the effectiveness in using only in situ data for data assimilation we used in situ observations at seiad valley collected at noon on may 23rd july 1st and september 19th fig 4 which coincided with the time when landsat 7 satellite collected remote sensing data the river is well mixed at seiad valley and there is no vertical change in water temperature hence observations at seiad valley were assumed to be representative of the water column fig 4 compares the in situ temperature observations at seiad valley with the predictions of model before and after data assimilation using only in situ data it also illustrates that 36 48 h post data assimilation depending on forcing data for each day the updated model predicts water temperature values that are similar to those of an un updated model table 1 presents the rmse of model relative to in situ data before data assimilation and after data assimilation for the different time periods post assimilation for assimilation done on days may 23rd and july 1st the error decreased up to 48 h after in situ data assimilation as also illustrated in fig 4a and b the original un updated model underestimates the minimum and maximum temperature at these days after assimilation of in situ data the updated model is run with warmer initial conditions that causes the error reduction however for september 19th the error of updated model increased much sooner i e after 12 h at the time of data assimilation the un updated model first overestimated the water temperature the kalman filter updated the model run with cooler initial conditions thereby reducing the error for few hours however the updated model with cooler initial condition soon started to underestimate the water temperature leading to higher error at later times when the observations returned to being warmer while assimilation of in situ temperature data helped decrease errors at the in situ monitoring location i e seiad valley the next step was to evaluate whether errors had also decreased at other locations in the river this was done by comparing the predictions of the un updated model i e before data assimilation and the updated model i e after data assimilation with remotely sensed temperature observations along the entire length of the river segment table 2 presents the errors between predicted temperatures and in situ measurements and also between predicted temperatures and remote sensing observations for the time 12 pm when both in situ and satellite data were collected while after assimilation of in situ observations the rmse reduces at the observation site data assimilation using only in situ data at one site is not capable of improving errors in temperature predictions across the entire study region along the length of the river fig 5 when comparing with rs observation the error reduction for may 23rd and september 19th is not significant 3 and 9 respectively for july 1st even though in situ data assimilation reduced the error for the observation site the error for the entire river increased by 19 the main reasons are low spatial resolution and insufficient observations along the river since water temperature is correlated to disease progression and mortality in infected fish hosts it is critical to update the model states for the entire river in order to identify the locations with high risk of mortality 3 3 assimilation of remote sensing temperature data using ensemble kalman filter the updated model after assimilation of remote sensing data were compared with in situ observations to investigate how assimilation of remote sensing observation influenced model accuracy in comparison to future in situ data fig 6 the rmse of modeled temperature before remote sensing data assimilation and after data assimilation were also estimated for different time periods see table 3 the error was reduced for all the three dates once data assimilation was done with the available remote sensing data on these three dates see columns under sub heading e 12 in table 3 however the updated model after in situ data assimilation was able to predict water temperature more accurately than updated model after remote sensing data assimilation for july 1st compare e 12 in table 2 versus table 3 furthermore similar to table 2 updated model predictions come back to un updated model prediction values in about two days which indicates that the influence of data assimilation with remote sensing observations also lasted only about two days the reason is that travel time for water particles is about two days to move from igd to seiad valley fig 7 shows the longitudinal profile of remote observations and model predictions before and after data assimilation table 4 summarizes the rmse of modeled temperature before and after remote sensing data assimilation rsda by comparing model predictions with satellite observations along the entire length of the river segment and also by comparing with in situ measurements at seiad valley only assimilation of remote sensing data is not able to improve the model accuracy because of low temporal resolution even though it updates the model states for the entire length of river the absolute spatial error of original un updated model was compared with absolute error of updated model after assimilation of remote sensing data fig 8 the error of original model is less than 2 c from seiad valley to rkm 234 for may 23rd and july 1st the error increases to 6 c for upstream of rkm 243 however after remote sensing data assimilation the spatial error for the entire river reduced to less than 2 c except on july 1st upstream of rmk 283 where absolute error is approximately 3 c on september 19th the original model has a better prediction of water temperature for the entire river comparing to un updated model predictions on may 23rd and july 1st except for a short length of river downstream of igd the error is below 2 c after assimilation of remote sensing data the average of absolute error for the entire length of river reduced from 1 5 c to 0 7 c 3 4 assimilation of remote sensing and in situ temperature data using proposed adaptive ensemble kalman filter strategy assimilation of only in situ data is able to improve the model accuracy at the observation site however the spatial error improvement is negligible this indicates that more spatially dense observation e g satellite data or more in situ observations at upstream are needed to update the model state variables section 3 2 assimilation of satellite data into the model improved the spatial model accuracy however the updated model prediction came back to un updated model prediction values in about two days on average it takes about two days for new water released from the dam to travel from igd to seiad valley more frequent data assimilation is therefore needed to keep the model updated section 3 3 based on what we learned from previous sections we need an adaptive data assimilation technique that uses both sources of observation to improve the temporal and spatial accuracy of model in the proposed adaptive ensemble kalman filter strategy we assimilated both in situ and remote sensing data into the model at an appropriate time to keep the model updated as new observations irrespective of their source became available while in situ measurements at seiad valley station are available every 15 min it is not computationally efficient to assimilate them every 15 min hence to determine the appropriate time in the proposed adaptive ensemble kalman filter strategy a maximum error between model predictions and observations was first defined as a threshold error whenever the error between model predictions and the in situ measurements exceeded this threshold value new in situ measurements were assimilated into the model we recommend that this threshold error should depend on the use and operation of the temperature model in different fields in this research threshold was assumed to be 0 5 c to assess the efficiency of this method even for small values of error as remote sensing data are less frequently available the data were assimilated whenever good quality satellite data were available for demonstration purposes in the adaptive strategy satellite data collected at 12 pm on may 23rd were first assimilated into the model to improve the water temperature for the entire river then the model was run until the error in comparison to the in situ data at seiad valley exceeded the threshold error at that point in time in situ data were assimilated into the model fig 9 a and the updated model was then run in an operational manner until it violated the threshold error again at a future time e g may 24th at 4 15 17 30 22 00 and may 25th at 9 00 the same procedure was repeated for other days when remote sensing data are available i e july 1st and september 19th in figs 9b and 7c respectively it can be seen that instead of assimilation of data every 15 min only two to five incidences of data assimilation during 48 h are enough to keep the model error below the threshold error for selected dates the adaptive data assimilation reduced the computation time by 25 comparing to the condition that all in situ data were assimilated every 15 min into the model table 5 summarizes the error values for the periods of 12 24 and 48 h after adaptive data assimilation after adaptive data assimilation the averaged 48 h error e 48 reduced by 55 56 and 32 for may 23rd july 1st and september 19th respectively fig 10 these error reductions are 16 to 35 higher than error reductions in previous methods i e in situ data assimilation and remote sensing data assimilation 4 conclusion a data assimilation framework using ensemble kalman filter and latin hypercube sampling was implemented to update the initial condition of a three dimensional hydrodynamic model of the lower klamath river the difference between water temperature at seiad valley and remote sensing data was subtracted from satellite data to remove the bias observations from different monitoring technologies i e in site data and remote sensing data from landsat 7 were assimilated into the model to improve the model efficiency most sensitive parameters in water temperature calculation of shallow rivers were used to generate the ensemble members among the acceptable perturbation range while data assimilation using in situ observations improved errors locally remote sensing data assimilation was able to improve the spatial error of the model significantly the average spatial error decreased from 2 59 c to 0 66 c assimilation of in situ observations into the model improved the model efficiency at the observation site however the model error increased over time and in approximately two days the model predictions of updated model were the same as base model before data assimilation corresponding to the time required for a water parcel to travel from igd to seiad valley in order to decrease the model error by time and avoid the computational cost by assimilating all the available in situ measurements a maximum acceptable error between model and measurements was defined in situ observations were assimilated into the model when the error exceeded this threshold assimilation of in situ data one to three times per day reduced the average daily error up to 58 compared to when in situ data were assimilated only once per day the computation time was also reduced

6616,there is lack of knowledge in assimilation of multi sensor multi modal water temperature observations into hydrodynamic models of shallow rivers specifically a how does accuracy of shallow river model improve after assimilation of in situ and remotely sensed temperature observations and b how can data from disparate sensors and sources be assimilated into the prediction model without significant increase in computational burden multi sensor multi modal observations used in this study are obtained from in situ monitoring devices in the river with limited spatial coverage but dense temporal resolution and from landsat 7 satellite that has better spatial coverage but limited temporal coverage use of remotely sensed observations from satellites poses the challenge that the physical region represented by satellite data does not directly correspond with the physical domain of the river simulated in hydrodynamic models satellites detects the skin water temperature whereas numerical models estimate the bulk temperature in the surface layer that may be multiple meters in thickness furthermore for rivers narrower than the resolution of satellite data the temperature of each cell represents the weighted average temperature of land and water these factors introduce biases into the updated numerical model thereby impeding appropriate management of temperature water quality and aquatic ecology we implemented an efficient ensemble kalman filter method using latin hypercube sampling to assimilate multi sensor water temperature observations into the hydrodynamic model of the lower klamath river located in northern california assimilation of remote sensing data from landsat 7 improved the model prediction for the entire river the average spatial error was reduced from 2 59 c to 0 66 c i e 75 improvement in situ data assimilation reduced the error at the observation location however error in the water temperature predicted by the updated model reverted in less than two days to the same level as that of an un updated model on the other hand it is not computationally efficient to assimilate all of the available data into the model as they become available in order to overcome these challenges in situ data were adaptively assimilated into the model whenever the error exceeded a maximum allowable error adaptive assimilation of in situ data for the lower klamath river application occurred one to three times per day and reduced the average daily error up to 58 compared to assimilation of in situ data only once each day keywords data

in a high incidence of mortality when river temperature reaches 15 18 c in late spring bartholomew and foott 2010 abiotic factors such as dissolved oxygen which is required by aquatic life that are dependent on aerobic environments for survival is also dependent on water temperature and can decrease in concentration when temperature increases similarly kinetics of multiple other reactive chemical contaminants are also dependent on water temperature leading to undesirable water quality problems and deterioration in health of aquatic life schnoor 1996 chapra 2008 babbar sebens et al

for identifying appropriate fish health and water quality management decisions typical methods in water temperature monitoring include a range of remote sensing as well as in situ techniques

most stable and accurately calibrated satellite irish 2000 hence water temperature measured by landsat 7 etm band 6 with 60 m resampled to 30 m resolution and repeat cycle of 16 days was used in this study however using satellite data to measure water temperature of inland water bodies can pose challenges especially when the grid resolution is larger than or similar to the size of the water body for rivers and streams narrower than the spatial resolution of remotely sensed measured temperature may represent a weighted average temperature of river banks and water moreover impermeability of the water column to electromagnetic radiation limits the physical domain actually observed by satellites for example satellites such as landsat 7 are able to only detect the skin temperature and this skin temperature is not directly comparable to the bulk temperature of the surface layer of a water column modeled within a numerical hydrodynamic model donlon et al 2002 javaheri et al 2016a temperature of the skin of a water body is also directly affected by solar radiation as well as direct interaction with the atmosphere and may be cooler or warmer than the bulk temperature of the first few meters of water below the surface while adjustment techniques have been proposed to remove the bias from water skin temperature data collected via satellites for lakes reservoirs and oceans javaheri et al 2016a reynolds et al 2002 donlon et al 2002 this relationship has not been determined for shallow rivers besides the challenges related to data resolution and mismatch between monitored and modeled physical domains numerical models using multiple types of datasets may also be significantly influenced by different sources of errors including approximation and truncation uncertain model inputs and assumptions biases in measuring devices and human error data assimilation da a model maintenance approach enables modelers to update an operational model s state variables dynamically based on information learned from incoming new observations of the modeled system while also taking into account the multiple sources of uncertainty in the underlying model and observations data assimilation has been successfully used in several water resources problems such ocean water temperature ezer and mellor 1997 keppenne and rienecker 2003 troccoli and haines 1999 aquatic contaminants seo et al 2003 dorigo et al 2007 soil moisture ottlé and vidal madjar 1994 pauwels et al 2001 ines et al 2013 and snow cover dong et al 2005 slater and clark 2006 javaheri et al 2016a assimilated remote sensing water temperature obtained from landsat 5 thematic mapper tm satellite into a hydrodynamic model of eagle creek reservoir located in central indiana they proposed a bias adjustment procedure for remote sensing data and found that adjusting before assimilation of new incoming data into the model not only improved the model efficiency with respect to satellite data but it also reduced the error in comparison to in situ data since the fate transport and mixing processes of lakes and rivers can be significantly different e g shallow rivers have significant mixing processes leading to negligible temperature stratification in the water column it is unknown whether similar adjustment assimilation techniques would help improve prediction of water column temperature in shallow rivers additionally there is no previous study that has reported whether assimilation of heterogeneous data from different monitoring technologies and sensors into a numerical hydrodynamic model of a river would help i keep the errors in temperature predictions below the maximum acceptable errors and ii whether such an assimilation is possible with low computational burden when large amounts of incoming data are available e g in situ measurements taken every few minutes in this study we have proposed a data assimilation methodology that takes advantage of temperature observations coming from different monitoring sources and an efficient ensemble kalman filter technique based on latin hypercube sampling method this new methodology was applied to a hydrodynamic model of lower klamath river located in northern california in order to investigate the following research questions 1 when in situ water temperature observations are assimilated into a hydrodynamic model of a river how is model accuracy affected in comparison to incoming remote sensing data 2 when remote sensing data derived from satellites are used for assimilation how does it affect the model accuracy when results of the updated model are compared with in situ data 3 how can an adaptive data assimilation approach take advantage of both monitoring technologies and assimilate them into the prediction model in a computationally efficient manner and in order to improve the overall model accuracy i e spatial and temporal the klamath river is a managed hydrologic system with competing interests for water use javaheri et al 2018 refined models that are able to accurately predict changes in water temperature with high resolution are critical for this system because temperature predictions are used to routinely inform potential impacts from modified flow in the river system the remainder of this paper is organized in multiple sections section 2 explains the case study and data collection extracting water temperature from landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm band 6 the hydrodynamic model and the proposed data assimilation formulation section 3 describes the results of the proposed adaptive data assimilation framework and finally section 4 describes the overall conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 study the klamath river emanates from the upper klamath lake in the cascade mountains flows through southern oregon and northern california and into the pacific ocean the total length of river is about 410 km and it is divided into upper and lower klamath river at iron gate dam igd this study is focused on the lower klamath river fig 1 starting from igd at river kilometer rkm 304 to the seiad valley sv rkm 205 rmk is measured from the ocean the lower klamath basin is steep and rocky with a complex terrain generally covered by forest except in the drainage areas of its tributaries the shasta and scott rivers among the several tributaries draining the lower klamath basin to the river the shasta and scott rivers have the highest flow flows at igd vary during the year december and january usually being the months with the highest flow and june to september the lowest 2 2 overall proposed data assimilation methodology fig 2 illustrates the summary of the methodology proposed in this study water temperature data were obtained from two monitoring technologies i e in situ data and satellite data spectral radiance from satellite images were converted to land surface temperature step 1 in fig 2 section 2 3 and the bias from satellite observation was removed as described in section 2 3 1 step 2 the hydrodynamic model was created and calibrated through step 3 in fig 2 using available meteorological and bathymetry data flow data at usgs stations fig 1 and water temperature in situ data at seiad valley station section 2 4 and javaheri et al 2016b since an ensemble kalman filter was used to update the model state variables using in situ and remote sensing observations section 2 5 ensembles were created by perturbing the inputs and model initial conditions via a latin hypercube sampling method step 4 section 2 5 1 the spread of ensembles was estimated using root mean square error ratio step 5 section 2 5 2 in situ and remote sensing data were assimilated separately steps 6 and 8 into the model and the model accuracy was then estimated through steps 7 and 9 sections 3 2 and 3 3 model accuracy estimated in step 7 was used to address objective 1 whereas model accuracy estimated in step 9 was used to address objective 2 the adaptive data assimilation objective 3 is done through steps 8 12 is described in section 3 4 2 3 temperature data in situ water column temperature data are collected every 15 min at downstream seiad valley station these data were used for model calibration as well as for data assimilation the remotely sensed water temperature data were obtained from landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm band 6 remote sensing temperature datasets were selected for three different dates during the year with no cloud cover may 23rd july 1st and september 19th of 2015 these dates were chosen because of the differences in temperature range observed in the river during these months and because these days overlap the period when salmon activity is significant the spectral radiance from satellite images was converted into at satellite brightness temperature bt by planck s law 1 bt k 2 l n k 1 l λ 1 where k1 and k2 are the calibration constants as 666 09 watts m 2 ster 1 μm 1 and 1282 71 kelvin respectively and l λ is spectral radiance which is estimated by 2 l λ m l q cal a l where ml is band specific multiplicative rescaling factor qcal are quantized and calibrated standard product pixel values and al is band specific additive rescaling factor the brightness temperature at the satellite is converted to land surface temperature lst by artis and carnahan 1982 3 l s t b t 1 w b t p l n e where w is wavelength of emitted radiance 10 4 12 5 μm p is a constant 14380 and e is land surface emissivity estimated the emissivity of water is 0 98 and lst represents the skin water temperature of river to assimilate remote sensing data approximately 200 sampling locations along the river were selected at random half of these sampling locations were used as training locations to implement the ensemble kalman filter data assimilation and the other half were used for testing the efficiency of data assimilation method since cell size of temperature raster in some river locations is larger than the river width the measurements of those cells were removed from the observations because they represent the weighted average temperature of land and water also as discussed earlier remote sensing data represent the skin temperature of water which is affected by solar radiation and wind hence the bias from satellite data should be removed before data assimilation 2 3 1 bias removal satellite data and in situ observation collected at the same time were compared at seiad valley station since in situ data are available only at seiad valley the difference between remote sensing data and in situ data at this location was subtracted from remote sensing data for the entire length of river to remove the observation bias 2 4 simulation model this study used the environmental fluid dynamic code efdc tetra tech 2009 for modeling of river hydrodynamics and temperature efdc is a three dimensional surface water modeling system for hydrodynamic water quality and sediment toxic contaminant simulations originally developed at the virginia institute of marine science to model estuarine systems it has been widely used subsequently to model flow characteristics and processes in different types of water bodies such as rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands and coastal ocean regions hamrick and wu 1997 arifin et al 2016 efdc solves the equations of continuity and momentum as well as transport equations to estimate the dynamics and temperature respectively tetra tech 2009 it supports cartesian and curvilinear orthogonal horizontal coordinates and can create sigma stretched vertical coordinates craig 2005 grid size and time step for this study were determined by considering the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the model was built using curvilinear coordinate and sigma stretched vertical coordinates the final model grid included 1270 longitudinal gridpoints 5 lateral gridpoints and 3 layers 1270 5 3 the model was run with a time step of 2 s considering stability and the computational burden constraints 2 5 ensemble kalman filter algorithm the ensemble kalman filter enkf first introduced by evensen 1994 was used as the data assimilation technique in this study this method is effective for assimilating data in higher order nonlinear models this method assumes that if we denote x k as a vector of state variables and y k as a vector of measurements the relationship between these vectors and the hydrodynamic numerical model f may be described as 4 x k f x k 1 u k 1 w k 5 y k h k x k v k where u k is the input vector w k is the uncertainty due to error in model v k is the vector of measurement errors h k is the linearized observation transformation matrix and the subscript k indicates the time step the method also estimates the forecast error covariance p f and uses it to update the state variables since the true values for state variables are unknown for most real world applications the method uses the ensemble average x k as its estimate of the true state 6 p k f 1 n 1 i 1 n x k f x k x k f x k t the updated state vector is taken to be a linear combination of model predictions and measurements 7 x k a x k f k k y k ε h k x k f note that a white noise ε is added to the vector of observations y k for each ensemble member to avoid the systematic error underestimation burgers et al 1998 in eq 7 k k is kalman gain estimated as follows 8 k k p k f h k t h k p k f h k t r k 1 where r k is the covariance matrix of observations in order to avoid the problems such as inbreeding filter divergence and spurious correlations due to undersampling methods for covariance inflation and covariance localization were applied inbreeding describes a situation in which the covariance matrix is underestimated due to small number of ensemble members filter divergence is a consequence of inbreeding and in cases in which the covariance is severely underestimated observations will have negligible impact on the final assimilation product spurious correlations between model states that are not physically related can occur as a result of sampling variability in the calculation of empirical correlations from the ensemble so the state variables are impacted by observations that are physically remote petrie 2008 application of covariance inflation and localization methods transform the updating eq 7 to the one below eq 9 9 x k a x k f ρ o λ k p k f h k t ρ o h k λ k p k f h k t μ k r k 1 y k ε h k x k f where λk and μk are inflation factors for forecast and observation covariance respectively o is the schur product and ρ is the correlation function petrie 2008 javaheri et al 2016a 2 5 1 latin hypercube sampling typically enkf uses a monte carlo approach to sample the variables randomly among their distribution range in this study instead of monte carlo latin hypercube sampling was selected to increase the efficiency annan et al 2005 xie and zhang 2010 the latin hypercube sampling method mckay et al 1979 iman and conover 1980 mckay 1988 is based on monte carlo simulation but instead of random sampling approach it uses a stratified sampling approach this method divides the distribution of each parameter into n equal probability intervals each with a probability of occurrence equal to 1 n then for each parameter each interval is sampled once this method is robust and requires fewer ensemble members than straightforward monte carlo methods 2 5 2 estimation of ensemble spread the performance of the enkf is highly dependent on the quality of ensemble generation ensembles are created by perturbing the forcing data if ensembles have too much spread the covariance matrix of the model may be over predicted and if ensembles have too little spread the covariance matrix may be underestimated a simple method was introduced by anderson 2001 to evaluate the amount of forcing data perturbation according to this method root mean square error rmse ratio ra is the ratio of the time averaged rmse of the ensemble mean r 1 to the mean rmse of the ensemble members r 2 moradkhani et al 2005 10 ra r 1 r 2 11 r 1 1 t t 1 t 1 n i 1 n x t i y t i 2 12 r 2 1 n i 1 n 1 t t 1 t x t i y t i 2 where n is ensemble size and t is period of analysis the normalized rmse ratio nrr is calculated 13 nrr ra e r a where e ra is the expected value of the ra and can be estimated as murphy 1988 14 e r a n 1 2 n optimum value for nrr should be close to unity nrr 1 indicates that ensemble spread is too small while nrr 1 shows that ensemble spread is too big moradkhani et al 2005 3 results the calibrated model of the lower klamath river from january 1st to april 30th 2015 was described in javaheri et al 2016b the calibrated model predicted the water temperature of a river with root mean square errors of 0 88 c when compared with in situ data collected at downstream seiad valley station fig 1 even though the rmse is small the error is big at maximum and minimum daily temperature up to 3 c the period of may 1st to september 31st was selected as data assimilation period for both remote sensing and in situ measurements 3 1 ensemble generation the distribution of each input parameter was divided into 30 intervals and each interval was sampled only once the most sensitive parameters in calculating the water temperature of shallow rivers include inflow temperature air temperature solar radiation wind speed flowrate and wet bulb temperature javaheri et al 2018 these model inputs were perturbed to generate the ensemble members fig 3 illustrates the variation of normalized rmse ratios for different perturbation factors it was found that with 15 distribution range for input parameters and 30 ensemble members nrr is 1 013 which is very close to unity 3 2 assimilation of in situ temperature data using ensemble kalman filter the bias in remote sensing observations from landsat 7 was removed and then the unbiased observations were used for remote sensing data assimilation rsda and model validation after in situ data assimilation in order to evaluate the effectiveness in using only in situ data for data assimilation we used in situ observations at seiad valley collected at noon on may 23rd july 1st and september 19th fig 4 which coincided with the time when landsat 7 satellite collected remote sensing data the river is well mixed at seiad valley and there is no vertical change in water temperature hence observations at seiad valley were assumed to be representative of the water column fig 4 compares the in situ temperature observations at seiad valley with the predictions of model before and after data assimilation using only in situ data it also illustrates that 36 48 h post data assimilation depending on forcing data for each day the updated model predicts water temperature values that are similar to those of an un updated model table 1 presents the rmse of model relative to in situ data before data assimilation and after data assimilation for the different time periods post assimilation for assimilation done on days may 23rd and july 1st the error decreased up to 48 h after in situ data assimilation as also illustrated in fig 4a and b the original un updated model underestimates the minimum and maximum temperature at these days after assimilation of in situ data the updated model is run with warmer initial conditions that causes the error reduction however for september 19th the error of updated model increased much sooner i e after 12 h at the time of data assimilation the un updated model first overestimated the water temperature the kalman filter updated the model run with cooler initial conditions thereby reducing the error for few hours however the updated model with cooler initial condition soon started to underestimate the water temperature leading to higher error at later times when the observations returned to being warmer while assimilation of in situ temperature data helped decrease errors at the in situ monitoring location i e seiad valley the next step was to evaluate whether errors had also decreased at other locations in the river this was done by comparing the predictions of the un updated model i e before data assimilation and the updated model i e after data assimilation with remotely sensed temperature observations along the entire length of the river segment table 2 presents the errors between predicted temperatures and in situ measurements and also between predicted temperatures and remote sensing observations for the time 12 pm when both in situ and satellite data were collected while after assimilation of in situ observations the rmse reduces at the observation site data assimilation using only in situ data at one site is not capable of improving errors in temperature predictions across the entire study region along the length of the river fig 5 when comparing with rs observation the error reduction for may 23rd and september 19th is not significant 3 and 9 respectively for july 1st even though in situ data assimilation reduced the error for the observation site the error for the entire river increased by 19 the main reasons are low spatial resolution and insufficient observations along the river since water temperature is correlated to disease progression and mortality in infected fish hosts it is critical to update the model states for the entire river in order to identify the locations with high risk of mortality 3 3 assimilation of remote sensing temperature data using ensemble kalman filter the updated model after assimilation of remote sensing data were compared with in situ observations to investigate how assimilation of remote sensing observation influenced model accuracy in comparison to future in situ data fig 6 the rmse of modeled temperature before remote sensing data assimilation and after data assimilation were also estimated for different time periods see table 3 the error was reduced for all the three dates once data assimilation was done with the available remote sensing data on these three dates see columns under sub heading e 12 in table 3 however the updated model after in situ data assimilation was able to predict water temperature more accurately than updated model after remote sensing data assimilation for july 1st compare e 12 in table 2 versus table 3 furthermore similar to table 2 updated model predictions come back to un updated model prediction values in about two days which indicates that the influence of data assimilation with remote sensing observations also lasted only about two days the reason is that travel time for water particles is about two days to move from igd to seiad valley fig 7 shows the longitudinal profile of remote observations and model predictions before and after data assimilation table 4 summarizes the rmse of modeled temperature before and after remote sensing data assimilation rsda by comparing model predictions with satellite observations along the entire length of the river segment and also by comparing with in situ measurements at seiad valley only assimilation of remote sensing data is not able to improve the model accuracy because of low temporal resolution even though it updates the model states for the entire length of river the absolute spatial error of original un updated model was compared with absolute error of updated model after assimilation of remote sensing data fig 8 the error of original model is less than 2 c from seiad valley to rkm 234 for may 23rd and july 1st the error increases to 6 c for upstream of rkm 243 however after remote sensing data assimilation the spatial error for the entire river reduced to less than 2 c except on july 1st upstream of rmk 283 where absolute error is approximately 3 c on september 19th the original model has a better prediction of water temperature for the entire river comparing to un updated model predictions on may 23rd and july 1st except for a short length of river downstream of igd the error is below 2 c after assimilation of remote sensing data the average of absolute error for the entire length of river reduced from 1 5 c to 0 7 c 3 4 assimilation of remote sensing and in situ temperature data using proposed adaptive ensemble kalman filter strategy assimilation of only in situ data is able to improve the model accuracy at the observation site however the spatial error improvement is negligible this indicates that more spatially dense observation e g satellite data or more in situ observations at upstream are needed to update the model state variables section 3 2 assimilation of satellite data into the model improved the spatial model accuracy however the updated model prediction came back to un updated model prediction values in about two days on average it takes about two days for new water released from the dam to travel from igd to seiad valley more frequent data assimilation is therefore needed to keep the model updated section 3 3 based on what we learned from previous sections we need an adaptive data assimilation technique that uses both sources of observation to improve the temporal and spatial accuracy of model in the proposed adaptive ensemble kalman filter strategy we assimilated both in situ and remote sensing data into the model at an appropriate time to keep the model updated as new observations irrespective of their source became available while in situ measurements at seiad valley station are available every 15 min it is not computationally efficient to assimilate them every 15 min hence to determine the appropriate time in the proposed adaptive ensemble kalman filter strategy a maximum error between model predictions and observations was first defined as a threshold error whenever the error between model predictions and the in situ measurements exceeded this threshold value new in situ measurements were assimilated into the model we recommend that this threshold error should depend on the use and operation of the temperature model in different fields in this research threshold was assumed to be 0 5 c to assess the efficiency of this method even for small values of error as remote sensing data are less frequently available the data were assimilated whenever good quality satellite data were available for demonstration purposes in the adaptive strategy satellite data collected at 12 pm on may 23rd were first assimilated into the model to improve the water temperature for the entire river then the model was run until the error in comparison to the in situ data at seiad valley exceeded the threshold error at that point in time in situ data were assimilated into the model fig 9 a and the updated model was then run in an operational manner until it violated the threshold error again at a future time e g may 24th at 4 15 17 30 22 00 and may 25th at 9 00 the same procedure was repeated for other days when remote sensing data are available i e july 1st and september 19th in figs 9b and 7c respectively it can be seen that instead of assimilation of data every 15 min only two to five incidences of data assimilation during 48 h are enough to keep the model error below the threshold error for selected dates the adaptive data assimilation reduced the computation time by 25 comparing to the condition that all in situ data were assimilated every 15 min into the model table 5 summarizes the error values for the periods of 12 24 and 48 h after adaptive data assimilation after adaptive data assimilation the averaged 48 h error e 48 reduced by 55 56 and 32 for may 23rd july 1st and september 19th respectively fig 10 these error reductions are 16 to 35 higher than error reductions in previous methods i e in situ data assimilation and remote sensing data assimilation 4 conclusion a data assimilation framework using ensemble kalman filter and latin hypercube sampling was implemented to update the initial condition of a three dimensional hydrodynamic model of the lower klamath river the difference between water temperature at seiad valley and remote sensing data was subtracted from satellite data to remove the bias observations from different monitoring technologies i e in site data and remote sensing data from landsat 7 were assimilated into the model to improve the model efficiency most sensitive parameters in water temperature calculation of shallow rivers were used to generate the ensemble members among the acceptable perturbation range while data assimilation using in situ observations improved errors locally remote sensing data assimilation was able to improve the spatial error of the model significantly the average spatial error decreased from 2 59 c to 0 66 c assimilation of in situ observations into the model improved the model efficiency at the observation site however the model error increased over time and in approximately two days the model predictions of updated model were the same as base model before data assimilation corresponding to the time required for a water parcel to travel from igd to seiad valley in order to decrease the model error by time and avoid the computational cost by assimilating all the available in situ measurements a maximum acceptable error between model and measurements was defined in situ observations were assimilated into the model when the error exceeded this threshold assimilation of in situ data one to three times per day reduced the average daily error up to 58 compared to when in situ data were assimilated only once per day the computation time was also reduced

6617,an increase in atmospheric co2 concentration co2 affects stomatal conductance gs since gs is an important parameter in the penman monteith model p m an accurate estimate of gs can improve the accuracy of the estimation of evapotranspiration et by p m when co2 increases this paper identifies three models of the relationship between gs and co2 the linear model l the hyperbolic model h and the modified hyperbolic model mh and compares their estimations of et when they are incorporated into p m a two year experiment which included four levels 400 550 700 and 900 μmol mol 1 and three levels 400 550 and 700 μmol mol 1 of co2 in 2015 and 2016 respectively was conducted in order to obtain validation data fifty papers that had studied the effect of increased co2 on gs over a 45 year period were analyzed to obtain calibration data after being calibrated and validated each of the three models was in turn included as a component of p m to estimate et under increased co2 followed by the comparison between estimated and observed et the sensitivity of p m to the parameters in three models was also analyzed our results show that gs decreased and the reduction rate gradually lessened as co2 increased of the three models mh gave the best estimate of gs having the largest values of the coefficient of determination r 2 0 97 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 0 96 and the modified affinity index d 0 93 and the smallest values of the root mean square error rmse 0 03 and the akaike information criterion aic 47 48 each of the three models gave different et results for different levels of co2 when used as a component of p m the mh had better et estimations than l and h when compared to observed et across all co2 concentration levels with the highest r2 nse and d and the lowest rmse and aic the sensitivity of p m to the empirical parameters varied among the three models for instance 40 and 20 changes of parameter p in l gs max p and cs 0 in h and b in mh resulted in 15 to 4 13 to 7 9 to 4 and 3 to 3 changes in predicted et respectively thus changes of parameter b in mh had minimum effect on predicted et indicating greater stability of p m in et estimation by incorporating mh therefore using mh to model the response of gs to increased co2 when incorporated into p m to estimate et not only represents a more appropriate stomata physiological reaction to higher co2 but also results in a more accurate estimate of et and making the model more broadly applicable keywords stomatal conductance co2 concentration linear model hyperbolic model modified hyperbolic model evapotranspiration penman monteith 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important parameter in farmland irrigation management and an important part of the hydrologic cycle accurate estimation of et can help to increase the conservation of irrigation water and manage water resources in a river basin bastiaanssen et al 2005 kang et al 2003 among many models that estimate et a combination method called the penman monteith p m model monteith 1965 which schematizes the vegetation cover as a single big leaf at a certain height has been widely used both in farmland et estimation li et al 2014 tanasijevic et al 2014 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 and in regional hydrological models arnold et al 1998 liang et al 1994 1996 because of its simple form and easy parameterization canopy conductance gc in p m represents the conductance of water vapor through the stomata through the entire canopy and from the interior of the soil to the soil surface it is an important parameter for the estimation of et allen et al 1998 jiang et al 2016 monteith 1965 hypothesized that gc was the product of maximum stomatal conductance gsmax and effective leaf area index laiactive based on monteith s work jarvis 1976 introduced a multi environment factor multiplication model and created a canopy conductance model jarvis model which has since been widely used stewart 1988 li et al 2014 lhomme et al 1998 zhang et al 2008 noilhan and planton 1989 in the jarvis model the environmental factors include net radiation rn temperature t water vapor pressure deficit vpd soil water content θ and co2 concentration the jarvis model performed under the hypothesis that the influence of all the factors are without any synergistic interactions jarvis 1976 when the time period is short the change in atmospheric co2 concentration is very small and is generally ignored li et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 however in recent years the atmospheric concentration of co2 has increased because of global climate change ipcc 2013 which has both directly and indirectly affected agriculture and hydrology by decreasing stomatal conductance gs morison 1998 increasing plant height and leaf area kang et al 2002 as well as changing drought and flood extrame patterns piao et al 2010 as a result more researchers are involving in the fundamental field of how the gs responds to changes in co2 concentration and applying the theories in analyses of crop et yield and watershed runoff under present and future climate change scenarios niu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2012 the relationship between gs and atmospheric co2 concentration has been well documented for example jarvis 1976 used a piecewise linear function to represent the relationship between them he concluded that when the co2 concentration is between 100 and 1000 μmol mol 1 the gs decreased linearly as the co2 concentration increased and when the co2 concentration is 100 μmol mol 1 or 1000 μmol mol 1 the gs was constant morison 1987 found a 40 decrease in gs when the co2 concentration was doubled from 330 to 660 μmol mol 1 which was introduced to a linear expression to model the gs co2 relationship in the erosion productivity impact calculator model epic easterling et al 1992 morison and gifford 1983 fitted the gs co2 curves by quadratic functions in two c3 and two c4 species under different leaf air vapor pressures ball et al 1987 proposed an empirical mechanistic model to simulate the relationship between gs and co2 concentration which was called ball berry stomatal conductance model ball et al 1987 collatz et al 1991 their model included the photosynthetic rate pn which is significant because it includes plant physiology in the model wang and wen 2010 found that the rate of decrease of gs gradually lessened as the co2 concentration increased they analyzed the response of gs to changes in atmospheric co2 concentration based on the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of stomatal activity and produced a hyperbolic model for the response of gs to changes in co2 concentration this model was validated using nine species of plants but there are still some issues about those relationships mentioned above even though the linear relationship by easterling et al 1992 is the most commonly used model for estimating the effect of increased co2 concentration on et using the p m model and has since been used in the soil and water assessment tool swat and the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 neitsch et al 2005 niu et al 2013 its accuracy has not been verified furthermore there were no estimates when co2 concentration was 660 μmol mol 1 so the reliability of using this linear model to estimate et under higher co2 concentrations is unknown in the ball berry model ball et al 1987 collatz et al 1991 pn is calculated differently and the calculation is complex so the ball berry model has not been applied into the p m model to estimate the effect of increased co2 concentration on et the hyperbolic model of wang and wen 2010 includes physiological parameters and provides accurate estimates of gs within nine plant species but there is no research incorporating this model into p m to estimate et responses to increased co2 concentration therefore it is important and necessary to validate the accuracy and reliability of these models when applying them into p m to estimate et especially when the co2 concentration is higher than 660 μmol mol 1 to find the best physiological and theoretic gs co2 relationships for estimating et under climate change the objective of this study is to obtain an optimal model of the gs co2 relationship that is theoretically valid and that represents changes in plant physiological activity in response to higher co2 concentrations so as to improve the accuracy and reliability of the estimate of et by p m when atmospheric co2 concentration increases therefore in this study the empirical parameters in the gs co2 models were calibrated using the gs and co2 data collected from 50 representative journal articles and the least square method the different model predictions were validated using the gs and et data derived under different co2 concentrations in the two year experiment this allows us to compare the accuracy of the gs and et estimated by the empirical models with the observed gs and et under increased atmospheric co2 concentration as well as with the estimated et by p m model without taking the stomatal response to co2 into account as each of the models was incorporated into p m sensitivity analysis will enable us to determine the stability of the models 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and design the experiment was conducted in the periods may september 2015 and april july 2016 in a climatic phytotron at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e altitude 1581 m the climatic phytotron consisted of four separate chambers each with dimensions 3 m length 4 m width 2 5 m height the chambers were equipped identically daily computer controlled adjustments to the environmental conditions were made every 2 h in the period 8 00 h to 20 00 h the temperature and humidity were adjusted every 10 days according to the 10 day averages of observed data from april to september that had been gathered at the experimental station over the previous six years the experiment used natural light the co2 concentrations in the chambers were supplemented by co2 gas cylinders and monitored by co2 gas analyzers there were four co2 concentrations respectively in four chambers in 2015 400 550 700 and 900 µmol mol 1 and three co2 concentrations respectively in three chambers in 2016 400 550 and 700 µmol mol 1 more details of the indoor equipment and the control principles were described by li et al 2018 the crop used in the experiment was a field grown maize cultivar zea mays l cultivar qiangsheng 51 c4 which was planted in plastic pots of height 26 5 cm bottom diameter 21 cm and top diameter 33 cm each chamber had twelve pots as the trial replicates initially three seeds were sown in each plastic pot and one seedling was retained after emergence the experiment was conducted in the phytotron during the period from the date of sowing may 7 in 2015 and april 22 in 2016 to the end of the experiment september 16 in 2015 and july 31 in 2016 stones were spread over the bottom of each pot with fine sand to act as a filtration layer the pots were filled with local sandy loam soil that had been air dried crushed and sieved each pot contained 18 kg soil with dry bulk density of 1 38 g cm 3 field water capacity of 0 27 cm3 cm 3 and wilting point of 0 10 cm3 cm 3 the surface of the soil was then covered with fine sand and nutritive soil to reduce the impact of irrigation on the topsoil structure the pots were weighed every 3 4 days by high precision weighing scales to determine the required amount of irrigation water and the irrigation water was measured in graduated cylinders the average irrigation water amounts of maize under different co2 concentrations were 528 400 µmol mol 1 455 550 µmol mol 1 445 700 µmol mol 1 and 464 900 µmol mol 1 mm in 2015 and 415 400 µmol mol 1 355 550 µmol mol 1 and 333 700 µmol mol 1 mm in 2016 respectively the amount of fertilizer used for each pot was the same during the growth period each pot was fertilized with 1 5 g urea and 1 5 g diammonium phosphate on five occasions in 2015 and with 0 85 g urea and 0 85 g diammonium phosphate on three occasions in 2016 a foliar spray of 250 ml potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution at a concentration of 2 was administered to each plant five times in 2015 and three times in 2016 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological data and co2 concentration the conventional meteorological data in each chamber such as photosynthetically active radiation par air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed u were monitored and recorded by a portable automatic weather station hobo u30 onset computer corp usa and a multi functional automatic anemometer velocicalc 9565 tsi inc usa at 30 minute intervals the daily average values of meteorological data for the chambers during the experiment are shown in fig 1 the co2 concentrations were monitored and recorded by the co2 gas sensors installed in the chambers at 1 second intervals 2 2 2 soil moisture content soil moisture content θ was measured and recorded by the sensors of portable automatic weather stations hobo s smd m005 onset computer corp usa the observed soil moisture content was calibrated using the oven dried method astm d2216 1998 before the start of the experiment 2 2 3 crop height and leaf area index after the emergence of the maize six plants representative of each treatment were randomly selected to measure leaf length maximum leaf width and plant height a steel tape graduated in cm was used and observations were made every seven to ten days the leaf area of an individual leaf was calculated as leaf length multiplied by the maximum leaf width and then multiplied by a scaling factor of 0 74 li et al 2014 the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 was defined as the ratio of the total leaf area of one plant to the surface area of the soil in the plastic pot 2 2 4 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was calculated using the water balance method since the maize plants were grown in pots in the chambers there was no need to consider precipitation surface runoff or groundwater supply a tray was placed below every pot to collect drainage or leakage water but no drainage or leakage from the pots was observed thus the water balance equation can be simplified to the following 1 et i δ w where et is crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 i is the irrigation amount mm d 1 and δw is the difference between two weighings mm d 1 2 2 5 stomatal conductance the stomatal conductance of water vapor diffusion gs from the maize leaves was measured using an li 6400 photosynthesis system li cor inc usa the second leaves of each of six representative plants that were undergoing the same treatment were randomly selected for measurement the gs of each selected leaf was recorded at two hour intervals from 8 00 h to 18 00 h on july 10 july 17 and august 15 in 2015 and june 12 june 15 june 17 june 21 and june 23 in 2016 the maximum gs gsmax values of each treatment were used to validate the three different relationships of stomatal conductance and co2 concentrations 2 3 data collection fifty representative journal articles concerning the effect of elevated co2 concentration on crop stomatal conductance were selected to collect the gs data with corresponding co2 concentrations the maximum values of gs data within each literature were chosen to be gs max with the presumption that the environmental conditions were optimal i e f rn f t f vpd f θ 1 in the eq 4b described in section 2 4 2 the articles were published in the years 1971 2016 and the co2 concentrations ranged from 100 to 1800 μmol mol

and discussion 3 1 relationship between stomatal conductance and co2 concentration in the jarvis canopy conductance model eq 4 we can see that the gc was calculated by gs max ref and modified by laiactive and some environmental variables i e rn t vpd θ and co2 in other words the submodels are used to modify gs max ref so if we know the gs max ref at the reference co2 concentration and the equations of the submodels we can know exactly the gc part since the environmental variable submodels except co2 have been known well noilhan and planton 1989 chen and dudhia 2001 we would like to look at the relationship between gs max and co2 in eq 11 fig 2 shows the changes in gs max with the increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations as observed in the experiments in 2015 and 2016 and in the works cited in the appendix it can be seen from fig 2a that gs max as observed in the two year experiment decreases as the co2 concentration increases and that the reduction rate of gs max i e the slope on the curve gradually lessens as the co2 concentration increases in order to supplement the amount of the experimental data and thereby increase the credibility of the research results we investigated large amount of literatures and carefully selected 50 papers that examined the influence of elevated co2 concentration on stomatal conductance and then we selected 20 of them in which at least three co2 concentration gradients were considered for the purpose to exactly draw the gs max and co2 trend lines the changes in gs max with the increases in co2 concentrations in these works are shown in fig 2b fig 2b shows that all the gs max decreases as the co2 concentration increases the magnitude of gs max varies widely among the cited works for example some show very steep decline as co2 concentration increases whereas other studies show a much smaller response however the most important indication is that the relationship between gs max and co2 concentration is not a simple linear one but that the data are better fitted with a nonlinear curve this observation is consistent with the early results of health and russell 1954 whose study showed a nonlinear response between gs and co2 concentration morison and gifford 1983 who used a quadratic curve to fit the gs co2 relationship and wang and wen 2010 who used a hyperbolic curve to represent the relationship between gs and co2 concentration the widely ranged values of gs max are because of the different crop species e g maize wheat sorghum cotton rice barley sugarcane soybean etc and the growth conditions e g growth chambers gc free air co2 enrichment experiment face open top chambers otc etc in order to examine these effects on gs max we plotted the data identifying the crop types and the growth conditions fig 2c and d it shows that gs max also has widely range in the magnitude and decline trend both for c3 and c4 types fig 2c as well as for gc face and otc conditions fig 2d so it can be concluded that the gs max co2 relationships in absolute values do not specifically and uniformly belong to any crop types or growth conditions which means there was no clear grouping of the stomatal responses to co2 with respect to crop type or treatment in the widely recognized theory of malate metabolism casati et al 1999 reckmann et al 1990 shi 1995 yu and wang 2010 which concerns the mechanism of stomatal movement photosynthesis changes the co2 concentration of mesophyll cells ci and eventually drives stomatal operation the effect of atmospheric co2 concentration on gs is mainly achieved by changing ci through influencing photosynthesis yu and wang 2010 the carbon fixation activity of rubisco one of the key enzymes responsible for photosynthesis is controlled by ci and the concentration of oxygen genkov et al 2010 wang and wen 2010 because the effect of co2 concentration on gs occurs as a biochemical reaction that is controlled by rubisco and because there is a nonlinear relationship between the rate of the biochemical reaction and ci farquhar et al 1980 the response of gs to changes in the co2 concentration is also nonlinear wang and wen 2010 3 2 calibration and validation of parameters in the three co2 dependent stomatal conductance submodels in order to calibrate and validate submodel parameters and to eliminate the influence of differences in magnitude in the values of gs max on model parameters also considering that the inputs and outputs in eqs 12 14 are relative values the data obtained from both the cited works and the experiments were converted to relative co2 concentrations co2 co2ref and relative maximum stomatal conductance gs max gs max ref as shown in fig 3 similar to fig 2 the relative values were also plotted identifying crop types c3 and c4 and growth conditions gc face and otc as shown in fig 3c and d it can be seen that for c3 and c4 crops the fitted decline trends curves are almost the same one as well as for gc face and otc conditions thus the relationships between gs max gs max ref and co2 co2ref are not affected by either crop types or growth conditions therefore by applying all the collected data fig 3b together into the least square method the values of cs0 305 μmol mol 1 and gs max p 0 018 m s 1 in eq 13 and b 0 663 in eq 14 were obtained the experimental gs max data and co2 concentrations in total 7 sets that were measured in 2015 and 2016 fig 3a were used to validate the three submodels the gs max gs max ref estimated by the linear model the hyperbolic model and the modified hyperbolic model are distinguished as gsl gsh and gsm respectively these values were compared with the measured relative maximum stomatal conductance gsa the results are shown in table 1 table 1 lists the linear regression coefficients b the coefficients of determination r2 the root mean square errors rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nse the fixed affinity indexes d and the akaike information criteria aic values obtained by regression analysis between the observed gsa and the estimated gsl gsh and gsm the table shows that the values of b for the relationships between gsl and gsa and between gsm and gsa 1 02 and 1 00 respectively are nearly the same and that the value of b for the relationship between gsh and gsa is the highest with a value of 1 22 of the other indicators the values of r2 nse and d 0 97 0 96 and 0 93 respectively for the relationship between gsm and gsa are the highest the values of r2 nse and d 0 65 0 21 and 0 49 respectively for the relationship between gsh and gsa are the lowest and the values of r2 nse and d 0 89 0 86 and 0 84 respectively for the relationship between gsl and gsa are intermediate the values of rmse and aic 0 03 and 47 48 respectively for the relationship between gsm and gsa are the lowest the values of rmse and aic 0 07 and 37 42 respectively for the relationship between gsh and gsa are the highest and the values of rmse and aic 0 06 and 38 10 respectively for the relationship between gsl and gsa are intermediate all these parameters show a consistent result in the three submodels the modified hyperbolic model is the most accurate and shows the best fit between estimated and observed data for gs followed by the linear model and the hyperbolic model increased co2 concentration undoubtedly has an effect on gs but scholars disagree in their understanding of the mathematical relationship between the two jarvis 1976 thought that gs decreased linearly with the increase in co2 concentration within the range 100 1000 μmol mol 1 morison and gifford 1983 used a quadratic function to represent the relationship between gs and co2 concentration within the range 200 800 μmol mol 1 since morison 1987 found that doubling the co2 concentration would result in a 40 decrease in gs within the range 330 660 μmol mol 1 easterling et al 1992 included that results in a linear model to represent the response of gs to change in co2 concentration in order to estimate the effect of increased co2 concentration on et the results of our study show that the response of gs to change in co2 concentration can be accurately approximated by a linear relationship within a limited range of co2 concentrations and within this range both the linear model and the modified hyperbolic model show a good fit for gs however when the co2 concentration is beyond this range the decrease in gs gradually lessens as the co2 concentration increases which shows a nonlinear relationship in this case the linear model will overestimate the effect of increasing co2 concentration on gs 3 3 comparison of observed et and et estimated by the penman monteith model without stomatal co2 response the comparison of the observed et eta and estimated et etr by p m model without stomatal co2 response i e f co2 1 was shown in table 2 and fig 4 in fig 4 it shows that the estimated etr was not good it was higher than the observed eta when taking no account of the co2 concentration effect on gs especially under the high co2 concentrations e g 550 700 and 900 µmol mol 1 and the higher the co2 concentration the larger the estimation error was between eta and etr the estimation errors were respectively 4 400 µmol mol 1 9 550 µmol mol 1 10 700 µmol mol 1 and 8 900 µmol mol 1 that was because gs decreases with the elevation of co2 concentration and there is a positive relationship between et and gs without the response of gs to co2 concentration the etr by p m model would be overestimated when compared with eta and the estimation errors would be more and more obvious along with the elevation of co2 concentration when the effect of co2 concentration on gs increases therefore when estimating et by p m model under elevated co2 concentration it is important and necessary to incorporate the proper gs co2 submodel to improve the estimation accuracy of et 3 4 comparison of observed et and et estimated by the penman monteith model using three co2 dependent stomatal conductance submodels from the linear regression coefficients of the relationship between observed et eta and estimated et using the linear model etl the hyperbolic model eth and the modified hyperbolic model etm which are shown in table 2 and fig 5 it can be seen that the hyperbolic model overestimated et for all four co2 concentrations fig 5b e h and k when the co2 concentration was no more than 550 μmol mol 1 eth and etr had similar estimation results with the close values of r2 rmse nse d and aic when the co2 concentration was higher than 550 μmol mol 1 the accuracy of eth by the hyperbolic model was improved when compared with etr which was estimated without the co2 concentration effect and all the above five evaluation parameters of eth had an advantage over that of etr table 2 in table 2 it shows that the estimation accuracies of et by linear model and modified hyperbolic model were higher than that by hyperbolic model and without co2 concentration effect when the co2 concentration was 400 and 550 μmol mol 1 etl and etm also overestimated eta to some degree the estimation errors were respectively 2 5 and 1 9 400 μmol mol 1 and 4 7 and 4 3 550 μmol mol 1 but all better than eth and etr when the co2 concentration was 700 μmol mol 1 etl and etm gave reasonably accurate estimates of eta with errors of 0 6 and 0 9 respectively when the co2 concentration was 900 μmol mol 1 etl significantly underestimated eta while etm gave a reasonably accurate estimate of eta with errors of 9 7 and 1 4 respectively when the co2 concentration was less than 900 μmol mol 1 although etl and etm were more accurate in estimating eta the values of r2 nse and d for the relationship between etm and eta were larger than those for the relationship between etl and eta and the values of rmse and aic for the relationship between etm and eta were smaller than those for the relationship between etl and eta the evaluation indicators r2 rmse nse d and aic for the relationship between etr and eta as well as eth and eta were the worst table 2 thus the modified hyperbolic model gave the best estimation of eta when the co2 concentration was 900 μmol mol 1 etl gave the worst estimate of eta and the evaluation indicators showed the worst performance which was similar with that of etr the models of eth and etm gave better estimates of eta but the values of r2 nse and d for the relationship between etm and eta were the largest and the values of rmse and aic were the smallest thus the modified hyperbolic model was still the best model and gave the most accurate estimate of et when the co2 concentration was higher because the exact fitting of gs played an important role in the estimation of et by p m the hyperbolic model performed consistently worse in the estimation of gs and et than either the linear model or the modified hyperbolic model the hyperbolic model only considered the relationship between the absolute co2 concentration and the absolute gs which is highly dependent on crop species the potential maximum gs gs max p and the parameter cs0 in eq 13 were empirical values which were highly dependent on the original data namely if the calibration data set changed the gs max p and cs0 would also like to change the gs values found in the different literature sources were often quite different which can significantly influence the calibration process for gs max p and cs0 thus the hyperbolic model may not be suitable for et estimation by p m if atmospheric co2 concentration increases in order to eliminate the influence of the absolute gs value on the accuracy of the model the concepts of relative gs max gs max gs max ref and relative co2 concentration co2 co2ref were introduced into the original hyperbolic model in a way that was consistent with the parameters of the linear model a comparison between figs 3b and 2b also shows that the introduction of the relative values can improve the response of gs to the decreased impact of higher co2 concentration with more concentrated data points and more stable calibrated empirical parameters in the model those who using the model only need to set the reference co2 concentration which is already known and a value of maximum stomatal conductance which is species dependent at the specific co2 concentration in order to accurately simulate et since other empirical parameters are stable the modified hyperbolic model has simplified the gs co2 model and is easier to be applied when co2 co2ref 2 the linear model and the modified hyperbolic model both gave basically the same estimate of et table 2 and fig 5 therefore the response of gs to co2 concentration was approximated as a linear relationship when co2 co2ref 2 this verified the gs co2 linear pattern applied in the study of easterling et al 1992 in which the response of gs to co2 concentration was linear in an absolute range of 330 660 μmol mol 1 however jarvis 1976 overestimated the co2 concentration range for this linear response in our paper we have overcome the limitation of the absolute range by considering that the approximate linear response of gs to co2 concentration will occur within a relative range i e co2 co2ref 2 in this situation the estimates of et by the linear model and by the modified hyperbolic model were close to one another but the modified hyperbolic model was more accurate and the estimate was better when co2 co2ref 2 the linear model overestimated the effect of increased co2 concentration on gs especially at 900 μmol mol 1 co2 co2ref 2 727 when the value of etl was much less than that of eta but the accuracy of etm was much better than that of etl these results illustrate that the modified hyperbolic model can better estimate the effect of increased co2 concentration on gs the results are consistent with that of section 3 2 based on the comprehensive analysis of the three different gs co2 submodels it is found that when incorporating these models into p m to estimate et under increased co2 concentrations the factor having most impact on the estimate of et was not the absolute co2 concentration level but the relative co2 concentration level which provides a more accurate estimate of et when the relative co2 concentration 2 12 i e 700 μmol mol 1 the linear model and the modified hyperbolic model showed no significant difference in et estimation but when the relative co2 concentration 2 12 using the modified hyperbolic model in p m can give a more precise and accurate result and it performs good at all co2 concentration levels in this research since the highest co2 concentration in our research is 900 μmol mol 1 the modified model is applicable within this range because the predicted co2 concentration is 936 μmol mol 1 under rcp8 5 climate change scenario and 900 μmol mol 1 is within this range the modified model is applicable under all the projected climate change scenarios in estimation of et and other hydrologic variables 3 5 sensitivity analysis of the penman monteith model to different parameters for estimating evapotranspiration in order to analyze the sensitivity of p m to the empirical parameters in the three gs co2 submodels when estimating et the parameters were changed by 40 and 20 and then the percentage change in predicted et was calculated the results are shown in table 3 which shows that et increased as p and b decreased and gs max p and cs0 increased and that et decreased as p and b increased and gs max p and cs0 decreased p m showed different sensitivities to the different empirical parameters for the et estimation change in the parameter b in the modified hyperbolic model had the least influence on et when values of b were changed by 40 20 20 and 40 et changed only by 1 87 0 92 0 89 and 1 75 2015 and 3 22 1 57 1 50 and 2 94 2016 the influences of the other parameters on et are greater as their percentages change the sensitivity analysis results in table 3 show that changes in the empirical parameters of the linear model and the hyperbolic model had greater influence on et and the changes in the estimate values had increased uncertainty as the empirical parameters changed when the modified hyperbolic model was incorporated into p m to estimate et under increased co2 concentrations changes in the empirical parameter b had little influence on estimated et showing this to be the most stable model and that it had wide applicability in this paper the p value 0 4 was selected because it was the most commonly used value in the literature that we analyzed using this value when the co2 concentration doubled gs decreased by 40 this value of p has been used by most scholars and is applied in different scientific research easterling et al 1992 neitsch et al 2005 niu et al 2013 wu et al 2012 zheng and peng 2001 analyzed a large quantity of research and derived a p value of 0 3 but this value has not been adopted by other scholars the use of gs data from different literature sources different amounts and different crops would result in different calibration values of b gs max p and cs0 in this paper we comprehensively analyzed a large number of papers published over a long time period which included data for most c3 and c4 crops co2 concentrations ranged from 100 to 1800 µmol mol 1 and the experimental environment involved open and closed equipment and pot and field experiments in this case the calibrated value of b provides a good fit for the nonlinear relationship between gs and the co2 concentration and thus provide a better estimate of et using p m the results are broadly representative and widely applicable the modified model provides an easier way to estimate et when co2 concentration increases in the future and our work also filled the gap where there is no validation of et estimated by p m model involving the stomatal co2 relationship but there are still some limitations in our research we only used pot experiment data to validate the parameters and models however we thought they are broadly applicable because the parameters in the models were calibrated using the data from many literatures which included both pot and field experiment data but further validation researches with field experiment data are also needed in the future carbon dioxide enrichment can affect not only stomatal conductance but also crop growth for example leaf area index lai and crop height h we already have considered that in our study the only thing is the lai and h data were measured in the experiment but not simulated using lai h co2 models that was because we only have the lai h data from our experiment but don t have the lai h data from the literatures which is hard to collect from the beginning to the end of the growth period and most literatures don t provide all the data but we will consider improving the lai h co2 model in our future s research another limitation of our work is that we only validated the models for c4 crop which was planted in growth chambers but not for c3 crop or other crops that grown in the field we will conduct such experiments in the future to improve our work 4 conclusions in this paper the gs and co2 concentration data obtained from the two year maize experiment and 50 published papers were analyzed the results that gs decreased and that the reduction rate gradually lessened as co2 concentration increased were obtained by comparing the estimated gs and et from the three gs co2 models the linear model the hyperbolic model and the modified hyperbolic model with the observed data it can be concluded that the modified hyperbolic model provides the best estimates both in gs and et under all levels of co2 concentrations with the largest values of r2 nse and d and the smallest values of rmse and aic followed in decreasing level of accuracy by the linear model and the hyperbolic model furthermore the modified hyperbolic model was more stable and reliable with the smallest changes in estimated et 3 when the empirical parameters changed 40 and 20 therefore when estimating et with p m for increased atmospheric co2 concentrations the inclusion of the modified hyperbolic gs co2 submodel not only recognizes resultant changes in stomata physiological responses but also makes the estimate more accurate more reliable and more widely representative and thus gives it greater applicability declaration of interests none acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the careful reviews and valuable

6617,an increase in atmospheric co2 concentration co2 affects stomatal conductance gs since gs is an important parameter in the penman monteith model p m an accurate estimate of gs can improve the accuracy of the estimation of evapotranspiration et by p m when co2 increases this paper identifies three models of the relationship between gs and co2 the linear model l the hyperbolic model h and the modified hyperbolic model mh and compares their estimations of et when they are incorporated into p m a two year experiment which included four levels 400 550 700 and 900 μmol mol 1 and three levels 400 550 and 700 μmol mol 1 of co2 in 2015 and 2016 respectively was conducted in order to obtain validation data fifty papers that had studied the effect of increased co2 on gs over a 45 year period were analyzed to obtain calibration data after being calibrated and validated each of the three models was in turn included as a component of p m to estimate et under increased co2 followed by the comparison between estimated and observed et the sensitivity of p m to the parameters in three models was also analyzed our results show that gs decreased and the reduction rate gradually lessened as co2 increased of the three models mh gave the best estimate of gs having the largest values of the coefficient of determination r 2 0 97 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 0 96 and the modified affinity index d 0 93 and the smallest values of the root mean square error rmse 0 03 and the akaike information criterion aic 47 48 each of the three models gave different et results for different levels of co2 when used as a component of p m the mh had better et estimations than l and h when compared to observed et across all co2 concentration levels with the highest r2 nse and d and the lowest rmse and aic the sensitivity of p m to the empirical parameters varied among the three models for instance 40 and 20 changes of parameter p in l gs max p and cs 0 in h and b in mh resulted in 15 to 4 13 to 7 9 to 4 and 3 to 3 changes in predicted et respectively thus changes of parameter b in mh had minimum effect on predicted et indicating greater stability of p m in et estimation by incorporating mh therefore using mh to model the response of gs to increased co2 when incorporated into p m to estimate et not only represents a more appropriate stomata physiological reaction to higher co2 but also results in a more accurate estimate of et and making the model more broadly applicable keywords stomatal conductance co2 concentration linear model hyperbolic model modified hyperbolic model evapotranspiration penman monteith 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important parameter in farmland irrigation management and an important part of the hydrologic cycle accurate estimation of et can help to increase the conservation of irrigation water and manage water resources in a river basin bastiaanssen et al 2005 kang et al 2003 among many models that estimate et a combination method called the penman monteith p m model monteith 1965 which schematizes the vegetation cover as a single big leaf at a certain height has been widely used both in farmland et estimation li et al 2014 tanasijevic et al 2014 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 and in regional hydrological models arnold et al 1998 liang et al 1994 1996 because of its simple form and easy parameterization canopy conductance gc in p m represents the conductance of water vapor through the stomata through the entire canopy and from the interior of the soil to the soil surface it is an important parameter for the estimation of et allen et al 1998 jiang et al 2016 monteith 1965 hypothesized that gc was the product of maximum stomatal conductance gsmax and effective leaf area index laiactive based on monteith s work jarvis 1976 introduced a multi environment factor multiplication model and created a canopy conductance model jarvis model which has since been widely used stewart 1988 li et al 2014 lhomme et al 1998 zhang et al 2008 noilhan and planton 1989 in the jarvis model the environmental factors include net radiation rn temperature t water vapor pressure deficit vpd soil water content θ and co2 concentration the jarvis model performed under the hypothesis that the influence of all the factors are without any synergistic interactions jarvis 1976 when the time period is short the change in atmospheric co2 concentration is very small and is generally ignored li et al 2014 zhang et al 2008 however in recent years the atmospheric concentration of co2 has increased because of global climate change ipcc 2013 which has both directly and indirectly affected agriculture and hydrology by decreasing stomatal conductance gs morison 1998 increasing plant height and leaf area kang et al 2002 as well as changing drought and flood extrame patterns piao et al 2010 as a result more researchers are involving in the fundamental field of how the gs responds to changes in co2 concentration and applying the theories in analyses of crop et yield and watershed runoff under present and future climate change scenarios niu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2012 the relationship between gs and atmospheric co2 concentration has been well documented for example jarvis 1976 used a piecewise linear function to represent the relationship between them he concluded that when the co2 concentration is between 100 and 1000 μmol mol 1 the gs decreased linearly as the co2 concentration increased and when the co2 concentration is 100 μmol mol 1 or 1000 μmol mol 1 the gs was constant morison 1987 found a 40 decrease in gs when the co2 concentration was doubled from 330 to 660 μmol mol 1 which was introduced to a linear expression to model the gs co2 relationship in the erosion productivity impact calculator model epic easterling et al 1992 morison and gifford 1983 fitted the gs co2 curves by quadratic functions in two c3 and two c4 species under different leaf air vapor pressures ball et al 1987 proposed an empirical mechanistic model to simulate the relationship between gs and co2 concentration which was called ball berry stomatal conductance model ball et al 1987 collatz et al 1991 their model included the photosynthetic rate pn which is significant because it includes plant physiology in the model wang and wen 2010 found that the rate of decrease of gs gradually lessened as the co2 concentration increased they analyzed the response of gs to changes in atmospheric co2 concentration based on the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of stomatal activity and produced a hyperbolic model for the response of gs to changes in co2 concentration this model was validated using nine species of plants but there are still some issues about those relationships mentioned above even though the linear relationship by easterling et al 1992 is the most commonly used model for estimating the effect of increased co2 concentration on et using the p m model and has since been used in the soil and water assessment tool swat and the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 neitsch et al 2005 niu et al 2013 its accuracy has not been verified furthermore there were no estimates when co2 concentration was 660 μmol mol 1 so the reliability of using this linear model to estimate et under higher co2 concentrations is unknown in the ball berry model ball et al 1987 collatz et al 1991 pn is calculated differently and the calculation is complex so the ball berry model has not been applied into the p m model to estimate the effect of increased co2 concentration on et the hyperbolic model of wang and wen 2010 includes physiological parameters and provides accurate estimates of gs within nine plant species but there is no research incorporating this model into p m to estimate et responses to increased co2 concentration therefore it is important and necessary to validate the accuracy and reliability of these models when applying them into p m to estimate et especially when the co2 concentration is higher than 660 μmol mol 1 to find the best physiological and theoretic gs co2 relationships for estimating et under climate change the objective of this study is to obtain an optimal model of the gs co2 relationship that is theoretically valid and that represents changes in plant physiological activity in response to higher co2 concentrations so as to improve the accuracy and reliability of the estimate of et by p m when atmospheric co2 concentration increases therefore in this study the empirical parameters in the gs co2 models were calibrated using the gs and co2 data collected from 50 representative journal articles and the least square method the different model predictions were validated using the gs and et data derived under different co2 concentrations in the two year experiment this allows us to compare the accuracy of the gs and et estimated by the empirical models with the observed gs and et under increased atmospheric co2 concentration as well as with the estimated et by p m model without taking the stomatal response to co2 into account as each of the models was incorporated into p m sensitivity analysis will enable us to determine the stability of the models 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and design the experiment was conducted in the periods may september 2015 and april july 2016 in a climatic phytotron at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e altitude 1581 m the climatic phytotron consisted of four separate chambers each with dimensions 3 m length 4 m width 2 5 m height the chambers were equipped identically daily computer controlled adjustments to the environmental conditions were made every 2 h in the period 8 00 h to 20 00 h the temperature and humidity were adjusted every 10 days according to the 10 day averages of observed data from april to september that had been gathered at the experimental station over the previous six years the experiment used natural light the co2 concentrations in the chambers were supplemented by co2 gas cylinders and monitored by co2 gas analyzers there were four co2 concentrations respectively in four chambers in 2015 400 550 700 and 900 µmol mol 1 and three co2 concentrations respectively in three chambers in 2016 400 550 and 700 µmol mol 1 more details of the indoor equipment and the control principles were described by li et al 2018 the crop used in the experiment was a field grown maize cultivar zea mays l cultivar qiangsheng 51 c4 which was planted in plastic pots of height 26 5 cm bottom diameter 21 cm and top diameter 33 cm each chamber had twelve pots as the trial replicates initially three seeds were sown in each plastic pot and one seedling was retained after emergence the experiment was conducted in the phytotron during the period from the date of sowing may 7 in 2015 and april 22 in 2016 to the end of the experiment september 16 in 2015 and july 31 in 2016 stones were spread over the bottom of each pot with fine sand to act as a filtration layer the pots were filled with local sandy loam soil that had been air dried crushed and sieved each pot contained 18 kg soil with dry bulk density of 1 38 g cm 3 field water capacity of 0 27 cm3 cm 3 and wilting point of 0 10 cm3 cm 3 the surface of the soil was then covered with fine sand and nutritive soil to reduce the impact of irrigation on the topsoil structure the pots were weighed every 3 4 days by high precision weighing scales to determine the required amount of irrigation water and the irrigation water was measured in graduated cylinders the average irrigation water amounts of maize under different co2 concentrations were 528 400 µmol mol 1 455 550 µmol mol 1 445 700 µmol mol 1 and 464 900 µmol mol 1 mm in 2015 and 415 400 µmol mol 1 355 550 µmol mol 1 and 333 700 µmol mol 1 mm in 2016 respectively the amount of fertilizer used for each pot was the same during the growth period each pot was fertilized with 1 5 g urea and 1 5 g diammonium phosphate on five occasions in 2015 and with 0 85 g urea and 0 85 g diammonium phosphate on three occasions in 2016 a foliar spray of 250 ml potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution at a concentration of 2 was administered to each plant five times in 2015 and three times in 2016 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological data and co2 concentration the conventional meteorological data in each chamber such as photosynthetically active radiation par air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed u were monitored and recorded by a portable automatic weather station hobo u30 onset computer corp usa and a multi functional automatic anemometer velocicalc 9565 tsi inc usa at 30 minute intervals the daily average values of meteorological data for the chambers during the experiment are shown in fig 1 the co2 concentrations were monitored and recorded by the co2 gas sensors installed in the chambers at 1 second intervals 2 2 2 soil moisture content soil moisture content θ was measured and recorded by the sensors of portable automatic weather stations hobo s smd m005 onset computer corp usa the observed soil moisture content was calibrated using the oven dried method astm d2216 1998 before the start of the experiment 2 2 3 crop height and leaf area index after the emergence of the maize six plants representative of each treatment were randomly selected to measure leaf length maximum leaf width and plant height a steel tape graduated in cm was used and observations were made every seven to ten days the leaf area of an individual leaf was calculated as leaf length multiplied by the maximum leaf width and then multiplied by a scaling factor of 0 74 li et al 2014 the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 was defined as the ratio of the total leaf area of one plant to the surface area of the soil in the plastic pot 2 2 4 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was calculated using the water balance method since the maize plants were grown in pots in the chambers there was no need to consider precipitation surface runoff or groundwater supply a tray was placed below every pot to collect drainage or leakage water but no drainage or leakage from the pots was observed thus the water balance equation can be simplified to the following 1 et i δ w where et is crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 i is the irrigation amount mm d 1 and δw is the difference between two weighings mm d 1 2 2 5 stomatal conductance the stomatal conductance of water vapor diffusion gs from the maize leaves was measured using an li 6400 photosynthesis system li cor inc usa the second leaves of each of six representative plants that were undergoing the same treatment were randomly selected for measurement the gs of each selected leaf was recorded at two hour intervals from 8 00 h to 18 00 h on july 10 july 17 and august 15 in 2015 and june 12 june 15 june 17 june 21 and june 23 in 2016 the maximum gs gsmax values of each treatment were used to validate the three different relationships of stomatal conductance and co2 concentrations 2 3 data collection fifty representative journal articles concerning the effect of elevated co2 concentration on crop stomatal conductance were selected to collect the gs data with corresponding co2 concentrations the maximum values of gs data within each literature were chosen to be gs max with the presumption that the environmental conditions were optimal i e f rn f t f vpd f θ 1 in the eq 4b described in section 2 4 2 the articles were published in the years 1971 2016 and the co2 concentrations ranged from 100 to 1800 μmol mol

and discussion 3 1 relationship between stomatal conductance and co2 concentration in the jarvis canopy conductance model eq 4 we can see that the gc was calculated by gs max ref and modified by laiactive and some environmental variables i e rn t vpd θ and co2 in other words the submodels are used to modify gs max ref so if we know the gs max ref at the reference co2 concentration and the equations of the submodels we can know exactly the gc part since the environmental variable submodels except co2 have been known well noilhan and planton 1989 chen and dudhia 2001 we would like to look at the relationship between gs max and co2 in eq 11 fig 2 shows the changes in gs max with the increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations as observed in the experiments in 2015 and 2016 and in the works cited in the appendix it can be seen from fig 2a that gs max as observed in the two year experiment decreases as the co2 concentration increases and that the reduction rate of gs max i e the slope on the curve gradually lessens as the co2 concentration increases in order to supplement the amount of the experimental data and thereby increase the credibility of the research results we investigated large amount of literatures and carefully selected 50 papers that examined the influence of elevated co2 concentration on stomatal conductance and then we selected 20 of them in which at least three co2 concentration gradients were considered for the purpose to exactly draw the gs max and co2 trend lines the changes in gs max with the increases in co2 concentrations in these works are shown in fig 2b fig 2b shows that all the gs max decreases as the co2 concentration increases the magnitude of gs max varies widely among the cited works for example some show very steep decline as co2 concentration increases whereas other studies show a much smaller response however the most important indication is that the relationship between gs max and co2 concentration is not a simple linear one but that the data are better fitted with a nonlinear curve this observation is consistent with the early results of health and russell 1954 whose study showed a nonlinear response between gs and co2 concentration morison and gifford 1983 who used a quadratic curve to fit the gs co2 relationship and wang and wen 2010 who used a hyperbolic curve to represent the relationship between gs and co2 concentration the widely ranged values of gs max are because of the different crop species e g maize wheat sorghum cotton rice barley sugarcane soybean etc and the growth conditions e g growth chambers gc free air co2 enrichment experiment face open top chambers otc etc in order to examine these effects on gs max we plotted the data identifying the crop types and the growth conditions fig 2c and d it shows that gs max also has widely range in the magnitude and decline trend both for c3 and c4 types fig 2c as well as for gc face and otc conditions fig 2d so it can be concluded that the gs max co2 relationships in absolute values do not specifically and uniformly belong to any crop types or growth conditions which means there was no clear grouping of the stomatal responses to co2 with respect to crop type or treatment in the widely recognized theory of malate metabolism casati et al 1999 reckmann et al 1990 shi 1995 yu and wang 2010 which concerns the mechanism of stomatal movement photosynthesis changes the co2 concentration of mesophyll cells ci and eventually drives stomatal operation the effect of atmospheric co2 concentration on gs is mainly achieved by changing ci through influencing photosynthesis yu and wang 2010 the carbon fixation activity of rubisco one of the key enzymes responsible for photosynthesis is controlled by ci and the concentration of oxygen genkov et al 2010 wang and wen 2010 because the effect of co2 concentration on gs occurs as a biochemical reaction that is controlled by rubisco and because there is a nonlinear relationship between the rate of the biochemical reaction and ci farquhar et al 1980 the response of gs to changes in the co2 concentration is also nonlinear wang and wen 2010 3 2 calibration and validation of parameters in the three co2 dependent stomatal conductance submodels in order to calibrate and validate submodel parameters and to eliminate the influence of differences in magnitude in the values of gs max on model parameters also considering that the inputs and outputs in eqs 12 14 are relative values the data obtained from both the cited works and the experiments were converted to relative co2 concentrations co2 co2ref and relative maximum stomatal conductance gs max gs max ref as shown in fig 3 similar to fig 2 the relative values were also plotted identifying crop types c3 and c4 and growth conditions gc face and otc as shown in fig 3c and d it can be seen that for c3 and c4 crops the fitted decline trends curves are almost the same one as well as for gc face and otc conditions thus the relationships between gs max gs max ref and co2 co2ref are not affected by either crop types or growth conditions therefore by applying all the collected data fig 3b together into the least square method the values of cs0 305 μmol mol 1 and gs max p 0 018 m s 1 in eq 13 and b 0 663 in eq 14 were obtained the experimental gs max data and co2 concentrations in total 7 sets that were measured in 2015 and 2016 fig 3a were used to validate the three submodels the gs max gs max ref estimated by the linear model the hyperbolic model and the modified hyperbolic model are distinguished as gsl gsh and gsm respectively these values were compared with the measured relative maximum stomatal conductance gsa the results are shown in table 1 table 1 lists the linear regression coefficients b the coefficients of determination r2 the root mean square errors rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nse the fixed affinity indexes d and the akaike information criteria aic values obtained by regression analysis between the observed gsa and the estimated gsl gsh and gsm the table shows that the values of b for the relationships between gsl and gsa and between gsm and gsa 1 02 and 1 00 respectively are nearly the same and that the value of b for the relationship between gsh and gsa is the highest with a value of 1 22 of the other indicators the values of r2 nse and d 0 97 0 96 and 0 93 respectively for the relationship between gsm and gsa are the highest the values of r2 nse and d 0 65 0 21 and 0 49 respectively for the relationship between gsh and gsa are the lowest and the values of r2 nse and d 0 89 0 86 and 0 84 respectively for the relationship between gsl and gsa are intermediate the values of rmse and aic 0 03 and 47 48 respectively for the relationship between gsm and gsa are the lowest the values of rmse and aic 0 07 and 37 42 respectively for the relationship between gsh and gsa are the highest and the values of rmse and aic 0 06 and 38 10 respectively for the relationship between gsl and gsa are intermediate all these parameters show a consistent result in the three submodels the modified hyperbolic model is the most accurate and shows the best fit between estimated and observed data for gs followed by the linear model and the hyperbolic model increased co2 concentration undoubtedly has an effect on gs but scholars disagree in their understanding of the mathematical relationship between the two jarvis 1976 thought that gs decreased linearly with the increase in co2 concentration within the range 100 1000 μmol mol 1 morison and gifford 1983 used a quadratic function to represent the relationship between gs and co2 concentration within the range 200 800 μmol mol 1 since morison 1987 found that doubling the co2 concentration would result in a 40 decrease in gs within the range 330 660 μmol mol 1 easterling et al 1992 included that results in a linear model to represent the response of gs to change in co2 concentration in order to estimate the effect of increased co2 concentration on et the results of our study show that the response of gs to change in co2 concentration can be accurately approximated by a linear relationship within a limited range of co2 concentrations and within this range both the linear model and the modified hyperbolic model show a good fit for gs however when the co2 concentration is beyond this range the decrease in gs gradually lessens as the co2 concentration increases which shows a nonlinear relationship in this case the linear model will overestimate the effect of increasing co2 concentration on gs 3 3 comparison of observed et and et estimated by the penman monteith model without stomatal co2 response the comparison of the observed et eta and estimated et etr by p m model without stomatal co2 response i e f co2 1 was shown in table 2 and fig 4 in fig 4 it shows that the estimated etr was not good it was higher than the observed eta when taking no account of the co2 concentration effect on gs especially under the high co2 concentrations e g 550 700 and 900 µmol mol 1 and the higher the co2 concentration the larger the estimation error was between eta and etr the estimation errors were respectively 4 400 µmol mol 1 9 550 µmol mol 1 10 700 µmol mol 1 and 8 900 µmol mol 1 that was because gs decreases with the elevation of co2 concentration and there is a positive relationship between et and gs without the response of gs to co2 concentration the etr by p m model would be overestimated when compared with eta and the estimation errors would be more and more obvious along with the elevation of co2 concentration when the effect of co2 concentration on gs increases therefore when estimating et by p m model under elevated co2 concentration it is important and necessary to incorporate the proper gs co2 submodel to improve the estimation accuracy of et 3 4 comparison of observed et and et estimated by the penman monteith model using three co2 dependent stomatal conductance submodels from the linear regression coefficients of the relationship between observed et eta and estimated et using the linear model etl the hyperbolic model eth and the modified hyperbolic model etm which are shown in table 2 and fig 5 it can be seen that the hyperbolic model overestimated et for all four co2 concentrations fig 5b e h and k when the co2 concentration was no more than 550 μmol mol 1 eth and etr had similar estimation results with the close values of r2 rmse nse d and aic when the co2 concentration was higher than 550 μmol mol 1 the accuracy of eth by the hyperbolic model was improved when compared with etr which was estimated without the co2 concentration effect and all the above five evaluation parameters of eth had an advantage over that of etr table 2 in table 2 it shows that the estimation accuracies of et by linear model and modified hyperbolic model were higher than that by hyperbolic model and without co2 concentration effect when the co2 concentration was 400 and 550 μmol mol 1 etl and etm also overestimated eta to some degree the estimation errors were respectively 2 5 and 1 9 400 μmol mol 1 and 4 7 and 4 3 550 μmol mol 1 but all better than eth and etr when the co2 concentration was 700 μmol mol 1 etl and etm gave reasonably accurate estimates of eta with errors of 0 6 and 0 9 respectively when the co2 concentration was 900 μmol mol 1 etl significantly underestimated eta while etm gave a reasonably accurate estimate of eta with errors of 9 7 and 1 4 respectively when the co2 concentration was less than 900 μmol mol 1 although etl and etm were more accurate in estimating eta the values of r2 nse and d for the relationship between etm and eta were larger than those for the relationship between etl and eta and the values of rmse and aic for the relationship between etm and eta were smaller than those for the relationship between etl and eta the evaluation indicators r2 rmse nse d and aic for the relationship between etr and eta as well as eth and eta were the worst table 2 thus the modified hyperbolic model gave the best estimation of eta when the co2 concentration was 900 μmol mol 1 etl gave the worst estimate of eta and the evaluation indicators showed the worst performance which was similar with that of etr the models of eth and etm gave better estimates of eta but the values of r2 nse and d for the relationship between etm and eta were the largest and the values of rmse and aic were the smallest thus the modified hyperbolic model was still the best model and gave the most accurate estimate of et when the co2 concentration was higher because the exact fitting of gs played an important role in the estimation of et by p m the hyperbolic model performed consistently worse in the estimation of gs and et than either the linear model or the modified hyperbolic model the hyperbolic model only considered the relationship between the absolute co2 concentration and the absolute gs which is highly dependent on crop species the potential maximum gs gs max p and the parameter cs0 in eq 13 were empirical values which were highly dependent on the original data namely if the calibration data set changed the gs max p and cs0 would also like to change the gs values found in the different literature sources were often quite different which can significantly influence the calibration process for gs max p and cs0 thus the hyperbolic model may not be suitable for et estimation by p m if atmospheric co2 concentration increases in order to eliminate the influence of the absolute gs value on the accuracy of the model the concepts of relative gs max gs max gs max ref and relative co2 concentration co2 co2ref were introduced into the original hyperbolic model in a way that was consistent with the parameters of the linear model a comparison between figs 3b and 2b also shows that the introduction of the relative values can improve the response of gs to the decreased impact of higher co2 concentration with more concentrated data points and more stable calibrated empirical parameters in the model those who using the model only need to set the reference co2 concentration which is already known and a value of maximum stomatal conductance which is species dependent at the specific co2 concentration in order to accurately simulate et since other empirical parameters are stable the modified hyperbolic model has simplified the gs co2 model and is easier to be applied when co2 co2ref 2 the linear model and the modified hyperbolic model both gave basically the same estimate of et table 2 and fig 5 therefore the response of gs to co2 concentration was approximated as a linear relationship when co2 co2ref 2 this verified the gs co2 linear pattern applied in the study of easterling et al 1992 in which the response of gs to co2 concentration was linear in an absolute range of 330 660 μmol mol 1 however jarvis 1976 overestimated the co2 concentration range for this linear response in our paper we have overcome the limitation of the absolute range by considering that the approximate linear response of gs to co2 concentration will occur within a relative range i e co2 co2ref 2 in this situation the estimates of et by the linear model and by the modified hyperbolic model were close to one another but the modified hyperbolic model was more accurate and the estimate was better when co2 co2ref 2 the linear model overestimated the effect of increased co2 concentration on gs especially at 900 μmol mol 1 co2 co2ref 2 727 when the value of etl was much less than that of eta but the accuracy of etm was much better than that of etl these results illustrate that the modified hyperbolic model can better estimate the effect of increased co2 concentration on gs the results are consistent with that of section 3 2 based on the comprehensive analysis of the three different gs co2 submodels it is found that when incorporating these models into p m to estimate et under increased co2 concentrations the factor having most impact on the estimate of et was not the absolute co2 concentration level but the relative co2 concentration level which provides a more accurate estimate of et when the relative co2 concentration 2 12 i e 700 μmol mol 1 the linear model and the modified hyperbolic model showed no significant difference in et estimation but when the relative co2 concentration 2 12 using the modified hyperbolic model in p m can give a more precise and accurate result and it performs good at all co2 concentration levels in this research since the highest co2 concentration in our research is 900 μmol mol 1 the modified model is applicable within this range because the predicted co2 concentration is 936 μmol mol 1 under rcp8 5 climate change scenario and 900 μmol mol 1 is within this range the modified model is applicable under all the projected climate change scenarios in estimation of et and other hydrologic variables 3 5 sensitivity analysis of the penman monteith model to different parameters for estimating evapotranspiration in order to analyze the sensitivity of p m to the empirical parameters in the three gs co2 submodels when estimating et the parameters were changed by 40 and 20 and then the percentage change in predicted et was calculated the results are shown in table 3 which shows that et increased as p and b decreased and gs max p and cs0 increased and that et decreased as p and b increased and gs max p and cs0 decreased p m showed different sensitivities to the different empirical parameters for the et estimation change in the parameter b in the modified hyperbolic model had the least influence on et when values of b were changed by 40 20 20 and 40 et changed only by 1 87 0 92 0 89 and 1 75 2015 and 3 22 1 57 1 50 and 2 94 2016 the influences of the other parameters on et are greater as their percentages change the sensitivity analysis results in table 3 show that changes in the empirical parameters of the linear model and the hyperbolic model had greater influence on et and the changes in the estimate values had increased uncertainty as the empirical parameters changed when the modified hyperbolic model was incorporated into p m to estimate et under increased co2 concentrations changes in the empirical parameter b had little influence on estimated et showing this to be the most stable model and that it had wide applicability in this paper the p value 0 4 was selected because it was the most commonly used value in the literature that we analyzed using this value when the co2 concentration doubled gs decreased by 40 this value of p has been used by most scholars and is applied in different scientific research easterling et al 1992 neitsch et al 2005 niu et al 2013 wu et al 2012 zheng and peng 2001 analyzed a large quantity of research and derived a p value of 0 3 but this value has not been adopted by other scholars the use of gs data from different literature sources different amounts and different crops would result in different calibration values of b gs max p and cs0 in this paper we comprehensively analyzed a large number of papers published over a long time period which included data for most c3 and c4 crops co2 concentrations ranged from 100 to 1800 µmol mol 1 and the experimental environment involved open and closed equipment and pot and field experiments in this case the calibrated value of b provides a good fit for the nonlinear relationship between gs and the co2 concentration and thus provide a better estimate of et using p m the results are broadly representative and widely applicable the modified model provides an easier way to estimate et when co2 concentration increases in the future and our work also filled the gap where there is no validation of et estimated by p m model involving the stomatal co2 relationship but there are still some limitations in our research we only used pot experiment data to validate the parameters and models however we thought they are broadly applicable because the parameters in the models were calibrated using the data from many literatures which included both pot and field experiment data but further validation researches with field experiment data are also needed in the future carbon dioxide enrichment can affect not only stomatal conductance but also crop growth for example leaf area index lai and crop height h we already have considered that in our study the only thing is the lai and h data were measured in the experiment but not simulated using lai h co2 models that was because we only have the lai h data from our experiment but don t have the lai h data from the literatures which is hard to collect from the beginning to the end of the growth period and most literatures don t provide all the data but we will consider improving the lai h co2 model in our future s research another limitation of our work is that we only validated the models for c4 crop which was planted in growth chambers but not for c3 crop or other crops that grown in the field we will conduct such experiments in the future to improve our work 4 conclusions in this paper the gs and co2 concentration data obtained from the two year maize experiment and 50 published papers were analyzed the results that gs decreased and that the reduction rate gradually lessened as co2 concentration increased were obtained by comparing the estimated gs and et from the three gs co2 models the linear model the hyperbolic model and the modified hyperbolic model with the observed data it can be concluded that the modified hyperbolic model provides the best estimates both in gs and et under all levels of co2 concentrations with the largest values of r2 nse and d and the smallest values of rmse and aic followed in decreasing level of accuracy by the linear model and the hyperbolic model furthermore the modified hyperbolic model was more stable and reliable with the smallest changes in estimated et 3 when the empirical parameters changed 40 and 20 therefore when estimating et with p m for increased atmospheric co2 concentrations the inclusion of the modified hyperbolic gs co2 submodel not only recognizes resultant changes in stomata physiological responses but also makes the estimate more accurate more reliable and more widely representative and thus gives it greater applicability declaration of interests none acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the careful reviews and valuable

6618,nowadays alteration of the natural flow regime is considered one the most widespread and damaging impacts for river ecosystems hence increasing our understanding of large scale hydrological alteration patterns would help us design more effective water use policies the present study aims to establish general patterns of hydrological alteration caused by dams on a national level with spain as a case study first we developed a classification of the natural flow regime of the spanish river network which served as the reference to assess the degree of hydrological alteration of 139 altered river gauges in addition using the flow series of the altered river gauges we defined a set of 7 types of altered regimes tars which allowed the stratification of the analyses the results revealed that the magnitude and direction of hydrological alteration depended on the natural flow class of the altered rivers in this regard major effects of dams on spanish rivers were related to the modification of the intra annual variability of daily flow the magnitude of seasonal maximum and minimum flows and the patterns of high flow events our results also showed that the distribution of the tars partially followed a geographic order but associations between tars and natural flow classes were not straightforward in addition we highlighted that the nature of the hydrological alteration was

conservation and restoration practices black et al 2005 zimmerman et al 2018 the assessment of hydrological alteration has commonly been carried out at scales ranging from a specific reach affected by a dam or reservoir e g magilligan and nislow 2005 maingi and marsh 2002 yang et al 2008 to individual drainages belmar et al 2013 piqué et al 2016 radinger et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2017 however the development of most of these studies implied the need for pre and post dam flow records which are normally absent from most altered rivers peñas et al 2016 sengupta et al 2018 thus management decisions are limited to a small fraction of all river reaches in a given geographic area eng et al 2013 developing a general framework that allows us to understand the patterns of hydrological alteration generated by dams at broader scales is therefore critical in order to aid management decisions carlisle et al 2011 highlighted the lack of systematic assessments of hydrological alteration across the united states and there are still very few studies mcmanamay et al 2012 poff et al 2007 zimmerman et al 2018 that have analyzed the dominant types of hydrological alteration in large areas these studies have stressed that there are two primary reasons that make generalizations of hydrological alteration caused by dams difficult to assess the variability of reservoir attributes hampers the prediction of their potential hydrological alteration thus the use of the actual flow records to stratify types of altered regimes rather than these attributes might reduce the noise resulting from this uncertainty second the magnitude and direction of the alteration might also depend upon the natural characteristics of the impacted river mcmanamay et al 2012 zimmerman et al 2018 additionally it must be noted that most large scale studies of hydrological alterations have been done in the conterminous united states all this serves to emphasize that greater efforts should be made to understand the general patterns of hydrological alteration in other regions especially in areas with a high degree of alteration such as the iberian peninsula according to eloha principles poff et al 2010 hydrological classifications of the natural flow regime are very valuable tools for assessing large scale hydrological alteration standing on two factors first the natural hydrological variability of each class represents the baseline condition against which hydrological alteration might be assessed peñas et al 2016 hence the use of predictive classifications avoids the use of only sites with pre and post dam data and allows the analyses to be expanded to much larger regions in addition the definition of flow classes can be used to stratify the analyses and serve as the organizational structure to aid in the definition and understanding of the differences in hydrological alteration between rivers of different flow classes arthington et al 2006 mcmanamay et al 2012 the main objective of this study is to assess and define the general patterns of hydrological alteration caused by dams in spain our specific objectives are to 1 assess how dams influence the most relevant attributes driving the natural hydrological variability of the river network on a national scale 2 define types of altered regimes in spain based exclusively on gauged flow series and 3 evaluate how hydrological alteration varies across rivers belonging to different hydrological classes i e rivers with contrasting hydrological behaviors we expect that natural flow regimes will influence the hydrological alteration patterns in addition we expect to find a certain degree of association between the geographical distribution of the types of altered regimes and the environmental characteristics of the catchments and between the type of altered regime and the registered dam uses and operational rules in order to meet these objectives we developed and used a predictive hydrological classification of the spanish river network 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area comprised continental spain fig 1 spain covers a total area of 550 000 km2 and presents catchments with areas ranging from several hundred square kilometers to more than 70 000 km2 the relief is organized into large units around a high interior plateau the meseta which occupies 45 of the total surface area and is located over 600 m above sea level masl surrounding the meseta is the cantabrian mountain range to the north the iberian system to the east and sierra morena to the south the pyrenees on the northeastern border and the bético system in the southeast are located outside the central plateau and reach altitudes over 3400 masl in addition spain is dominated by a mediterranean climate ranging from xeric and desertic to pluvioseasonal while the northern border is dominated by a temperate oceanic climate rivas martínez et al 2004 given this heterogeneity there is high variability in water resource availability across the country over 1200 dams have been built since the beginning of the 20th century to cope with the water demands of the population and agriculture and to a lesser degree energy production 2 2 hydrological data and hydrological indices the hydrological database used in this study consisted of daily mean flows in the 1976 2016 period from 1290 gauge stations provided by the center for hydrographic studies cedex ministry of public works and ministry for ecological transition spain and various water agencies and regional governments first we segregated natural and altered river gauges natural river gauges were those unaffected by impoundments or large upstream abstractions and with upstream catchment agriculture or forest plantation land cover under 50 in addition an analysis of the natural flow series was carried out to eliminate years without desirable data quality following the criteria established in peñas et al 2014 we then selected the altered river gauges with optimal characteristics to carry out further analyses in this regard we considered only 1 gauges in rivers affected by a minimum of one and a maximum of three upstream impoundments except in two cases were 4 and 5 dams upstream were allowed and 2 gauges with a ratio of impounded catchment area catchment area in the impoundment and catchment area at the gauging station over 0 3 for both natural and altered river gauges years with more than 30 days of missing data were removed from the analysis and in the last step we discarded the gauges that accounted for 8 years in the 1976 2016 period after applying these restrictions 282 and 139 natural and altered rivers gauges respectively were selected fig 1 supplementary material table s3 daily

watershed barquín et al 2015 was developed using flow directions inferred from a 10 m digital elevation model dem with netmap tools benda et al 2007 the virtual watershed was ultimately composed of 130 606 river reaches with an average length of 986 m predictor variables describing several environmental attributes that are hypothesized to be important discriminators of the hydrological regime including climate topography land cover and geology were extracted from existing national gis databases provided by several national and regional organizations detailed information about these environmental variables and information sources can be found in supplementary material table s2 and peñas et al 2014 2 4 development of natural flow regime classification we produced a classification of the natural flow regimes hereafter hydrological classification for the entire river network to analyze how different types of hydrological alteration are related to the unaltered hydrological nature of rivers the hydrological classification was derived using the predict then classify strategy fig 2 peñas et al 2014 snelder and booker 2013 starting from the 85 his obtained from each natural river gauge section 2 2 the predict then classify strategy includes the following 4 steps 1 principal component analysis pca on the 85 his obtained from each natural river gauge to create a reduced set of non correlated synthetic indices sinat 2 development of empirical models using random forest rf of the sinat based on catchment variables climatic topographical geological and land cover 3 prediction of the sinat for river reaches in the entire river network without a gauge and 4 clustering of river reaches to create natural classes nc for the entire river network using the partitioning around medoids algorithm the broken stick method bs jackson 1993 was applied to define the optimal set of sinats to define ncs given that a priori we did not know the optimal number of ncs we produced hydrological classifications with numbers of ncs ranging from 2 to 50 then classification strength cs van sickle 1997 and anova on selected his were carried out to determine the optimal number of classes briefly cs is calculated from the difference between the mean dissimilarity of the gauges in the same class dwithin and the mean dissimilarity of gauges in the other classes dbetween higher cs values indicated a greater uniformity within classes and greater differences between classes van sickle 1997 following the procedure outlined in snelder and booker 2013 and snelder et al 2012 cs analysis was performed on gauges not used in the fitted models by means of a fivefold cross validation procedure hastie et al 2001 to focus on the predictive performance of the classifications and smooth out the variability inherent to each subset in addition we performed an anova on the his 9 with the highest values in the sinats of the pca which in turn are related to the hydrological interpretation of each sinat the anova used class membership as the explanatory variable and allowed for the analysis of the potential of classifications to discriminate each of the his the coefficient of determination r2 was calculated for each level 2 to 50 class level of the hydrological classifications 2 5 definition of types of altered regimes we defined types of altered regimes tar using the hydrological regimes recorded in the altered river gauges using a simplified classification procedure compared to that used in section 2 4 which lacks a prediction process the definition of tar started from the 85 his obtained from each altered river gauge section 2 2 and included two steps 1 principal component analysis pca to obtain a reduced set of non correlated synthetic indices sialt and 2 clustering of gauges with altered flow regimes to create tars using the partitioning around medoids algorithm the bs method jackson 1993 was applied to define the optimal set of sialts to further create the tars we produced classifications with numbers of tars ranging from 2 to 20 again we used cs and anova to define the optimal number of tars nonetheless it must be noted that the generation of tars did not entail any prediction process hence cs analysis and anova were performed on the same gauges used in the definition of the tars next we analyzed the spatial distribution of the tars we compared the latitude coordinate x and longitude coordinate y of the altered river gauges with one way analysis of variance anova using tar as the fixed factor post hoc comparisons were made using tukey s test to explore differences between specific tar pairs finally we analyzed the degree of association between the tars and the purposes of the reservoirs first we defined the purposes of the reservoirs using official information from the ministry for ecological transition which is responsible for compiling this data reservoir purposes were defined as irrigation ir water supply ws hydropower generation hp or any combination of them ir hp ir ws hp ws ir hp ws then we applied a fisher s exact test to analyze significant associations between tar and reservoir purposes p values were simulated following the monte carlo simulation procedure using 106 replicates in addition to avoid problems regarding zeros in the contingency table we performed two separate fisher test analyses in the first we eliminated reservoir purposes that presented zeros in any tar in the second we eliminated tars that presented zeros in any reservoir purpose 2 6 assessment of large scale hydrological alteration the characterization and interpretation of nationwide patterns of hydrological alteration were done according to the tar and the nc to which the altered river gauges should belong in the absence of dams to this end we assessed the degree of hydrological alteration of each altered river gauge and the tar nc pairs according to the following procedure 1 each altered river gauge was assigned a nc based on the specific river reach where it was located 2 for each altered river gauge sinats values were calculated according to the 85 hydrological indices calculated previously to this end the rotation factors of the sinats i e the eigenvectors obtained from the pca performed on the natural river gauges section 2 3 were applied to the 85 his of each altered river gauge 3 all the altered river gauges that belonged to the same tar and the same nc were grouped tar nc pairs 4 for each tar nc pair the magnitude and direction of change of the sinats of the altered river gauges with respect to the natural river gauges in their same nc were estimated we used the kruscal wallis k w to test whether these differences were significant analyses were done with the restriction that there should be at least three natural river gauges and three altered river gauges in each tar nc pair comparison this restriction considerably reduced the number of available altered river gauges 3 results 3 1 development of a natural flow regime classification the first four sinats of the pca performed on the natural river gauges explained 84 of the variance the hydrological interpretation of each sinat was carried out by attending to the his with the highest values in each sinat of the pca hence sinat 1 was negatively related to the intra annual variability of daily flows l2 in addition sinat 1 was also negatively related to the magnitude of seasonal maximum flows 90hf while it was positively related to the magnitude of seasonal minimum flows 90lf sinat 2 was positively related to the duration of high flow events dphigh but negatively to the frequency of these events fre3 sinat 3 was negatively related to the interannual variability of minimum flow timing sdjmin and the interannual variability of the magnitude of september flows sdm9 lastly sinat 4 was positively related to the magnitude of spring flows m4 and their interannual variability sdm4 mean r2 value of rf models was 0 5 finally the classification performance assessed through cs showed a sharp increase in cs from 2 to 7 nc while it presented a gradual improvement from 8 to 20 nc fig 3 a anova analyses were consistent with the performance results exhibited by cs supplementary material figure s1 we chose 20 ncs as the optimal level to classify the river network as cs did not reveal significant differences i e overlapping among standard error bars beyond this class level in addition a visual inspection of the geographic distribution of the ncs revealed agreement with prior knowledge of the study area fig 4 only ncs that maintained at least one group of tar nc gauges were considered in the assessment of the hydrological alteration patterns consequently we ignored ncs 2 4 6 9 11 12 15 16 17 18 and 19 in further analyses here we only described the hydrological characteristics of the ncs that were relevant to subsequently understanding the hydrological alteration patterns according to the hydrological interpretation of the sinat presented below nc1 exhibited high intra annual flow variability which reflected a major contrast in the magnitude of maximum and minimum seasonal flows fig 3b nc1 also exhibited the highest interannual variability of minimum flow timing and magnitude nc3 presented low intra annual flow variability and was distinguished by very few but long lasting high flow events fig 3b nc3 also exhibited low interannual variability of minimum flow magnitude and timing nc5 presented one of the most stable annual flow regimes in addition nc5 presented the highest values in sinat 4 which reflects both large magnitude spring flows and high interannual variability fig 3b in addition nc5 presented very few but long lasting high flow events nc7 exhibited the most stable annual flow regimes the stability of the rivers in nc7 is also reflected in the low interannual variability of spring flows sinat 4 fig 3b in addition owing to this flow stability the high sinat 2 values of nc7 could be interpreted as regimes characterized by long periods of flows exceeding the high flow threshold considered 25 percent exceedance nc8 was characterized by low interannual variability of the timing and magnitude of minimum annual flows nc8 also presented high magnitude spring flows nc10 presented low sinat 2 values which was interpreted as rivers with frequent but short high flow events in addition nc10 presented rivers with low interannual variability of the timing and magnitude of low flows nc13 and nc20 exhibited similar hydrological characteristics fig 3 and similar geographical distribution north catchments fig 4 they exhibited the highest frequency of high flow events in addition analysis of the monthly flow regime not included highlighted that nc13 in contrast to nc20 presented a second high flow peak during the spring which might be related to snowmelt processes while nc20 presented a peak only during winter months lastly nc14 was characterized by rivers with the lowest annual stability in the study area 3 2 generation of types of altered regimes the first seven sialts of the pcaalt performed on the gauges with altered flow regimes explained the 90 of variance the hydrological interpretation of each sialt was also done according to the his with the highest values and their sign in the pcaalt sialt 1 was positively related to the magnitude of monthly 30hf and weekly 7hf maximum flows and the intra annual variability of daily flows l2 sialt 2 exhibited an inverse relationship with the interannual variability of summer flows sdm8 while sialt 3 was related to the interannual variability of minimum flows sdbfi and sd1lf sialt 4 was positively related to the frequency of high flow events nphigh and sdnphigh sialt 5 was negatively related to the mean value of april flows m4 and sdm4 and sialt 6 presented a direct relationship with the magnitude of minimum annual flows x95 finally sialt 7 was related with the variability of october flows sdm10 the cs analysis showed a marked increase in this statistic from 2 to 7 tars fig 5 this agreed with anova of selected his supplementary material figure s2 hence we selected 7 as the optimal number of tars the analysis of the spatial distribution patterns of tars indicated that both x f6 138 6 62 p value 0 01 and y f6 138 7 31 p value 0 01 coordinates presented significant differences according to tar fig 6 a moreover tukey s test highlighted that each of the 7 tars presented significant differences with at least 1 tar in one of the coordinate axes table 1 nine ncs held at least 1 tar with the minimum number of altered river gauges established to perform analyses 3 and 89 altered river gauges remained table 2 and fig 6b and c finally given the absence of tar nc pair in tar7 it was removed from the hydrological alteration assessment finally none of the tars showed predilection for any of the reservoir purposes table 3 the analysis of the association between tars and reservoir purposes did not present significant results in either of the two fisher tests performed i e when reservoir purposes that presented zeros in any tar were discarded p value greater than 0 07 and when tars that presented zeros in any reservoir use were discarded p value greater than 0 28 in order to reduce the potential noise associated with the reservoir size we repeated the fisher tests but omitting those reservoirs showing low storage index tests using only those reservoirs with storage index above the 25th and 50th percentile also revealed a lack of significant association between tars and reservoir purposes results not shown 3 3 assessment of large scale hydrological alteration in total we performed 80 comparisons between natural and altered river gauges 20 tar nc groups multiplied by 4 sinat half of the k w analyses 40 of these comparisons yielded significant differences table 4 four tar nc pairs presented a significant increase in sinat 1 with respect to the mean of their respective ncs table 4 and fig 7 this means that gauges in these tar nc groups presented lower intra annual variability of daily flows and smaller seasonal maximum flows than the means of their respective ncs in contrast four tar nc groups presented a significant decrease in sinat 1 i e gauges in these groups exhibited the opposite hydrological alteration table 4 and fig 7 in thirteen out of twenty tar nc pairs analyzed a significant decrease in the value of sinat 2 was found table 4 and fig 7 this translates into more frequent high flow events but of a shorter duration in contrast four tar nc pairs presented a significant increase in this sinat in parallel five tar nc pairs presented a significant decrease in sinat 3 while only tar2 nc13 and tar2 nc20 exhibited a significant increase table 4 and fig 8 a decrease in sinat 3 indicated greater variability of both the timing and magnitude of minimum flows finally k w analysis identified significant decreases and increases in sinat 4 in six and two tar nc groups respectively table 4 and fig 8 an increase in sinat 4 meant a reduction in the mean and interannual variability of the magnitude of spring flows 4 discussion our results showed how dams modify the most relevant features in the determination of large scale hydrological variability patterns in spanish rivers a 20 nc hydrological classification served as the basis to represent unaltered hydrological conditions and a classification of the altered flow regimes composed of 7 tars defined the most common altered hydrological regimes the integration of both classifications was critical to interpreting and understanding the main patterns of hydrological alteration our results showed that all the tar nc pairs generated a significant alteration of at least one sinat moreover some tar nc pairs produced a significant alteration of all sinats the intra annual variability of daily flows and the frequency and duration of high flow events were the most commonly altered hydrological features consistent with our initial expectations the results highlighted that the magnitude and direction of the hydrological alterations caused by each tar were highly associated with the ncs our results also highlighted that tars presented a certain degree of geographical dependence this means that tars were not uniquely influenced by the presence of the reservoir but they still presented a certain influence of the climatic and other environmental characteristics of the basin moreover contrary to expectations this study demonstrated that there was not a direct relationship between the tars defined here and the registered purposes of the dams 4 1 development of a natural flow regime classification the procedure followed to develop the natural flow classification has been proved to be scientifically suitable and accurate by several studies peñas et al 2014 snelder and booker 2013 hydrological classification identified intra annual variability of daily flows magnitude of seasonal maximum and minimum flows sinat 1 and frequency and duration of high flow events sinat 2 as the major natural hydrological gradients in the study area the variability of the magnitude of the minimum monthly flows the variability of timing of minimum flows sinat 3 and the magnitude and variability of spring flows sinat 4 were also important gradients to segregate rivers most of the hydrological characteristics found to be critical in the classification were consistent with those used in a classification covering only the northern third of spain peñas et al 2014 this was not surprising given that the area covered by peñas et al 2014 included catchments covering some of the most marked environmental gradients in spain alvarez cabria et al 2016 peñas et al 2018 nonetheless other hydrological characteristics not considered in peñas et al 2014 such as frequency and duration of high flow events and the variability of minimum flow timing have also appeared as determinant variables that explain the hydrological variability of spanish rivers the inclusion of all spanish catchments has increased the range of environmental characteristics considered and thereby added greater hydrological variability compared to prior classifications of spanish catchments belmar et al 2011 peñas et al 2014 solans and garcía de jalón 2016 regarding the number of ncs we deemed 20 ncs to be an appropriate balance to account for the hydrological variability of spanish rivers while maintaining a minimum number of altered river gauges in each nc to perform further analyses the selection of 20 ncs was consistent with other hydrological classifications developed under the principles of the eloha framework in spanish catchments peñas et al 2016 solans and garcía de jalón 2016 both of these works proposed hydrological classifications composed of 6 natural classes but it must be noted that they also considered proportionally smaller study areas than that covered here the cs analysis fig 3a and anova supplementary material figure s1 highlighted that a classification composed of more than 20 ncs would not reflect a greater uniformity within classes and or greater differences between classes in contrast the selection of a more detailed classification would have reduced the number of ncs in which the large scale patterns of hydrological alteration could be assessed 4 2 generation of types of altered regimes the results indicated that the development of tars based on the flow regime series of altered gauges provide a more appropriate strategy to understand patterns of hydrological alteration than using an a priori sorting of dams based on their registered uses in this regard contrary to expectations none of the seven tars presented a direct relationship with any of the official registered dam uses table 3 poff and hart 2002 stressed that developing a classification based on reservoir operation is difficult as several classification criteria vary across different disciplines hence the effects of dams should be defined by the way they modify the natural flow regime poff and hart 2002 as has been done through the definition of tars the his with the highest values in the sialt of the pcaalt varied dramatically in comparison to the his with the highest values in the sinat in order to clarify what this result entails it must be pointed out that the hydrological interpretation of the hydrological classifications and the tars is based on the percentage of variance explained by each si sinat and sialt respectively and the his with the highest loads in each si in this regard the first three sialts which account for more than 66 of the variance at the altered river gauges were related to his that did not even appear in any of the sinat for instance magnitude of monthly and weekly maximum flows sialt 1 interannual variability of summer flows sialt 2 and interannual variability of the daily and weekly minimum flows sialt 3 conversely many other hydrological characteristics captured by pcanat such as the magnitude of seasonal maximum and minimum flows timing of minimum flows and the magnitude and the interannual variability of spring flows did not appear in any of the sialts however it should also be noted that not all the signals of the natural variability patterns have been lost at the altered river gauges such as the intra annual variability of daily flows or characteristics related to the frequency of high flow events finally the analysis of the spatial distribution of the tars revealed that there was a certain degree of geographical dependence fig 6 several studies e g peñas et al 2014 reidy liermann et al 2012 snelder and booker 2013 acknowledge the direct response of the distribution of ncs to environmental gradients related to climate geology land uses or catchment configuration we believe that this geographical dependence is related to the environmental characteristics of the catchment which might still exert certain control over the hydrological behavior of the altered rivers in this context radinger et al 2018 found that in the ebro river catchment the alteration of mean annual flows seasonality and summer flows was mainly related to climate and land use patterns and not only to the presence of dams nonetheless the influence of dams on the flow regime is stronger than the control exerted by the environmental characteristics of the catchment poff et al 2007 as demonstrated by the lack of significant differences between many of the tars and their geographical dependence 4 3 assessment of large scale hydrological alteration our results suggested that dams did not possess the capacity to modify the entire range of natural hydrological characteristics analyzed in this study and represented by the sinat but they would produce significant effects on specific hydrological characteristics depending on the tar and the nc that the altered river gauges were assigned this is consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated that the magnitude and direction of the effects of dams are strongly influenced by the natural flow class membership the specific operational rules of the dam and the analyzed hydrological characteristic mcmanamay et al 2012 for instance several studies have found general patterns concerning the effects of dams such as a decrease in maximum flows and daily flow variability belmar et al 2013 costigan and daniels 2012 magilligan and nislow 2005 poff et al 2007 and an increase in minimum flows batalla et al 2004 gao et al 2012 poff et al 2007 zimmerman et al 2018 as stated above these three hydrological characteristics are partially considered in sinat 1 contrary to the general patterns found elsewhere our results highlighted that the directionality of the alteration varied in relation to the nc and to a lesser extent to the tar for instance nc3 and nc7 were characterized by low intra annual variability of daily flows small magnitude maximum seasonal flows and large magnitude minimum seasonal flows fig 7 in both ncs we found a significant decrease in sinat 1 for at least one tar i e an increase in the intra annual variability of daily flows and the magnitude of maximum seasonal flows and a decrease in the magnitude of minimum seasonal flows in contrast we found the opposite alteration in nc10 in which three out of five analyses revealed significant decreases table 4 nc10 was composed of rivers with high interannual variability nonetheless these patterns could not be generalized for all ncs for instance nc8 was characterized by sinat 1 values similar to those of nc10 but dams generated the opposite effect moreover in nc13 the direction of the significant hydrological alteration depended upon the specific tar analyzed the most common form of alteration was the frequency and duration of high flow events represented by sinat 2 in most of the cases we found a significant decrease of this parameter given that the frequency and duration of high flow events is highly correlated this decrease is translated in the increase in the number of events through the year which implies the reduction in the length in days of each event most of the nc tar pairs that presented significant alterations to this sinat 2 nc1 nc3 nc5 nc7 nc8 and nc14 table 4 presented a relatively low frequency of high flow events fig 3 meanwhile nc10 and nc13 presented higher frequencies of high flow events than the other ncs in these two ncs the direction of the alteration was not as clear and depended upon the analyzed tar assessments of the alteration caused by dams to the frequency of high flow events across the united states showed a lack of consistency in the responses magilligan and nislow 2005 mcmanamay et al 2012 this highlighted again the dependence of the response increase decrease on the hydrological nature of the altered river making any generalization difficult if the ncs are not considered patterns similar to those described above were also observed in the analysis of the alteration of sinat 3 in this case the altered river gauges assigned to the ncs with the highest values in this sinat e g tar1 nc10 tar3 nc8 or tar5 nc10 fig 8 tended to undergo a decrease in the sinat 3 value while the opposite result was observed at the altered river gauges assigned to the nc that presented the lowest values e g tar2 nc13 or tar2 nc20 fig 8 sinat 3 was related to the interannual variability of the magnitude and timing of minimum flows in five out of seven cases where analysis revealed significant alterations a reduction in this variability was observed in most cases the ultimate objective or capacity of dams is to regulate the flow regime poff and hart 2002 thus this result was not surprising nonetheless as highlighted by mcmanamay 2014 in cases where the natural flow regime is very stable dams could create abnormally higher variability regarding sinat 4 the patterns of alteration were not as clear and several tar nc pairs did not comply with the aforementioned rule i e a decrease in sinat values in tars with the highest sinat values and an increase in sinat values in the opposite situation e g tar2 nc10 tar4 nc10 tar2 nc13 tar4 nc13 and tar2 nc20 sinat 4 represented the magnitude of spring flows and their interannual variability sources of spring flows vary largely across natural flow classes as they can be influenced by different climatological processes bejarano et al 2010 including snowmelt rain or the starting point of the dry season which present a marked gradient in the study area rivas martínez et al 2004 hence it is likely to find a heterogeneous range of altered responses according to the nc and the tar as was the case 5 conclusion most studies on hydrological alteration caused by dams are carried out on a local scale this is one of the first attempts worldwide and the only one in spain and europe aimed at unraveling patterns of large scale hydrological alteration our results showed that the magnitude and direction of the hydrological alteration is highly dependent on the pre dam characteristics of the affected river hence it has been verified that the use of hydrological classifications provides a suitable framework for organizing information in order to assess the hydrological alteration the assessment of hydrological alteration patterns has indicated that the most common form of alteration was the increase in the number of high flow events and the reduction in the length of these events according to our results two aspects should be stressed in future hydrological alteration studies first the tars presented a certain degree of geographical dependence this indicates that the environmental characteristics of the catchment and not only the presence of dams exerted certain control over the altered rivers in addition we did not find any relationships among the tars and the purpose of the dam this result implies that classifying reservoirs according to their purpose is not very useful when analyzing the patterns of hydrological alteration and the potential ecological consequences of the alteration in sum this study revealed that both the definition of ncs and tars are essential to unraveling large scale hydrological alteration patterns in addition most dams nowadays at least in spain are equipped with automatic monitoring systems to track water inputs outputs volume etc although public access to these data is limited in most cases the availability of the flow series released from dams would allow each dam to be assigned to a tar this combined with the nc of the river downstream would multiply the number of rivers to be potentiality assessed these assessments will aid in the understanding of the hydrological alteration patterns caused by dams and the relationships of this alteration with the effects on river ecosystem functioning as well as ultimately allowing future restoration and management actions to be proposed acknowledgments this study was

6618,nowadays alteration of the natural flow regime is considered one the most widespread and damaging impacts for river ecosystems hence increasing our understanding of large scale hydrological alteration patterns would help us design more effective water use policies the present study aims to establish general patterns of hydrological alteration caused by dams on a national level with spain as a case study first we developed a classification of the natural flow regime of the spanish river network which served as the reference to assess the degree of hydrological alteration of 139 altered river gauges in addition using the flow series of the altered river gauges we defined a set of 7 types of altered regimes tars which allowed the stratification of the analyses the results revealed that the magnitude and direction of hydrological alteration depended on the natural flow class of the altered rivers in this regard major effects of dams on spanish rivers were related to the modification of the intra annual variability of daily flow the magnitude of seasonal maximum and minimum flows and the patterns of high flow events our results also showed that the distribution of the tars partially followed a geographic order but associations between tars and natural flow classes were not straightforward in addition we highlighted that the nature of the hydrological alteration was

et al 2010 was designed to aid water managers in the decision making process including environmental flow protection according to eloha identifying and quantifying the degree to which the flow regime departs from natural conditions i e the hydrological alteration might provide a better understanding of the degree of river ecosystem impairment piqué et al 2016 and improve reservoir management conservation and restoration practices black et al 2005 zimmerman et al 2018 the assessment of hydrological alteration has commonly been carried out at scales ranging from a specific reach affected by a dam or reservoir e g magilligan and nislow 2005 maingi and marsh 2002 yang et al 2008 to individual drainages belmar et al 2013 piqué et al 2016 radinger et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2017 however the development of most of these studies implied the need for pre and post dam flow records which are normally absent from most altered rivers peñas et al 2016 sengupta et al 2018 thus management decisions are limited to a small fraction of all river reaches in a given geographic area eng et al 2013 developing a general framework that allows us to understand the patterns of hydrological alteration generated by dams at broader scales is therefore critical in order to aid management decisions carlisle et al 2011 highlighted the lack of systematic assessments of hydrological alteration across the united states and there are still very few studies mcmanamay et al 2012 poff et al 2007 zimmerman et al 2018 that have analyzed the dominant types of hydrological alteration in large areas these studies have stressed that there are two primary reasons that make generalizations of hydrological alteration caused by dams difficult to assess the variability of reservoir attributes hampers the prediction of their potential hydrological alteration thus the use of the actual flow records to stratify types of altered regimes rather than these attributes might reduce the noise resulting from this uncertainty second the magnitude and direction of the alteration might also depend upon the natural characteristics of the impacted river mcmanamay et al 2012 zimmerman et al 2018 additionally it must be noted that most large scale studies of hydrological alterations have been done in the conterminous united states all this serves to emphasize that greater efforts should be made to understand the general patterns of hydrological alteration in other regions especially in areas with a high degree of alteration such as the iberian peninsula according to eloha principles poff et al 2010 hydrological classifications of the natural flow regime are very valuable tools for assessing large scale hydrological alteration standing on two factors first the natural hydrological variability of each class represents the baseline condition against which hydrological alteration might be assessed peñas et al 2016 hence the use of predictive classifications avoids the use of only sites with pre and post dam data and allows the analyses to be expanded to much larger regions in addition the definition of flow classes can be used to stratify the analyses and serve as the organizational structure to aid in the definition and understanding of the differences in hydrological alteration between rivers of different flow classes arthington et al 2006 mcmanamay et al 2012 the main objective of this study is to assess and define the general patterns of hydrological alteration caused by dams in spain our specific objectives are to 1 assess how dams influence the most relevant attributes driving the natural hydrological variability of the river network on a national scale 2 define types of altered regimes in spain based exclusively on gauged flow series and 3 evaluate how hydrological alteration varies across rivers belonging to different hydrological classes i e rivers with contrasting hydrological behaviors we expect that natural flow regimes will influence the hydrological alteration patterns in addition we expect to find a certain degree of association between the geographical distribution of the types of altered regimes and the environmental characteristics of the catchments and between the type of altered regime and the registered dam uses and operational rules in order to meet these objectives we developed and used a predictive hydrological classification of the spanish river network 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area comprised continental spain fig 1 spain covers a total area of 550 000 km2 and presents catchments with areas ranging from several hundred square kilometers to more than 70 000 km2 the relief is organized into large units around a high interior plateau the meseta which occupies 45 of the total surface area and is located over 600 m above sea level masl surrounding the meseta is the cantabrian mountain range to the north the iberian system to the east and sierra morena to the south the pyrenees on the northeastern border and the bético system in the southeast are located outside the central plateau and reach altitudes over 3400 masl in addition spain is dominated by a mediterranean climate ranging from xeric and desertic to pluvioseasonal while the northern border is dominated by a temperate oceanic climate rivas martínez et al 2004 given this heterogeneity there is high variability in water resource availability across the country over 1200 dams have been built since the beginning of the 20th century to cope with the water demands of the population and agriculture and to a lesser degree energy production 2 2 hydrological data and hydrological indices the hydrological database used in this study consisted of daily mean flows in the 1976 2016 period from 1290 gauge stations provided by the center for hydrographic studies cedex ministry of public works and ministry for ecological transition spain and various water agencies and regional governments first we segregated natural and altered river gauges natural river gauges were those unaffected by impoundments or large upstream abstractions and with upstream catchment agriculture or forest plantation land cover under 50 in addition an analysis of the natural flow series was carried out to eliminate years without desirable data quality following the criteria established in peñas et al 2014 we then selected the altered river gauges with optimal characteristics to carry out further analyses in this regard we considered only 1 gauges in rivers affected by a minimum of one and a maximum of three upstream impoundments except in two cases were 4 and 5 dams upstream were allowed and 2 gauges with a ratio of impounded catchment area catchment area in the impoundment and catchment area at the gauging station over 0 3 for both natural and altered river gauges years with more than 30 days of missing data were removed from the analysis and in the last step we discarded the gauges that accounted for 8 years in the 1976 2016 period after applying these restrictions 282 and 139 natural and altered rivers gauges respectively were selected fig 1 supplementary material table s3 daily flow series from both natural and altered river gauges were normalized by dividing all daily flow values by the mean annual flow poff et al 2006 snelder et al 2009 next a set of 85 ecologically meaningful hydrological indices his were calculated olden and poff 2003 richter et al 1996 supplementary material table s1 2 3 environmental information in order to produce a classification of the natural flow regime for the entire river network section 2 4 the definition of a spatial framework to integrate the environmental and hydrological information is needed to achieve this goal a virtual watershed barquín et al 2015 was developed using flow directions inferred from a 10 m digital elevation model dem with netmap tools benda et al 2007 the virtual watershed was ultimately composed of 130 606 river reaches with an average length of 986 m predictor variables describing several environmental attributes that are hypothesized to be important discriminators of the hydrological regime including climate topography land cover and geology were extracted from existing national gis databases provided by several national and regional organizations detailed information about these environmental variables and information sources can be found in supplementary material table s2 and peñas et al 2014 2 4 development of natural flow regime classification we produced a classification of the natural flow regimes hereafter hydrological classification for the entire river network to analyze how different types of hydrological alteration are related to the unaltered hydrological nature of rivers the hydrological classification was derived using the predict then classify strategy fig 2 peñas et al 2014 snelder and booker 2013 starting from the 85 his obtained from each natural river gauge section 2 2 the predict then classify strategy includes the following 4 steps 1 principal component analysis pca on the 85 his obtained from each natural river gauge to create a reduced set of non correlated synthetic indices sinat 2 development of empirical models using random forest rf of the sinat based on catchment variables climatic topographical geological and land cover 3 prediction of the sinat for river reaches in the entire river network without a gauge and 4 clustering of river reaches to create natural classes nc for the entire river network using the partitioning around medoids algorithm the broken stick method bs jackson 1993 was applied to define the optimal set of sinats to define ncs given that a priori we did not know the optimal number of ncs we produced hydrological classifications with numbers of ncs ranging from 2 to 50 then classification strength cs van sickle 1997 and anova on selected his were carried out to determine the optimal number of classes briefly cs is calculated from the difference between the mean dissimilarity of the gauges in the same class dwithin and the mean dissimilarity of gauges in the other classes dbetween higher cs values indicated a greater uniformity within classes and greater differences between classes van sickle 1997 following the procedure outlined in snelder and booker 2013 and snelder et al 2012 cs analysis was performed on gauges not used in the fitted models by means of a fivefold cross validation procedure hastie et al 2001 to focus on the predictive performance of the classifications and smooth out the variability inherent to each subset in addition we performed an anova on the his 9 with the highest values in the sinats of the pca which in turn are related to the hydrological interpretation of each sinat the anova used class membership as the explanatory variable and allowed for the analysis of the potential of classifications to discriminate each of the his the coefficient of determination r2 was calculated for each level 2 to 50 class level of the hydrological classifications 2 5 definition of types of altered regimes we defined types of altered regimes tar using the hydrological regimes recorded in the altered river gauges using a simplified classification procedure compared to that used in section 2 4 which lacks a prediction process the definition of tar started from the 85 his obtained from each altered river gauge section 2 2 and included two steps 1 principal component analysis pca to obtain a reduced set of non correlated synthetic indices sialt and 2 clustering of gauges with altered flow regimes to create tars using the partitioning around medoids algorithm the bs method jackson 1993 was applied to define the optimal set of sialts to further create the tars we produced classifications with numbers of tars ranging from 2 to 20 again we used cs and anova to define the optimal number of tars nonetheless it must be noted that the generation of tars did not entail any prediction process hence cs analysis and anova were performed on the same gauges used in the definition of the tars next we analyzed the spatial distribution of the tars we compared the latitude coordinate x and longitude coordinate y of the altered river gauges with one way analysis of variance anova using tar as the fixed factor post hoc comparisons were made using tukey s test to explore differences between specific tar pairs finally we analyzed the degree of association between the tars and the purposes of the reservoirs first we defined the purposes of the reservoirs using official information from the ministry for ecological transition which is responsible for compiling this data reservoir purposes were defined as irrigation ir water supply ws hydropower generation hp or any combination of them ir hp ir ws hp ws ir hp ws then we applied a fisher s exact test to analyze significant associations between tar and reservoir purposes p values were simulated following the monte carlo simulation procedure using 106 replicates in addition to avoid problems regarding zeros in the contingency table we performed two separate fisher test analyses in the first we eliminated reservoir purposes that presented zeros in any tar in the second we eliminated tars that presented zeros in any reservoir purpose 2 6 assessment of large scale hydrological alteration the characterization and interpretation of nationwide patterns of hydrological alteration were done according to the tar and the nc to which the altered river gauges should belong in the absence of dams to this end we assessed the degree of hydrological alteration of each altered river gauge and the tar nc pairs according to the following procedure 1 each altered river gauge was assigned a nc based on the specific river reach where it was located 2 for each altered river gauge sinats values were calculated according to the 85 hydrological indices calculated previously to this end the rotation factors of the sinats i e the eigenvectors obtained from the pca performed on the natural river gauges section 2 3 were applied to the 85 his of each altered river gauge 3 all the altered river gauges that belonged to the same tar and the same nc were grouped tar nc pairs 4 for each tar nc pair the magnitude and direction of change of the sinats of the altered river gauges with respect to the natural river gauges in their same nc were estimated we used the kruscal wallis k w to test whether these differences were significant analyses were done with the restriction that there should be at least three natural river gauges and three altered river gauges in each tar nc pair comparison this restriction considerably reduced the number of available altered river gauges 3 results 3 1 development of a natural flow regime classification the first four sinats of the pca performed on the natural river gauges explained 84 of the variance the hydrological interpretation of each sinat was carried out by attending to the his with the highest values in each sinat of the pca hence sinat 1 was negatively related to the intra annual variability of daily flows l2 in addition sinat 1 was also negatively related to the magnitude of seasonal maximum flows 90hf while it was positively related to the magnitude of seasonal minimum flows 90lf sinat 2 was positively related to the duration of high flow events dphigh but negatively to the frequency of these events fre3 sinat 3 was negatively related to the interannual variability of minimum flow timing sdjmin and the interannual variability of the magnitude of september flows sdm9 lastly sinat 4 was positively related to the magnitude of spring flows m4 and their interannual variability sdm4 mean r2 value of rf models was 0 5 finally the classification performance assessed through cs showed a sharp increase in cs from 2 to 7 nc while it presented a gradual improvement from 8 to 20 nc fig 3 a anova analyses were consistent with the performance results exhibited by cs supplementary material figure s1 we chose 20 ncs as the optimal level to classify the river network as cs did not reveal significant differences i e overlapping among standard error bars beyond this class level in addition a visual inspection of the geographic distribution of the ncs revealed agreement with prior knowledge of the study area fig 4 only ncs that maintained at least one group of tar nc gauges were considered in the assessment of the hydrological alteration patterns consequently we ignored ncs 2 4 6 9 11 12 15 16 17 18 and 19 in further analyses here we only described the hydrological characteristics of the ncs that were relevant to subsequently understanding the hydrological alteration patterns according to the hydrological interpretation of the sinat presented below nc1 exhibited high intra annual flow variability which reflected a major contrast in the magnitude of maximum and minimum seasonal flows fig 3b nc1 also exhibited the highest interannual variability of minimum flow timing and magnitude nc3 presented low intra annual flow variability and was distinguished by very few but long lasting high flow events fig 3b nc3 also exhibited low interannual variability of minimum flow magnitude and timing nc5 presented one of the most stable annual flow regimes in addition nc5 presented the highest values in sinat 4 which reflects both large magnitude spring flows and high interannual variability fig 3b in addition nc5 presented very few but long lasting high flow events nc7 exhibited the most stable annual flow regimes the stability of the rivers in nc7 is also reflected in the low interannual variability of spring flows sinat 4 fig 3b in addition owing to this flow stability the high sinat 2 values of nc7 could be interpreted as regimes characterized by long periods of flows exceeding the high flow threshold considered 25 percent exceedance nc8 was characterized by low interannual variability of the timing and magnitude of minimum annual flows nc8 also presented high magnitude spring flows nc10 presented low sinat 2 values which was interpreted as rivers with frequent but short high flow events in addition nc10 presented rivers with low interannual variability of the timing and magnitude of low flows nc13 and nc20 exhibited similar hydrological characteristics fig 3 and similar geographical distribution north catchments fig 4 they exhibited the highest frequency of high flow events in addition analysis of the monthly flow regime not included highlighted that nc13 in contrast to nc20 presented a second high flow peak during the spring which might be related to snowmelt processes while nc20 presented a peak only during winter months lastly nc14 was characterized by rivers with the lowest annual stability in the study area 3 2 generation of types of altered regimes the first seven sialts of the pcaalt performed on the gauges with altered flow regimes explained the 90 of variance the hydrological interpretation of each sialt was also done according to the his with the highest values and their sign in the pcaalt sialt 1 was positively related to the magnitude of monthly 30hf and weekly 7hf maximum flows and the intra annual variability of daily flows l2 sialt 2 exhibited an inverse relationship with the interannual variability of summer flows sdm8 while sialt 3 was related to the interannual variability of minimum flows sdbfi and sd1lf sialt 4 was positively related to the frequency of high flow events nphigh and sdnphigh sialt 5 was negatively related to the mean value of april flows m4 and sdm4 and sialt 6 presented a direct relationship with the magnitude of minimum annual flows x95 finally sialt 7 was related with the variability of october flows sdm10 the cs analysis showed a marked increase in this statistic from 2 to 7 tars fig 5 this agreed with anova of selected his supplementary material figure s2 hence we selected 7 as the optimal number of tars the analysis of the spatial distribution patterns of tars indicated that both x f6 138 6 62 p value 0 01 and y f6 138 7 31 p value 0 01 coordinates presented significant differences according to tar fig 6 a moreover tukey s test highlighted that each of the 7 tars presented significant differences with at least 1 tar in one of the coordinate axes table 1 nine ncs held at least 1 tar with the minimum number of altered river gauges established to perform analyses 3 and 89 altered river gauges remained table 2 and fig 6b and c finally given the absence of tar nc pair in tar7 it was removed from the hydrological alteration assessment finally none of the tars showed predilection for any of the reservoir purposes table 3 the analysis of the association between tars and reservoir purposes did not present significant results in either of the two fisher tests performed i e when reservoir purposes that presented zeros in any tar were discarded p value greater than 0 07 and when tars that presented zeros in any reservoir use were discarded p value greater than 0 28 in order to reduce the potential noise associated with the reservoir size we repeated the fisher tests but omitting those reservoirs showing low storage index tests using only those reservoirs with storage index above the 25th and 50th percentile also revealed a lack of significant association between tars and reservoir purposes results not shown 3 3 assessment of large scale hydrological alteration in total we performed 80 comparisons between natural and altered river gauges 20 tar nc groups multiplied by 4 sinat half of the k w analyses 40 of these comparisons yielded significant differences table 4 four tar nc pairs presented a significant increase in sinat 1 with respect to the mean of their respective ncs table 4 and fig 7 this means that gauges in these tar nc groups presented lower intra annual variability of daily flows and smaller seasonal maximum flows than the means of their respective ncs in contrast four tar nc groups presented a significant decrease in sinat 1 i e gauges in these groups exhibited the opposite hydrological alteration table 4 and fig 7 in thirteen out of twenty tar nc pairs analyzed a significant decrease in the value of sinat 2 was found table 4 and fig 7 this translates into more frequent high flow events but of a shorter duration in contrast four tar nc pairs presented a significant increase in this sinat in parallel five tar nc pairs presented a significant decrease in sinat 3 while only tar2 nc13 and tar2 nc20 exhibited a significant increase table 4 and fig 8 a decrease in sinat 3 indicated greater variability of both the timing and magnitude of minimum flows finally k w analysis identified significant decreases and increases in sinat 4 in six and two tar nc groups respectively table 4 and fig 8 an increase in sinat 4 meant a reduction in the mean and interannual variability of the magnitude of spring flows 4 discussion our results showed how dams modify the most relevant features in the determination of large scale hydrological variability patterns in spanish rivers a 20 nc hydrological classification served as the basis to represent unaltered hydrological conditions and a classification of the altered flow regimes composed of 7 tars defined the most common altered hydrological regimes the integration of both classifications was critical to interpreting and understanding the main patterns of hydrological alteration our results showed that all the tar nc pairs generated a significant alteration of at least one sinat moreover some tar nc pairs produced a significant alteration of all sinats the intra annual variability of daily flows and the frequency and duration of high flow events were the most commonly altered hydrological features consistent with our initial expectations the results highlighted that the magnitude and direction of the hydrological alterations caused by each tar were highly associated with the ncs our results also highlighted that tars presented a certain degree of geographical dependence this means that tars were not uniquely influenced by the presence of the reservoir but they still presented a certain influence of the climatic and other environmental characteristics of the basin moreover contrary to expectations this study demonstrated that there was not a direct relationship between the tars defined here and the registered purposes of the dams 4 1 development of a natural flow regime classification the procedure followed to develop the natural flow classification has been proved to be scientifically suitable and accurate by several studies peñas et al 2014 snelder and booker 2013 hydrological classification identified intra annual variability of daily flows magnitude of seasonal maximum and minimum flows sinat 1 and frequency and duration of high flow events sinat 2 as the major natural hydrological gradients in the study area the variability of the magnitude of the minimum monthly flows the variability of timing of minimum flows sinat 3 and the magnitude and variability of spring flows sinat 4 were also important gradients to segregate rivers most of the hydrological characteristics found to be critical in the classification were consistent with those used in a classification covering only the northern third of spain peñas et al 2014 this was not surprising given that the area covered by peñas et al 2014 included catchments covering some of the most marked environmental gradients in spain alvarez cabria et al 2016 peñas et al 2018 nonetheless other hydrological characteristics not considered in peñas et al 2014 such as frequency and duration of high flow events and the variability of minimum flow timing have also appeared as determinant variables that explain the hydrological variability of spanish rivers the inclusion of all spanish catchments has increased the range of environmental characteristics considered and thereby added greater hydrological variability compared to prior classifications of spanish catchments belmar et al 2011 peñas et al 2014 solans and garcía de jalón 2016 regarding the number of ncs we deemed 20 ncs to be an appropriate balance to account for the hydrological variability of spanish rivers while maintaining a minimum number of altered river gauges in each nc to perform further analyses the selection of 20 ncs was consistent with other hydrological classifications developed under the principles of the eloha framework in spanish catchments peñas et al 2016 solans and garcía de jalón 2016 both of these works proposed hydrological classifications composed of 6 natural classes but it must be noted that they also considered proportionally smaller study areas than that covered here the cs analysis fig 3a and anova supplementary material figure s1 highlighted that a classification composed of more than 20 ncs would not reflect a greater uniformity within classes and or greater differences between classes in contrast the selection of a more detailed classification would have reduced the number of ncs in which the large scale patterns of hydrological alteration could be assessed 4 2 generation of types of altered regimes the results indicated that the development of tars based on the flow regime series of altered gauges provide a more appropriate strategy to understand patterns of hydrological alteration than using an a priori sorting of dams based on their registered uses in this regard contrary to expectations none of the seven tars presented a direct relationship with any of the official registered dam uses table 3 poff and hart 2002 stressed that developing a classification based on reservoir operation is difficult as several classification criteria vary across different disciplines hence the effects of dams should be defined by the way they modify the natural flow regime poff and hart 2002 as has been done through the definition of tars the his with the highest values in the sialt of the pcaalt varied dramatically in comparison to the his with the highest values in the sinat in order to clarify what this result entails it must be pointed out that the hydrological interpretation of the hydrological classifications and the tars is based on the percentage of variance explained by each si sinat and sialt respectively and the his with the highest loads in each si in this regard the first three sialts which account for more than 66 of the variance at the altered river gauges were related to his that did not even appear in any of the sinat for instance magnitude of monthly and weekly maximum flows sialt 1 interannual variability of summer flows sialt 2 and interannual variability of the daily and weekly minimum flows sialt 3 conversely many other hydrological characteristics captured by pcanat such as the magnitude of seasonal maximum and minimum flows timing of minimum flows and the magnitude and the interannual variability of spring flows did not appear in any of the sialts however it should also be noted that not all the signals of the natural variability patterns have been lost at the altered river gauges such as the intra annual variability of daily flows or characteristics related to the frequency of high flow events finally the analysis of the spatial distribution of the tars revealed that there was a certain degree of geographical dependence fig 6 several studies e g peñas et al 2014 reidy liermann et al 2012 snelder and booker 2013 acknowledge the direct response of the distribution of ncs to environmental gradients related to climate geology land uses or catchment configuration we believe that this geographical dependence is related to the environmental characteristics of the catchment which might still exert certain control over the hydrological behavior of the altered rivers in this context radinger et al 2018 found that in the ebro river catchment the alteration of mean annual flows seasonality and summer flows was mainly related to climate and land use patterns and not only to the presence of dams nonetheless the influence of dams on the flow regime is stronger than the control exerted by the environmental characteristics of the catchment poff et al 2007 as demonstrated by the lack of significant differences between many of the tars and their geographical dependence 4 3 assessment of large scale hydrological alteration our results suggested that dams did not possess the capacity to modify the entire range of natural hydrological characteristics analyzed in this study and represented by the sinat but they would produce significant effects on specific hydrological characteristics depending on the tar and the nc that the altered river gauges were assigned this is consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated that the magnitude and direction of the effects of dams are strongly influenced by the natural flow class membership the specific operational rules of the dam and the analyzed hydrological characteristic mcmanamay et al 2012 for instance several studies have found general patterns concerning the effects of dams such as a decrease in maximum flows and daily flow variability belmar et al 2013 costigan and daniels 2012 magilligan and nislow 2005 poff et al 2007 and an increase in minimum flows batalla et al 2004 gao et al 2012 poff et al 2007 zimmerman et al 2018 as stated above these three hydrological characteristics are partially considered in sinat 1 contrary to the general patterns found elsewhere our results highlighted that the directionality of the alteration varied in relation to the nc and to a lesser extent to the tar for instance nc3 and nc7 were characterized by low intra annual variability of daily flows small magnitude maximum seasonal flows and large magnitude minimum seasonal flows fig 7 in both ncs we found a significant decrease in sinat 1 for at least one tar i e an increase in the intra annual variability of daily flows and the magnitude of maximum seasonal flows and a decrease in the magnitude of minimum seasonal flows in contrast we found the opposite alteration in nc10 in which three out of five analyses revealed significant decreases table 4 nc10 was composed of rivers with high interannual variability nonetheless these patterns could not be generalized for all ncs for instance nc8 was characterized by sinat 1 values similar to those of nc10 but dams generated the opposite effect moreover in nc13 the direction of the significant hydrological alteration depended upon the specific tar analyzed the most common form of alteration was the frequency and duration of high flow events represented by sinat 2 in most of the cases we found a significant decrease of this parameter given that the frequency and duration of high flow events is highly correlated this decrease is translated in the increase in the number of events through the year which implies the reduction in the length in days of each event most of the nc tar pairs that presented significant alterations to this sinat 2 nc1 nc3 nc5 nc7 nc8 and nc14 table 4 presented a relatively low frequency of high flow events fig 3 meanwhile nc10 and nc13 presented higher frequencies of high flow events than the other ncs in these two ncs the direction of the alteration was not as clear and depended upon the analyzed tar assessments of the alteration caused by dams to the frequency of high flow events across the united states showed a lack of consistency in the responses magilligan and nislow 2005 mcmanamay et al 2012 this highlighted again the dependence of the response increase decrease on the hydrological nature of the altered river making any generalization difficult if the ncs are not considered patterns similar to those described above were also observed in the analysis of the alteration of sinat 3 in this case the altered river gauges assigned to the ncs with the highest values in this sinat e g tar1 nc10 tar3 nc8 or tar5 nc10 fig 8 tended to undergo a decrease in the sinat 3 value while the opposite result was observed at the altered river gauges assigned to the nc that presented the lowest values e g tar2 nc13 or tar2 nc20 fig 8 sinat 3 was related to the interannual variability of the magnitude and timing of minimum flows in five out of seven cases where analysis revealed significant alterations a reduction in this variability was observed in most cases the ultimate objective or capacity of dams is to regulate the flow regime poff and hart 2002 thus this result was not surprising nonetheless as highlighted by mcmanamay 2014 in cases where the natural flow regime is very stable dams could create abnormally higher variability regarding sinat 4 the patterns of alteration were not as clear and several tar nc pairs did not comply with the aforementioned rule i e a decrease in sinat values in tars with the highest sinat values and an increase in sinat values in the opposite situation e g tar2 nc10 tar4 nc10 tar2 nc13 tar4 nc13 and tar2 nc20 sinat 4 represented the magnitude of spring flows and their interannual variability sources of spring flows vary largely across natural flow classes as they can be influenced by different climatological processes bejarano et al 2010 including snowmelt rain or the starting point of the dry season which present a marked gradient in the study area rivas martínez et al 2004 hence it is likely to find a heterogeneous range of altered responses according to the nc and the tar as was the case 5 conclusion most studies on hydrological alteration caused by dams are carried out on a local scale this is one of the first attempts worldwide and the only one in spain and europe aimed at unraveling patterns of large scale hydrological alteration our results showed that the magnitude and direction of the hydrological alteration is highly dependent on the pre dam characteristics of the affected river hence it has been verified that the use of hydrological classifications provides a suitable framework for organizing information in order to assess the hydrological alteration the assessment of hydrological alteration patterns has indicated that the most common form of alteration was the increase in the number of high flow events and the reduction in the length of these events according to our results two aspects should be stressed in future hydrological alteration studies first the tars presented a certain degree of geographical dependence this indicates that the environmental characteristics of the catchment and not only the presence of dams exerted certain control over the altered rivers in addition we did not find any relationships among the tars and the purpose of the dam this result implies that classifying reservoirs according to their purpose is not very useful when analyzing the patterns of hydrological alteration and the potential ecological consequences of the alteration in sum this study revealed that both the definition of ncs and tars are essential to unraveling large scale hydrological alteration patterns in addition most dams nowadays at least in spain are equipped with automatic monitoring systems to track water inputs outputs volume etc although public access to these data is limited in most cases the availability of the flow series released from dams would allow each dam to be assigned to a tar this combined with the nc of the river downstream would multiply the number of rivers to be potentiality assessed these assessments will aid in the understanding of the hydrological alteration patterns caused by dams and the relationships of this alteration with the effects on river ecosystem functioning as well as ultimately allowing future restoration and management actions to be proposed acknowledgments this study was

wrc parameters soil bulk density ρb variations affect the accuracy of k u estimates in this study we extend the mualem van genuchten model to account for the ρb effect with ρb related wrc and k s models we apply two functions a and b that relate the van genuchten wrc model to ρb and two models 1 and 2 that estimate k s with various ρb by combining the ρb related wrc functions and k s models we develop four integrated approaches i e a1 a2 b1 and b2 for estimating k u at various ρb k u measurements made on five soils with various textures and ρb are used to evaluate the accuracy of the four approaches the results show that all approaches produce reasonable k u estimates with average root mean square errors rmses less than 0 35 expressed in dimensionless unit because logarithmic k u values are used approach a2 with an average rmse of 0 25 agrees better with k u measurements than does approach a1 that has an average rmse of 0 28 this is because model 2 accounts for the wrc shape effect near saturation approaches a1 and a2 give more accurate k u estimates than do approaches b1 and b2 which both have average rmses of 0 35 because function a performs better in estimating wrcs than does function b the proposed approaches could be incorporated into simulation models for improved prediction of water solute and gas transport in soils keywords soil hydraulic conductivity water

has been widely used jansson 1998 šimůnek et al 2005 there is a need to relate the mualem van genuchten 1980 model parameters to ρb for an improved understanding of water transport in dynamic soil systems tian et al 2018c related the parameters used in the van genuchten 1980 wrc model to ρb using a series of ρb related empirical functions two approaches for estimating wrcs of soils at various ρb values were developed by tian et al 2018c the mualem and assouline 1989 method has the potential to be combined with the van genuchten 1980 wrc function for estimating k s of soils at various ρb but it has not been evaluated with measured k s values the tian et al 2018c approaches and the mualem and assouline 1989 method are promising for application to the mualem van genuchten 1980 hydraulic conductivity estimation model for taking into account the effect of ρb the objectives of this study are to 1 relate the mualem van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic conductivity estimation model parameters to ρb 2 introduce four approaches to estimate k u for soil over a range of ρb values and 3 evaluate and compare the performance of the four approaches for estimating k u using measured values 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development the mualem van genuchten model has been widely used for describing soil hydraulic properties van genuchten 1980 in this model the soil wrc is expressed by 1 s θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α ψ n m ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where s is the effective degree of saturation θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 at soil water matric potential ψ kpa θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents m3 m 3 respectively and α kpa 1 n and m are empirical shape parameters in which m is commonly expressed as m 1 1 n to derive a closed form solution for the mualem 1976 relative hydraulic conductivity model the mualem van genuchten 1980 hydraulic conductivity function is given as follows 2 k s k s l 1 1 s n n 1 1 1 n 2 ψ 0 k ψ 0 where k is the hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 k is a matching point at saturation mm h 1 and l is an empirical pore connectivity parameter a measured k s is commonly used for k while l is fixed at 0 5 mualem 1976 the k u θ or k u ψ relationship is obtained by combining eqs 1 and 2 variation in ρb can have a significant effect on the estimation of k u assouline 2006a thus it is necessary to relate the mualem van genuchten 1980 model to ρb for improved prediction of water movement in soil systems with spatially and or temporally variable ρb tian et al 2018c extended the four parameters in eq 1 to account for the ρb dependence with the following equations 3 θ s ρ s ρ b ρ s ρ b 0 θ s 0 4 θ r ρ b ρ b 0 θ r 0 5 α α 0 ρ b ρ b 0 3 97 where the subscript 0 refers to parameters under a reference ρb condition and ρs is the soil particle density mg m 3 a linear relationship between parameter n and ρb has been reported by several studies assouline et al 1997 fu shao 2007 jiang et al 2017 6a n a ρ b b where a and b are empirical parameters that vary with soil type to obtain a and b at least two n values at two reference bulk densities are needed tian et al 2018c observed a relatively moderate relationship compared to the linear relationship between n and ρb as follows 6b n 1 n 0 1 ρ b ρ b 0 0 97 1 28 f s i l t f c l a y where f silt f clay is the ratio between the soil silt content and clay content that are determined according to the usda soil textural classification and n 0 is the fitted n value at the reference ρb0 condition unlike eq 6a eq 6b estimates n values at various ρb using only one reference n 0 value and thus it has the advantage of simplicity by substituting eqs 3 6 into eq 1 the van genuchten 1980 wrc model is extended to take into account the effects of ρb to simplify the expression of the model function we set the value of ρb0 to be 1 0 mg m 3 then the ρb related eq 1 is normalized as follows 7 s θ ρ b θ r 0 ρ s ρ b ρ s 1 θ s 0 ρ b θ r 0 1 1 ρ b 3 97 α 0 ψ n 1 1 n ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where n is expressed as eq 6a or eq 6b with ρb0 1 0 mg m 3 note ρb ρb0 and ρs in eq 7 are assumed to be unitless parameters to make units match the k s also varies with ρb jabro 1992 after comparing eight different models that related k s to ρb assouline 2006b concluded that the following kozeny carman equation based model had the best agreement with k s measurements 8 k s k s 0 η η 0 3 ρ b ρ b 0 δ 7 where η 1 ρb ρs is the soil total porosity and δ is an empirical parameter assouline 2006b observed that δ 4 gave the best overall agreement with the k s measurements for soils used in his study k s0 and η0 are parameters under the reference ρb0 condition by setting ρb0 to 1 0 mg m 3 eq 8 is normalized as 9 k s k s 0 ρ s ρ b ρ s 1 3 ρ b 3 in addition mualem and assouline 1989 developed a semi theoretical model to estimate k s under various ρb conditions using soil wrc model functions 10 k s k s 0 θ s θ r θ s 0 θ r 0 l 2 0 1 ψ 1 d s ψ 0 1 ψ 1 d s 0 ψ 2 where s ψ represents a wrc model function e g the brooks and corey 1964 model and s 0 is the effective degree of saturation at the reference ρb0 the empirical pore connectivity parameter l 0 5 also used in eq 2 is adopted in eq 10 assouline 2006a combined eq 10 with the brooks and corey 1964 and the assouline et al 1998 wrc functions for estimating soil k s of at various ρb values in the present study the van genuchten 1980 wrc function is applied to this model by substituting eqs 1 3 and 4 into eq 10 performing integration details about the integral calculation are shown in the appendix a and setting ρb0 to 1 0 mg m 3 we derive a new k s model as follows 11 k s k s 0 ρ s ρ b ρ s 1 θ s 0 ρ b θ r 0 θ s 0 θ r 0 2 5 ρ b 3 97 2 2 2 approaches for estimating k u for soils at various ρb values so far we have introduced two van genuchten wrc functions i e eqs 7 6a and eqs 7 6b designated as function a and function b respectively that relate model parameters to ρb and two k s models i e eqs 9 and 11 designated as model 1 and model 2 respectively that include ρb as a variable tian et al 2018c indicated that function a gave more accurate wrc estimates than did function b while function b had the advantage of simplicity over function a model 1 was developed based on the kozeny carman equation while model 2 included wrc model functions as variables by combining these wrc functions and k s models with eq 2 we obtained the following four approaches that can be used to estimate k u for soils at various ρb values approaches a1 eq 2 function a and model 1 a2 eq 2 function a and model 2 b1 eq 2 function b and model 1 and b2 eq 2 function b and model 2 water retention curve parameters and k s0 value at the reference ρb0 of 1 0 mg m 3 are required for the proposed approaches but they can be obtained using measurements made on samples with any known ρb for example parameters θs0 and θr0 at ρb0 of 1 0 mg m 3 can be calculated from θs and θr measurements on soil samples with a known ρb by solving eqs 3 and 4 note considering that θr is the water content at which soil k u approaches zero we set θr as the θ determined at 1500 kpa following tian et al 2018c when θ measurements at 1500 kpa are not available the best fit values are used for function a three unknown parameters α0 a and b are obtained by fitting eqs 6a 7 to wrc measurements simultaneously with the least squares method for a specific soil both a and b rely on ρb thus at least two wrc curves at two markedly different ρb values are required to derive the best fit a and b values tian et al 2018c for function b n depends on ρb and soil texture f silt f clay thus unknown parameters α0 and n 0 can be obtained by fitting eqs 6b 7 to one wrc measurement at a known ρb value tian et al 2018c in this case ρb can be any specific value the k s at the required ρb condition can be directly calculated with eq 8 or eq 10 from a k s measurement with a known ρb or it can be obtained by using the normalized k s model eq 9 or 11 the k s0 in eq 9 is estimated from the ks measurement at a known ρb by solving eq 9 likewise the k s0 in eq 11 can be estimated from θs0 and θr0 estimates and a k s measurement made on soil with a known ρb by solving the equation 2 3 experimental validation to evaluate the performance of the four approaches for estimating soil k u with variable ρb the measurements of k s k u and wrc made on five soils with different textures and ρb values were used as validation datasets table 1 presents the basic physical properties of the soils the datasets of soils 1 3 were from laliberte et al 1966 who measured the main drying wrcs of the soils at three or four ρb values and the k s and k u ψ values were determined at another five ρb conditions table 1 the different ρb conditions were achieved by packing soil columns with a vibrating device for soils 4 and 5 we measured the wrc k s and k u ψ values at various ρb values table 1 the soil samples were air dried passed through a 2 mm screen mixed with predetermined amounts of water and then packed uniformly into stainless steel containers at different ρb values the wrcs of soils 4 and 5 were determined at a range of ψ values 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 kpa with a tension table eijkelkamp giesbeek the netherlands and at 30 50 100 500 and 1500 kpa with a pressure plate apparatus soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca these wrcs have been reported in tian et al 2018c the k s of soil samples at different ρb were determined by using the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 three replicated wrc and k s measurements were made for each soil and each ρb the k u ψ curves of soils 4 and 5 were determined with a hyprop device ums gmbh munich germany following the simplified evaporation method schindler 1980 peters et al 2015 the wrcs at the lowest and highest ρb values table 1 were applied to calculate the θs0 and θr0 and to obtain the best fit α0 a and b values in approaches a1 and a2 the α0 and n 0 values in approaches b1 and b2 were obtained by fitting eqs 6b 7 to the wrc measurements at the lowest ρb then wrc parameters at the ρb for determining k u were estimated using the proposed functions the k s0 values in eqs 9 and 11 were determined by using a k s measurement at a known ρb substantial variation usually occurred in k s measurements on the same soil van genuchten et al 1991 in consideration of this variability all k s measurements at different ρb were applied for the calculation of k s0 and the average values were used to estimate k u the k u ψ values for each soil at different ρb were then estimated accordingly and compared with the measured data the root mean square error rmse and bias between the estimated and measured k u values were used to evaluate the performance of the approaches 12 r m s e log 10 k u e s t i m a t e d log 10 k u m e a s u r e d 2 n 13 b i a s log 10 k u e s t i m a t e d log 10 k u m e a s u r e d n where n is the number of data points logarithmic values of k u were used in eqs 12 and 13 to avoid deviations toward high conductivities in the wet range the rmse and bias are presented as dimensionless numbers because logarithmic conductivity values were used we also calculated the best fit k s values to evaluate the performance of models 1 and 2 for estimating k s the best fit k s was obtained by fitting eq 2 in which the parameters s and n were estimated using function a to measured k u ψ values using the least squares method the goodness of fit was quantified with the rmse between estimated and measured k u values the best fit k s represents the most suitable value for the matching point at saturation i e k in eq 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil wrc estimates at various ρb values fig 1 presents the wrc estimates of the five soils using function a and function b instead of the conventional θ ψ relationship the wrcs presented here show ψ as a function of s because the k u ψ estimations are needed in this study and thus only the s ψ term in eq 7 is necessary the ρb variation had a significant effect on the shape of the wrc estimates in general s of soils at relatively low ρb values changed over ψ more considerably compared to those of soils at relatively high ρb values in the near saturation ψ range however the changes of the s ψ curve shape showed opposite trends in mid range ψ fig 1 in terms of wrcs from different estimation functions function b gave slightly higher s than did function a in the wetter range of the wrcs but the opposite trend was observed in the drier range of the wrcs for soils 1 3 most of the water was drained at relatively large ψ 30 kpa and the two functions produced quite similar wrcs except on samples with the lowest ρb values for soils 4 and 5 the full range 0 to 1500 kpa wrcs were measured the wrcs estimated with function a differed considerably from that of function b when s decreased rapidly with the reduction of ψ tian et al 2018c showed that function a produced more accurate wrc estimates than did function b in most cases which was caused by the fact that function a used reference measurements on samples at two different ρb values whereas function b used only one wrc measurement conversely function b has the advantage of being less time consuming for data collection as compared to function a and it is preferred when limited wrc measurements are available 3 2 soil k s estimates at various ρb values fig 2 shows the measured best fit and estimated using models 1 and 2 k s values as a function of ρb for the five soils the ρb variation had a significant effect on k s measurements generally k s decreased with increasing ρb and k s of soils at the highest and lowest ρb values differed by up to one order of magnitude fig 2 the ρb also affected the accuracy of the best fit k s values for samples with relatively high ρb the best fit ks values were close to measured k s for samples with relatively low ρb however the best fit k s values were greater than measured ones fig 2 some studies reported that the measured k s might not be the optimal k for estimating k u with the original mualem van genuchten model schaap et al 2001 schaap and van genuchten 2006 other studies pointed out that the measured k s should be fixed at a small negative value of the pressure head because eq 2 failed to capture the macro pore flow luckner et al 1989 vogel and cislerova 1988 and the k u ψ curve estimated with the original mualem van genuchten model could exhibit an abrupt drop at water contents just below saturation when the change of the wrc shape near saturation was significant vogel et al 2000 in other words the best fit k s at saturation could be substantially greater than the measured k s when the shape of the wrc changed considerably at matric potentials near saturation this was evident in fig 1 in the near saturation range of the wrcs the degree of saturation s declined quickly with ψ for soil samples with relatively low ρb while the s changes were relatively small for soil samples with relatively high ρb consequently the curve fitting procedure overestimated k s at low ρb values due to significant changes in the wrc shape near saturation fig 2 also shows that models 1 and 2 give quite different k s estimates especially in the small ρb value range the model 1 estimated k s curves black solid lines were in good agreement with k s measurements for the five soils on average rmse 0 08 this was also confirmed by assouline 2006a in which model 1 gave the most accurate k s estimates compared to measured k s values among eight different models the model 2 estimated k s curves red solid lines were close to measured k s at large ρb values but they deviated from measurements at small ρb values rmse 0 20 thus model 1 estimated k s values were closer to k s measurements than were model 2 estimates when comparing with best fit k s values alternately model 2 produced more accurate estimates rmse 0 29 than did model 1 rmse 0 37 model 2 better accounted for the shape effect of wrcs near saturation at low ρb values than did model 1 this is reasonable because model 2 is developed based on the wrc model function see eq 10 and the shape effect is included by substitution of eq 1 into eq 10 it should be noted that the reference k s0 is a key factor in determining k s as a function of ρb using model 2 the dashed lines in fig 2 are the estimated k s curves using k s0 derived from each single k s measurement at different ρb values when a k s measurement was close to the best fit k s at the same or similar ρb the k s curves based on this k s measurement approached the other best fit k s values at different ρb values the optimal k s measurements for calculating k s0 using model 2 were those made on samples with relatively high ρb values the ρb value should be greater than 1 5 mg m 3 for coarse texture soils e g soils 1 and 4 and greater than 1 3 mg m 3 for fine texture soils e g soils 2 3 and 5 in consideration of the large variability of k s measurements multiple measurements over a wide range of ρb are preferred for calculating k s0 in model 2 in our study the k s curves derived from the average k s0 values the solid red lines in fig 2 were used in the estimation of k u although they might not be the optimal values for all soils this was similar to the approach of model 1 where average k s0 values were used 3 3 soil k u estimates at various ρb values four approaches which combine two wrc functions and two k s models were used to estimate k u of the five soils at various ρb values fig 3 compares the estimated k u versus measured k u values using approach a1 the rmse and bias values between estimated and measured k u values at a specific ρb are listed in table 2 on the whole approach a1 gave accurate k u estimation for soils 1 4 with average rmse ranged from 0 17 to 0 34 and average bias ranged from 0 23 to 0 09 on soil 5 however approach a1 generally underestimated k u under all three ρb conditions with an average rmse of 0 89 and an average bias of 0 71 the underestimation was especially clear in the low k u range the results in fig 3 and table 2 also indicate that compared to measurements approach a1 tends to give lower k u values in the relatively low ρb range but no consistent trends are observed in the relatively high ρb range this happened because approach a1 used model 1 for estimating k s and the estimations were generally lower than the best fit k s values under relatively low ρb conditions fig 2 although the mualem van genuchten 1980 hydraulic conductivity model has been used extensively it has several limitations when the default k and l 0 5 are used in eq 2 in the present study l was taken as 0 5 an optimal value obtained from a data set of 45 disturbed and undisturbed samples mualem 1976 several studies have indicated that l varied over a wide range and it could be negative yates et al 1992 schuh and cline 1990 leij et al 1997 schaap and leij 2000 schaap and leij 2000 showed that using l 1 produced more accurate k u estimates for a data set of 235 soil samples than did l 0 5 fig 4 evaluates the effects of parameter l on the original mualem van genuchten 1980 model in which measured k s at ρb of 1 09 mg m 3 and wrc parameters at ρb of 1 10 mg m 3 table 1 were used to estimate k u of soil 5 at ρb of 1 13 mg m 3 for the original mualem van genuchten 1980 model it was observed that l 1 is a more suitable model parameter than l 0 5 for soil 5 fig 4 similarly setting l 1 instead of l 0 5 in the ρb related model approach a1 improved the accuracy of estimates for soil 5 fig 3 the average rmse was decreased from 0 89 to 0 35 and the average bias changed from 0 71 to 0 02 table 2 thus for soil 5 using an l value of 1 in approach a1 produced more accurate k u estimates than did using l 0 5 it is difficult to determine which l is optimal for a specific soil because l is affected by soil texture and several other physical properties schaap and leij 2000 despite this our results showed that using the same l in the ρb related model produced accurate k u estimates when the l value was suitable for the original mualem van genuchten 1980 model i e the model not accounting for ρb effects a comparison between measured and estimated k u values using approach a2 for the five soils is presented in fig 5 except for soil 5 the estimated k u values agreed well with the k u measurements similar to that of approach a1 taking l 1 instead of the default l 0 5 improved the accuracy of approach a2 significantly on soil 5 the average rmse decreased from 0 78 to 0 25 and the average bias changed from 0 65 to 0 01 further analysis showed that approach a2 produced better k u estimates as indicated by the lower on soils 1 2 4 and 5 or the same on soil 3 average rmses compared to those of approach a1 table 2 this is because approach a2 accounted for the shape effect of wrcs near saturation under relatively low ρb conditions for most soils across the five soils approach a2 gave k u estimates with an average rmse and an average bias of 0 25 and 0 03 respectively the measured k u data versus estimated k u values using approaches b1 and b2 are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively in both cases the wrc parameters were obtained by using function b in which soil texture data and one wrc measurement were used tian et al 2018c indicated that function b gave less accurate wrc estimates than did function a consequently the k u values from approaches b1 and b2 had larger average rmse values 0 35 for both approaches on all five soils than did those from approaches a1 and a2 average rmse values of 0 28 and 0 25 respectively table 2 no consistent difference was observed between approaches b1 and b2 on soils 1 2 and 5 approach b2 gave more accurate k u estimates than did approach b1 especially under relatively low ρb conditions on soils 3 and 4 however approach b1 produced k u data with lower average rmse than did those from approach b2 in summary among the four approaches approach a2 performed the best followed by approach a1 and both gave more accurate results than did approaches b1 and b2 on the other hand approaches b1 and b2 required fewer wrc measurements for estimation of model parameters which might be an advantage in some situations where the cost or availability of data collection is an important issue for all four approaches the accuracy of wrc estimates was a key factor that determined the accuracy of k u estimates especially in the lower k u range besides we observed that parameter l played a critical role in estimating k u with the mualem van genuchten model the default l of 0 5 was reasonable for soils 1 4 while an l of 1 was better for soil 5 thus future studies are required to further improve the model accuracy by introducing soil specific l values or texture dependent l models 4 conclusion changes in ρb affect the accuracy of the mualem van genuchten 1980 k u estimation model in this study we applied two functions for relating wrc parameters to ρb and two models for correlating k s with ρb by assembling the functions and models four approaches were developed to estimate k u of soils at various ρb values evaluation using k u measurements on five soils showed that among the four approaches approach a2 gave the most accurate k u estimates for all soils approach a1 produced less accurate k u estimates compared to approach a2 but performed better than did approaches b1 and b2 approach a2 performed better than did approach a1 because the k s estimation model used in approach a2 accounted for the shape effect of wrc near saturation under relatively low ρb approaches a1 and a2 gave more accurate k u estimates than did approaches b1 and b2 because more accurate wrc estimates were used on the whole all four approaches gave reasonable k u estimates with average rmses lower than 0 35 thus the approaches developed herein have potential for improving

6619,the mualem van genuchten model has been widely used for estimating unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity k u from measured saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and fitted water retention curve wrc parameters soil bulk density ρb variations affect the accuracy of k u estimates in this study we extend the mualem van genuchten model to account for the ρb effect with ρb related wrc and k s models we apply two functions a and b that relate the van genuchten wrc model to ρb and two models 1 and 2 that estimate k s with various ρb by combining the ρb related wrc functions and k s models we develop four integrated approaches i e a1 a2 b1 and b2 for estimating k u at various ρb k u measurements made on five soils with various textures and ρb are used to evaluate the accuracy of the four approaches the results show that all approaches produce reasonable k u estimates with average root mean square errors rmses less than 0 35 expressed in dimensionless unit because logarithmic k u values are used approach a2 with an average rmse of 0 25 agrees better with k u measurements than does approach a1 that has an average rmse of 0 28 this is because model 2 accounts for the wrc shape effect near saturation approaches a1 and a2 give more accurate k u estimates than do approaches b1 and b2 which both have average rmses of 0 35 because function a performs better in estimating wrcs than does function b the proposed approaches could be incorporated into simulation models for improved prediction of water solute and gas transport in soils keywords soil hydraulic conductivity water

k u is generally difficult costly and time consuming wind 1966 introduced an approach for measuring k u by using evaporation experiments in the laboratory schindler 1980 developed a simplified evaporation method for determining k u in the field ankeny et al 1990 introduced a simple method to determine k u through infiltration experiments in addition in situ k u dynamics can be estimated by combined use of heat pulse and water potential sensors tian et al 2018a more commonly k u is estimated using soil water retention parameters and k s measurement based on relative hydraulic conductivity models burdine 1953 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 assouline 2001 taking into account the effects of ρb in the k u estimation models is increasingly important for improved simulation of water solute and gas transport in soils vereecken et al 2016 to account for the effect of ρb in hydraulic conductivity estimation models the k s value and soil water retention parameters should be related to ρb several approaches have been developed to relate k s to ρb or the total soil porosity mualem and assouline 1989 or et al 2000 flint and selker 2003 assouline 2006a guarracino 2007 assouline and or 2008 the k s values under different ρb conditions can be estimated with ρb related models based on the kozeny carman equation or et al 2000 mualem and assouline 1989 estimated soil k

has been widely used jansson 1998 šimůnek et al 2005 there is a need to relate the mualem van genuchten 1980 model parameters to ρb for an improved understanding of water transport in dynamic soil

ρb values were developed by tian et al 2018c the mualem and assouline 1989 method has the potential to be combined with the van genuchten 1980 wrc function for estimating k s of soils at various ρb but it has not been evaluated with measured k s values the tian et al 2018c approaches and the mualem and assouline 1989 method are promising for application to the mualem van genuchten 1980 hydraulic conductivity estimation model for taking into account the effect of ρb the objectives of this study are to 1 relate the mualem van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic conductivity estimation model parameters to ρb 2 introduce four approaches to estimate k u for soil over a range of ρb values and 3 evaluate and compare the performance of the four approaches for estimating k u using measured values 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development the mualem van genuchten model has been widely used for describing soil hydraulic properties van genuchten 1980 in this model the soil wrc is expressed by 1 s θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α ψ n m ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where s is the effective degree of saturation θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 at soil water matric potential ψ kpa θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents m3 m 3 respectively and α kpa 1 n and m are empirical shape parameters in which m is commonly expressed as m 1 1 n to derive a closed form solution for the mualem 1976 relative hydraulic conductivity model the mualem van genuchten 1980 hydraulic conductivity function is given as follows 2 k s k s l 1 1 s n n 1 1 1 n 2 ψ 0 k ψ 0 where k is the hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 k is a matching point at saturation mm h 1 and l is an empirical pore connectivity parameter a measured k s is commonly used for k while l is fixed at 0 5 mualem 1976 the k u θ or k u ψ relationship is obtained by combining eqs 1 and 2 variation in ρb can have a significant effect on the estimation of k u assouline 2006a thus it is necessary to relate the mualem van genuchten 1980 model to ρb for improved prediction of water movement in soil systems with spatially and or temporally variable ρb tian et al 2018c extended the four parameters in eq 1 to account for the ρb dependence with the following equations 3 θ s ρ s ρ b ρ s ρ b 0 θ s 0 4 θ r ρ b ρ b 0 θ r 0 5 α α 0 ρ b ρ b 0 3 97 where the subscript 0 refers to parameters under a reference ρb condition and ρs is the soil particle density mg m 3 a linear relationship between parameter n and ρb has been reported by several studies assouline et al 1997 fu shao 2007 jiang et al 2017 6a n a ρ b b where a and b are empirical parameters that vary with soil type to obtain a and b at least two n values at two reference bulk densities are needed tian et al 2018c observed a relatively moderate relationship compared to the linear relationship between n and ρb as follows 6b n 1 n 0 1 ρ b ρ b 0 0 97 1 28 f s i l t f c l a y where f silt f clay is the ratio between the soil silt content and clay content that are determined according to the usda soil textural classification and n 0 is the fitted n value at the reference ρb0 condition unlike eq 6a eq 6b estimates n values at various ρb using only one reference n 0 value and thus it has the advantage of simplicity by substituting eqs 3 6 into eq 1 the van genuchten 1980 wrc model is extended to take into account the effects of ρb to simplify the expression of the model function we set the value of ρb0 to be 1 0 mg m 3 then the ρb related eq 1 is normalized as follows 7 s θ ρ b θ r 0 ρ s ρ b ρ s 1 θ s 0 ρ b θ r 0 1 1 ρ b 3 97 α 0 ψ n 1 1 n ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where n is expressed as eq 6a or eq 6b with ρb0 1 0 mg m 3 note ρb ρb0 and ρs in eq 7 are assumed to be unitless parameters to make units match the k s also varies with ρb jabro 1992 after comparing eight different models that related k s to ρb assouline 2006b concluded that the following kozeny carman equation based model had the best agreement with k s measurements 8 k s k s 0 η η 0 3 ρ b ρ b 0 δ 7 where η 1 ρb ρs is the soil total porosity and δ is an empirical parameter assouline 2006b observed that δ 4 gave the best overall agreement with the k s measurements for soils used in his study k s0 and η0 are parameters under the reference ρb0 condition by setting ρb0 to 1 0 mg m 3 eq 8 is normalized as 9 k s k s 0 ρ s ρ b ρ s 1 3 ρ b 3 in addition mualem and assouline 1989 developed a semi theoretical model to estimate k s under various ρb conditions using soil wrc model functions 10 k s k s 0 θ s θ r θ s 0 θ r 0 l 2 0 1 ψ 1 d s ψ 0 1 ψ 1 d s 0 ψ 2 where s ψ represents a wrc model function e g the brooks and corey 1964 model and s 0 is the effective degree of saturation at the reference ρb0 the empirical pore connectivity parameter l 0 5 also used in eq 2 is adopted in eq 10 assouline 2006a combined eq 10 with the brooks and corey 1964 and the assouline et al 1998 wrc functions for estimating soil k s of at various ρb values in the present study the van genuchten 1980 wrc function is applied to this model by substituting eqs 1 3 and 4 into eq 10 performing integration details about the integral calculation are shown in the appendix a and setting ρb0 to 1 0 mg m 3 we derive a new k s model as follows 11 k s k s 0 ρ s ρ b ρ s 1 θ s 0 ρ b θ r 0 θ s 0 θ r 0 2 5 ρ b 3 97 2 2 2 approaches for estimating k u for soils at various ρb values so far we have introduced two van genuchten wrc functions i e eqs 7 6a and eqs 7 6b designated as function a and function b respectively that relate model parameters to ρb and two k s models i e eqs 9 and 11 designated as model 1 and model 2 respectively that include ρb as a variable tian et al 2018c indicated that function a gave more accurate wrc estimates than did function b while function b had the advantage of simplicity over function a model 1 was developed based on the kozeny carman equation while model 2 included wrc model functions as variables by combining these wrc functions and k s models with eq 2 we obtained the following four approaches that can be used to estimate k u for soils at various ρb values approaches a1 eq 2 function a and model 1 a2 eq 2 function a and model 2 b1 eq 2 function b and model 1 and b2 eq 2 function b and model 2 water retention curve parameters and k s0 value at the reference ρb0 of 1 0 mg m 3 are required for the proposed approaches but they can be obtained using measurements made on samples with any known ρb for example parameters θs0 and θr0 at ρb0 of 1 0 mg m 3 can be calculated from θs and θr measurements on soil samples with a known ρb by solving eqs 3 and 4 note considering that θr is the water content at which soil k u approaches zero we set θr as the θ determined at 1500 kpa following tian et al 2018c when θ measurements at 1500 kpa are not available the best fit values are used for function a three unknown parameters α0 a and b are obtained by fitting eqs 6a 7 to wrc measurements simultaneously with the least squares method for a specific soil both a and b rely on ρb thus at least two wrc curves at two markedly different ρb values are required to derive the best fit a and b values tian et al 2018c for function b n depends on ρb and soil texture f silt f clay thus unknown parameters α0 and n 0 can be obtained by fitting eqs 6b 7 to one wrc measurement at a known ρb value tian et al 2018c in this case ρb can be any specific value the k s at the required ρb condition can be directly calculated with eq 8 or eq 10 from a k s measurement with a known ρb or it can be obtained by using the normalized k s model eq 9 or 11 the k s0 in eq 9 is estimated from the ks measurement at a known ρb by solving eq 9 likewise the k s0 in eq 11 can be estimated from θs0 and θr0 estimates and a k s measurement made on soil with a known ρb by solving the equation 2 3 experimental validation to evaluate the performance of the four approaches for estimating soil k u with variable ρb the measurements of k s k u and wrc made on five soils with different textures and ρb values were used as validation datasets table 1 presents the basic physical properties of the soils the datasets of soils 1 3 were from laliberte et al 1966 who measured the main drying wrcs of the soils at three or four ρb values and the k s and k u ψ values were determined at another five ρb conditions table 1 the different ρb conditions were achieved by packing soil columns with a vibrating device for soils 4 and 5 we measured the wrc k s and k u ψ values at various ρb values table 1 the soil samples were air dried passed through a 2 mm screen mixed with predetermined amounts of water and then packed uniformly into stainless steel containers at different ρb values the wrcs of soils 4 and 5 were determined at a range of ψ values 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 kpa with a tension table eijkelkamp giesbeek the netherlands and at 30 50 100 500 and 1500 kpa with a pressure plate apparatus soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca these wrcs have been reported in tian et al 2018c the k s of soil samples at different ρb were determined by using the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 three replicated wrc and k s measurements were made for each soil and each ρb the k u ψ curves of soils 4 and 5 were determined with a hyprop device ums gmbh munich germany following the simplified evaporation method schindler 1980 peters et al 2015 the wrcs at the lowest and highest ρb values table 1 were applied to calculate the θs0 and θr0 and to obtain the best fit α0 a and b values in approaches a1 and a2 the α0 and n 0 values in approaches b1 and b2 were obtained by fitting eqs 6b 7 to the wrc measurements at the lowest ρb then wrc parameters at the ρb for determining k u were estimated using the proposed functions the k s0 values in eqs 9 and 11 were determined by using a k s measurement at a known ρb substantial variation usually occurred in k s measurements on the same soil van genuchten et al 1991 in consideration of this variability all k s measurements at different ρb were applied for the calculation of k s0 and the average values were used to estimate k u the k u ψ values for each soil at different ρb were then estimated accordingly and compared with the measured data the root mean square error rmse and bias between the estimated and measured k u values were used to evaluate the performance of the approaches 12 r m s e log 10 k u e s t i m a t e d log 10 k u m e a s u r e d 2 n 13 b i a s log 10 k u e s t i m a t e d log 10 k u m e a s u r e d n where n is the number of data points logarithmic values of k u were used in eqs 12 and 13 to avoid deviations toward high conductivities in the wet range the rmse and bias are presented as dimensionless numbers because logarithmic conductivity values were used we also calculated the best fit k s values to evaluate the performance of models 1 and 2 for estimating k s the best fit k s was obtained by fitting eq 2 in which the parameters s and n were estimated using function a to measured k u ψ values using the least squares method the goodness of fit was quantified with the rmse between estimated and measured k u values the best fit k s represents the most suitable value for the matching point at saturation i e k in eq 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil wrc estimates at various ρb values fig 1 presents the wrc estimates of the five soils using function a and function b instead of the conventional θ ψ relationship the wrcs presented here show ψ as a function of s because the k u ψ estimations are needed in this study and thus only the s ψ term in eq 7 is necessary the ρb variation had a significant effect on the shape of the wrc estimates in general s of soils at relatively low ρb values changed over ψ more considerably compared to those of soils at relatively high ρb values in the near saturation ψ range however the changes of the s ψ curve shape showed opposite trends in mid range ψ fig 1 in terms of wrcs from different estimation functions function b gave slightly higher s than did function a in the wetter range of the wrcs but the opposite trend was observed in the drier range of the wrcs for soils 1 3 most of the water was drained at relatively large ψ 30 kpa and the two functions produced quite similar wrcs except on samples with the lowest ρb values for soils 4 and 5 the full range 0 to 1500 kpa wrcs were measured the wrcs estimated with function a differed considerably from that of function b when s decreased rapidly with the reduction of ψ tian et al 2018c showed that function a produced more accurate wrc estimates than did function b in most cases which was caused by the fact that function a used reference measurements on samples at two different ρb values whereas function b used only one wrc measurement conversely function b has the advantage of being less time consuming for data collection as compared to function a and it is preferred when limited wrc measurements are available 3 2 soil k s estimates at various ρb values fig 2 shows the measured best fit and estimated using models 1 and 2 k s values as a function of ρb for the five soils the ρb variation had a significant effect on k s measurements generally k s decreased with increasing ρb and k s of soils at the highest and lowest ρb values differed by up to one order of magnitude fig 2 the ρb also affected the accuracy of the best fit k s values for samples with relatively high ρb the best fit ks values were close to measured k s for samples with relatively low ρb however the best fit k s values were greater than measured ones fig 2 some studies reported that the measured k s might not be the optimal k for estimating k u with the original mualem van genuchten model schaap et al 2001 schaap and van genuchten 2006 other studies pointed out that the measured k s should be fixed at a small negative value of the pressure head because eq 2 failed to capture the macro pore flow luckner et al 1989 vogel and cislerova 1988 and the k u ψ curve estimated with the original mualem van genuchten model could exhibit an abrupt drop at water contents just below saturation when the change of the wrc shape near saturation was significant vogel et al 2000 in other words the best fit k s at saturation could be substantially greater than the measured k s when the shape of the wrc changed considerably at matric potentials near saturation this was evident in fig 1 in the near saturation range of the wrcs the degree of saturation s declined quickly with ψ for soil samples with relatively low ρb while the s changes were relatively small for soil samples with relatively high ρb consequently the curve fitting procedure overestimated k s at low ρb values due to significant changes in the wrc shape near saturation fig 2 also shows that models 1 and 2 give quite different k s estimates especially in the small ρb value range the model 1 estimated k s curves black solid lines were in good agreement with k s measurements for the five soils on average rmse 0 08 this was also confirmed by assouline 2006a in which model 1 gave the most accurate k s estimates compared to measured k s values among eight different models the model 2 estimated k s curves red solid lines were close to measured k s at large ρb values but they deviated from measurements at small ρb values rmse 0 20 thus model 1 estimated k s values were closer to k s measurements than were model 2 estimates when comparing with best fit k s values alternately model 2 produced more accurate estimates rmse 0 29 than did model 1 rmse 0 37 model 2 better accounted for the shape effect of wrcs near saturation at low ρb values than did model 1 this is reasonable because model 2 is developed based on the wrc model function see eq 10 and the shape effect is included by substitution of eq 1 into eq 10 it should be noted that the reference k s0 is a key factor in determining k s as a function of ρb using model 2 the dashed lines in fig 2 are the estimated k s curves using k s0 derived from each single k s measurement at different ρb values when a k s measurement was close to the best fit k s at the same or similar ρb the k s curves based on this k s measurement approached the other best fit k s values at different ρb values the optimal k s measurements for calculating k s0 using model 2 were those made on samples with relatively high ρb values the ρb value should be greater than 1 5 mg m 3 for coarse texture soils e g soils 1 and 4 and greater than 1 3 mg m 3 for fine texture soils e g soils 2 3 and 5 in consideration of the large variability of k s measurements multiple measurements over a wide range of ρb are preferred for calculating k s0 in model 2 in our study the k s curves derived from the average k s0 values the solid red lines in fig 2 were used in the estimation of k u although they might not be the optimal values for all soils this was similar to the approach of model 1 where average k s0 values were used 3 3 soil k u estimates at various ρb values four approaches which combine two wrc functions and two k s models were used to estimate k u of the five soils at various ρb values fig 3 compares the estimated k u versus measured k u values using approach a1 the rmse and bias values between estimated and measured k u values at a specific ρb are listed in table 2 on the whole approach a1 gave accurate k u estimation for soils 1 4 with average rmse ranged from 0 17 to 0 34 and average bias ranged from 0 23 to 0 09 on soil 5 however approach a1 generally underestimated k u under all three ρb conditions with an average rmse of 0 89 and an average bias of 0 71 the underestimation was especially clear in the low k u range the results in fig 3 and table 2 also indicate that compared to measurements approach a1 tends to give lower k u values in the relatively low ρb range but no consistent trends are observed in the relatively high ρb range this happened because approach a1 used model 1 for estimating k s and the estimations were generally lower than the best fit k s values under relatively low ρb conditions fig 2 although the mualem van genuchten 1980 hydraulic conductivity model has been used extensively it has several limitations when the default k and l 0 5 are used in eq 2 in the present study l was taken as 0 5 an optimal value obtained from a data set of 45 disturbed and undisturbed samples mualem 1976 several studies have indicated that l varied over a wide range and it could be negative yates et al 1992 schuh and cline 1990 leij et al 1997 schaap and leij 2000 schaap and leij 2000 showed that using l 1 produced more accurate k u estimates for a data set of 235 soil samples than did l 0 5 fig 4 evaluates the effects of parameter l on the original mualem van genuchten 1980 model in which measured k s at ρb of 1 09 mg m 3 and wrc parameters at ρb of 1 10 mg m 3 table 1 were used to estimate k u of soil 5 at ρb of 1 13 mg m 3 for the original mualem van genuchten 1980 model it was observed that l 1 is a more suitable model parameter than l 0 5 for soil 5 fig 4 similarly setting l 1 instead of l 0 5 in the ρb related model approach a1 improved the accuracy of estimates for soil 5 fig 3 the average rmse was decreased from 0 89 to 0 35 and the average bias changed from 0 71 to 0 02 table 2 thus for soil 5 using an l value of 1 in approach a1 produced more accurate k u estimates than did using l 0 5 it is difficult to determine which l is optimal for a specific soil because l is affected by soil texture and several other physical properties schaap and leij 2000 despite this our results showed that using the same l in the ρb related model produced accurate k u estimates when the l value was suitable for the original mualem van genuchten 1980 model i e the model not accounting for ρb effects a comparison between measured and estimated k u values using approach a2 for the five soils is presented in fig 5 except for soil 5 the estimated k u values agreed well with the k u measurements similar to that of approach a1 taking l 1 instead of the default l 0 5 improved the accuracy of approach a2 significantly on soil 5 the average rmse decreased from 0 78 to 0 25 and the average bias changed from 0 65 to 0 01 further analysis showed that approach a2 produced better k u estimates as indicated by the lower on soils 1 2 4 and 5 or the same on soil 3 average rmses compared to those of approach a1 table 2 this is because approach a2 accounted for the shape effect of wrcs near saturation under relatively low ρb conditions for most soils across the five soils approach a2 gave k u estimates with an average rmse and an average bias of 0 25 and 0 03 respectively the measured k u data versus estimated k u values using approaches b1 and b2 are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively in both cases the wrc parameters were obtained by using function b in which soil texture data and one wrc measurement were used tian et al 2018c indicated that function b gave less accurate wrc estimates than did function a consequently the k u values from approaches b1 and b2 had larger average rmse values 0 35 for both approaches on all five soils than did those from approaches a1 and a2 average rmse values of 0 28 and 0 25 respectively table 2 no consistent difference was observed between approaches b1 and b2 on soils 1 2 and 5 approach b2 gave more accurate k u estimates than did approach b1 especially under relatively low ρb conditions on soils 3 and 4 however approach b1 produced k u data with lower average rmse than did those from approach b2 in summary among the four approaches approach a2 performed the best followed by approach a1 and both gave more accurate results than did approaches b1 and b2 on the other hand approaches b1 and b2 required fewer wrc measurements for estimation of model parameters which might be an advantage in some situations where the cost or availability of data collection is an important issue for all four approaches the accuracy of wrc estimates was a key factor that determined the accuracy of k u estimates especially in the lower k u range besides we observed that parameter l played a critical role in estimating k u with the mualem van genuchten model the default l of 0 5 was reasonable for soils 1 4 while an l of 1 was better for soil 5 thus future studies are required to further improve the model accuracy by introducing soil specific l values or texture dependent l models 4 conclusion changes in ρb affect the accuracy of the mualem van genuchten 1980 k u estimation model in this study we applied two functions for relating wrc parameters to ρb and two models for correlating k s with ρb by assembling the functions and models four approaches were developed to estimate k u of soils at various ρb values evaluation using k u measurements on five soils showed that among the four approaches approach a2 gave the most accurate k u estimates for all soils approach a1 produced less accurate k u estimates compared to approach a2 but performed better than did approaches b1 and b2 approach a2 performed better than did approach a1 because the k s estimation model used in approach a2 accounted for the shape effect of wrc near saturation under relatively low ρb approaches a1 and a2 gave more accurate k u estimates than did approaches b1 and b2 because more accurate wrc estimates were used on the whole all four approaches gave reasonable k u estimates with average rmses lower than 0 35 thus the approaches developed herein have potential for improving
