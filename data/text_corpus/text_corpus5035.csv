ecological environment in kendall grassland was downloaded to validate gpp ftp cdiac ornl gov pub ameriflux data after standardizing the input data the model was set to run a spin up simulation which start with very low initial levels of carbon and nitrogen state until the total carbon levels stabilize for 6000 years without grazing then the biome bgc grazing model simulations were run to illustrate two different scenarios grazing and non grazing in the grazing scenario all variables relating to both climate change and grazing were permitted to fluctuate during the complete simulation for the non grazing scenario which considers the impact of climate on carbon dynamics we used historical climate data but without grazing information for the simulation impacts of grazing on carbon dynamics from 1979 to 2011 were obtained using differences between grazing and non grazing simulations 3 results 3 1 model validation fig 2 a depicts the results of et on a daily basis as measured by the bowen ratio and the biome bgc model in 2013 the results indicated that the observed et was 0 84 mm m 2 day 1 while the modeled value was 1 12 mm m 2 day 1 in average the difference between the observed and simulated et ranged from 0 mm to 10 36 mm m 2 day 1 with the rmse of 1 08 mm which is quite acceptable there was a large data gap for doy 55 73 because bowen ratio data were missing during this period as shown in fig 2b biome bgc also well simulated gpp for grazed grassland in comparison with the eddy covariance data r2 0 82 p 0 05 in addition the annual variability in gpp was captured by the model 3 2 spatal temporal distribution of et and wue in central asia et gradually decreases from fm 365 65 36 86 mm m 2 yr 1 to dg 183 32 21 15 mm m 2 yr 1 as shown in fig 3 a as would be expected this decreasing trend accurately reflected the mountain oasis desert ecosystem distribution on the spatial scale the highest et values were distributed in the qilian mountain area this was due to the occurrence of summer and autumn precipitation higher than in any other regions with an average of about 365 66 mm in the arid zones water consumed in et was mainly from precipitation it was in the qilian mountains with good sources of water excellent water conditions ample vegetative cover plus shallow groundwater levels and wide snow cover that the highest et in the basin was measured temper grassland in kazakhstan with an average of 276 93 29 36 mm also had a relatively strong et this was due to irrigation in the northern part of kazakhstan on the other hand the lowest et value with an average of 183 32 21 15 mm was found in the lower reaches this was due to the area suffering from perennial drought and minimal vegetation coverage the mean annual wue of central asia s grassland ecosystems over the period 1979 2011 also showed large spatial variability fig 3b wue of the three grassland ecosystems ranged from 0 62 0 03 g c kg 1 h2o in fm to 1 12 0 10 g c kg 1 h2o in tg with an average of 0 83 0 05 g c kg 1 h2o tg in northern central asia had the highest annual wue averaged 1 12 0 10 g c kg 1 h2o these regions have relatively high net primary productivity npp and evapotranspiration et due to suitable temperatures and ample precipitation the fm had the lowest annual wue averaged 0 62 0 03 g c kg 1 h2o because of the high et although the annual mean et was low in dg low gpp associated with sparse vegetation and low temperature in this region resulted in lower annual wue averaged 0 75 0 05 g c kg 1 h2o fig 4 c illustrates the annual et values from 1979 to 2011 in three grassland areas throughout central asia all grasslands exhibited similar et but with noticeable annual decline trend p 0 05 central asia experienced significant declines due to climatic factors of 1 47 2 72 mm per decade during the 33 year period from 1979 2011 central asia witnessed significant warming 0 3 c per decade and a dramatic decrease in precipitation 4 42 mm yr 1 fig 1a the drier and warmer climate exacerbated the xeric conditions in central asia s grasslands and took a toll on the regional et in central asia during the period 1979 to 2011 wue ranged from 0 92 0 55 g c kg 1 h2o in 2008 to 0 66 0 54 g c kg 1 h2o in 1981 fig 4d annual wue increased at a rate of 0 004 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 in tg annual wue increased at a slightly higher rate 0 006 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 while in dg wue also trended upward at a rate of 0 004 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 no statistically significant trend however was observed in fm fig 4d 3 3 grazing effects on et and wue a comparison of et under grazed and non grazed conditions for different grassland types is shown in figs 5 and 6 notably et reductions and increases occurred in all grassland types depending on the climate conditions and grazing intensity approximately 85 77 of tgs showed a decreasing trend in et because of the more aggressive grazing which averaged 0 27 head ha fig 5a et increased when the grazing intensity decreased to 0 11 head ha but this only accounted for 14 23 of tgs the same results were observed in dgs 91 66 of the grasslands experienced et reduction when the grazing intensity averaged 0 52 head ha fig 5c notably the grazing intensity in some fm regions was only 0 09 head ha 48 01 of the grasslands showed et trending upward fig 5f these results imply that et might respond to gi differently for different grassland types fig 6 shows carbon dynamics from the grazing and non grazing scenarios representing situations with and without grazing over time from 1979 to 2011 grazing lowered et by 7 47 in central asia the reduction rate for fm tg and dg were 3 10 12 70 and 7 42 respectively the grasslands manifested differing patterns of wue depending on how intensely they were grazed fig 7 apart from fm where wue was positively correlated with grazing intensity fig 7e f other areas significantly decreased wue due to grazing but the rate of decrease varied with grazing intensity wue of fm increased by 6 86 from non grazed to grazed scenario while wue of tg and dg decreased by 7 27 and 5 61 this was resulted from gpp incensement of fm 2 41 and reduction in tg and dg 18 68 and 11 27 respectively fig 7d spatially most of the dgs 75 65 showed a decreasing trend in wue because of the higher average grazing intensity of 0 51 head ha fig 7c the et increased when the grazing intensity decreased to 0 39 head ha but this only accounted for only 24 35 on the other hand wue of most fms 88 08 increased because of gpp increases in this region accordingly 54 22 of dgs experienced wue increases and the other half decreases in general grazing decreased wue by 3 60 in central asia from 1979 to 2011 to ensure the best grazing intensity tg dg and fm should be limited to 0 17 0 39 and 0 38 head ha respectively in order to achieve the maximum utilization of water efficiency 4 discussion 4 1 model performance and uncertainties the biome bgc grazing model has been shown to accurately predict central asian grassland et on a daily basis uncertainties may still remain due to interpretation of the data both temporal and spatial even though the sources of the data have been thoroughly vetted the model was parameterized with limited sites so some uncertainties may come from the model parameters for example water vapor pressure deficit for stomatal conductance were presented as a given for each functional type of plant these uncertainties in the structure of our model may also be responsible for compromising our simulation results to a certain extent future improvements on these aspects of modeling will certainly reduce such uncertainties 4 2 et and grazing effects in our study et gradually decreases from the forest meadow 365 65 mm m 2 yr 1 to desert grassland 183 32 mm m 2 yr 1 the magnitudes and range of variations in et are consistent with previous research zhang et al 2014 measured et over the riparian shrub on the qinghai tibet plateau and the results indicated that annual et between 390 mm and 503 mm for the period using the eddy covariance technique yang and zhou 2011 estimated the cumulative et over a temperate desert steppe in inner mongolia china in 2008 was 150 9 mm in 2006 using the eddy covariance technique miao et al estimated et to be 230 3 mm and 201 4 mm for a fenced and a degraded steppe in xilinhot inner mongolia china miao et al 2009 on average grazing reduced et for grasslands in central asia by 7 46 during the period 1979 2013 compare to non grazing scenario with grazing similarly affecting the et of different grassland ecosystems bremer et al 2001 reported that grazing reduced the seasonal evaporation of a steppe in kansas by 6 1 from may to october in 1999 frank 2003 reported a 7 decrease in et on average for a grazed prairie in three consecutive years although in the year with higher soil water availability et was greater in the grazed prairie than in the un grazed prairie stewart and verma 1992 found similar et in both degraded and fenced steppes in wet years when soil moisture was not a limiting factor coronato and bertiller 1996 on the other hand reported that grazing failed to exert any effect on soil water content further studies especially those at multiple sites and over a longer term are required to better understand these different results 4 3 wue and grazing effects different plant species vary in their water use efficiency br√ºmmer et al 2012 eichelmann et al 2016 singh et al 2017 tian et al 2010 in our study we found that the wue of the three grassland ecosystems ranged from 0 62 g c kg 1 h2o in fm to 1 12 g c kg 1 h2o in tg with an average of 0 83 g c kg 1 h2o law et al 2002 calculated wue for grassland was 0 94 g c kg 1 h2o based on the synthesis data from fluxnet peng et al 2007 used an integrated process based ecosystem model dynamic land ecosystem model dlem to simulate wue for different biomes and the results indicated that average wue in grassland in the southern united states was 0 58 g c kg 1 h2o our investigations indicated that grazing intensity significantly affected wue in the three types of grassland in general the more a region was grazed the more wue decreased thereafter declining as grazing intensified this held true except for fm which increased markedly under low grazing intensity figs 7 and 8 in particular circumstances grazing intensity increases in wue might be related to over compensation in photosynthetic growth which means plants can re grow to an equal or greater biomass following defoliation agrawal 2000 mcnaughton et al 1997 olejniczak 2011 in this study negative relationships were found between wue and evapotranspiration fig 4b a similar negative relation between wue and et was reported by qiu et al 2008 in the north china plain using a multiple transect field survey wu et al 2013 concluded that in a certain time an optimal grazing exclusion would influence the water carbon process at the community level by changing species assemblage these results indicated that it was possible to maintain relatively high yield and optimal wue by refining the grazing regime 5 conclusions in summary this study attempted to fully assess the long term changes of et and wue with the goal of understanding the interactions between carbon and water resources under grazing at the regional scale in central asian grasslands our results showed that throughout central asia annual et decreased 1 47 2 72 mm per decade for the three grassland types during the period 1979 2011 while wue exhibited increasing trends in at a rate of 0 0 006 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 an increase in gpp was primarily responsible for the increase in wue likely attributable to more rapid plant growth as a consequence of changes in the environment such as increasing co2 as well as proper grazing for the various grassland types et and wue displayed differences and exhibited varying responses to grazing grazing lowered et by 7 47 in central asia from 1979 to 2011 with 3 10 12 70 and 7 42 for fm tg and dg respectively wue increased by 6 86 for fm from non grazed to grazed scenario but decreased by 7 27 and 5 61 for tg and dg water use efficiency defines how efficiently the landscape uses precipitation to produce biomass and it has the potential to play an important role in setting pricing for ecosystem services palmer and yunusa 2011 our findings imply that keeping a proper grazing intensity is essential to maintaining the water carbon balance on dry grasslands grazing enclosures therefore are effective measures for maintaining dry

ecological environment in kendall grassland was downloaded to validate gpp ftp cdiac ornl gov pub ameriflux data after standardizing the input data the model was set to run a spin up simulation which start with very low initial levels of carbon and nitrogen state until the total carbon levels stabilize for 6000 years without grazing then the biome bgc grazing model simulations were run to illustrate two different scenarios grazing and non grazing in the grazing scenario all variables relating to both climate change and grazing were permitted to fluctuate during the complete simulation for the non grazing scenario which considers the impact of climate on carbon dynamics we used historical climate data but without grazing information for the simulation impacts of grazing on carbon dynamics from 1979 to 2011 were obtained using differences between grazing and non grazing simulations 3 results 3 1 model validation fig 2 a depicts the results of et on a daily basis as measured by the bowen ratio and the biome bgc model in 2013 the results indicated that the observed et was 0 84 mm m 2 day 1 while the modeled value was 1 12 mm m 2 day 1 in average the difference between the observed and simulated et ranged from 0 mm to 10 36 mm m 2 day 1 with the rmse of 1 08 mm which is quite acceptable there was a large data gap for doy 55 73 because bowen ratio data were missing during this period as shown in fig 2b biome bgc also well simulated gpp for grazed grassland in comparison with the eddy covariance data r2 0 82 p 0 05 in addition the annual variability in gpp was captured by the model 3 2 spatal temporal distribution of et and wue in central asia et gradually decreases from fm 365 65 36 86 mm m 2 yr 1 to dg 183 32 21 15 mm m 2 yr 1 as shown in fig 3 a as would be expected this decreasing trend accurately reflected the mountain oasis desert ecosystem distribution on the spatial scale the highest et values were distributed in the qilian mountain area this was due to the occurrence of summer and autumn precipitation higher than in any other regions with an average of about 365 66 mm in the arid zones water consumed in et was mainly from precipitation it was in the qilian mountains with good sources of water excellent water conditions ample vegetative cover plus shallow groundwater levels and wide snow cover that the highest et in the basin was measured temper grassland in kazakhstan with an average of 276 93 29 36 mm also had a relatively strong et this was due to irrigation in the northern part of kazakhstan on the other hand the lowest et value with an average of 183 32 21 15 mm was found in the lower reaches this was due to the area suffering from perennial drought and minimal vegetation coverage the mean annual wue of central asia s grassland ecosystems over the period 1979 2011 also showed large spatial variability fig 3b wue of the three grassland ecosystems ranged from 0 62 0 03 g c kg 1 h2o in fm to 1 12 0 10 g c kg 1 h2o in tg with an average of 0 83 0 05 g c kg 1 h2o tg in northern central asia had the highest annual wue averaged 1 12 0 10 g c kg 1 h2o these regions have relatively high net primary productivity npp and evapotranspiration et due to suitable temperatures and ample precipitation the fm had the lowest annual wue averaged 0 62 0 03 g c kg 1 h2o because of the high et although the annual mean et was low in dg low gpp associated with sparse vegetation and low temperature in this region resulted in lower annual wue averaged 0 75 0 05 g c kg 1 h2o fig 4 c illustrates the annual et values from 1979 to 2011 in three grassland areas throughout central asia all grasslands exhibited similar et but with noticeable annual decline trend p 0 05 central asia experienced significant declines due to climatic factors of 1 47 2 72 mm per decade during the 33 year period from 1979 2011 central asia witnessed significant warming 0 3 c per decade and a dramatic decrease in precipitation 4 42 mm yr 1 fig 1a the drier and warmer climate exacerbated the xeric conditions in central asia s grasslands and took a toll on the regional et in central asia during the period 1979 to 2011 wue ranged from 0 92 0 55 g c kg 1 h2o in 2008 to 0 66 0 54 g c kg 1 h2o in 1981 fig 4d annual wue increased at a rate of 0 004 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 in tg annual wue increased at a slightly higher rate 0 006 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 while in dg wue also trended upward at a rate of 0 004 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 no statistically significant trend however was observed in fm fig 4d 3 3 grazing effects on et and wue a comparison of et under grazed and non grazed conditions for different grassland types is shown in figs 5 and 6 notably et reductions and increases occurred in all grassland types depending on the climate conditions and grazing intensity approximately 85 77 of tgs showed a decreasing trend in et because of the more aggressive grazing which averaged 0 27 head ha fig 5a et increased when the grazing intensity decreased to 0 11 head ha but this only accounted for 14 23 of tgs the same results were observed in dgs 91 66 of the grasslands experienced et reduction when the grazing intensity averaged 0 52 head ha fig 5c notably the grazing intensity in some fm regions was only 0 09 head ha 48 01 of the grasslands showed et trending upward fig 5f these results imply that et might respond to gi differently for different grassland types fig 6 shows carbon dynamics from the grazing and non grazing scenarios representing situations with and without grazing over time from 1979 to 2011 grazing lowered et by 7 47 in central asia the reduction rate for fm tg and dg were 3 10 12 70 and 7 42 respectively the grasslands manifested differing patterns of wue depending on how intensely they were grazed fig 7 apart from fm where wue was positively correlated with grazing intensity fig 7e f other areas significantly decreased wue due to grazing but the rate of decrease varied with grazing intensity wue of fm increased by 6 86 from non grazed to grazed scenario while wue of tg and dg decreased by 7 27 and 5 61 this was resulted from gpp incensement of fm 2 41 and reduction in tg and dg 18 68 and 11 27 respectively fig 7d spatially most of the dgs 75 65 showed a decreasing trend in wue because of the higher average grazing intensity of 0 51 head ha fig 7c the et increased when the grazing intensity decreased to 0 39 head ha but this only accounted for only 24 35 on the other hand wue of most fms 88 08 increased because of gpp increases in this region accordingly 54 22 of dgs experienced wue increases and the other half decreases in general grazing decreased wue by 3 60 in central asia from 1979 to 2011 to ensure the best grazing intensity tg dg and fm should be limited to 0 17 0 39 and 0 38 head ha respectively in order to achieve the maximum utilization of water efficiency 4 discussion 4 1 model performance and uncertainties the biome bgc grazing model has been shown to accurately predict central asian grassland et on a daily basis uncertainties may still remain due to interpretation of the data both temporal and spatial even though the sources of the data have been thoroughly vetted the model was parameterized with limited sites so some uncertainties may come from the model parameters for example water vapor pressure deficit for stomatal conductance were presented as a given for each functional type of plant these uncertainties in the structure of our model may also be responsible for compromising our simulation results to a certain extent future improvements on these aspects of modeling will certainly reduce such uncertainties 4 2 et and grazing effects in our study et gradually decreases from the forest meadow 365 65 mm m 2 yr 1 to desert grassland 183 32 mm m 2 yr 1 the magnitudes and range of variations in et are consistent with previous research zhang et al 2014 measured et over the riparian shrub on the qinghai tibet plateau and the results indicated that annual et between 390 mm and 503 mm for the period using the eddy covariance technique yang and zhou 2011 estimated the cumulative et over a temperate desert steppe in inner mongolia china in 2008 was 150 9 mm in 2006 using the eddy covariance technique miao et al estimated et to be 230 3 mm and 201 4 mm for a fenced and a degraded steppe in xilinhot inner mongolia china miao et al 2009 on average grazing reduced et for grasslands in central asia by 7 46 during the period 1979 2013 compare to non grazing scenario with grazing similarly affecting the et of different grassland ecosystems bremer et al 2001 reported that grazing reduced the seasonal evaporation of a steppe in kansas by 6 1 from may to october in 1999 frank 2003 reported a 7 decrease in et on average for a grazed prairie in three consecutive years although in the year with higher soil water availability et was greater in the grazed prairie than in the un grazed prairie stewart and verma 1992 found similar et in both degraded and fenced steppes in wet years when soil moisture was not a limiting factor coronato and bertiller 1996 on the other hand reported that grazing failed to exert any effect on soil water content further studies especially those at multiple sites and over a longer term are required to better understand these different results 4 3 wue and grazing effects different plant species vary in their water use efficiency br√ºmmer et al 2012 eichelmann et al 2016 singh et al 2017 tian et al 2010 in our study we found that the wue of the three grassland ecosystems ranged from 0 62 g c kg 1 h2o in fm to 1 12 g c kg 1 h2o in tg with an average of 0 83 g c kg 1 h2o law et al 2002 calculated wue for grassland was 0 94 g c kg 1 h2o based on the synthesis data from fluxnet peng et al 2007 used an integrated process based ecosystem model dynamic land ecosystem model dlem to simulate wue for different biomes and the results indicated that average wue in grassland in the southern united states was 0 58 g c kg 1 h2o our investigations indicated that grazing intensity significantly affected wue in the three types of grassland in general the more a region was grazed the more wue decreased thereafter declining as grazing intensified this held true except for fm which increased markedly under low grazing intensity figs 7 and 8 in particular circumstances grazing intensity increases in wue might be related to over compensation in photosynthetic growth which means plants can re grow to an equal or greater biomass following defoliation agrawal 2000 mcnaughton et al 1997 olejniczak 2011 in this study negative relationships were found between wue and evapotranspiration fig 4b a similar negative relation between wue and et was reported by qiu et al 2008 in the north china plain using a multiple transect field survey wu et al 2013 concluded that in a certain time an optimal grazing exclusion would influence the water carbon process at the community level by changing species assemblage these results indicated that it was possible to maintain relatively high yield and optimal wue by refining the grazing regime 5 conclusions in summary this study attempted to fully assess the long term changes of et and wue with the goal of understanding the interactions between carbon and water resources under grazing at the regional scale in central asian grasslands our results showed that throughout central asia annual et decreased 1 47 2 72 mm per decade for the three grassland types during the period 1979 2011 while wue exhibited increasing trends in at a rate of 0 0 006 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 an increase in gpp was primarily responsible for the increase in wue likely attributable to more rapid plant growth as a consequence of changes in the environment such as increasing co2 as well as proper grazing for the various grassland types et and wue displayed differences and exhibited varying responses to grazing grazing lowered et by 7 47 in central asia from 1979 to 2011 with 3 10 12 70 and 7 42 for fm tg and dg respectively wue increased by 6 86 for fm from non grazed to grazed scenario but decreased by 7 27 and 5 61 for tg and dg water use efficiency defines how efficiently the landscape uses precipitation to produce biomass and it has the potential to play an important role in setting pricing for ecosystem services palmer and yunusa 2011 our findings imply that keeping a proper grazing intensity is essential to maintaining the water carbon balance on dry grasslands grazing enclosures therefore are effective measures for maintaining dry

25176,ayu fish are actively released by many fishery cooperatives in japan these fish exhibit the density dependent population dynamics within territorial competition at low density all fish can hold feeding territories once all territory sites are occupied surplus fish become floaters as the density further increases all fish give up their own territories and then form a school territory holders are more valuable than floaters as a food source and a target of recreational fishing thus the main purpose of the release of ayu is to increase the amount of territory holders for these reasons the release policy for ayu should take into account the influence of a change in density on the population dynamics we develop a rate equation to describe the density dependent population dynamics of ayu accompanied by the release of fingerlings our results indicate that the release of ayu demands unique policy different from other fish species the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories due to the increase in density caused by released fingerlings specifically the release policy that reduces the amount of fingerlings that are released at one time and lengthens the time interval between each release increases the catch of territory holders keywords ayu plecoglossus altivelis culture based fisheries rate equation population dynamics territorial competition release policy 1 introduction culture based fisheries are important approaches to enhance fish stocks in waters that do not have enough natural supply to sustain an ecosystem fisheries and recreational fishing in contrast to aquaculture involving the cultivation of aquatic species within artificially controlled environments culture based fisheries control a part of the life history of certain species and release their seed or fry into open waters at the appropriate time honma 1980 thus in culture based fisheries the released fingerlings propagate and flourish in a natural environment until they reach harvestable size liao 1988 thorpe 1980 for this reason it is important to design the release policy from ecological features in order to effectively and sustainably increase fish catches adcp 1989 here we consider the release policy for ayu fish plecoglossus altivelis osmeridae which are an endemic migratory fish in japan kawanabe 1969 miyadi 1960 takahashi and azuma 2006 ayu form algae feeding territories midstream during a growing season iguchi 1996 kawanabe 1957 in the early growing season all fish can hold territories at low density this feeding territory is formed in rapids where algae grow on rocks and stones of riverbeds biggs et al 1998 kawanabe 1973 during the growing season newcomers migrate from downstream and fish density increases day by day once all territory sites are occupied surplus fish become non territory holders floaters and stay in deep pools kawanabe et al 1957 in contrast to rapids algae cannot grow in pools because sufficient sunlight does not reach the riverbeds thus floaters cannot sufficiently feed in pools for this reason floaters often intrude into others territories to steal algae territory holders violently attack intruders in order to defend their own territories kawanabe 1973 mizuno and kawanabe 1957 as the density further increases territory holders have to spend much more time defending territories thus losing time to feed on algae eventually all fish give up their own territories and then form a school iguchi et al 2003 katano et al 2004 conversely territories are reformed from the school when the fish density decreases iguchi 1996 thus ayu exhibit the density dependent population dynamics within the territorial competition kawanabe 1958 tanaka et al 2011 in japan ayu are one of the most important fishery resources in inland fisheries and popular as a target of recreational fishing in recent years because wild ayu are decreasing remarkably due to the degradation of river environments and the division of rivers by dams culture based fisheries for ayu are actively carried out by many fishery cooperatives it is important to note is that territory holders are more valuable as fish resources than floaters territory holders are more expensive as a food source because they are bigger on average than floaters due to rich algae kawanabe 1957 nakashima et al 2009 mori et al 2008 furthermore the most popular style of fishing in japan tomozuri which utilizes territorial behaviors of ayu can be applied only to territory holders iguchi 1996 kawanabe 1973 in tomozuri fishermen use a live decoy as an intruder for territory holders then territory holders attack the decoy in order to defend their own territories by utilizing the habit fishermen can fish the territory holders based on the above relationships the release policy for ayu should be designed to increase the amount of territory holders effectively in consideration with the ecological features of ayu previous studies have proposed some release policies for ayu from various viewpoints e g the lineage of ayu fingerlings iwata et al 2007 miura et al 2012 the impact on other species katano et al 2000 2006 the river environment i e river width tsuboi and takagi 2016 water quality awata et al 2010 muraoka et al 2011 and frequency of boulders tsuboi et al 2012 and population density katano 2014 however little attention has been given to the density dependent population dynamics which are deeply concerned with a change in density caused by release recently a rate equation that describes the density dependent population dynamics of ayu within the territorial competition has been proposed katsumata et al 2017 in the present study we incorporate the release of ayu which affects the fish density in this rate equation and examine an effective release policy for ayu by using this newly proposed model our results indicate that the release of ayu demands unique policy different from other fish species the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories due to the increase in density caused by released fingerlings specifically the release policy that reduces the amount of fingerlings that are released at one time i e divide the stocked fingerlings and release them frequently and lengthens the time interval between each release increases the catch of territory holders 2 model in our previous study we developed a rate equation that describes the density dependent population dynamics of ayu within the territorial competition katsumata et al 2017 by functionally expanding this rate equation we build a simple model which takes into account a change in fish density caused by release the territorial competition of ayu occurs midstream individual fish take one of two strategies within the territorial competition territory holder th or floater fl empty sites can be classified into rapids and pools let the proportions of territory holders and floaters be y th and y fl respectively for empty sites let the proportions of rapids and pools be x rapid and x pool respectively the sum of these proportions denotes the whole region of the river where the territorial competition occurs y th y fl x rapid x pool 1 from the previous studies which describe the territorial behaviors of ayu iguchi 1996 kawanabe 1957 1973 miyadi 1960 takahashi and azuma 2006 we assume that each proportion y th y fl x rapid and x pool changes over time depending on the following cases i y th increases when floaters find vacant rapids and become territory holders decreases when territory holders give up their own territories and become floaters decreases when territory holders die and the places become vacant ii y fl decreases when floaters find vacant rapids and become territory holders increases when territory holders give up their own territories and become floaters decreases when floaters die and the places become vacant increases when newcomers which migrate from downstream become floaters increases when ayu fingerlings are released and become floaters iii x rapid increases or decreases by the change of y th iv x pool increases or decreases by the change of y fl note that newcomers are wild ayu that retrograded from downstream and fingerlings that are just released do not have their own territories corresponding to the cases of i iv we obtain the following rate equations if we assume an infinite population which can be described by the mean field theory 1 y th t 1 y fl t x rapid t r y fl t y th t d th y th t y th t y fl t 1 y fl t x rapid t r y fl t y th t d fl y fl t m t r t y fl t x rapid t 1 Œ¥ y th x rapid t x pool t 1 Œ¥ y fl x pool t fig 1 illustrates the flow diagram of a change in fish proportion in eq 1 t is a time step arbitrary unit d th and d fl denote the death rate of territory holders and floaters Œ¥y th and Œ¥y fl are the temporal variation of y th y th t 1 y th t and y fl y fl t 1 y fl t respectively we explain the functions r y fl t m t and r t in eq 1 fig 2 the function r y fl t is the rate that territory holders give up their own territories when the proportion of floaters increases the defense costs to protect the territories become larger and territory holders tend to give up their own territories iguchi et al 2003 katano et al 2004 thus we define the function r y fl t as follows 2 r y fl t 1 1 exp a Œ∏ y fl t where a and Œ∏ denote the increasing gradient and inflection point of r y fl t respectively as a increases the shape of r y fl t turns from a logistic curve which has the inflection point Œ∏ to a step function which has the threshold Œ∏ fig 2a this function converges towards 1 as y fl t increases we assume that 0 t t t 1 is the period from the beginning to the end of the season of ayu migration thus as observed in the state of ayu before spring kawanabe 1969 miyadi 1960 takahashi and azuma 2006 no fish have migrated to midstream yet at t 0 y th 0 y fl 0 0 from the above we define the function m t that is the proportion of newcomers which are wild ayu at time t 3 m t m 0 t t 0 t t where m m 0 is the proportion of newcomers during the season of ayu migration 0 t t therefore the value of m has a direct relation to the amount of wild ayu in the river the function r t is the proportion of fingerlings that are released at time t in general fishery cooperatives divide and release stocked fingerlings frequently when fingerlings whose proportion of the total amount is v are released n separate times at regular time intervals t the function r t is described as the following comb function 4 r t v n i 0 n 1 Œ¥ t i t where the function Œ¥ is an unit impulse function 5 Œ¥ z 1 z 0 0 z 0 the value of i in eq 4 relates to the i 1 th release this function r t represents a train of n number of scaled unit impulses spaced at intervals of t fig 2b the first release is carried out at t 0 then the second and subsequent releases are carried out every time interval t the release is carried out n times total and the proportion of floaters increases by v n per release stocked fingerlings seldom die because they are cultivated within artificially controlled environments which have no mortality factors thus we assume that v is a constant value usually culture based fisheries for ayu release fingerlings during the same time period as the migration of ayu 0 t t from the eq 4 the final release is carried out at t n 1 t thus we put following limitation 6 n 1 t t we put some limitations on y th y fl x rapid and x pool based on the actual evidences as follows the midstream in a typical japanese river consists of about 55 rapids and about 45 pools kawanabe 1973 among these rapids territory sites where algae grow on the surface of rocks are estimated to be about 20 thus we assume that rapids which are suitable for territory are about 10 0 55 0 20 0 11 of the whole y th becomes 0 1 when all territory sites are occupied where x rapid 0 while y th becomes 0 when no one has territory where x rapid 0 1 thus y th x rapid is always 0 1 similarly y fl x pool is always 0 9 based on the above relationships y th y fl x rapid and x pool are 7 y th x rapid 0 1 y fl x pool 0 9 we develop a formula for evaluating the utility of the release of ayu as described in the introduction the main purpose of the release of ayu is to increase the amount of territory holders thus we define the increment of the proportion of territory holders due to release as the utility 8 utility t 0 t fin y th t y th t v 0 where t fin and y th t v 0 denote the final time step of summation and the proportion of territory holders under v 0 respectively all model parameters except for v are common between y th t and y th t v 0 thus the eq 8 denotes the difference in proportion of territory holders between the cases where fingerlings are released where v 0 and where they are not released where v 0 table 1 shows the definition of parameters 3 results 3 1 population dynamics in accordance with the eq 1 we numerically calculate the population dynamics of territory holders and floaters accompanied by the release of ayu fingerlings in these calculations the proportion of newcomers which migrate from downstream per unit time m is set to a small value this setting means that the river does not have enough supply of wild ayu to sustain either a fishery or recreational fishing fig a1 the population dynamics exhibit two different patterns depending on the frequency of releases n and the time interval between each release t as follows fig 3 1 territories are maintained when n and t are large e g n t 20 200 30 200 30 150 territories are continuously maintained in the process of population change when time t is small all fish can hold their own territories in rapids and some territory sites are not occupied y th 0 1 once all territory sites are occupied y th 0 1 surplus fish become floaters in this stage some floaters die naturally and some become territory holders to take the place of dead territory holders however the proportion of floaters increases because the amount of newcomers and released fingerings is larger than this decrease this decrease in the proportion of floaters depends on the values of n and t as n or t becomes larger because the period of release 0 t n 1 t is prolonged more fish die naturally in this stage consequently the population of floaters which prevent territory holders from holding territories increases gradually as a result territories are continuously maintained under large n and t after the final release n 1 t t fish decrease due to natural death 2 territories break down when n or t is small e g results other than pattern 1 in fig 3 territories break down due to an increase in floaters caused by released fingerlings as with pattern 1 all fish can hold their own territories in rapids when t is small and surplus fish become floaters when all territory sites are occupied in the increasing stage of floaters since more fingerlings are released in a short term as n or t becomes smaller the proportion of floaters increases sharply as a result the proportion of floaters exceeds the critical limit and all fish give up their own territories and then form a school after the final release fish decrease due to natural death when the proportion of floaters decreases and falls below the other critical limit territories are reformed from the school these population dynamics reproduce the territorial behaviors of actual ayu see also introduction katsumata et al 2017 kawanabe 1957 1958 iguchi 1996 tanaka et al 2011 our results indicate that since the increase in floaters due to released fingerlings corresponds to the natural decrease in fish proportions the territories can be maintained continuously under large n and t 3 2 utility of release in accordance with the eq 8 we numerically evaluate the utility of the release of ayu fig 4 the utility for t 100 150 and 400 were plotted against n fig 4a the utility increases with an increase in n when n becomes larger than or equal to the critical limit n n n the utility increases rapidly since territories are continuously maintained in the process of population change fig 3 this critical limit n depends on the value of t and n t becomes larger with decreasing t the utility for n 20 30 and 50 were plotted against t fig 4b the utility increases with an increase in t similar to the change in utility against n the utility increases rapidly when t becomes larger than or equal to the critical limit t t t this critical limit t depends on the value of n and t n becomes larger with decreasing n as mentioned above since the increase in floaters due to released fingerlings corresponds to the natural decrease in fish proportions the increase in floaters becomes more gradual as n and t increase when n and t are sufficiently large the amount of the increase in floaters is almost equal to the amount of the natural decrease in this case almost all of the released fingerlings can become territory holders to take the place of dead territory holders therefore even if n or t is further increased from such a state the utility in eq 8 almost never changes for this reason the utility function converges towards about 950 as n or t increases see red lines in fig 4a and b the phase diagram was drawn in n t space showing the states of territories fig 4c the thick line t t n or n n t on the phase diagram shows the boundary between the maintaining and breakdown of territories the utility value greatly differs between areas above and below this boundary line thus the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories due to the increase in floaters caused by released fingerlings these results indicate that the release policy that reduces the amount of fingerlings that are released at one time and lengthens the time interval between each release i e set n and t to large values increases the catch of territory holders therefore the release of ayu demands unique policy 3 3 sensitivity analysis based on the above results in culture based fisheries for ayu it is important not to break down territories we show the change in the boundary line between the maintaining and breakdown of territories in n t space by changing one parameter while keeping the others the same as the conditions in figs 3 and 4 fig 5 various situations can be supposed depending on which parameter is changed first we consider the pressure of tomozuri which is the most popular style of fishing in japan fig 5a this fishing technique can be applied only to territory holders thus in a river popular for tomozuri the death rate of territory holders d th is larger than floaters d fl the population growth of floaters is gradual under large d th because many floaters become frequently territory holders thus territories can be maintained at small values of n and t as a result the boundary line approaches an origin n t 0 0 as d th increases next we change the amount of wild ayu in the river fig 5b when m is large because many newcomers migrate from downstream and become floaters the population growth of floaters is sharp thus large values of n and t are required in order to maintain territories for this reason the boundary line moves away from the origin as m increases furthermore our model indicates that the release into rivers that have enough supply of wild ayu yields a negative utility fig a2 then we focus on the strength of territoriality of ayu fig 5c the strength of territoriality attack frequency of ayu varies between individuals katano et al 2004 thus in a population consisting of individuals that have strong territoriality the inflection point of function r y fl t in eq 2 Œ∏ is presumed to be a large value as Œ∏ increases because it is harder for floaters to break down territories the boundary line approaches the origin finally we change the amount of stocked fingerlings v fig 5d when v is large because many fingerlings are released and become floaters the population growth of floaters is sharp thus large values of n and t are required to maintain territories as a result the boundary line moves away from the origin as v increases this result indicates that the release requires a longer period of time as the amount of stocked fingerlings becomes larger 4 conclusion and discussion in the present study we have developed a rate equation to describe the density dependent population dynamics of ayu accompanied by the release of fingerlings according to this rate equation the population dynamics exhibit different patterns depending on the frequency of releases n and the time interval between each release t fig 3 as n and t increase since the increase in floaters due to released fingerlings corresponds to the natural decrease in fish proportions the population growth of floaters becomes gradual as a result territories are continuously maintained we have evaluated the utility of the release of ayu based on the population dynamics of territory holders fig 4 the utility increases with an increase in n or t in particular the utility rapidly increases when territories are maintained in conclusion the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories due to the increase in density caused by released fingerlings furthermore we have shown the change in the boundary line between the maintaining and breakdown of territories in n t space fig 5 when the pressure of tomozuri is high fig 5a or the territoriality of ayu is strong fig 5c territories can be maintained at small values of n and t in contrast when the amount of wild ayu or stocked fingerlings is large fig 5b and d large values of n and t are required in order to maintain territories ayu exhibit a historical effect in the breakdown and formation processes of territory katsumata et al 2017 tanaka et al 2011 according to the territorial competition of ayu territory holders have to spend more time to defend their own territories as the density of fish increases when the fish density exceeds the critical limit all fish give up their own territories and then form a school territory breakdown in contrast when the density decreases and falls below the other critical limit territories are reformed from the school territory formation from the observation data it is known that the actual critical limit of territory breakdown is between 4 1 fish m2 and 5 5 fish m2 kawanabe 1969 iguchi 1996 iguchi and yamaguchi 1994 iguchi et al 2003 while that limit of territory formation is nearly equal to 1 5 fish m2 kawanabe 1969 iguchi 1996 iguchi and yamaguchi 1994 thus the breakdown and formation processes of territory exhibit the historical effect which has two transition densities that greatly differ it is difficult to reform territories from the school since the critical limit of formation i e 1 5 fish m2 is significantly smaller than the limit for breakdown i e 4 1 5 5 fish m2 this fact too indicates that the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories ayu are rather sensitive to the change in the river environment for example muddy water caused by a river flooding burdens stress on ayu and causes their diseases awata et al 2010 muraoka et al 2011 in addition sand carried by the strong water current scrapes algae off rocks and stones of riverbeds blenkinsopp and lock 1994 peterson 1996 therefore under such environmental conditions it is considered that the death rate of ayu i e d th and d fl becomes higher and the proportion of territory sites i e y th x rapid becomes smaller see also eq 7 on the other hand water temperature elevation caused by a river drought results in the high temperature rapid area where ayu cannot live and the algae decay in this case also it is considered that the proportion of territory sites becomes smaller culture based fisheries should not remarkably disturb native ecosystems thus it is necessary to design the release policy taking into account the influence of released fingerlings on native ecosystems for example other fish species aquatic insects diatoms algae and water quality are important components of a river ecosystem ayu have a great influence on the diversity in a river ecosystem because they specifically feed on algae katano et al 2000 2006 abe et al 2005 for these reasons the evaluation formula of the utility in eq 8 should be changed depending on the purpose of release and river

25176,ayu fish are actively released by many fishery cooperatives in japan these fish exhibit the density dependent population dynamics within territorial competition at low density all fish can hold feeding territories once all territory sites are occupied surplus fish become floaters as the density further increases all fish give up their own territories and then form a school territory holders are more valuable than floaters as a food source and a target of recreational fishing thus the main purpose of the release of ayu is to increase the amount of territory holders for these reasons the release policy for ayu should take into account the influence of a change in density on the population dynamics we develop a rate equation to describe the density dependent population dynamics of ayu accompanied by the release of fingerlings our results indicate that the release of ayu demands unique policy different from other fish species the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories due to the increase in density caused by released fingerlings specifically the release policy that reduces the amount of fingerlings that are released at one time and lengthens the time interval between each release increases the catch of territory holders keywords ayu plecoglossus altivelis culture based fisheries rate equation population dynamics territorial competition release policy 1 introduction culture based fisheries are important approaches to enhance fish stocks in waters that do not have enough natural supply to sustain an ecosystem fisheries and recreational fishing in contrast to aquaculture involving the cultivation of aquatic species within artificially controlled environments culture based fisheries control a part of the life history of certain species and release their seed or fry into open waters at the appropriate time honma 1980 thus in culture based fisheries the released fingerlings propagate and flourish in a natural environment until they reach harvestable size liao 1988 thorpe 1980 for this reason it is important to design the release policy from ecological features in order to effectively and sustainably increase fish catches adcp 1989 here we consider the release policy for ayu fish plecoglossus altivelis osmeridae which are an endemic migratory fish in japan kawanabe 1969 miyadi 1960 takahashi and azuma 2006 ayu form algae feeding territories midstream during a growing season iguchi 1996 kawanabe 1957 in the early growing season all fish can hold territories at low density this feeding territory is formed in rapids where algae grow on rocks and stones of riverbeds biggs et al 1998 kawanabe 1973 during the growing season newcomers migrate from downstream and fish density increases day by day once all territory sites are occupied surplus fish become non territory holders floaters and stay in deep pools kawanabe et al 1957 in contrast to rapids algae cannot grow in pools because sufficient sunlight does not reach the riverbeds thus floaters cannot sufficiently feed in pools for this reason floaters often intrude into others territories to steal algae territory holders violently attack intruders in order to defend their own territories kawanabe 1973 mizuno and kawanabe 1957 as the density further increases territory holders have to spend much more time defending territories thus losing time to feed on algae eventually all fish give up their own territories and then form a school iguchi et al 2003 katano et al 2004 conversely territories are reformed from the school when the fish density decreases iguchi 1996 thus ayu exhibit the density dependent population dynamics within the territorial competition kawanabe 1958 tanaka et al 2011 in japan ayu are one of the most important fishery resources in inland fisheries and popular as a target of recreational fishing in recent years because wild ayu are decreasing remarkably due to the degradation of river environments and the division of rivers by dams culture based fisheries for ayu are actively carried out by many fishery cooperatives it is important to note is that territory holders are more valuable as fish resources than floaters territory holders are more expensive as a food source because they are bigger on average than floaters due to rich algae kawanabe 1957 nakashima et al 2009 mori et al 2008 furthermore the most popular style of fishing in japan tomozuri which utilizes territorial behaviors of ayu can be applied only to territory holders iguchi 1996 kawanabe 1973 in tomozuri fishermen use a live decoy as an intruder for territory holders then territory holders attack the decoy in order to defend their own territories by utilizing the habit fishermen can fish the territory holders based on the above relationships the release policy for ayu should be designed to increase the amount of territory holders effectively in consideration with the ecological features of ayu previous studies have proposed some release policies for ayu from various viewpoints e g the lineage of ayu fingerlings iwata et al 2007 miura et al 2012 the impact on other species katano et al 2000 2006 the river environment i e river width tsuboi and takagi 2016 water quality awata et al 2010 muraoka et al 2011 and frequency of boulders tsuboi et al 2012 and population density katano 2014 however little attention has been given to the density dependent population dynamics which are deeply concerned with a change in density caused by release recently a rate equation that describes the density dependent population dynamics of ayu within the territorial competition has been proposed katsumata et al 2017 in the present study we incorporate the release of ayu which affects the fish density in this rate equation and examine an effective release policy for ayu by using this newly proposed model our results indicate that the release of ayu demands unique policy different from other fish species the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories due to the increase in density caused by released fingerlings specifically the release policy that reduces the amount of fingerlings that are released at one time i e divide the stocked fingerlings and release them frequently and lengthens the time interval between each release increases the catch of territory holders 2 model in our previous study we developed a rate equation that describes the density dependent population dynamics of ayu within the territorial competition katsumata et al 2017 by functionally expanding this rate equation we build a simple model which takes into account a change in fish density caused by release the territorial competition of ayu occurs midstream individual fish take one of two strategies within the territorial competition territory holder th or floater fl empty sites can be classified into rapids and pools let the proportions of territory holders and floaters be y th and y fl respectively for empty sites let the proportions of rapids and pools be x rapid and x pool respectively the sum of these proportions denotes the whole region of the river where the territorial competition occurs y th y fl x rapid x pool 1 from the previous studies which describe the territorial behaviors of ayu iguchi 1996 kawanabe 1957 1973 miyadi 1960 takahashi and azuma 2006 we assume that each proportion y th y fl x rapid and x pool changes over time depending on the following cases i y th increases when floaters find vacant rapids and become territory holders decreases when territory holders give up their own territories and become floaters decreases when territory holders die and the places become vacant ii y fl decreases when floaters find vacant rapids and become territory holders increases when territory holders give up their own territories and become floaters decreases when floaters die and the places become vacant increases when newcomers which migrate from downstream become floaters increases when ayu fingerlings are released and become floaters iii x rapid increases or decreases by the change of y th iv x pool increases or decreases by the change of y fl note that newcomers are wild ayu that retrograded from downstream and fingerlings that are just released do not have their own territories corresponding to the cases of i iv we obtain the following rate equations if we assume an infinite population which can be described by the mean field theory 1 y th t 1 y fl t x rapid t r y fl t y th t d th y th t y th t y fl t 1 y fl t x rapid t r y fl t y th t d fl y fl t m t r t y fl t x rapid t 1 Œ¥ y th x rapid t x pool t 1 Œ¥ y fl x pool t fig 1 illustrates the flow diagram of a change in fish proportion in eq 1 t is a time step arbitrary unit d th and d fl denote the death rate of territory holders and floaters Œ¥y th and Œ¥y fl are the temporal variation of y th y th t 1 y th t and y fl y fl t 1 y fl t respectively we explain the functions r y fl t m t and r t in eq 1 fig 2 the function r y fl t is the rate that territory holders give up their own territories when the proportion of floaters increases the defense costs to protect the territories become larger and territory holders tend to give up their own territories iguchi et al 2003 katano et al 2004 thus we define the function r y fl t as follows 2 r y fl t 1 1 exp a Œ∏ y fl t where a and Œ∏ denote the increasing gradient and inflection point of r y fl t respectively as a increases the shape of r y fl t turns from a logistic curve which has the inflection point Œ∏ to a step function which has the threshold Œ∏ fig 2a this function converges towards 1 as y fl t increases we assume that 0 t t t 1 is the period from the beginning to the end of the season of ayu migration thus as observed in the state of ayu before spring kawanabe 1969 miyadi 1960 takahashi and azuma 2006 no fish have migrated to midstream yet at t 0 y th 0 y fl 0 0 from the above we define the function m t that is the proportion of newcomers which are wild ayu at time t 3 m t m 0 t t 0 t t where m m 0 is the proportion of newcomers during the season of ayu migration 0 t t therefore the value of m has a direct relation to the amount of wild ayu in the river the function r t is the proportion of fingerlings that are released at time t in general fishery cooperatives divide and release stocked fingerlings frequently when fingerlings whose proportion of the total amount is v are released n separate times at regular time intervals t the function r t is described as the following comb function 4 r t v n i 0 n 1 Œ¥ t i t where the function Œ¥ is an unit impulse function 5 Œ¥ z 1 z 0 0 z 0 the value of i in eq 4 relates to the i 1 th release this function r t represents a train of n number of scaled unit impulses spaced at intervals of t fig 2b the first release is carried out at t 0 then the second and subsequent releases are carried out every time interval t the release is carried out n times total and the proportion of floaters increases by v n per release stocked fingerlings seldom die because they are cultivated within artificially controlled environments which have no mortality factors thus we assume that v is a constant value usually culture based fisheries for ayu release fingerlings during the same time period as the migration of ayu 0 t t from the eq 4 the final release is carried out at t n 1 t thus we put following limitation 6 n 1 t t we put some limitations on y th y fl x rapid and x pool based on the actual evidences as follows the midstream in a typical japanese river consists of about 55 rapids and about 45 pools kawanabe 1973 among these rapids territory sites where algae grow on the surface of rocks are estimated to be about 20 thus we assume that rapids which are suitable for territory are about 10 0 55 0 20 0 11 of the whole y th becomes 0 1 when all territory sites are occupied where x rapid 0 while y th becomes 0 when no one has territory where x rapid 0 1 thus y th x rapid is always 0 1 similarly y fl x pool is always 0 9 based on the above relationships y th y fl x rapid and x pool are 7 y th x rapid 0 1 y fl x pool 0 9 we develop a formula for evaluating the utility of the release of ayu as described in the introduction the main purpose of the release of ayu is to increase the amount of territory holders thus we define the increment of the proportion of territory holders due to release as the utility 8 utility t 0 t fin y th t y th t v 0 where t fin and y th t v 0 denote the final time step of summation and the proportion of territory holders under v 0 respectively all model parameters except for v are common between y th t and y th t v 0 thus the eq 8 denotes the difference in proportion of territory holders between the cases where fingerlings are released where v 0 and where they are not released where v 0 table 1 shows the definition of parameters 3 results 3 1 population dynamics in accordance with the eq 1 we numerically calculate the population dynamics of territory holders and floaters accompanied by the release of ayu fingerlings in these calculations the proportion of newcomers which migrate from downstream per unit time m is set to a small value this setting means that the river does not have enough supply of wild ayu to sustain either a fishery or recreational fishing fig a1 the population dynamics exhibit two different patterns depending on the frequency of releases n and the time interval between each release t as follows fig 3 1 territories are maintained when n and t are large e g n t 20 200 30 200 30 150 territories are continuously maintained in the process of population change when time t is small all fish can hold their own territories in rapids and some territory sites are not occupied y th 0 1 once all territory sites are occupied y th 0 1 surplus fish become floaters in this stage some floaters die naturally and some become territory holders to take the place of dead territory holders however the proportion of floaters increases because the amount of newcomers and released fingerings is larger than this decrease this decrease in the proportion of floaters depends on the values of n and t as n or t becomes larger because the period of release 0 t n 1 t is prolonged more fish die naturally in this stage consequently the population of floaters which prevent territory holders from holding territories increases gradually as a result territories are continuously maintained under large n and t after the final release n 1 t t fish decrease due to natural death 2 territories break down when n or t is small e g results other than pattern 1 in fig 3 territories break down due to an increase in floaters caused by released fingerlings as with pattern 1 all fish can hold their own territories in rapids when t is small and surplus fish become floaters when all territory sites are occupied in the increasing stage of floaters since more fingerlings are released in a short term as n or t becomes smaller the proportion of floaters increases sharply as a result the proportion of floaters exceeds the critical limit and all fish give up their own territories and then form a school after the final release fish decrease due to natural death when the proportion of floaters decreases and falls below the other critical limit territories are reformed from the school these population dynamics reproduce the territorial behaviors of actual ayu see also introduction katsumata et al 2017 kawanabe 1957 1958 iguchi 1996 tanaka et al 2011 our results indicate that since the increase in floaters due to released fingerlings corresponds to the natural decrease in fish proportions the territories can be maintained continuously under large n and t 3 2 utility of release in accordance with the eq 8 we numerically evaluate the utility of the release of ayu fig 4 the utility for t 100 150 and 400 were plotted against n fig 4a the utility increases with an increase in n when n becomes larger than or equal to the critical limit n n n the utility increases rapidly since territories are continuously maintained in the process of population change fig 3 this critical limit n depends on the value of t and n t becomes larger with decreasing t the utility for n 20 30 and 50 were plotted against t fig 4b the utility increases with an increase in t similar to the change in utility against n the utility increases rapidly when t becomes larger than or equal to the critical limit t t t this critical limit t depends on the value of n and t n becomes larger with decreasing n as mentioned above since the increase in floaters due to released fingerlings corresponds to the natural decrease in fish proportions the increase in floaters becomes more gradual as n and t increase when n and t are sufficiently large the amount of the increase in floaters is almost equal to the amount of the natural decrease in this case almost all of the released fingerlings can become territory holders to take the place of dead territory holders therefore even if n or t is further increased from such a state the utility in eq 8 almost never changes for this reason the utility function converges towards about 950 as n or t increases see red lines in fig 4a and b the phase diagram was drawn in n t space showing the states of territories fig 4c the thick line t t n or n n t on the phase diagram shows the boundary between the maintaining and breakdown of territories the utility value greatly differs between areas above and below this boundary line thus the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories due to the increase in floaters caused by released fingerlings these results indicate that the release policy that reduces the amount of fingerlings that are released at one time and lengthens the time interval between each release i e set n and t to large values increases the catch of territory holders therefore the release of ayu demands unique policy 3 3 sensitivity analysis based on the above results in culture based fisheries for ayu it is important not to break down territories we show the change in the boundary line between the maintaining and breakdown of territories in n t space by changing one parameter while keeping the others the same as the conditions in figs 3 and 4 fig 5 various situations can be supposed depending on which parameter is changed first we consider the pressure of tomozuri which is the most popular style of fishing in japan fig 5a this fishing technique can be applied only to territory holders thus in a river popular for tomozuri the death rate of territory holders d th is larger than floaters d fl the population growth of floaters is gradual under large d th because many floaters become frequently territory holders thus territories can be maintained at small values of n and t as a result the boundary line approaches an origin n t 0 0 as d th increases next we change the amount of wild ayu in the river fig 5b when m is large because many newcomers migrate from downstream and become floaters the population growth of floaters is sharp thus large values of n and t are required in order to maintain territories for this reason the boundary line moves away from the origin as m increases furthermore our model indicates that the release into rivers that have enough supply of wild ayu yields a negative utility fig a2 then we focus on the strength of territoriality of ayu fig 5c the strength of territoriality attack frequency of ayu varies between individuals katano et al 2004 thus in a population consisting of individuals that have strong territoriality the inflection point of function r y fl t in eq 2 Œ∏ is presumed to be a large value as Œ∏ increases because it is harder for floaters to break down territories the boundary line approaches the origin finally we change the amount of stocked fingerlings v fig 5d when v is large because many fingerlings are released and become floaters the population growth of floaters is sharp thus large values of n and t are required to maintain territories as a result the boundary line moves away from the origin as v increases this result indicates that the release requires a longer period of time as the amount of stocked fingerlings becomes larger 4 conclusion and discussion in the present study we have developed a rate equation to describe the density dependent population dynamics of ayu accompanied by the release of fingerlings according to this rate equation the population dynamics exhibit different patterns depending on the frequency of releases n and the time interval between each release t fig 3 as n and t increase since the increase in floaters due to released fingerlings corresponds to the natural decrease in fish proportions the population growth of floaters becomes gradual as a result territories are continuously maintained we have evaluated the utility of the release of ayu based on the population dynamics of territory holders fig 4 the utility increases with an increase in n or t in particular the utility rapidly increases when territories are maintained in conclusion the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories due to the increase in density caused by released fingerlings furthermore we have shown the change in the boundary line between the maintaining and breakdown of territories in n t space fig 5 when the pressure of tomozuri is high fig 5a or the territoriality of ayu is strong fig 5c territories can be maintained at small values of n and t in contrast when the amount of wild ayu or stocked fingerlings is large fig 5b and d large values of n and t are required in order to maintain territories ayu exhibit a historical effect in the breakdown and formation processes of territory katsumata et al 2017 tanaka et al 2011 according to the territorial competition of ayu territory holders have to spend more time to defend their own territories as the density of fish increases when the fish density exceeds the critical limit all fish give up their own territories and then form a school territory breakdown in contrast when the density decreases and falls below the other critical limit territories are reformed from the school territory formation from the observation data it is known that the actual critical limit of territory breakdown is between 4 1 fish m2 and 5 5 fish m2 kawanabe 1969 iguchi 1996 iguchi and yamaguchi 1994 iguchi et al 2003 while that limit of territory formation is nearly equal to 1 5 fish m2 kawanabe 1969 iguchi 1996 iguchi and yamaguchi 1994 thus the breakdown and formation processes of territory exhibit the historical effect which has two transition densities that greatly differ it is difficult to reform territories from the school since the critical limit of formation i e 1 5 fish m2 is significantly smaller than the limit for breakdown i e 4 1 5 5 fish m2 this fact too indicates that the release of ayu should be carried out so as not to break down territories ayu are rather sensitive to the change in the river environment for example muddy water caused by a river flooding burdens stress on ayu and causes their diseases awata et al 2010 muraoka et al 2011 in addition sand carried by the strong water current scrapes algae off rocks and stones of riverbeds blenkinsopp and lock 1994 peterson 1996 therefore under such environmental conditions it is considered that the death rate of ayu i e d th and d fl becomes higher and the proportion of territory sites i e y th x rapid becomes smaller see also eq 7 on the other hand water temperature elevation caused by a river drought results in the high temperature rapid area where ayu cannot live and the algae decay in this case also it is considered that the proportion of territory sites becomes smaller culture based fisheries should not remarkably disturb native ecosystems thus it is necessary to design the release policy taking into account the influence of released fingerlings on native ecosystems for example other fish species aquatic insects diatoms algae and water quality are important components of a river ecosystem ayu have a great influence on the diversity in a river ecosystem because they specifically feed on algae katano et al 2000 2006 abe et al 2005 for these reasons the evaluation formula of the utility in eq 8 should be changed depending on the purpose of release and river

25177,the complexity of honeybees provides systems to study mechanisms affecting their population dynamics an essential environmental variable influencing the age based division of labor of worker honeybees is their nutritional status we present basic but important assumptions that can help us understand the complexity of honeybee population dynamics given their nutritional status we propose a non linear differential equation system that models the population dynamics of brood and worker bees nurses and foragers within a colony the dynamics of these populations are influenced by the available stored pollen in cells and the current levels of vitellogenin vg a major storage protein in the fat body of nurse bees our model shows a the importance of pollen collection and consumption rates adequate feeding rates to the queen and the impact of good nutrition during the larvae stage for future foraging activity b the size of both the brood and worker populations at equilibrium are directly dependent upon the increase of levels of vg titers in nurse bees c division of labor regulatory effects determined by the vg titers in nurse bees are important for balancing nurse bee and forager populations d coexistence of both brood and worker populations is dependent upon available food for the brood i e pollen collected and converted to vg and available foragers e taking into account seasonal changes in pollen collection improves the prediction of long term consequences keywords honeybees division of labor vitellogenin nutrition mathematical model seasonal changes pollen derived proteins 1 introduction honeybees apis mellifera are social and have a high structured division of labor a typical colony of honeybees is composed of 10 20 thousand eggs larvae and pupae up to 30 000 adult workers all females zero to several hundred drones males and a single female queen in general the queen bee is the only egg laying member while worker bees perform a number of tasks including feeding the queen colony maintenance colony defense against honey robbers but most importantly rearing the brood and maintaining the required nutritional demands of the colony such as pollen nectar propolis and water robinson 1992 seeley 2009 calderone 1998 johnson 2010 behavioral task distribution of bees can be influenced by aging genes and environment wright et al 2018 for instance in the spring and summer division of labor is shaped to maximize the accumulation of resources e g honey and growth rate while in the winter worker bees become less differentiated in task performance because the primary goal is to maintain worker survivorship through this season johnson 2010 the growth development productivity and health of a honeybee colony is dependent upon fulfilling the nutritional demands of larvae and adult workers brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 survival and quality of larvae and adult workers are of prime importance for the productivity and health of a colony in general a honeybee colony requires of macronutrients i e proteins carbohydrates and fats and of micronutrients i e vitamins and minerals for growth and development of healthy larvae and adults brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 winston 1992 crailsheim et al 1992 the colony having specific needs monitors foraging efforts to collect nectar pollen water and tree resin wright et al 2018 however the nutritional needs at the individual bee level are mostly determined by somatic demands arising with age and behavioral role in the colony paoli et al 2014 for instance findings in paoli et al 2014 show that young bees require higher protein intake than older adult workers prioritizing their dietary intake of carbohydrates over protein as they age for honeybees the main source of carbohydrates is floral nectar while pollen satisfies the nutritional requirements for protein lipids sterols and micronutrients winston 1992 wright et al 2018 vaudo et al 2015 several studies have shown that honeybees regulate the intake of macronutrients around specific proportions wright et al 2018 schmickl and crailsheim 2004 nectar is collected in excess according to floral nectar availability wright et al 2018 schmickl and crailsheim 2004 vaudo et al 2015 transformed gradually to honey during the returning flight and within the nest nicolson and human 2008 stored in sealed cells as honey brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 and reserved for overwintering needs khoury et al 2013 honey stored in tens of kilograms seeley 2009 is used as fuel for energy intensive flights colony thermoregulation and wax production wheeler and robinson 2014 wright et al 2018 on the other hand pollen is collected as a reserve for only a few days depending on the ratio of pollen supply to pollen demand dreller et al 1999 camazine 1993 maintaining in storage about 1 kg on average wright et al 2018 pollen foragers make decisions based on the pollen available in cells acting as a negative stimulus i e decreasing pollen foraging and on chemical pheromones from the existing larvae acting as a positive stimulus i e increasing pollen foraging dreller et al 1999 schmickl and crailsheim 2004 pankiw and page 2001a fewell and winston 1992 page 2013 bees hoard food in the form of honey nectar and bee bread pollen wright et al 2018 the pollen stored and processed by young hive bees bee bread differs in its nutritional value from floral pollen wright et al 2018 the protein and lipid content in bee bread is found to be in smaller ranges than floral pollen wright et al 2018 herbert and shimanuki 1978 however the quantity of protein in pollen is of less significance than the amount of essential amino acids proportional to bee requirements wright et al 2018 groot and d 1953 pollen is the only source of the ten essential amino acids i e protein required by honeybees bitondi and simoes 1996 brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 huang et al 2010 in fact some studies have suggested a link between foraging behavior and amino acid nutrition hendriksma and shafir 2016 therefore consumption of pollen is evidence of high protein levels in the haemolymph which is usually accompanied by high levels of storage proteins such as vitellogenin frias et al 2016 in this study we want to focus our attention to a glycolipoprotein vitellogenin vitellogenin vg is an egg yolk protein which is the primary source of amino acids hughes 2015 and it appears to be one of the most important regulators of immunity and longevity of honeybees amdam et al 2009 amdam and omholt 2002 glavinic et al 2017 worker bees begin the synthesis of vitellogenin 2 3 days later after emerging as an adult amdam et al 2010 2003 vg is synthesized primarily in the fat body cells of the abdomen released into the haemolymph and incorporated into the hypopharyngeal glands hpgs where it is used to make royal jelly proteins amdam and omholt 2002 h√∂lldobler and wilson 2009 these glands provide secretions rich in protein which are fed by nurse bees to larvae and adults of all three castes ahn et al 2012 crailsheim et al 1992 paoli et al 2014 a wide range of proteins are stored in the fat body and haemolymph but vitellogenin is the most dominant in both queens and workers amdam and omholt 2002 brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 studies have shown that vitellogenin is dependent on the availability and quality of pollen amdam et al 2010 it has several functions in worker bees such as adult bee physiological development immune responses such as reducing susceptibility to parasites and pathogens amdam et al 2004 2009 alaux et al 2011 page et al 2012 and oxidative stress resistance seehuus et al 2006 amdam and omholt 2002 also vitellogenin is utilized for various metabolic purposes in addition to brood food production amdam and omholt 2002 oliver 2007 guidugli et al 2005 such as acting as an antioxidant to prolong queen bee and forager lifespans as well as acting as a hormone that affects future foraging behavior amdam et al 2010 oliver 2007 page et al 2012 ihle et al 2010 vitellogenin levels are important during the nest stage and thus influence honeybee worker division of labor the relationship between vitellogenin and their pronounced division of labor can be seen by comparing the levels of vitellogenin in the fat body or by comparing the size of the hpg for instance in nurse bees vitellogenin titer levels in the fat body are high allowing them to transfer protein to larvae and other colony members amdam and omholt 2003 tsuruda and page 2009 while in foragers are low ahn et al 2012 crailsheim 1992 on the other hand the size of hpg is an indicator of protein nutrition prior to becoming a nurse and affects their ability to care for larvae ahn et al 2012 huang and otis 1989 hrassnigg and crailsheim 1998 two to three weeks after emergence as an adult vitellogenin synthesis declines in workers inducing a transition from nursing to foraging behavior amdam and omholt 2002 tsuruda and page 2009 amdam et al 2010 guidugli et al 2005 individual foragers may concentrate more on collecting either pollen or nectar due to variation in the life history anatomy physiology and genotypes of individuals that are linked to the titers of vitellogenin and juvenile hormone amdam et al 2010 tsuruda and page 2009 the consequences of protein shortage could be tremendous it could affect brood production the quality or the number of larvae reared to adulthood and colony nutritional state towards future brood rearing brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 this does not only have an effect on the size of the population but also on the age demography which then affects the division of labor schmickl and crailsheim 2007 also when pollen is unavailable due to bad weather or other adverse environmental conditions bees will engage in brood cannibalism to obtain the protein necessary to feed other larvae brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 carroll et al 2017 haydak 1970 schmickl and crailsheim 2004 khoury et al 2013 several studies show that poor pollen nutrition can have an impact on different causes leading to colony collapse disorder such causes include resistance to infections and viruses such as nosema and varroa in addition to sensitivity to pesticides degrandi hoffman et al 2010 huang 2012 wahl and ulm 1983 change of season weather and temperature have huge impacts on the population dynamics of a honeybee colony but also on social regulation johnson 2003 they can affect the amount of proteins in the fat body of a worker bee amdam and omholt 2002 brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 for instance wintering workers have in general a high haemolymph vitellogenin titer higher in late autumn than at the end of winter however the titer of brood less worker bees in the summer may be higher than in the winter bees probably due to the absence of food transmission to brood amdam and omholt 2002 climate variability has an effect on nutritional factors related to the quality and the quantity of nectar and pollen resources switanek et al 2017 intensity of temperature rain or solar radiation have been connected with the foraging activity of honeybees switanek et al 2017 vicens and bosch 2000 szabo 1980 abou shaara 2014 which induces an effect on the egg laying rate of the queen bee torres et al 2015 there are studies showing that rainy periods can cease foraging activities switanek et al 2017 riessberger and crailsheim 1997 schmickl and crailsheim 2007 amdam et al 2010 availability of nectar and pollen in the field affected by environmental factors that change seasonally also influence foraging activity amdam et al 2009 therefore summer time is when bees foraging rate is the highest along with mortality rate amdam and omholt 2002 and during fall foraging is almost ceased mathematical models have been developed to study honeybee colony population dynamics schmickl and crailsheim 2007 becher et al 2014 perry et al 2015 kang et al 2016 messan et al 2017 khoury et al 2011 2013 schmickl and karsai 2017 the most relevant studies to our work are those of schmickl and crailsheim 2007 khoury et al 2013 becher et al 2014 perry et al 2015 and schmickl and karsai 2017 which all modeled the population dynamics of honeybees and nutrient stores the approach of these studies differs from each other but have primarily focused on specific factors affecting the dynamics of brood and worker population for instance schmickl and crailsheim 2007 created a difference equation model to study the population and resource dynamics of a honeybee colony by focusing on the importance of pollen supply and of brood cannibalism they also provided an extensive review about other mathematical models and their purpose several of these models have focused on behavioral aspects of foraging food processing spatial organization and processes associated with division of labor in khoury et al 2013 they presented a theoretical framework to explore how the dynamics of food flow through a colony might interact with population dynamics to determine colony growth and development more recently becher et al 2014 developed beehave which integrates honeybee colony dynamics and population dynamics of the varroa mite and transmitted viruses with and explicit foraging model later becher et al 2016 developed another software tool beescout which can simulate bee search patterns in any mapped landscape aiding the explanation of how landscape configurations and parameters describing searching behavior affect detection probability of food sources in addition seasonal nectar and pollen availability in realistic landscapes is also implemented in beescout this software tool can also be used as an input for beehave to predict the overall impact of multiple stressors that can affect colony growth and death perry et al 2015 developed a model to explore possible impacts of age dependent foraging performance on a colony affected by different stressors including nutritional schmickl and karsai 2017 developed a mathematical model that links age polyethism by predicting the dynamics of brood population and it links colony level fitness by predicting the dynamics of adult forager populations and nutrient stores another relevant study to our work is that of amdam and omholt 2002 developing a nonlinear differential equation model to predict the vitellogenin dynamics in the fat body the haemolymph and the hpgs of an individual bee that is exposed to various task scenarios in different seasons the results of this model show consistency with empirical data and serve as a starting point to the assumptions of our model we investigate the implications of the information stated above by developing a honeybee population model using nonlinear differential equations this model will allow us to investigate how the dynamics of vitellogenin titers might interact with population dynamics to influence colony growth we will be looking at the vitellogenin dynamics of the adult worker population influencing the distribution of adult worker bees to tasks such as brood nursing and food collection specifically we focus on the importance of pollen derived proteins and the impacts on the division of labor our goal is to propose a starting point of modeling techniques that can allow us to study present problems leading to colony collapses such as nutritional stress naug 2009 scarcity of food sources naug 2009 and climate change 2 model development we propose a nonlinear ordinary differential equations model with the following state variables b t represents the brood population size consisting of eggs and larvae and n t f t represents the worker population size of the two main task groups in a colony i e nurses and foragers respectively at time t in addition we consider the current pollen storage in the colony p t and the available vitellogenin titers in nurse bees v t at time t respectively our five compartment model is derived following specific details found in the literature and assumptions from empirical findings 1 the rate of change of brood population b t d b dt is determined by input the egg laying rate by the queen is related to the amount of royal jelly fed by nurse bees and each egg contains certain amount of vg to start developing allen 1960 moore et al 2015 amdam and omholt 2002 i e c q Œ± q v e g where e g is the average content of vg in one egg and c q 0 1 is the conversion efficiency of queen transfer of vg into egg laying production i e 1 c q Œ± q v can be considered as the metabolic cost of queen for egg laying production output transition rate from brood to nurse bee Œ≤ bh 1 œÑ bf where œÑ bf is the developmental time from brood to nurse bee here we assume that there is no additional brood death thus the dynamics of the brood can be described by the following equation 1 b c q Œ± q v e g queen s egg laying rate Œ≤ bf b transition rate to nurse 2 nurse bees are a temporal worker sub caste that specializes in brood rearing dreller et al 1999 m√ºnch and amdam 2010 the rate of change of the nursing worker population n t dn dt is determined by input transition rate from brood Œ≤ bh b outputs transition rate to forager Œ≤ hf 1 œÑ hf where œÑ hf is the developmental time from nurse to forager bee after nursing bees transition to foraging tasks outside the colony due at least in part to low levels of vitellogenin titers amdam et al 2010 amdam and omholt 2003 huang et al 1994 goblirsch et al 2013 the transition rate to forager increases when nurse bees have low levels of vitellogenin at time t this implies that the transition rate Œ≤ hf v n 1 from nurse to forager is a decreasing function of the average of vg per nurse bee an example of this transition rate can be Œ≤ hf Œ≤ hf m n 1 Œ± v v n 1 where Œ≤ hf m is the maximum transition rate from nurse bee to forager when the average of vg per nurse bee v n is very low and Œ± v regulates the effects of the vg per nurse bee on the transitional rate from nurse bee to forager when v n is high i e if v n is high then the transition rate from nurse to forager bee will be very small mortality rate d h is a nonlinear function of vg contained in nurse bees and its population size n and foragers f seehuus et al 2006 we assume that d h is decreasing with respect to the average vg per nurse bee v n and increasing with respect to n and foragers f i e d h v n n for simplification we can just take d h as a constant that is smaller than the death rate of forager thus the dynamics of the hive can be described by the following equation 2 n Œ≤ bh transition from brood b Œ≤ hf v n 1 transition to forager decreasing with v n d h v n n nurse mortality rate depend e n t on vg and n n 3 the rate of change of foraging worker population f t d f dt is determined by input transition rate from nurse Œ≤ hf v n 1 n output mortality rate d f f should be a nonlinear function of vg contained in forager bees and its population size f for simplicity we assume that d f d h is constant m√ºnch and amdam 2010 thus the dynamics of the foragers can be described by the following equation 3 f Œ≤ hf v n 1 n transition from nurse bee to forager decreasing with v d f f forager mortality rate 4 the rate of change of pollen storage p t d p dt is determined by input the parameter r is the maximum pollen collection rate by foragers the pollen collection rate is regulated by the foraging worker population f and brood population b and the available pollen stored p in the colony tsuruda and page 2009 fewell and page 1993 pankiw and page 1999 2001b described by rbf 1 ab b p which implies a more larvae results in more brood pheromone that stimulates pollen foraging behavior and b more stored pollen reduces pollen foraging activity traynor et al 2014 camazine 1993 the parameters a and b represent the regulation effects of brood and pollen storage respectively output on average each nurse bee removes pollen at the rate of Œ± p i e more pollen faster removing rate the total removing rate of pollen by all nurse bees is Œ± p n in addition we assume that the pollen has a deterioration rate of d p due to the lack of attending or consumption it is known that nurse bees prefer to consume fresh pollen wright et al 2018 stored less than 72 h anderson et al 2014 thus the dynamics of the pollen storage can be described by the following equation 4 p rb 1 ab bp regulated pollen collection rate f Œ± np removing rate of pollen by nurse bee for vg production d p p deterioration rate of pollen 5 the rate of change of vg in nurse bees v t d v dt is determined by inputs production rate of vg from pollen by nurses and the total vg contained in newly emerged adult bees nurse bees deplete pollen reserves for the synthesis of vitellogenin dreller et al 1999 m√ºnch and amdam 2010 the conversion rate of pollen per gram to vg is represented by c thus the consumed pollen Œ± p h would be converted to vg with the amount of c Œ± p h there are Œ≤ bh b t 1 œÑ bf b t newly emerged adult bees whose content of vg could be estimated as follows Œ≤ bh c q Œ± q v t œÑ bf c q Œ± q v t œÑ bf e g t

laying production and longevity haydak 1970 wang et al 2014 and to the brood to regulate growth and development traynor et al 2014 crailsheim et al 1992 the portion of vg distributed to brood is measured by the product of the brood population b and the average brood s consumption rate Œ± b v similarly feeding rate to queen is measured by Œ± q v use vg for their own metabolism which is described by Œ± h nv dying during the nursing stage is described by d h v surviving and transitioning into foragers can be described by Œ≤ hf v n 1 v thus the dynamics of the vg in nurses can be

we take Œ≤ hf m n v Œ≤ hf m 1 Œ± v n v d h v n n d h and the simplified version of v in eq 6 when v 0 we define Œ≤ hf m 1 Œ± v n v 0 we provide a state diagram in fig 1 to aid visualize the relationships of the state variables in our model 3 results in this section we explore the dynamics of model 7 analytically and provide biological implications note that an interior equilibria of model 7 can be expressed in the following form 8 p v b n f œÜ Œæ n c Œ± Œæ Œ± h c q Œ± b Œ± q e g Œ≤ bh Œæ n Œæ c q Œ± q e g Œ≤ bh Œæ n n Œ≤ hf m n d f 1 Œ± v Œæ where œÜ Œæ Œ± q c Œ± Œæ 1 c q 1 1 e g Œæ and n is a positive solution of the polynomial f n c 3 n 3 c 2 n 2 c 1 n c 0 where c i i 0 a b 3 are polynomials of Œæ see details in b 5 the parameter Œæ measures nurse bees nutritional status and can be expressed as follows 9 Œæ c q Œ± q Œ± v d h e g Œ≤ hf m e g c q Œ± q Œ± v e g d h e g Œ≤ hf m 2 4 c q Œ± q Œ± v d h e g 2 Œ± v d h e g note that Œæ 1 v n is the vg content per nurse bee from simple analysis see appendix a we can conclude that the level of vg per nurse bee decreases when the feeding rate to queen and the efficiency of converting vg for egg laying production Œ± q and c q respectively increases also since Œ± v is a parameter that regulates the effects of the levels of vg per nurse bee that have on the transition rate from nurse to forager if Œ± v is too small this can void this regulation effect but too large can enhance it and possibly lose tractability of this effect moreover the levels of vg per nurse bee show an increase when there is an increase of the average content of vg per egg the mortality rate of bees during the nursing stage and the maximum transition rate from nurse to forager i e e g d h and Œ≤ hf m let a b c c q d f d h d p e g Œ± Œ± b Œ± q Œ± v Œ≤ hf m Œ≤ bh be positive parameters more details regarding the derivation of 8 can be found in appendix b and the number of interior equilibria the model 7 have is determined with the following theorem theorem 3 1 existence of interior equilibria system 7 is positive invariant in ‚Ñù 5 model 7 always has the extinction equilibrium e 0 which is always asymptotically stable and can have none or two interior equilibria under the following conditions 1 no interior equilibria if Œ± b cr Œæ Œ≤ hf m d f 1 Œ± v Œæ 2 two interior equilibria if Œ± b cr Œæ Œ≤ hf m d f 1 Œ± v Œæ biological implication our model can have up to two interior equilibria i e two possible points of the form p v b n f where all the components are greater than zero and have the potential to become stable if an interior equilibrium point becomes stable it means that depending on parameter values and initial conditions both the brood and worker populations and quantities of stored pollen and vitellogenin in nurse bees will reach a specific size determined by 8 and stay stable at that point in the long term note that Œ± b cr Œæ Œ≤ hf m d f 1 Œ± v Œæ cr n v Œ≤ hf m d f 1 Œ± v Œæ cr v f which can be simplified as cr Œ± b v f this is interpreted as follows if the colony s nutritional status is good i e pollen collection processing and consumption are suitable for colony s needs then both brood and worker populations are able to coexist i e both populations can reach one of the two interior equilibria otherwise the colony may die out also from 8 we can conclude that the components p v b f increase when Œæ decreases or levels of vitellogenin per nurse bee i e 1 Œæ increases next we analyze the synergetic effects in a numerical fashion over the population size of brood and worker bees given by parameters affecting the levels of vitellogenin per nurse bee the levels of vitellogenin per nurse bee i e 1 Œæ increase as the transition rate from nurse to forager Œ≤ hf m increases see appendix a in fig 2 we can see that as v n increases the brood population and forager task group s size increase in a similar fashion until they both reach a maximum while the nurse task group s size decreases when Œ≤ hf m 1 7 both brood and foragers follow a similar shape because in our model brood population is mostly dependent by the amount of pollen collected by foragers which then will be converted to nutritious jelly another explanation to this observation in our model is that recruiting more pollen foragers increases the inflow of proteinaceous pollen prompting to lower larval mortality and less starvation schmickl and karsai 2016 also forager task group s size display a maximum when v n 0 0058 g which corresponds to 7 days old after emerging from cell this level of vg at 7 days old may represent a minimum time for nurse bees to initiate foraging activity at a faster rate also we can see that the left end to mid range of the v n axis corresponding to the low mid levels of vg per nurse bee coincide with the transition rate of Œ≤ hf m 1 21 1 7 this range is consistent with empirical findings in tsuruda and page 2009 where the bees start foraging 2 3 weeks after emerging fig 3 help us understand the impact of Œ± v which measures the regulation of vg per nurse bee affecting the developmental time from nursing to foraging on the dynamics of v n in our model for instance if Œ± v is too large then the levels of v n become very small having no impact on the transition rate from nurse to forager however if Œ± v is too small it can diminish the tractability of the effects of the levels of vg towards the task switching from nurse to forager in this figure we can see that as the levels of v n increase the task group s size of nurses decreases while the foragers one increases this is not true from our assumptions where transition rate from nurses to foragers increases if the vg levels per nurse bee decreases this is an example in which if Œ± v is too large it can overemphasize the regulation effects of levels of vg however medium ranges for Œ± v could be most optimal in our model hence Œ± v seems to be a sensitive parameter that strongly determines the effects of the levels of v n on task switching rates and should be chosen very carefully in order to capture more realistic effects in fig 4 we observe the importance of the rate at which the queen is fed by the nurses given that it can determine the future of the colony since it affects the colony as a whole in the same way for instance the highest values of v n displayed in these figures are given by a small Œ± q this means that if very low amount of vg is fed to the queen the nurse bees will have more vg stored in their body fats also we observe that a decreasing feeding rate to the queen negatively affects the colony no matter if other mechanisms such as feeding the brood collection rate of pollen or synthesis of vg are in place decreasing parameters such as Œ± v Œ± q and c q can increase the vg content per nurse bee i e decreasing the regulation effects of the amount of vg per nurse on the transition rate from nurse bee to forager feeding rate to the queen and efficiency of converting the vg for egg laying by the queen respectively low conversion rate of vg from pollen can cause the colony to collapse see white region in fig 5 a c note that these three parameters act in a synergistic manner creating a chain of events starting from the fact that if Œ± v is reasonably small then there is an increase amount of foragers more likely bringing back pollen then if the conversion rate from pollen to vg by nurse bees is low there is not enough vg per nurse bee produced to feed the queen i e small Œ± q lower right end white region in fig 5b and therefore the queen cannot use stored vg for egg laying production lower right end white region in fig 5c all these synergetic effects can cause colony s death increasing parameters such as e g Œ≤ hf m and d h can increase vg content per nurse bee i e increasing the average amount of vg per egg laid the maximum transition rate from nurse bee to forager and mortality rate of nurse bee respectively large parameter values of e g and Œ≤ hf m and low to medium conversion rate of vg from pollen c can cause death of populations within the colony see fig 5d and e however if the mortality rate of nurse bees increases or is too large then our results show that the conversion rate of vg to pollen must be high in order to keep the colony alive see fig 5f from a simple analysis see appendix a we know that the content of vg per nurse increases with the decrease of c q which measures the efficiency of using vg for egg laying production by the queen results in fig 6 a and b suggest that low collection rate of pollen r and low consumption rate of pollen by nurses Œ± together with low c q can drive the colony to die out similarly medium to low c q and low to high values of average feeding rate of vg to brood can cause colony s death see fig 6c it is clear from these simulations that the efficiency of converting vg for egg laying production by the queen plays an important role for colony survival in addition a rapid depletion of food stores for brood feeding can cause the colony to die of starvation le conte and navajas 2008 high feeding rate to queen Œ± q prompts a decrease of vg per nurse bee since the queen is usually fed with larger quantities than brood if this is the case the nurse bees will not have enough vg to feed brood and for their own metabolic use therefore this extreme situation can cause colony s death see fig 7 a moreover if Œ± q is low then the regulation effects of current brood in the colony a and the regulation effects of stored pollen b are high see white region on right end of fig 7b and b it will prompt a smaller overall pollen collection rate however a small overall pollen collection rate will cause a decrease and limited availability of pollen for consumption by nurse bees and feeding to brood and queen this scenario will be critical on the survivability of the colony and according to our numerical results in fig 7b and c respectively shows that nurse bees will invest more on the queen by feeding it at higher rates reducing available vg per nurse bee in order to lay more eggs and maintain the colony alive also an increase or decrease of Œ± q has no influence with respect to the maximum pollen collection rate r on determining coexistence of populations within the colony in fig 8 a c we vary the parameter a v which regulates the effects of the levels of vg per nurse that have over the transition rate from nurse to forager in order to have a clear understanding of these simulations it is necessary to have in mind that when Œ± v is very small close to zero the effects of the level of vg per nurse on task switching rates from nurse to bee are almost null also too large Œ± v may have a negative impact in the assumptions made for our model with this in mind we proceed to the explanations of each scenario in fig 8a and b we can see that low collection and consumption rate of pollen r and Œ± respectively can cause the colony to die when the levels of vg per nurse bee have no effect on task switching rates Œ± v further implications can be made about these results for instance for our choice of Œ≤ hf m 0 25 fast transition rate from nurse to forager in these simulations given that r is relatively low white region in fig 8a it could suggest that foragers are collecting other nutrients such as nectar instead of pollen hence remaining nurse bees may not be able to rear brood due to lack of pollen which may also influence low consumption rate of pollen Œ± for vg synthesis white region in fig 8b moreover if the feeding rate to brood Œ± b is high and Œ± v low see white region in fig 8c i e there is no significant effect of the level of vg per nurse on task switching rates then the colony may not survive in general for any of these cases we can conclude that regulating the transition rate from nurse to forager by considering levels of vg per nurse bee is of great importance and significant in our modeling in the following 2d bifurcation we can see the synergistic effects of different parameters for instance if the transition rate from nurse bee to forager Œ≤ hf m is large inducing less nurse bees rearing brood and the conversion rate from pollen to vg by nurse bees c is very small i e levels of vg per nurse bee decreases and it is limited this will cause the collapse of the colony see white region of fig 9 a in addition if the consumption and conversion rate of pollen Œ± and c respectively the colony cannot survive due to insufficient levels of vg necessary for the different mechanisms in the colony see white region of fig 9a moreover if we do not consider the regulation effects of available brood and stored pollen in the colony i e a b 0 our model has a unique interior equilibrium red point in fig 9c however if we consider large values of a and b which produces a very low overall collection rate of pollen then the colony cannot survive due to insufficient pollen in the colony lastly we found that variation of v n or 1 Œæ with respect to Œ± v c q e g Œ≤ hf m have no effect on the metabolic use of vg in nurse bees Œ± h on determining the survival of the colony i e decreasing or increasing these parameters with respect to Œ± h do not cause the colony to die out similarly the variation of v n with respect to Œ± q e g Œ≤ hf m have no effect on the consumption rate of pollen to vg Œ± 3 1 seasonality effects first we perform a validity check by including the influence of environmental factors such as change of season affecting pollen collection which has effects on variation of population sizes within a honeybee colony our simulations compare results with empirical data from harr√≠s 1980 in order to include seasonality in our model we assume that the pollen collection rate has annual periodicity and can be approximated by the first order harmonic s t r 1 cos 3 œÄ t œï 365 where r is the baseline collection rate and œï is the day of the year when the collection rate is maximal fig 10 the regulated pollen collection rate in eq 4 is then modified as follows s t b 1 ab b p the values of r and œï were chosen to fit best to our choice of empirical data the rest of the parameters from model 7 were chosen by following the ranges in table 1 fig 11 shows the population dynamics of brood and workers nurses and foragers for approximately one year exploring the long term dynamics of both models considered with and without seasonality we can obtain the following case when the original model without seasonality produces coexistence meaning both brood and worker populations reach a stable equilibrium while the model with seasonality produces an output such that the colony die out both cases were obtained by lowering simultaneously the parameter value c q which determines the efficiency of using vitellogenin for egg laying production by the queen in this case the model with seasonality could give us a more realistic intuition of what could happen in the long term since reducing the efficiency of using the nutrient vitellogenin for egg laying by the queen could cause a decrease of new brood produced and therefore a decrease of future adult workers until the colony dies out see fig 12 3 2 sensitivity analysis up until this point our model simulations including bifurcations and time series rely on parameter values see table 1 that have been collected from numerous empirical studies while some are yet unknown in many of these studies the precision at which this values were measured is uncertain however these parameters can be considered a good baseline to study our model and make predictions nevertheless we consider sensitivity analysis techniques such as partial rank correlation coefficient prcc by using an appropriate sampling technique such as latin hypercube sampling lhs in order to determine which parameters are important in contributing to the variability of outcomes in this case we the outcomes of interest are the population size of brood b and workers of both task groups i e nurse bees n and foragers f but also the nutritional content of vg per nurse given by nv 1 1 Œæ this sensitivity analysis method can quantify the impact of model outcomes given the uncertainty of parameters and initial conditions input marino et al 2008 in this case our model outcomes will be the size of each of the populations considered in our model and the nutritional content of vg per nurse at a given time point the lhs method assumes a uniform distribution to create ranges of parameters with their respective baseline values marino et al 2008 we perform multiple runs n 500 of the sampled values for the response output here we use the best fit parameter values as the baseline values to compute lhs prcc values with 15 to create the ranges in order to quantify the impact of seasonality in our model we asses the sensitivity on the size of populations considered in our model i e brood and adult worker bees and the vitellogenin content per nurse bee to each of the parameters at a given time point we explore the sensitivity of parameters on these population sizes for our model 7 with and without seasonality the results for each model respectively are depicted in blue no seasonality and purple with seasonality the time points considered at each outcome are the highest and lowest point for each population in fig c 19 in figs 13 16 we observe that the sensitivity of parameters in the model without seasonality in blue at t 185 360 and 380 have no difference but also in the model with seasonality in purple at time t 185 when both brood and worker populations are at the highest however we can determine that the parameters having a positive impact on these population sizes for these cases are the collection rate of pollen conversion rate of pollen to vg the queen s feeding rate the efficiency of converting vg for egg production by the queen and the maximum transition rate from nurse bee to forager r c Œ± q c q and Œ≤ hf m respectively the parameters having a negative impact on the brood population size are the brood s regulation effects on pollen collection the brood s feeding rate the average content of vg in one egg the metabolic use of vg by nurse bee forager s mortality rate and the transition rate from brood to nurse bee a Œ± b e g Œ± h d f and Œ≤ bh respectively furthermore in fig 13 sensitivity analysis of parameters at time t 360 when population size is the lowest fig c 19 in the model with seasonality in purple shows a different outcome than at t 185 in purple here we observe that when population is at the lowest the parameters having a positive impact on the population size are r c Œ≤ hf m and œï and the parameters having a negative impact are a d f Œ± h and Œ≤ bh in comparison at the time point when brood population is at the highest parameters such as Œ± q and c q had a positive impact on the population size but not at the lowest point in terms of seasonality when the brood population is at the highest it represents the period of time when queen s nutritional status is of utmost important for egg laying production in fig 14 we observe that the parameters having a positive impact on the nurse task group size outcome at the time point t 185 and at t 360 both in purple are r Œ± q c q and c in addition to the previous parameters listed at the time point when the size of the nurse task group is the highest Œ≤ bh shows a positive impact on the population size this makes sense since transition rate from brood to adult bee as a nurse determines nurse task group size also at time t 360 in purple when the size of the nurse task group is the lowest we observe that instead Œ≤ bh has a significant negative impact on this task group size and Œ± v which regulates the transition rate from nurse bee to forager given levels of vg titers in their body fat has a positive impact on the outcome this suggests that regulation effects on task switching has an important impact on maintaining nurse bees in colony s low season in general the parameters having a positive impact on brood population and nurse task group sizes across all times higher and lowest points are the collection rate of pollen the conversion rate of pollen to vg and the maximum transition rate from nurse to forager r c Œ≤ hf m notice that these parameters are linked to each other representing the availability of food source for the brood available pollen foragers bringing back pollen to the hive for vg production in fig 15 the sensitivity of parameters at time t 370 when population size is the lowest in the model with seasonality in purple shows a different outcome than at t 200 in purple here we observe that when forager task group size is at the lowest the parameters having a positive impact on the size of this task group are e g and Œ≤ hf m and the parameters having a negative impact are Œ± q c q d f and Œ± v in comparison at the two different time points we conclude that the parameter describing the maximum transition rate from nurse to forager Œ≤ hf m has a positive impact on the forager task group size across all time and not seasonal sensitive also we observe that parameters such as e g Œ± q and c q have opposite impact at the highest point versus at the lowest point changing from positive to negative respectively this suggest that if more vg is spent towards queen s feeding for egg laying production during low season i e winter cold temperatures rainy the forager task group size can be negatively affected due to an increase of foraging behavior to satisfy colony needs in reality this is unlikely to occur since bees have the ability to determine when to forage under good weather conditions however it is known that the colony prepares for overwintering season and a decrease number of foragers is needed which it is reflected in these results also another result implying this is that the parameter Œ± v describing the regulation effects of amount of vg per nurse bee on the transition time from nurse to forager has a higher and more significant negative impact on the forager task group size this implies that the parameter Œ± v strongly regulate the transition time from nurse to forager given that more vg titers are in the fat body of nurse bees since less is used towards brood and queen feeding in fig 16 we observe that parameters in the model with seasonality in purple at time t 185 having a positive impact on the outcome amount of vitellogein per nurse bee are e g Œ≤ hf m and œï and similarly for the time point t 360 except for œï which is having a negative impact on the outcome this is explained by the fact that at t 185 corresponds to the high foraging and brood production season whereas at t 360 corresponds when pollen collection and brood production is low thus showing a negative impact on the outcome moreover parameters having a significantly negative impact on the amount of vg per nurse bee are Œ± q and c q at t 185 when brood population size is at the highest and in addition d f at t 360 when brood population size is at the lowest this suggests that efficiency of feeding the queen for brood production has a significant negative impact on the amount of vg per nurse bee and in any case it shows the importance to the colony on the other hand at time point t 360 forager death rate d f is negatively affecting the amount of vg per nurse bee and this can be explained by the fact that this time point corresponds to colony s low season when weather is not optimal for foraging and pollen collection rate r is minimal see positive to negative impact switch in fig 16a and b in purple 4 discussion the population dynamics of honeybees has been studied for decades now h√∂lldobler and wilson 2009 ament et al 2010 by looking at different aspects and mechanisms that regulate and influence sudden or gradual changes of the brood and worker populations within a colony the study of the mechanisms that enable or restrict changes in behavior of honeybees in response to changes in the environment is an active area of research ament et al 2010 schulz et al 1998 toth et al 2005 toth and robinson 2005 robinson 1992 the intention of the model presented here is not an attempt to simulate reality but to provide a modeling framework that considers factors influencing colony dynamics i e growth or decrease of population in this work we explore the effects of an essential environmental variable influencing the age based division of labor of worker honeybees is their nutritional status ament et al 2010 avni et al 2014 for instance in the work of avni et al 2014 important understanding of the temporal and spatial fluctuations of pollen derived nutrients for honeybees were provided however their findings do not support the hypothesis of colony growth affected by pollen quantity and nutritional quality specifically we focused on the effects of vitellogenin content per nurse bee and how it interacts with the essential demographic and allocation processes within the colony to influence colony growth we presented a non linear differential equation system that models the population dynamics of a honeybee colony this model considers the population of brood and adult workers divided in two task groups nurses and foragers stored pollen in the hive and vitellogenin content in nurse bees analytical results of model 7 provide the existence of up to two interior equilibria i e two possible points where all the components of our model b n f p v are greater than zero and have the potential to become stable the size of both the brood and worker populations within the colony at a stable point are directly dependent upon the increase of vg levels per nurse bee i e increase of 1 Œæ also coexistence of both brood and worker populations is dependent upon enough food to feed the brood pollen collected and converted to vg and available foragers for example among african races of a mellifera starvation is more frequent because they store low honey reserves toth et al 2005 winston 1991 from the numerical simulations we learned that the parameter Œ± v which describes the regulation effects that the levels of vg per nurse bee have on the transition rate from nurse to forager seems to be very sensitive for instance too small Œ± v can neutralize the regulation effects of task switching but too large can overemphasize these effects therefore a good value choice for Œ± v in our model is critical to capture true regulation effects of levels of vg per nurse bee on the transition rate form nurse to forager in addition the regulation effects of current brood in the colony and stored pollen a and b respectively are very important in our model these parameters give a certain sensitivity that respond to brood pheromone and current levels of stored pollen in cells in our model when these parameters are too large it means that there is enough pollen to feed current brood and foragers must decrease foraging for pollen under this scenario low pollen collection rate and low queen feeding rate can cause colony s death the only way a colony can survive is if feeding rate of the queen is high enough since it will prompt production of new brood to preserve the colony in fig 4 we can see that a decreasing rate of Œ± q decreases both brood and worker population sizes several scenarios in our numerical simulations provide conditions at which the colony is prone to die for instance low collection rate of pollen by foragers leads to low pollen consumption rate by nurse bees which promotes colony s death see white region in fig 6 this implication has been explored in the work of naug 2009 stating that scarce food resources lead to low pollen consumption rates which then affects the ability to improve worker longevity huang 2012 our results also confirmed that survival of the colony is dependent on worker longevity for instance as the mortality rate of nurse bees increases it is necessary to maintain a high conversion rate of pollen to vg in order to provide enough food for new brood see fig 5f however rapid depletion of food stores for brood feeding can cause the colony die of starvation le conte and navajas 2008 also our results indicate that medium to large conversion rate of pollen to vg by nurse bees is necessary for colony survival providing enough vg available to feed the queen for egg laying production see fig 5a c in general the rates of food collection and consumption are essential elements of food storage inside the hive anderson et al 2014 further results indicate that fast transition rate from nurse bee to forager can cause the colony to die out see fig 5d and e in the long run if the transition rate from nurse to forager is high it may not be sustainable for the colony because there will be fewer available nurse bees synthesizing vg and rearing brood while foragers have higher mortality rates during high foraging season gordon 1996 states that rapid changes in tasks are caused as a result of a response to environmental stimuli other results show that when the efficiency of using vitellogenin for egg laying production by the queen is decreased or low the levels of vitellogenin per nurse bee increases an explanation of this could be that the queen is not been fed enough and therefore not able to produce eggs for instance depending on food conditions some species of ants control the composition of eggs and nutritional quality wheeler 1986 the sensitivity analysis performed in this study helped us quantify the impact of model outcomes given the uncertainty of parameters and initial conditions we used prcc sensitivity analysis with lhs as the sampling technique in order to determine which parameters are more influential on the different outcomes of interest we found that the parameters having a positive impact on brood population and nurse task group sizes across all time are the pollen collection rate pollen conversion rate to vitellogenin and the maximum transition rate from nurse to forager these parameters show that the availability of food resources specifically pollen huang 2012 mainly for brood survival and brood production are of vital importance for the success of the colony which has been confirmed in the work of naug 2009 also results showed that the amount of vg titers per nurse bee is significantly positively influenced by the amount of vg deposited in an egg and the period of time corresponding to the colony s high season but also the transition rate from nurse bee to foraging however the amount of vg titers per nurse bee is significantly negatively influenced by queen s feeding rate and the efficiency of converting vg for egg production overall the sensitivity analysis provided further confirmation that food source for queen egg production and developing brood are of vital importance for colony s success lastly we considered seasonality for the collection rate of pollen since in reality pollen collection rate is not constant due to changes in weather conditions synge 1947 thorp 1979 in order to perform a validity check of our model with seasonality we compared time series simulations generated by our model with empirical data from harr√≠s 1980 comparing the effects of seasonality model 7 we learned that seasonality can provide a more realistic intuition of long term consequences for instance when the efficiency of converting vg for egg laying production is decreased the model without seasonality does not show catastrophic events such as colony s death however the model with seasonality showed a periodic decrease of population size until the colony collapsed see fig 12 several studies with mathematical models for honeybee colonies are existent schmickl and crailsheim 2007 khoury et al 2013 becher et al 2014 perry et al 2015 schmickl and karsai 2017 most of these have modeled the population dynamics of honeybees and nutrient stores for example schmickl and crailsheim 2007 created a model to study the population and resource dynamics of a honeybee colony and including the effect of division of labor in the hive however the modeling approach is complicated and since it is well known that bees have a strong age based division of labor the theory used to model task allocation is more relevant in ants the model presented in khoury et al 2013 has similar assumptions to ours however one of the main differences from our model is the assumption of the transition from nurse bee to forager in our model we assume that the transition from nurse bee to foragers increases by a transition rate that depends on the levels of vitellogenin in the nurse bee and not only by the absence of stored food and reduced social inhibition also we enhanced their simple assumption of food collection rate by including the regulation effects of brood pheromone and stored pollen in beehave by becher et al 2014 although they take into considerations many aspects affecting colony dynamics they assume that the level of pollen and nectar stores in the colony affects the age at which workers initiate foraging activities they do not take into account other mechanisms changing at the molecular guidugli et al 2005 amdam et al 2010 amdam and omholt 2002 2003 and physiological level johnson 2005 amdam and omholt 2002 in our model we attempt to incorporate in a general manner those mechanisms within a bee that affect the initiation of foraging the model of perry et al 2015 proposes an ode model that captures the impacts of precocious foraging induced by different stressors the model suggests that food limitation set by inefficiency of a young foraging force would hasten colony terminal decline results from our model also suggest that high transition rate to foraging i e precocious bees can cause a decline of brood and forager population these implications have also been reviewed by klein et al 2017 scofield and mattila 2015 stating that early foraging and for a short period is due to shortage of pollen and thus vitellogenin during development in any case these models are useful in their own way and have been designed to address specific questions the analytical and numerical results presented here are unique and simple in the sense that we incorporate mechanisms that affect the age based division of labor and implications that can have on the change of brood and worker population sizes over time we presented basic but important assumptions that can help us understand and have greater insight in the complexity of honeybee population dynamics given their nutritional status and or needs this model can be extended by including other scenarios such as limiting the pollen influx in the late summer and study how it can affect the lifespan of bees and possibly lead to colony collapse or when bees opt to engage in brood cannibalism as a natural strategy to recycle protein other mechanism to be included is the transition back from forager to nurse bee under certain environmental conditions oettler et al 2015 and the interplay of diseases or infections such as nosema ceranae which is known to alter vitellogenin levels and therefore alter normal age polyethism causing colony imbalance benvau and nieh 2017

18 we observe the effects of the average amount of vg that a laid egg by the queen can contain in our model increasing e g increases levels of vg per nurse bee 1 Œæ thus if the queen deposits large amounts of vg into an egg then vg is recycled back into the available vg in the colony however it seems that depositing large amounts of vg into eggs can have a negative effect on both the brood and worker populations size since as e g increases these population sizes decrease the following figure aids the set up for sensitivity analysis results 
25177,the complexity of honeybees provides systems to study mechanisms affecting their population dynamics an essential environmental variable influencing the age based division of labor of worker honeybees is their nutritional status we present basic but important assumptions that can help us understand the complexity of honeybee population dynamics given their nutritional status we propose a non linear differential equation system that models the population dynamics of brood and worker bees nurses and foragers within a colony the dynamics of these populations are influenced by the available stored pollen in cells and the current levels of vitellogenin vg a major storage protein in the fat body of nurse bees our model shows a the importance of pollen collection and consumption rates adequate feeding rates to the queen and the impact of good nutrition during the larvae stage for future foraging activity b the size of both the brood and worker populations at equilibrium are

derived proteins 1 introduction honeybees apis mellifera are social and have a high structured division of labor a typical colony of honeybees is composed of 10 20 thousand eggs larvae and pupae up to 30 000 adult workers all females zero to several hundred drones males and a single female queen in general the queen bee is the only egg laying member while worker bees perform a number of tasks including feeding the queen colony maintenance colony defense against honey robbers but most importantly rearing the brood and maintaining the required nutritional demands of the colony such as pollen nectar propolis and water robinson 1992 seeley 2009 calderone 1998 johnson 2010 behavioral task distribution of bees can be influenced by aging genes and environment wright et al 2018 for instance in the spring and summer division of labor is shaped to maximize the accumulation of resources e g honey and growth rate while in the winter worker bees become less differentiated in task performance because the primary goal is to maintain worker survivorship through this season johnson 2010 the growth development productivity and health of a honeybee colony is dependent upon fulfilling the nutritional demands of larvae and adult workers brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 survival and quality of larvae and adult workers are of prime importance for the productivity and health of a colony in general a honeybee colony requires of macronutrients i e proteins carbohydrates and fats and of micronutrients i e vitamins and minerals for growth and development of healthy larvae and adults brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 winston 1992 crailsheim et al 1992 the colony having specific needs monitors foraging efforts to collect nectar pollen water and tree resin wright et al 2018 however the nutritional needs at the individual bee level are mostly determined by somatic demands arising with age and behavioral role in the colony paoli et al 2014 for instance findings in paoli et al 2014 show that young bees require higher protein intake than older adult workers prioritizing their dietary intake of carbohydrates over protein as they age for honeybees the main source of carbohydrates is floral nectar while pollen satisfies the nutritional requirements for protein lipids sterols and micronutrients winston 1992 wright et al 2018 vaudo et al 2015 several studies have shown that honeybees regulate the intake of macronutrients around specific proportions wright et al 2018 schmickl and crailsheim 2004 nectar is collected in excess according to floral nectar availability wright et al 2018 schmickl and crailsheim 2004 vaudo et al 2015 transformed gradually to honey during the returning flight and within the nest nicolson and human 2008 stored in sealed cells as honey brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 and reserved for overwintering needs khoury et al 2013 honey stored in tens of kilograms seeley 2009 is used as fuel for energy intensive flights colony thermoregulation and wax production wheeler and robinson 2014 wright et al 2018 on the other hand pollen is collected as a reserve for only a few days depending on the ratio of pollen supply to pollen demand dreller et al 1999 camazine 1993 maintaining in storage about 1 kg on average wright et al 2018 pollen foragers make decisions based on the pollen available in cells acting as a negative stimulus i e decreasing pollen foraging and on chemical pheromones from the existing larvae acting as a positive stimulus i e increasing pollen foraging dreller et al 1999 schmickl and crailsheim 2004 pankiw and page 2001a fewell and winston 1992 page 2013 bees hoard food in the form of honey nectar and bee bread pollen wright et al 2018 the pollen stored and processed by young hive bees bee bread differs in its nutritional value from floral pollen wright et al 2018 the protein and lipid content in bee bread is found to be in smaller ranges than floral pollen wright et al 2018 herbert and shimanuki 1978 however the quantity of protein in pollen is of less significance than the amount of essential amino acids proportional to bee requirements wright et al 2018 groot and d 1953 pollen is the only source of the ten essential amino acids i e protein required by honeybees bitondi and simoes 1996 brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 huang et al 2010 in fact some studies have suggested a link between foraging behavior and amino acid nutrition hendriksma and shafir 2016 therefore consumption of pollen is evidence of high protein levels in the haemolymph which is usually accompanied by high levels of storage proteins such as vitellogenin frias et al 2016 in this study we want to focus our attention to a glycolipoprotein vitellogenin vitellogenin vg is an egg yolk protein which is the primary source of amino acids hughes 2015 and it appears to be one of the most important regulators of immunity and longevity of honeybees amdam et al 2009 amdam and omholt 2002 glavinic et al 2017 worker bees begin the synthesis of vitellogenin 2 3 days later after emerging as an adult amdam et al 2010 2003 vg is synthesized primarily in the fat body cells of the abdomen released into the haemolymph and incorporated into the hypopharyngeal glands hpgs where it is used to make royal jelly proteins amdam and omholt 2002 h√∂lldobler and wilson 2009 these glands provide secretions rich in protein which are fed by nurse bees to larvae and adults of all three castes ahn et al 2012 crailsheim et al 1992 paoli et al 2014 a wide range of proteins are stored in the fat body and haemolymph but vitellogenin is the most dominant in both queens and workers amdam and omholt 2002 brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 studies have shown that vitellogenin is dependent on the availability and quality of pollen amdam et al 2010 it has several functions in worker bees such as adult bee physiological development immune responses such as reducing susceptibility to parasites and pathogens amdam et al 2004 2009 alaux et al 2011 page et al 2012 and oxidative stress resistance seehuus et al 2006 amdam and omholt 2002 also vitellogenin is utilized for various metabolic purposes in addition to brood food production amdam and omholt 2002 oliver 2007 guidugli et al 2005 such as acting as an antioxidant to prolong queen bee and forager lifespans as well as acting as a hormone that affects future foraging behavior amdam et al 2010 oliver 2007 page et al 2012 ihle et al 2010 vitellogenin levels are important during the nest stage and thus influence honeybee worker division of labor the relationship between vitellogenin and their pronounced division of labor can be seen by comparing the levels of vitellogenin in the fat body or by comparing the size of the hpg for instance in nurse bees vitellogenin titer levels in the fat body are high allowing them to transfer protein to larvae and other colony members amdam and omholt 2003 tsuruda and page 2009 while in foragers are low ahn et al 2012 crailsheim 1992 on the other hand the size of hpg is an indicator of protein nutrition prior to becoming a nurse and affects their ability to care for larvae ahn et al 2012 huang and otis 1989 hrassnigg and crailsheim 1998 two to three weeks after emergence as an adult vitellogenin synthesis declines in workers inducing a transition from nursing to foraging behavior amdam and omholt 2002 tsuruda and page 2009 amdam et al 2010 guidugli et al 2005 individual foragers may concentrate more on collecting either pollen or nectar due to variation in the life history anatomy physiology and genotypes of individuals that are linked to the titers of vitellogenin and juvenile hormone amdam et al 2010 tsuruda and page 2009 the consequences of protein shortage could be tremendous it could affect brood production the quality or the number of larvae reared to adulthood and colony nutritional state towards future brood rearing brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 this does not only have an effect on the size of the population but also on the age demography which then affects the division of labor schmickl and crailsheim 2007 also when pollen is unavailable due to bad weather or other adverse environmental conditions bees will engage in brood cannibalism to obtain the protein necessary to feed other larvae brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 carroll et al 2017 haydak 1970 schmickl and crailsheim 2004 khoury et al 2013 several studies show that poor pollen nutrition can have an impact on different causes leading to colony collapse disorder such causes include resistance to infections and viruses such as nosema and varroa in addition to sensitivity to pesticides degrandi hoffman et al 2010 huang 2012 wahl and ulm 1983 change of season weather and temperature have huge impacts on the population dynamics of a honeybee colony but also on social regulation johnson 2003 they can affect the amount of proteins in the fat body of a worker bee amdam and omholt 2002 brodschneider and crailsheim 2010 for instance wintering workers have in general a high haemolymph vitellogenin titer higher in late autumn than at the end of winter however the titer of brood less worker bees in the summer may be higher than in the winter bees probably due to the absence of food transmission to brood amdam and omholt 2002 climate variability has an effect on nutritional factors related to the quality and the quantity of nectar and pollen resources switanek et al 2017 intensity of temperature rain or solar radiation have been connected with the foraging activity of honeybees switanek et al 2017 vicens and bosch 2000 szabo 1980 abou shaara 2014 which induces an effect on the egg laying rate of the queen bee torres et al 2015 there are studies showing that rainy periods can cease foraging activities switanek et al 2017 riessberger and crailsheim 1997 schmickl and crailsheim 2007 amdam et al 2010 availability of nectar and pollen in the field affected by environmental factors that change seasonally also influence foraging activity amdam et al 2009 therefore summer time is when bees foraging rate is the highest along with mortality rate amdam and omholt 2002 and during fall foraging is almost ceased mathematical models have been developed to study honeybee colony population dynamics schmickl and crailsheim 2007 becher et al 2014 perry et al 2015 kang et al 2016 messan et al 2017 khoury et al 2011 2013 schmickl and karsai 2017 the most relevant studies to our work are those of schmickl and crailsheim 2007 khoury et al 2013 becher et al 2014 perry et al 2015 and schmickl and karsai 2017 which all modeled the population dynamics of honeybees and nutrient stores the approach of these studies differs from each other but have primarily focused on specific factors affecting the dynamics of brood and worker population for instance schmickl and crailsheim 2007 created a difference equation model to study the population and resource dynamics of a honeybee colony by focusing on the importance of pollen supply and of brood cannibalism they also provided an extensive review about other mathematical models and their purpose several of these models have focused on behavioral aspects of foraging food processing spatial organization and processes associated with division of labor in khoury et al 2013 they presented a theoretical framework to explore how the dynamics of food flow through a colony might interact with population dynamics to determine colony growth and development more recently becher et al 2014 developed beehave which integrates honeybee colony dynamics and population dynamics of the varroa mite and transmitted viruses with and explicit foraging model later becher et al 2016 developed another software tool beescout which can simulate bee search patterns in any mapped landscape aiding the explanation of how landscape configurations and parameters describing searching behavior affect detection probability of food sources in addition seasonal nectar and pollen availability in realistic landscapes is also implemented in beescout this software tool can also be used as an input for beehave to predict the overall impact of multiple stressors that can affect colony growth and death perry et al 2015 developed a model to explore possible impacts of age dependent foraging performance on a colony affected by different stressors including nutritional schmickl and karsai 2017 developed a mathematical model that links age polyethism by predicting the dynamics of brood population and it links colony level fitness by predicting the dynamics of adult forager populations and nutrient stores another relevant study to our work is that of amdam and omholt 2002 developing a nonlinear differential equation model to predict the vitellogenin dynamics in the fat body the haemolymph and the hpgs of an individual bee that is exposed to various task scenarios in different seasons the results of this model show consistency with empirical data and serve as a starting point to the assumptions of our model we investigate the implications of the information stated above by developing a honeybee population model using nonlinear differential equations this model will allow us to investigate how the dynamics of vitellogenin titers might interact with population dynamics to influence colony growth we will be looking at the vitellogenin dynamics of the adult worker population influencing the distribution of adult worker bees to tasks such as brood nursing and food collection specifically we focus on the importance of pollen derived proteins and the impacts on the division of labor our goal is to propose a starting point of modeling techniques that can allow us to study present problems leading to colony collapses such as nutritional stress naug 2009 scarcity of food sources naug 2009 and climate change 2 model development we propose a nonlinear ordinary differential equations model with the following state variables b t represents the brood population size consisting of eggs and larvae and n t f t represents the worker population size of the two main task groups in a colony i e nurses and foragers respectively at time t in addition we consider the current pollen storage in the colony p t and the available vitellogenin titers in nurse bees v t at time t respectively our five compartment model is derived following specific details found in the literature and assumptions from empirical findings 1 the rate of change of brood population b t d b dt is determined by input the egg laying rate by the queen is related to the amount of royal jelly fed by nurse bees and each egg contains certain amount of vg to start developing allen 1960 moore et al 2015 amdam and omholt 2002 i e c q Œ± q v e g where e g is the average content of vg in one egg and c q 0 1 is the conversion efficiency of queen transfer of vg into egg laying production i e 1 c q Œ± q v can be considered as the metabolic cost of queen for egg laying production output transition rate from brood to nurse bee Œ≤ bh 1 œÑ bf where œÑ bf is the developmental time from brood to nurse bee here we assume that there is no additional brood death thus the dynamics of the brood can be described by the following equation 1 b c q Œ± q v e g queen s egg laying rate Œ≤ bf b transition rate to nurse 2 nurse bees are a temporal worker sub caste that specializes in brood rearing dreller et al 1999 m√ºnch and amdam 2010 the rate of change of the nursing worker population n t dn dt is determined by input transition rate from brood Œ≤ bh b outputs transition rate to forager Œ≤ hf 1 œÑ hf where œÑ hf is the developmental time from nurse to forager bee after nursing bees transition to foraging tasks outside the colony due at least in part to low levels of vitellogenin titers amdam et al 2010 amdam and omholt 2003 huang et al 1994 goblirsch et al 2013 the transition rate to forager increases when nurse bees have low levels of vitellogenin at time t this implies that the transition rate Œ≤ hf v n 1 from nurse to forager is a decreasing function of the average of vg per nurse bee an example of this transition rate can be Œ≤ hf Œ≤ hf m n 1 Œ± v v n 1 where Œ≤ hf m is the maximum transition rate from nurse bee to forager when the average of vg per nurse bee v n is very low and Œ± v regulates the effects of the vg per nurse bee on the transitional rate from nurse bee to forager when v n is high i e if v n is high then the transition rate from nurse to forager bee will be very small mortality rate d h is a nonlinear function of vg contained in nurse bees and its population size n and foragers f seehuus et al 2006 we assume that d h is decreasing with respect to the average vg per nurse bee v n and increasing with respect to n and foragers f i e d h v n n for simplification we can just take d h as a constant that is smaller than the death rate of forager thus the dynamics of the hive can be described by the following equation 2 n Œ≤ bh transition from brood b Œ≤ hf v n 1 transition to forager decreasing with v n d h v n n nurse mortality rate depend e n t on vg and n n 3 the rate of change of foraging worker population f t d f dt is determined by input transition rate from nurse Œ≤ hf v n 1 n output mortality rate d f f should be a nonlinear function of vg contained in forager bees and its population size f for simplicity we assume that d f d h is constant m√ºnch and amdam 2010 thus the dynamics of the foragers can be described by the following equation 3 f Œ≤ hf v n 1 n transition from nurse bee to forager decreasing with v d f f forager mortality rate 4 the rate of change of pollen storage p t d p dt is determined by input the parameter r is the maximum pollen collection rate by foragers the pollen collection rate is regulated by the foraging worker population f and brood population b and the available pollen stored p in the colony tsuruda and page 2009 fewell and page 1993 pankiw and page 1999 2001b described by rbf 1 ab b p which implies a more larvae results in more brood pheromone that stimulates pollen foraging behavior and b more stored pollen reduces pollen foraging activity traynor et al 2014 camazine 1993 the parameters a and b represent the regulation effects of brood and pollen storage respectively output on average each nurse bee removes pollen at the rate of Œ± p i e more pollen faster removing rate the total removing rate of pollen by all nurse bees is Œ± p n in addition we assume that the pollen has a deterioration rate of d p due to the lack of attending or consumption it is known that nurse bees prefer to consume fresh pollen wright et al 2018 stored less than 72 h anderson et al 2014 thus the dynamics of the pollen storage can be described by the following equation 4 p rb 1 ab bp regulated pollen collection rate f Œ± np removing rate of pollen by nurse bee for vg production d p p deterioration rate of pollen 5 the rate of change of vg in nurse bees v t d v dt is determined by inputs production rate of vg from pollen by nurses and the total vg contained in newly emerged adult bees nurse bees deplete pollen reserves for the synthesis of vitellogenin dreller et al 1999 m√ºnch and amdam 2010 the conversion rate of pollen per gram to vg is represented by c thus the consumed pollen Œ± p h would be converted to vg with the amount of c Œ± p h there are Œ≤ bh b t 1 œÑ bf b t newly emerged adult bees whose content of vg could be estimated as follows Œ≤ bh c q Œ± q v t œÑ bf c q Œ± q v t œÑ bf e g t œÑ bf t v œÑ d œÑ outputs nurse bee s distribution rate of vg removal rate of vg due to death of nurse bee and transition rate to foraging the nurse bees administer vg to the queen to regulate egg laying production and longevity haydak 1970 wang et al 2014 and to the brood to regulate growth and development traynor et al 2014 crailsheim et al 1992 the portion of vg distributed to brood is measured by the product of the brood population b and the average brood s consumption rate Œ± b v similarly feeding rate to queen is measured by Œ± q v use vg for their own metabolism which is described by Œ± h nv dying during the nursing stage is described by d h v surviving and transitioning into foragers can be described by Œ≤ hf v n 1 v thus the dynamics of the vg in nurses can be

we take Œ≤ hf m n v Œ≤ hf m 1 Œ± v n v d h v n n d h and the simplified version of v in eq 6 when v 0 we define Œ≤ hf m 1 Œ± v n v 0 we provide a state diagram in fig 1 to aid visualize the relationships of the state variables in our model 3 results in this section we explore the dynamics of model 7 analytically and provide biological implications note that an interior equilibria of model 7 can be expressed in the following form 8 p v b n f œÜ Œæ n c Œ± Œæ Œ± h c q Œ± b Œ± q e g Œ≤ bh Œæ n Œæ c q Œ± q e g Œ≤ bh Œæ n n Œ≤ hf m n d f 1 Œ± v Œæ where œÜ Œæ Œ± q c Œ± Œæ 1 c q 1 1 e g Œæ and n is a positive solution of the polynomial f n c 3 n 3 c 2 n 2 c 1 n c 0 where c i i 0 a b 3 are polynomials of Œæ see details in b 5 the parameter Œæ measures nurse bees nutritional status and can be expressed as follows 9 Œæ c q Œ± q Œ± v d h e g Œ≤ hf m e g c q Œ± q Œ± v e g d h e g Œ≤ hf m 2 4 c q Œ± q Œ± v d h e g 2 Œ± v d h e g note that Œæ 1 v n is the vg content per nurse bee from simple analysis see appendix a we can conclude that the level of vg per nurse bee decreases when the feeding rate to queen and the efficiency of converting vg for egg laying production Œ± q and c q respectively increases also since Œ± v is a parameter that regulates the effects of the levels of vg per nurse bee that have on the transition rate from nurse to forager if Œ± v is too small this can void this regulation effect but too large can enhance it and possibly lose tractability of this effect moreover the levels of vg per nurse bee show an increase when there is an increase of the average content of vg per egg the mortality rate of bees during the nursing stage and the maximum transition rate from nurse to forager i e e g d h and Œ≤ hf m let a b c c q d f d h d p e g Œ± Œ± b Œ± q Œ± v Œ≤ hf m Œ≤ bh be positive parameters more details regarding the derivation of 8 can be found in appendix b and the number of interior equilibria the model 7 have is determined with the following theorem theorem 3 1 existence of interior equilibria system 7 is positive invariant in ‚Ñù 5 model 7 always has the extinction equilibrium e 0 which is always asymptotically stable and can have none or two interior equilibria under the following conditions 1 no interior equilibria if Œ± b cr Œæ Œ≤ hf m d f 1 Œ± v Œæ 2 two interior equilibria if Œ± b cr Œæ Œ≤ hf m d f 1 Œ± v Œæ biological implication our model can have up to two interior equilibria i e two possible points of the form p v b n f where all the components are greater than zero and have the potential to become stable if an interior equilibrium point becomes stable it means that depending on parameter values and initial conditions both the brood and worker populations and quantities of stored pollen and vitellogenin in nurse bees will reach a specific size determined by 8 and stay stable at that point in the long term note that Œ± b cr Œæ Œ≤ hf m d f 1 Œ± v Œæ cr n v Œ≤ hf m d f 1 Œ± v Œæ cr v f which can be simplified as cr Œ± b v f this is interpreted as follows if the colony s nutritional status is good i e pollen collection processing and consumption are suitable for colony s needs then both brood and worker populations are able to coexist i e both populations can reach one of the two interior equilibria otherwise the colony may die out also from 8 we can conclude that the components p v b f increase when Œæ decreases or levels of vitellogenin per nurse bee i e 1 Œæ increases next we analyze the synergetic effects in a numerical fashion over the population size of brood and worker bees given by parameters affecting the levels of vitellogenin per nurse bee the levels of vitellogenin per nurse bee i e 1 Œæ increase as the transition rate from nurse to forager Œ≤ hf m increases see appendix a in fig 2 we can see that as v n increases the brood population and forager task group s size increase in a similar fashion until they both reach a maximum while the nurse task group s size decreases when Œ≤ hf m 1 7 both brood and foragers follow a similar shape because in our model brood population is mostly dependent by the amount of pollen collected by foragers which then will be converted to nutritious jelly another explanation to this observation in our model is that recruiting more pollen foragers increases the inflow of proteinaceous pollen prompting to lower larval mortality and less starvation schmickl and karsai 2016 also forager task group s size display a maximum when v n 0 0058 g which corresponds to 7 days old after emerging from cell this level of vg at 7 days old may represent a minimum time for nurse bees to initiate foraging activity at a faster rate also we can see that the left end to mid range of the v n axis corresponding to the low mid levels of vg per nurse bee coincide with the transition rate of Œ≤ hf m 1 21 1 7 this range is consistent with empirical findings in tsuruda and page 2009 where the bees start foraging 2 3 weeks after emerging fig 3 help us understand the impact of Œ± v which measures the regulation of vg per nurse bee affecting the developmental time from nursing to foraging on the dynamics of v n in our model for instance if Œ± v is too large then the levels of v n become very small having no impact on the transition rate from nurse to forager however if Œ± v is too small it can diminish the tractability of the effects of the levels of vg towards the task switching from nurse to forager in this figure we can see that as the levels of v n increase the task group s size of nurses decreases while the foragers one increases this is not true from our assumptions where transition rate from nurses to foragers increases if the vg levels per nurse bee decreases this is an example in which if Œ± v is too large it can overemphasize the regulation effects of levels of vg however medium ranges for Œ± v could be most optimal in our model hence Œ± v seems to be a sensitive parameter that strongly determines the effects of the levels of v n on task switching rates and should be chosen very carefully in order to capture more realistic effects in fig 4 we observe the importance of the rate at which the queen is fed by the nurses given that it can determine the future of the colony since it affects the colony as a whole in the same way for instance the highest values of v n displayed in these figures are given by a small Œ± q this means that if very low amount of vg is fed to the queen the nurse bees will have more vg stored in their body fats also we observe that a decreasing feeding rate to the queen negatively affects the colony no matter if other mechanisms such as feeding the brood collection rate of pollen or synthesis of vg are in place decreasing parameters such as Œ± v Œ± q and c q can increase the vg content per nurse bee i e decreasing the regulation effects of the amount of vg per nurse on the transition rate from nurse bee to forager feeding rate to the queen and efficiency of converting the vg for egg laying by the queen respectively low conversion rate of vg from pollen can cause the colony to collapse see white region in fig 5 a c note that these three parameters act in a synergistic manner creating a chain of events starting from the fact that if Œ± v is reasonably small then there is an increase amount of foragers more likely bringing back pollen then if the conversion rate from pollen to vg by nurse bees is low there is not enough vg per nurse bee produced to feed the queen i e small Œ± q lower right end white region in fig 5b and therefore the queen cannot use stored vg for egg laying production lower right end white region in fig 5c all these synergetic effects can cause colony s death increasing parameters such as e g Œ≤ hf m and d h can increase vg content per nurse bee i e increasing the average amount of vg per egg laid the maximum transition rate from nurse bee to forager and mortality rate of nurse bee respectively large parameter values of e g and Œ≤ hf m and low to medium conversion rate of vg from pollen c can cause death of populations within the colony see fig 5d and e however if the mortality rate of nurse bees increases or is too large then our results show that the conversion rate of vg to pollen must be high in order to keep the colony alive see fig 5f from a simple analysis see appendix a we know that the content of vg per nurse increases with the decrease of c q which measures the efficiency of using vg for egg laying production by the queen results in fig 6 a and b suggest that low collection rate of pollen r and low consumption rate of pollen by nurses Œ± together with low c q can drive the colony to die out similarly medium to low c q and low to high values of average feeding rate of vg to brood can cause colony s death see fig 6c it is clear from these simulations that the efficiency of converting vg for egg laying production by the queen plays an important role for colony survival in addition a rapid depletion of food stores for brood feeding can cause the colony to die of starvation le conte and navajas 2008 high feeding rate to queen Œ± q prompts a decrease of vg per nurse bee since the queen is usually fed with larger quantities than brood if this is the case the nurse bees will not have enough vg to feed brood and for their own metabolic use therefore this extreme situation can cause colony s death see fig 7 a moreover if Œ± q is low then the regulation effects of current brood in the colony a and the regulation effects of stored pollen b are high see white region on right end of fig 7b and b it will prompt a smaller overall pollen collection rate however a small overall pollen collection rate will cause a decrease and limited availability of pollen for consumption by nurse bees and feeding to brood and queen this scenario will be critical on the survivability of the colony and according to our numerical results in fig 7b and c respectively shows that nurse bees will invest more on the queen by feeding it at higher rates reducing available vg per nurse bee in order to lay more eggs and maintain the colony alive also an increase or decrease of Œ± q has no influence with respect to the maximum pollen collection rate r on determining coexistence of populations within the colony in fig 8 a c we vary the parameter a v which regulates the effects of the levels of vg per nurse that have over the transition rate from nurse to forager in order to have a clear understanding of these simulations it is necessary to have in mind that when Œ± v is very small close to zero the effects of the level of vg per nurse on task switching rates from nurse to bee are almost null also too large Œ± v may have a negative impact in the assumptions made for our model with this in mind we proceed to the explanations of each scenario in fig 8a and b we can see that low collection and consumption rate of pollen r and Œ± respectively can cause the colony to die when the levels of vg per nurse bee have no effect on task switching rates Œ± v further implications can be made about these results for instance for our choice of Œ≤ hf m 0 25 fast transition rate from nurse to forager in these simulations given that r is relatively low white region in fig 8a it could suggest that foragers are collecting other nutrients such as nectar instead of pollen hence remaining nurse bees may not be able to rear brood due to lack of pollen which may also influence low consumption rate of pollen Œ± for vg synthesis white region in fig 8b moreover if the feeding rate to brood Œ± b is high and Œ± v low see white region in fig 8c i e there is no significant effect of the level of vg per nurse on task switching rates then the colony may not survive in general for any of these cases we can conclude that regulating the transition rate from nurse to forager by considering levels of vg per nurse bee is of great importance and significant in our modeling in the following 2d bifurcation we can see the synergistic effects of different parameters for instance if the transition rate from nurse bee to forager Œ≤ hf m is large inducing less nurse bees rearing brood and the conversion rate from pollen to vg by nurse bees c is very small i e levels of vg per nurse bee decreases and it is limited this will cause the collapse of the colony see white region of fig 9 a in addition if the consumption and conversion rate of pollen Œ± and c respectively the colony cannot survive due to insufficient levels of vg necessary for the different mechanisms in the colony see white region of fig 9a moreover if we do not consider the regulation effects of available brood and stored pollen in the colony i e a b 0 our model has a unique interior equilibrium red point in fig 9c however if we consider large values of a and b which produces a very low overall collection rate of pollen then the colony cannot survive due to insufficient pollen in the colony lastly we found that variation of v n or 1 Œæ with respect to Œ± v c q e g Œ≤ hf m have no effect on the metabolic use of vg in nurse bees Œ± h on determining the survival of the colony i e decreasing or increasing these parameters with respect to Œ± h do not cause the colony to die out similarly the variation of v n with respect to Œ± q e g Œ≤ hf m have no effect on the consumption rate of pollen to vg Œ± 3 1 seasonality effects first we perform a validity check by including the influence of environmental factors such as change of season affecting pollen collection which has effects on variation of population sizes within a honeybee colony our simulations compare results with empirical data from harr√≠s 1980 in order to include seasonality in our model we assume that the pollen collection rate has annual periodicity and can be approximated by the first order harmonic s t r 1 cos 3 œÄ t œï 365 where r is the baseline collection rate and œï is the day of the year when the collection rate is maximal fig 10 the regulated pollen collection rate in eq 4 is then modified as follows s t b 1 ab b p the values of r and œï were chosen to fit best to our choice of empirical data the rest of the parameters from model 7 were chosen by following the ranges in table 1 fig 11 shows the population dynamics of brood and workers nurses and foragers for approximately one year exploring the long term dynamics of both models considered with and without seasonality we can obtain the following case when the original model without seasonality produces coexistence meaning both brood and worker populations reach a stable equilibrium while the model with seasonality produces an output such that the colony die out both cases were obtained by lowering simultaneously the parameter value c q which determines the efficiency of using vitellogenin for egg laying production by the queen in this case the model with seasonality could give us a more realistic intuition of what could happen in the long term since reducing the efficiency of using the nutrient vitellogenin for egg laying by the queen could cause a decrease of new brood produced and therefore a decrease of future adult workers until the colony dies out see fig 12 3 2 sensitivity analysis up until this point our model simulations including bifurcations and time series rely on parameter values see table 1 that have been collected from numerous empirical studies while some are yet unknown in many of these studies the precision at which this values were measured is uncertain however these parameters can be considered a good baseline to study our model and make predictions nevertheless we consider sensitivity analysis techniques such as partial rank correlation coefficient prcc by using an appropriate sampling technique such as latin hypercube sampling lhs in order to determine which parameters are important in contributing to the variability of outcomes in this case we the outcomes of interest are the population size of brood b and workers of both task groups i e nurse bees n and foragers f but also the nutritional content of vg per nurse given by nv 1 1 Œæ this sensitivity analysis method can quantify the impact of model outcomes given the uncertainty of parameters and initial conditions input marino et al 2008 in this case our model outcomes will be the size of each of the populations considered in our model and the nutritional content of vg per nurse at a given time point the lhs method assumes a uniform distribution to create ranges of parameters with their respective baseline values marino et al 2008 we perform multiple runs n 500 of the sampled values for the response output here we use the best fit parameter values as the baseline values to compute lhs prcc values with 15 to create the ranges in order to quantify the impact of seasonality in our model we asses the sensitivity on the size of populations considered in our model i e brood and adult worker bees and the vitellogenin content per nurse bee to each of the parameters at a given time point we explore the sensitivity of parameters on these population sizes for our model 7 with and without seasonality the results for each model respectively are depicted in blue no seasonality and purple with seasonality the time points considered at each outcome are the highest and lowest point for each population in fig c 19 in figs 13 16 we observe that the sensitivity of parameters in the model without seasonality in blue at t 185 360 and 380 have no difference but also in the model with seasonality in purple at time t 185 when both brood and worker populations are at the highest however we can determine that the parameters having a positive impact on these population sizes for these cases are the collection rate of pollen conversion rate of pollen to vg the queen s feeding rate the efficiency of converting vg for egg production by the queen and the maximum transition rate from nurse bee to forager r c Œ± q c q and Œ≤ hf m respectively the parameters having a negative impact on the brood population size are the brood s regulation effects on pollen collection the brood s feeding rate the average content of vg in one egg the metabolic use of vg by nurse bee forager s mortality rate and the transition rate from brood to nurse bee a Œ± b e g Œ± h d f and Œ≤ bh respectively furthermore in fig 13 sensitivity analysis of parameters at time t 360 when population size is the lowest fig c 19 in the model with seasonality in purple shows a different outcome than at t 185 in purple here we observe that when population is at the lowest the parameters having a positive impact on the population size are r c Œ≤ hf m and œï and the parameters having a negative impact are a d f Œ± h and Œ≤ bh in comparison at the time point when brood population is at the highest parameters such as Œ± q and c q had a positive impact on the population size but not at the lowest point in terms of seasonality when the brood population is at the highest it represents the period of time when queen s nutritional status is of utmost important for egg laying production in fig 14 we observe that the parameters having a positive impact on the nurse task group size outcome at the time point t 185 and at t 360 both in purple are r Œ± q c q and c in addition to the previous parameters listed at the time point when the size of the nurse task group is the highest Œ≤ bh shows a positive impact on the population size this makes sense since transition rate from brood to adult bee as a nurse determines nurse task group size also at time t 360 in purple when the size of the nurse task group is the lowest we observe that instead Œ≤ bh has a significant negative impact on this task group size and Œ± v which regulates the transition rate from nurse bee to forager given levels of vg titers in their body fat has a positive impact on the outcome this suggests that regulation effects on task switching has an important impact on maintaining nurse bees in colony s low season in general the parameters having a positive impact on brood population and nurse task group sizes across all times higher and lowest points are the collection rate of pollen the conversion rate of pollen to vg and the maximum transition rate from nurse to forager r c Œ≤ hf m notice that these parameters are linked to each other representing the availability of food source for the brood available pollen foragers bringing back pollen to the hive for vg production in fig 15 the sensitivity of parameters at time t 370 when population size is the lowest in the model with seasonality in purple shows a different outcome than at t 200 in purple here we observe that when forager task group size is at the lowest the parameters having a positive impact on the size of this task group are e g and Œ≤ hf m and the parameters having a negative impact are Œ± q c q d f and Œ± v in comparison at the two different time points we conclude that the parameter describing the maximum transition rate from nurse to forager Œ≤ hf m has a positive impact on the forager task group size across all time and not seasonal sensitive also we observe that parameters such as e g Œ± q and c q have opposite impact at the highest point versus at the lowest point changing from positive to negative respectively this suggest that if more vg is spent towards queen s feeding for egg laying production during low season i e winter cold temperatures rainy the forager task group size can be negatively affected due to an increase of foraging behavior to satisfy colony needs in reality this is unlikely to occur since bees have the ability to determine when to forage under good weather conditions however it is known that the colony prepares for overwintering season and a decrease number of foragers is needed which it is reflected in these results also another result implying this is that the parameter Œ± v describing the regulation effects of amount of vg per nurse bee on the transition time from nurse to forager has a higher and more significant negative impact on the forager task group size this implies that the parameter Œ± v strongly regulate the transition time from nurse to forager given that more vg titers are in the fat body of nurse bees since less is used towards brood and queen feeding in fig 16 we observe that parameters in the model with seasonality in purple at time t 185 having a positive impact on the outcome amount of vitellogein per nurse bee are e g Œ≤ hf m and œï and similarly for the time point t 360 except for œï which is having a negative impact on the outcome this is explained by the fact that at t 185 corresponds to the high foraging and brood production season whereas at t 360 corresponds when pollen collection and brood production is low thus showing a negative impact on the outcome moreover parameters having a significantly negative impact on the amount of vg per nurse bee are Œ± q and c q at t 185 when brood population size is at the highest and in addition d f at t 360 when brood population size is at the lowest this suggests that efficiency of feeding the queen for brood production has a significant negative impact on the amount of vg per nurse bee and in any case it shows the importance to the colony on the other hand at time point t 360 forager death rate d f is negatively affecting the amount of vg per nurse bee and this can be explained by the fact that this time point corresponds to colony s low season when weather is not optimal for foraging and pollen collection rate r is minimal see positive to negative impact switch in fig 16a and b in purple 4 discussion the population dynamics of honeybees has been studied for decades now h√∂lldobler and wilson 2009 ament et al 2010 by looking at different aspects and mechanisms that regulate and influence sudden or gradual changes of the brood and worker populations within a colony the study of the mechanisms that enable or restrict changes in behavior of honeybees in response to changes in the environment is an active area of research ament et al 2010 schulz et al 1998 toth et al 2005 toth and robinson 2005 robinson 1992 the intention of the model presented here is not an attempt to simulate reality but to provide a modeling framework that considers factors influencing colony dynamics i e growth or decrease of population in this work we explore the effects of an essential environmental variable influencing the age based division of labor of worker honeybees is their nutritional status ament et al 2010 avni et al 2014 for instance in the work of avni et al 2014 important understanding of the temporal and spatial fluctuations of pollen derived nutrients for honeybees were provided however their findings do not support the hypothesis of colony growth affected by pollen quantity and nutritional quality specifically we focused on the effects of vitellogenin content per nurse bee and how it interacts with the essential demographic and allocation processes within the colony to influence colony growth we presented a non linear differential equation system that models the population dynamics of a honeybee colony this model considers the population of brood and adult workers divided in two task groups nurses and foragers stored pollen in the hive and vitellogenin content in nurse bees analytical results of model 7 provide the existence of up to two interior equilibria i e two possible points where all the components of our model b n f p v are greater than zero and have the potential to become stable the size of both the brood and worker populations within the colony at a stable point are directly dependent upon the increase of vg levels per nurse bee i e increase of 1 Œæ also coexistence of both brood and worker populations is dependent upon enough food to feed the brood pollen collected and converted to vg and available foragers for example among african races of a mellifera starvation is more frequent because they store low honey reserves toth et al 2005 winston 1991 from the numerical simulations we learned that the parameter Œ± v which describes the regulation effects that the levels of vg per nurse bee have on the transition rate from nurse to forager seems to be very sensitive for instance too small Œ± v can neutralize the regulation effects of task switching but too large can overemphasize these effects therefore a good value choice for Œ± v in our model is critical to capture true regulation effects of levels of vg per nurse bee on the transition rate form nurse to forager in addition the regulation effects of current brood in the colony and stored pollen a and b respectively are very important in our model these parameters give a certain sensitivity that respond to brood pheromone and current levels of stored pollen in cells in our model when these parameters are too large it means that there is enough pollen to feed current brood and foragers must decrease foraging for pollen under this scenario low pollen collection rate and low queen feeding rate can cause colony s death the only way a colony can survive is if feeding rate of the queen is high enough since it will prompt production of new brood to preserve the colony in fig 4 we can see that a decreasing rate of Œ± q decreases both brood and worker population sizes several scenarios in our numerical simulations provide conditions at which the colony is prone to die for instance low collection rate of pollen by foragers leads to low pollen consumption rate by nurse bees which promotes colony s death see white region in fig 6 this implication has been explored in the work of naug 2009 stating that scarce food resources lead to low pollen consumption rates which then affects the ability to improve worker longevity huang 2012 our results also confirmed that survival of the colony is dependent on worker longevity for instance as the mortality rate of nurse bees increases it is necessary to maintain a high conversion rate of pollen to vg in order to provide enough food for new brood see fig 5f however rapid depletion of food stores for brood feeding can cause the colony die of starvation le conte and navajas 2008 also our results indicate that medium to large conversion rate of pollen to vg by nurse bees is necessary for colony survival providing enough vg available to feed the queen for egg laying production see fig 5a c in general the rates of food collection and consumption are essential elements of food storage inside the hive anderson et al 2014 further results indicate that fast transition rate from nurse bee to forager can cause the colony to die out see fig 5d and e in the long run if the transition rate from nurse to forager is high it may not be sustainable for the colony because there will be fewer available nurse bees synthesizing vg and rearing brood while foragers have higher mortality rates during high foraging season gordon 1996 states that rapid changes in tasks are caused as a result of a response to environmental stimuli other results show that when the efficiency of using vitellogenin for egg laying production by the queen is decreased or low the levels of vitellogenin per nurse bee increases an explanation of this could be that the queen is not been fed enough and therefore not able to produce eggs for instance depending on food conditions some species of ants control the composition of eggs and nutritional quality wheeler 1986 the sensitivity analysis performed in this study helped us quantify the impact of model outcomes given the uncertainty of parameters and initial conditions we used prcc sensitivity analysis with lhs as the sampling technique in order to determine which parameters are more influential on the different outcomes of interest we found that the parameters having a positive impact on brood population and nurse task group sizes across all time are the pollen collection rate pollen conversion rate to vitellogenin and the maximum transition rate from nurse to forager these parameters show that the availability of food resources specifically pollen huang 2012 mainly for brood survival and brood production are of vital importance for the success of the colony which has been confirmed in the work of naug 2009 also results showed that the amount of vg titers per nurse bee is significantly positively influenced by the amount of vg deposited in an egg and the period of time corresponding to the colony s high season but also the transition rate from nurse bee to foraging however the amount of vg titers per nurse bee is significantly negatively influenced by queen s feeding rate and the efficiency of converting vg for egg production overall the sensitivity analysis provided further confirmation that food source for queen egg production and developing brood are of vital importance for colony s success lastly we considered seasonality for the collection rate of pollen since in reality pollen collection rate is not constant due to changes in weather conditions synge 1947 thorp 1979 in order to perform a validity check of our model with seasonality we compared time series simulations generated by our model with empirical data from harr√≠s 1980 comparing the effects of seasonality model 7 we learned that seasonality can provide a more realistic intuition of long term consequences for instance when the efficiency of converting vg for egg laying production is decreased the model without seasonality does not show catastrophic events such as colony s death however the model with seasonality showed a periodic decrease of population size until the colony collapsed see fig 12 several studies with mathematical models for honeybee colonies are existent schmickl and crailsheim 2007 khoury et al 2013 becher et al 2014 perry et al 2015 schmickl and karsai 2017 most of these have modeled the population dynamics of honeybees and nutrient stores for example schmickl and crailsheim 2007 created a model to study the population and resource dynamics of a honeybee colony and including the effect of division of labor in the hive however the modeling approach is complicated and since it is well known that bees have a strong age based division of labor the theory used to model task allocation is more relevant in ants the model presented in khoury et al 2013 has similar assumptions to ours however one of the main differences from our model is the assumption of the transition from nurse bee to forager in our model we assume that the transition from nurse bee to foragers increases by a transition rate that depends on the levels of vitellogenin in the nurse bee and not only by the absence of stored food and reduced social inhibition also we enhanced their simple assumption of food collection rate by including the regulation effects of brood pheromone and stored pollen in beehave by becher et al 2014 although they take into considerations many aspects affecting colony dynamics they assume that the level of pollen and nectar stores in the colony affects the age at which workers initiate foraging activities they do not take into account other mechanisms changing at the molecular guidugli et al 2005 amdam et al 2010 amdam and omholt 2002 2003 and physiological level johnson 2005 amdam and omholt 2002 in our model we attempt to incorporate in a general manner those mechanisms within a bee that affect the initiation of foraging the model of perry et al 2015 proposes an ode model that captures the impacts of precocious foraging induced by different stressors the model suggests that food limitation set by inefficiency of a young foraging force would hasten colony terminal decline results from our model also suggest that high transition rate to foraging i e precocious bees can cause a decline of brood and forager population these implications have also been reviewed by klein et al 2017 scofield and mattila 2015 stating that early foraging and for a short period is due to shortage of pollen and thus vitellogenin during development in any case these models are useful in their own way and have been designed to address specific questions the analytical and numerical results presented here are unique and simple in the sense that we incorporate mechanisms that affect the age based division of labor and implications that can have on the change of brood and worker population sizes over time we presented basic but important assumptions that can help us understand and have greater insight in the complexity of honeybee population dynamics given their nutritional status and or needs this model can be extended by including other scenarios such as limiting the pollen influx in the late summer and study how it can affect the lifespan of bees and possibly lead to colony collapse or when bees opt to engage in brood cannibalism as a natural strategy to recycle protein other mechanism to be included is the transition back from forager to nurse bee under certain environmental conditions oettler et al 2015 and the interplay of diseases or infections such as nosema ceranae which is known to alter vitellogenin levels and therefore alter normal age polyethism causing colony imbalance benvau and nieh 2017

we can attempt to model only the dynamic variations of single species under the conditions of neutral assumptions hubbell 2001 ofi≈£eru et al 2010 demonstrated a neutral community model for a single operational taxonomic unit otu within a microbial community based on previous works the transition matrix of the model is similar to hubbell s but has been extended for use with microbial communities into a continuous format and incorporates environmental effects with the continuous format the dynamic variation of single species is viewed as a diffusion process and can be represented by a stochastic differential equation to estimate the parameters the authors transformed the stochastic differential equation into a linear regression model and suggested a weighted least squares method however because the current technology for detecting microorganisms has detection limits curtis et al 2002 the species in the microbial community cannot be detected consequently there are zero values in the observation dataset unfortunately the models from ofi≈£eru et al 2010 cannot contend with a dataset of temporal observations with zero values although this limitation can be partly overcome by high quality data along with further development of molecular technology the authors neglect one situation the individuals of the species are all dead at the time of sampling in the local community so that they cannot be detected therefore it is still necessary and significant to be able to model the temporal observations of the microbial community with zero values at this situation in addition local community size and immigration rate are mixed in their model however the immigration rate is important for analyzing the diversity of ecological communities as a result of our analysis of this model we would like to propose a more general neutral community model to improve the utilization of temporal observations within microbial communities inspired by previous works sloan et al 2006 burns et al 2015 we have also provided a new parametric estimation method different with weighted least squares method the individual parameters can be inferred from our method and the abovementioned shortcomings have been resolved 2 materials and methods 2 1 a broader neutral community model for temporal observations the main notations and the core concepts of our model were originally introduced by sloan et al 2006 and ofi≈£eru et al 2010 in this study we are introducing a necessary derivation to the model we make the following assumptions 1 the local community with n t individuals varies as an assemblage 2 at a species independent rate an individual dies or leaves the local community then the position of this individual is replaced either by an immigrant from a source community with the probability m or by the reproduction of a member in the local community with probability 1 m 3 the relative abundance of the species that the individual belongs to is p in the source community therefore the evolution of the whole local community is driven by a series of immigration birth and death processes by choosing a time period in which only one individual death occurs one species with initial abundance n will have three possible states increase by one stay the same or decrease by one in the next time period the corresponding transition probability can be given by the following expressions sloan et al 2006 ofi≈£eru et al 2010 1 pr n 1 n n t n n t m p 1 Œ± 1 m n n t 1 2 pr n 1 n n n t m 1 p 1 Œ± 1 m n t n n t 1 3 pr n n 1 pr n 1 n pr n 1 n where Œ± is a parameter that can confer advantage Œ± 0 or disadvantage Œ± 0 on the birth rate of a species when it is assumed that environmental factors have effects on the birth rates of species thereby the parameter Œ± controls the transition from niche dominated to neutral regime if the relative abundance of one species in a local community is represented as x n n t and n t is large enough then x can be considered as a continuous variable let a be the mean time for one replacement in a local community then scale time t by a to be œÑ t a consequently in a time period Œ¥ œÑ the expected changes in x are Œ¥ x 1 n t 0 then the expectation and squared difference for x can be calculated as sloan et al 2006 ofi≈£eru et al 2010 4 e Œ¥ x x x 1 n t m p x 2 Œ± 1 m x 1 x 5 e Œ¥ x 2 x x 1 n t 2 2 1 x x m p x 1 2 x next the dynamic variations of the species can be considered as a diffusion process according to mathematical theory we can refer to eq 4 as the drift term and eq 5 as the diffusion term to get a non linear stochastic differential equation 6 d x n t m p x 2 Œ± 1 m x 1 x Œ¥ œÑ 2 1 x x m p x 1 2 x d w œÑ where Œ¥ œÑ 1 n t 2 w œÑ is standard brownian motion substituting œÑ t a into eq 6 we get 7 d x n t m p x 2 Œ± 1 m x 1 x d t a 1 a 2 1 x x m p x 1 2 x d w t where Œ± can be a linear function of k observed factors z i i 1 k such as Œ± a 0 i 1 k a i z i further under assumption of neutrality Œ± 0 eq 7 becomes 8 d x n t m p x d t a 1 a 2 1 x x m p x 1 2 x d w t eqs 7 and 8 are our central formulas and the token of our neutral community model the model of ofi≈£eru et al 2010 consists of the following two formulas 9 d x n t m p x 2 Œ± 1 m x 1 x d t a 1 a 2 1 x x d w t 10 d x n t m p x d t a 1 a 2 1 x x d w t comparing these with our central formulas eqs 7 and 8 the difference is that term m p x 1 2 x is absent in the ofi≈£eru et al model eqs 9 and 10 to discuss this easily we refer to eqs 7 and 9 as the non neutral community model and eqs 8 and 10 as the purely neutral community model 2 2 the method of parameter estimation directly implementing maximum likelihood estimator mle for the parameters of our model eqs 7 and 8 is somewhat difficult thus the likelihood estimation for parameters of our model will be implemented following the steps below i estimation of n t and p average over all observed communities samples to get estimation of n t that is n ÀÜ t k 1 n n k n where n is the number of local communities and n k is the number of individuals in the k th community the relative abundance p for one species in the source community can be calculated as p ÀÜ k 1 n a k n n t where a k is the abundance of this species in the k th local community ii estimation of m a and a i for eq 7 with the estimated values of n ÀÜ t and p ÀÜ and using the euler method 27 to obtain a discrete eq 7 we get 11 x t x t 1 n ÀÜ t m p ÀÜ x t 1 2 Œ± 1 m x t 1 1 x t 1 1 a Œ¥ t 2 x t 1 1 x t 1 m p ÀÜ x t 1 1 2 x t 1 Œ¥ t a Œµ t Œ± a 0 i 1 k a i z i where z i represent environmental factors with the

and lifestyle on the dynamics of human associated microbiota two individuals were recruited and labeled individual a and individual b for individual a stool samples were collected daily from day 0 to day 346 and labeled a gut group saliva samples were sampled daily from day 26 to day 364 labeled a saliva group for individual b stool samples were sampled daily from day 0 to day 252 and named b gut group for each sample the v4 regions of 16s rrna genes were amplified and sequenced with illumina gaiix time series otu tables of 3 groups were chosen at 97 similarity via the qiime analysis pipeline v1 3 the read data for all samples have been deposited in the european bioinformatics institute ebi european nucleotide archive ena under the nucleotide accession number erp006059 subject a s nutritional metadata that is estimated daily intake of calories total fat saturated fat cholesterol protein sodium carbohydrates fiber sugars and calcium are provided under the group accession number sameg179160 in addition for our purposes we first wanted to compare our purely neutral model eq 8 with that of ofi≈£eru et al eq 10 secondly we wanted know whether our non neutral model eq 7 also could work with exterior factors to achieve this goal our chosen otu observations needed to have corresponding temporal factors thus the data we used were selected from the a saliva group between days 123 and 202 in addition too many zero values existing in the temporal observations reduce the credibility of the model fitting we averaged the abundance of otus over all samples then from the largest average to the smallest average seven otus were selected to fit models out of which five otus were without zero values in their temporal observations and two otus were with zero values 3 results because the identities of otus are not necessary in our analysis we used serial numbers to represent otus the specific contrasting relationship between identities and serial numbers are provided in supplementary table s1 3 1 comparison of two model based on mle approach the estimated parameters of the two models eqs 8 and 10 using our proposed mle approach are shown in table 1 although the two models are slightly different in form there are almost no differences in either the individual parameters or the compound parameters 3 2 comparison of two model based on mle and least square approach the estimated parameters of two formulas eqs 8 and 10 using separately own estimation method are listed in the tables 2 3 one observation is that the parameters n t and m have been estimated separately in our results whereas the two variables are combined in the results from ofi≈£eru et al table 2 the weighted least square method cannot support an estimate of these parameters n t and m separately the results show that the estimations of n t have identical values for all otus table 2 the estimations of m are combined with n t in the results from ofi≈£eru et al but our results indicate that they are all too small mean 0 0032 in our data set although they are relatively stable std 0 0035 meanwhile they are negatively correlated with the estimations of p correlation coefficient 0 6198 see fig 1 perhaps this means that immigration is more important for maintaining the diversity of rare species the values of n t m also are calculated in our results and compared with those of ofi≈£eru et al table 2 fig 2 a the coefficients of determination r2 in our results are slightly poor than those in ofi≈£eru et al fig 2b a point that requires special attention is that otu6 and otu7 were not included in the above comparisons the estimations of p show almost no differences between our results and those of ofi≈£eru et al table 2 fig 2c the estimations of the common parameter a in the results from ofi≈£eru et al are substantially larger than in our results mean 20068 vs 564 fig 2d as are the variances std 24854 vs 576 fig 3 shows that there are zero values in the temporal observations of otu6 and otu7 the models of ofi≈£eru et al do not depict dynamic changes of otu6 and otu7 but our model can work with otu6 and otu7 whose temporal observations containing zero values table 2 and table 4 in addition if we compare the estimates of these compound parameters using separately own estimation method it is clear from the table 3 that there is little difference in estimates of the compound parameters that govern the average population dynamics the main difference appears in the values of a table 2 3 3 parameter estimation for the non neutral community model to investigate whether exterior factors can be incorporated into our model we fitted eq 7 to an actual data set in the original data set there were ten nutrition factors such as calcium calories carbohydrates etc because these factors are highly relevant to each other principal component analysis was implemented to reduce the number of factors by using function principal in r language version 3 3 2 the first and second principal components were taken as factors and incorporated into our model table 4 shows the results of the parameter estimation the incorporated factors partially improved the goodness of fit of the model but the total influences are very small mean r2 0 4597vs 0 4544 the estimations of a i are generally too small for otus except for otu6 and otu7 table 4 this may mean that exterior factors have more influences on otus with zero values for temporal observations the estimated values of n t p m and a in table 2 are the same as in table 2 the reason for this is that we first implemented parameter estimation for eq 8 and then used the estimated values from eq 8 as the initial values for parameters n t p m and in the estimation of eq 7 4 discussion can our models deal with the time series with zero values what needs to be particularly pointed out is that we divide the time series with zero values into two classes one class is the zero values caused by the detection limit or the biases of the molecular sequencing so that the species are not detected at the sampling time another case is that the individuals of the species in the local communities become extinct because of deaths emigration at the sampling time so that the observed data of this species is zero for the second case due to the existence of the metacommunity at some time later the individuals of the species in the metacommunity can immigrate into the local communities so that the abundance of the species can be restored to a nonzero case instead of a string of zeroes our models want to deal with the second case with zero values ofi≈£eru et al 2010 assume that the immigration rate m is close to 0 or 1 when the microbial community is at the state of equilibrium under this assumption x will be close to p so that the term m p x 1 2 x can be neglected in eq 5 thus the term in the variance of the model only lefts term 2 1 x x this would mean that the volatility of the species is driven mainly by the species itself and has almost no relation with immigration while this may be true for some species it is wrong for the species that die out i e contain zero value in observations in local communities according to neutral theory reproduction and immigration are two mechanisms for maintaining existence of species in local community the species would recover from the extinction in the local community the role of immigration should not be negligible thus m is assumed to be small 0 or be larger 1 maybe inappropriate in essence the effect of the immigration from metacommunity to local community is ignored in their models which is why their models cannot deal with the zero values the second case different from ofi≈£eru et al our models have no limitations on m and contain the term m p x 1 2 x in the variance of the model stems when the individuals in the local community are zero item m p x 1 2 x becomes m p and it will not be zero which means that the individual immigration from metacommunity can drive the dynamic change of the species in the local community this is the reason that our model can deal with the time series with zero values nevertheless because our models are modified from ofi≈£eru et al and the main structure of both models are similar particularly with respect to compound parameters the differences of fitting results are very small with neglecting of term m p x 1 2 x in the variance of the model ofi≈£eru et al can transform their model into a linear regression model and implement weighted least square method to obtain parameter estimation they made a tradeoff between the convenience of fitting complex models using mle and the richer estimates that emerge from the weighted least squares one of the advantages of the weighted least square approach of ofiteru et al is that it gives straight forward p values and confidence limits for the parameter estimates however for observations with zero values the models of ofi≈£eru et al do not work because when the weighted least square method is implemented the weight x 1 x 1 will be infinite because of x 0 because our models cannot be transformed into linear regression model we choose mle to estimate parameters though the mle can estimate single rather than compound parameters it is difficult to directly obtain p values and confidence limits for the parameter estimates however directly estimating all the parameters for our model using mle is infeasible because of this reason we suggest our parameter estimation approach which is executed following two steps for the first step similar to previous works sloan et al 2006 burns et al 2015 we think that parameters n t and p both depend on other otus within the observed microbial communities therefore it may be more justified to estimate them based on the information from the whole microbial communities thus the parameters n t and p are directly estimated by averaging many communities but the difference with sloan et al 2006 is that we use samples of time series instead of space samples in order to reflect the zero sum assumption hubbell 2001 the estimate of local community size is fixed for all samples in our method in addition the size of microbial community is difficult to determine although recent advances in the application of molecular methods has made it possible to analysis the structure of microbial community most molecular methods still analyze small samples from very large densely populated communities woodcock et al 2006 2007 this disparity between sample size and community size far exceeds that for surveys of plants and animals woodcock et al 2006 2007 we used samples of time series to infer the community size n t in fact the estimate of n t in our method reflects the sample size of 16s rrna amplicons however we still think that this way is feasible because of sample size of 16s rrna amplicons is routinely conflated with community size even if it is small against real community size and contingent on the sequencing depth in addition what is the effect of n t on the rest of parameter estimation obviously the likelihood function of our model contains parameter n t the different value of n t leads to the different likelihood function thus the rest of parameter estimation in our model will be affected by value of n t this means that the rest of parameter estimations are also relate to the sequencing depth however the compound parameters in our results are almost same with ofi≈£eru et al s what is the reason for this we speculate that one reason is that the effects between the parameters which are caused by n t relate to the sequencing depth are offset by each other in addition because of data acquisition we have no more appropriate data and have no choice but to use the data type of 16s rrna amplicons thus we have no intention to draw inferences on the structure of the human gut based on our models we would use this data set to demonstrate the difference between our models and ofi≈£eru et al s in future with the development of molecular technology the microbial community size can be well determined by the sample data and the approximate estimation of community size will be more accurate although ofi≈£eru et al 2010 use the mixed values of n t and m to characterize the community it cleverly avoids the difficulty of the precise estimate of n t perhaps it is a better way to characterize the microbial community but in the future it is still significance to estimate n t and m respectively the parameter p is estimated by averaging consecutive sample abundances it needs two prerequisites the system truly is a dynamic steady state the time series is long enough that the trajectory of relative abundance which has traversed through enough values can give a representative sample of the distribution of all possible values in addition why there are differences about values of a between our results and ofi≈£eru et al s we have used parameter a as a variable to optimize the likelihood function whereas ofi≈£eru et al 2010 directly obtained this parameter from the standard residual error of the regression equation by fixing n t and p we constrain a to take a particular value to fit likelihood function this is why the r2 values in our results are slightly poor than that in ofiteru et al similarly the other parameters are affected by value of n t and indirectly related to the sequencing depth 5 conclusions we have improved the neutral community model presented by ofi≈£eru et al 2010 and have provided a parameter estimation method this improved model now can be applied to temporal observations with zero values for describing the dynamic variability of otus and the methods that we suggest provide individual estimations of parameters however it remains difficult to determine if the temporal observations of rare species with zero values are induced by technical limitations or the deaths of individuals in local community it appears that observations of rare species with too many zero values are more likely to be caused by molecular detection limitations in microbial communities therefore it should be pay more attention to the quality of observation data for rare species when implementing our model in addition we choose the time series containing one and two zero values to demonstrate our work which does not mean that our model cannot handle the time series with more zero values only for two reasons one is that the time series that contains a lot of zero values is more likely due to molecular sequencing is not conform to the second case with zero values the other one is that the time series including the data we use in this paper are too short to estimate the parameters of stochastic differential equations using data containing more zero will reduce the reliability of statistical inference in addition for our estimation method the likelihood estimation relies on selection of initial values we suggest that it is better to repeat the estimation method many times to select the best initial values acknowledgements the authors wish to express our most sincere

that they cannot be detected therefore it is still necessary and significant to be able to model the temporal observations of the microbial community with zero values at this situation in addition local community size and immigration rate are mixed in their model however the immigration rate is important for analyzing the diversity of ecological communities as a result of our analysis of this model we would like to propose a more general neutral community model to improve the utilization of temporal observations within microbial communities inspired by previous works sloan et al 2006 burns et al 2015 we have also provided a new parametric estimation method different with weighted least squares method the individual parameters can be inferred from our method and the abovementioned shortcomings have been resolved 2 materials and methods 2 1 a broader neutral community model for temporal observations the main notations and the core concepts of our model were originally introduced by sloan et al 2006 and ofi≈£eru et al 2010 in this study we are introducing a necessary derivation to the model we make the following assumptions 1 the local community with n t individuals varies as an assemblage 2 at a species independent rate an individual dies or leaves the local community then the position of this individual is replaced either by an immigrant from a source community with the probability m or by the reproduction of a member in the local community with probability 1 m 3 the relative abundance of the species that the individual belongs to is p in the source community therefore the evolution of the whole local community is driven by a series of immigration birth and death processes by choosing a time period in which only one individual death occurs one species with initial abundance n will have three possible states increase by one stay the same or decrease by one in the next time period the corresponding transition probability can be given by the following expressions sloan et al 2006 ofi≈£eru et al 2010 1 pr n 1 n n t n n t m p 1 Œ± 1 m n n t 1 2 pr n 1 n n n t m 1 p 1 Œ± 1 m n t n n t 1 3 pr n n 1 pr n 1 n pr n 1 n where Œ± is a parameter that can confer advantage Œ± 0 or disadvantage Œ± 0 on the birth rate of a species when it is assumed that environmental factors have effects on the birth rates of species thereby the parameter Œ± controls the transition from niche dominated to neutral regime if the relative abundance of one species in a local community is represented as x n n t and n t is large enough then x can be considered as a continuous variable let a be the mean time for one replacement in a local community then scale time t by a to be œÑ t a consequently in a time period Œ¥ œÑ the expected changes in x are Œ¥ x 1 n t 0 then the expectation and squared difference for x can be calculated as sloan et al 2006 ofi≈£eru et al 2010 4 e Œ¥ x x x 1 n t m p x 2 Œ± 1 m x 1 x 5 e Œ¥ x 2 x x 1 n t 2 2 1 x x m p x 1 2 x next the dynamic variations of the species can be considered as a diffusion process according to mathematical theory we can refer to eq 4 as the drift term and eq 5 as the diffusion term to get a non linear stochastic differential equation 6 d x n t m p x 2 Œ± 1 m x 1 x Œ¥ œÑ 2 1 x x m p x 1 2 x d w œÑ where Œ¥ œÑ 1 n t 2 w œÑ is standard brownian motion substituting œÑ t a into eq 6 we get 7 d x n t m p x 2 Œ± 1 m x 1 x d t a 1 a 2 1 x x m p x 1 2 x d w t where Œ± can be a linear function of k observed factors z i i 1 k such as Œ± a 0 i 1 k a i z i further under assumption of neutrality Œ± 0 eq 7 becomes 8 d x n t m p x d t a 1 a 2 1 x x m p x 1 2 x d w t eqs 7 and 8 are our central formulas and the token of our neutral community model the model of ofi≈£eru et al 2010 consists of the following two formulas 9 d x n t m p x 2 Œ± 1 m x 1 x d t a 1 a 2 1 x x d w t 10 d x n t m p x d t a 1 a 2 1 x x d w t comparing these with our central formulas eqs 7 and 8 the difference is that term m p x 1 2 x is absent in the ofi≈£eru et al model eqs 9 and 10 to discuss this easily we refer to eqs 7 and 9 as the non neutral community model and eqs 8 and 10 as the purely neutral community model 2 2 the method of parameter estimation directly implementing maximum likelihood estimator mle for the parameters of our model eqs 7 and 8 is somewhat difficult thus the likelihood estimation for parameters of our model will be implemented following the steps below i estimation of n t and p average over all observed communities samples to get estimation of n t that is n ÀÜ t k 1 n n k n where n is the number of local communities and n k is the number of individuals in the k th community the relative abundance p for one species in the source community can be calculated as p ÀÜ k 1 n a k n n t where a k is the abundance of this species in the k th local community ii estimation of m a and a i for eq 7 with the estimated values of n ÀÜ t and p ÀÜ and using the euler method 27 to obtain a discrete eq 7 we get 11 x t x t 1 n ÀÜ t m p ÀÜ x t 1 2 Œ± 1 m x t 1 1 x t 1 1 a Œ¥ t 2 x t 1 1 x t 1 m p ÀÜ x t 1 1 2 x t 1 Œ¥ t a Œµ t Œ± a 0 i 1 k a i z i where z i represent environmental factors with the

and lifestyle on the dynamics of human associated microbiota two individuals were recruited and labeled individual a and individual b for individual a stool samples were collected daily from day 0 to day 346 and labeled a gut group saliva samples were sampled daily from day 26 to day 364 labeled a saliva group for individual b stool samples were sampled daily from day 0 to day 252 and named b gut group for each sample the v4 regions of 16s rrna genes were amplified and sequenced with illumina gaiix time series otu tables of 3 groups were chosen at 97 similarity via the qiime analysis pipeline v1 3 the read data for all samples have been deposited in the european bioinformatics institute ebi european nucleotide archive ena under the nucleotide accession number erp006059 subject a s nutritional metadata that is estimated daily intake of calories total fat saturated fat cholesterol protein sodium carbohydrates fiber sugars and calcium are provided under the group accession number sameg179160 in addition for our purposes we first wanted to compare our purely neutral model eq 8 with that of ofi≈£eru et al eq 10 secondly we wanted know whether our non neutral model eq 7 also could work with exterior factors to achieve this goal our chosen otu observations needed to have corresponding temporal factors thus the data we used were selected from the a saliva group between days 123 and 202 in addition too many zero values existing in the temporal observations reduce the credibility of the model fitting we averaged the abundance of otus over all samples then from the largest average to the smallest average seven otus were selected to fit models out of which five otus were without zero values in their temporal observations and two otus were with zero values 3 results because the identities of otus are not necessary in our analysis we used serial numbers to represent otus the specific contrasting relationship between identities and serial numbers are provided in supplementary table s1 3 1 comparison of two model based on mle approach the estimated parameters of the two models eqs 8 and 10 using our proposed mle approach are shown in table 1 although the two models are slightly different in form there are almost no differences in either the individual parameters or the compound parameters 3 2 comparison of two model based on mle and least square approach the estimated parameters of two formulas eqs 8 and 10 using separately own estimation method are listed in the tables 2 3 one observation is that the parameters n t and m have been estimated separately in our results whereas the two variables are combined in the results from ofi≈£eru et al table 2 the weighted least square method cannot support an estimate of these parameters n t and m separately the results show that the estimations of n t have identical values for all otus table 2 the estimations of m are combined with n t in the results from ofi≈£eru et al but our results indicate that they are all too small mean 0 0032 in our data set although they are relatively stable std 0 0035 meanwhile they are negatively correlated with the estimations of p correlation coefficient 0 6198 see fig 1 perhaps this means that immigration is more important for maintaining the diversity of rare species the values of n t m also are calculated in our results and compared with those of ofi≈£eru et al table 2 fig 2 a the coefficients of determination r2 in our results are slightly poor than those in ofi≈£eru et al fig 2b a point that requires special attention is that otu6 and otu7 were not included in the above comparisons the estimations of p show almost no differences between our results and those of ofi≈£eru et al table 2 fig 2c the estimations of the common parameter a in the results from ofi≈£eru et al are substantially larger than in our results mean 20068 vs 564 fig 2d as are the variances std 24854 vs 576 fig 3 shows that there are zero values in the temporal observations of otu6 and otu7 the models of ofi≈£eru et al do not depict dynamic changes of otu6 and otu7 but our model can work with otu6 and otu7 whose temporal observations containing zero values table 2 and table 4 in addition if we compare the estimates of these compound parameters using separately own estimation method it is clear from the table 3 that there is little difference in estimates of the compound parameters that govern the average population dynamics the main difference appears in the values of a table 2 3 3 parameter estimation for the non neutral community model to investigate whether exterior factors can be incorporated into our model we fitted eq 7 to an actual data set in the original data set there were ten nutrition factors such as calcium calories carbohydrates etc because these factors are highly relevant to each other principal component analysis was implemented to reduce the number of factors by using function principal in r language version 3 3 2 the first and second principal components were taken as factors and incorporated into our model table 4 shows the results of the parameter estimation the incorporated factors partially improved the goodness of fit of the model but the total influences are very small mean r2 0 4597vs 0 4544 the estimations of a i are generally too small for otus except for otu6 and otu7 table 4 this may mean that exterior factors have more influences on otus with zero values for temporal observations the estimated values of n t p m and a in table 2 are the same as in table 2 the reason for this is that we first implemented parameter estimation for eq 8 and then used the estimated values from eq 8 as the initial values for parameters n t p m and in the estimation of eq 7 4 discussion can our models deal with the time series with zero values what needs to be particularly pointed out is that we divide the time series with zero values into two classes one class is the zero values caused by the detection limit or the biases of the molecular sequencing so that the species are not detected at the sampling time another case is that the individuals of the species in the local communities become extinct because of deaths emigration at the sampling time so that the observed data of this species is zero for the second case due to the existence of the metacommunity at some time later the individuals of the species in the metacommunity can immigrate into the local communities so that the abundance of the species can be restored to a nonzero case instead of a string of zeroes our models want to deal with the second case with zero values ofi≈£eru et al 2010 assume that the immigration rate m is close to 0 or 1 when the microbial community is at the state of equilibrium under this assumption x will be close to p so that the term m p x 1 2 x can be neglected in eq 5 thus the term in the variance of the model only lefts term 2 1 x x this would mean that the volatility of the species is driven mainly by the species itself and has almost no relation with immigration while this may be true for some species it is wrong for the species that die out i e contain zero value in observations in local communities according to neutral theory reproduction and immigration are two mechanisms for maintaining existence of species in local community the species would recover from the extinction in the local community the role of immigration should not be negligible thus m is assumed to be small 0 or be larger 1 maybe inappropriate in essence the effect of the immigration from metacommunity to local community is ignored in their models which is why their models cannot deal with the zero values the second case different from ofi≈£eru et al our models have no limitations on m and contain the term m p x 1 2 x in the variance of the model stems when the individuals in the local community are zero item m p x 1 2 x becomes m p and it will not be zero which means that the individual immigration from metacommunity can drive the dynamic change of the species in the local community this is the reason that our model can deal with the time series with zero values nevertheless because our models are modified from ofi≈£eru et al and the main structure of both models are similar particularly with respect to compound parameters the differences of fitting results are very small with neglecting of term m p x 1 2 x in the variance of the model ofi≈£eru et al can transform their model into a linear regression model and implement weighted least square method to obtain parameter estimation they made a tradeoff between the convenience of fitting complex models using mle and the richer estimates that emerge from the weighted least squares one of the advantages of the weighted least square approach of ofiteru et al is that it gives straight forward p values and confidence limits for the parameter estimates however for observations with zero values the models of ofi≈£eru et al do not work because when the weighted least square method is implemented the weight x 1 x 1 will be infinite because of x 0 because our models cannot be transformed into linear regression model we choose mle to estimate parameters though the mle can estimate single rather than compound parameters it is difficult to directly obtain p values and confidence limits for the parameter estimates however directly estimating all the parameters for our model using mle is infeasible because of this reason we suggest our parameter estimation approach which is executed following two steps for the first step similar to previous works sloan et al 2006 burns et al 2015 we think that parameters n t and p both depend on other otus within the observed microbial communities therefore it may be more justified to estimate them based on the information from the whole microbial communities thus the parameters n t and p are directly estimated by averaging many communities but the difference with sloan et al 2006 is that we use samples of time series instead of space samples in order to reflect the zero sum assumption hubbell 2001 the estimate of local community size is fixed for all samples in our method in addition the size of microbial community is difficult to determine although recent advances in the application of molecular methods has made it possible to analysis the structure of microbial community most molecular methods still analyze small samples from very large densely populated communities woodcock et al 2006 2007 this disparity between sample size and community size far exceeds that for surveys of plants and animals woodcock et al 2006 2007 we used samples of time series to infer the community size n t in fact the estimate of n t in our method reflects the sample size of 16s rrna amplicons however we still think that this way is feasible because of sample size of 16s rrna amplicons is routinely conflated with community size even if it is small against real community size and contingent on the sequencing depth in addition what is the effect of n t on the rest of parameter estimation obviously the likelihood function of our model contains parameter n t the different value of n t leads to the different likelihood function thus the rest of parameter estimation in our model will be affected by value of n t this means that the rest of parameter estimations are also relate to the sequencing depth however the compound parameters in our results are almost same with ofi≈£eru et al s what is the reason for this we speculate that one reason is that the effects between the parameters which are caused by n t relate to the sequencing depth are offset by each other in addition because of data acquisition we have no more appropriate data and have no choice but to use the data type of 16s rrna amplicons thus we have no intention to draw inferences on the structure of the human gut based on our models we would use this data set to demonstrate the difference between our models and ofi≈£eru et al s in future with the development of molecular technology the microbial community size can be well determined by the sample data and the approximate estimation of community size will be more accurate although ofi≈£eru et al 2010 use the mixed values of n t and m to characterize the community it cleverly avoids the difficulty of the precise estimate of n t perhaps it is a better way to characterize the microbial community but in the future it is still significance to estimate n t and m respectively the parameter p is estimated by averaging consecutive sample abundances it needs two prerequisites the system truly is a dynamic steady state the time series is long enough that the trajectory of relative abundance which has traversed through enough values can give a representative sample of the distribution of all possible values in addition why there are differences about values of a between our results and ofi≈£eru et al s we have used parameter a as a variable to optimize the likelihood function whereas ofi≈£eru et al 2010 directly obtained this parameter from the standard residual error of the regression equation by fixing n t and p we constrain a to take a particular value to fit likelihood function this is why the r2 values in our results are slightly poor than that in ofiteru et al similarly the other parameters are affected by value of n t and indirectly related to the sequencing depth 5 conclusions we have improved the neutral community model presented by ofi≈£eru et al 2010 and have provided a parameter estimation method this improved model now can be applied to temporal observations with zero values for describing the dynamic variability of otus and the methods that we suggest provide individual estimations of parameters however it remains difficult to determine if the temporal observations of rare species with zero values are induced by technical limitations or the deaths of individuals in local community it appears that observations of rare species with too many zero values are more likely to be caused by molecular detection limitations in microbial communities therefore it should be pay more attention to the quality of observation data for rare species when implementing our model in addition we choose the time series containing one and two zero values to demonstrate our work which does not mean that our model cannot handle the time series with more zero values only for two reasons one is that the time series that contains a lot of zero values is more likely due to molecular sequencing is not conform to the second case with zero values the other one is that the time series including the data we use in this paper are too short to estimate the parameters of stochastic differential equations using data containing more zero will reduce the reliability of statistical inference in addition for our estimation method the likelihood estimation relies on selection of initial values we suggest that it is better to repeat the estimation method many times to select the best initial values acknowledgements the authors wish to express our most sincere

25179,semi desert areas are sensitive to changes in rainfall and agricultural pressure prone to abrupt changes and to the collapse of ecological functions the sclerophyllous evergreen forest of central chile known as matorral has been extensively overgrazed by domestic livestock as a consequence the native and endemic species of this forest community have been replaced by a savanna type environment dominated by the species acacia caven known as espinales it has been hypothesized that the collapse of matorral forest can be abrupt and the two ecosystems represent two alternative stable states to understand the ecological dynamics that occur during this transition their signature in space and the consequences of livestock management a cellular automata model that considers the local interaction among forest vegetation acacia and livestock management was developed by simulating and analyzing the process of fragmentation in space and time in a gradient of livestock pressure and aridity the results show that the system exhibits properties of robust criticality with a shift of patch size distributions from models matching power laws to models matching truncated power laws as livestock pressure increases nearby the point of collapse simulation results in scenarios with rotation of livestock at the tipping point reveal the interaction between resting frequency and forest conservation these results provide information to design better management strategies in human modified landscapes in the remaining chilean matorral keywords acacia caven alternative ecosystem states ecosystem shift matorral robust criticality 1 introduction semi desert areas cover more than 41 of the surface of the planet and sustain 2 billion people via agriculture and livestock these are ecological systems highly vulnerable to climate and human induced changes as a consequence these environments have been largely degraded millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 grazing and browsing pressure from livestock along with extensive droughts and heavy rains are the major drivers of degradation in semi desert areas more than 70 of the total pastoral terrain and rangeland in semi desert areas has been somehow degraded millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 obtaining early warning indicators that can provide timely information about the condition of the ecological functions in semi desert ecosystems is critical for developing a new generation of preventive rangeland management strategies reynolds et al 2007 early warning indicators of transitions are clues provided by the spatial and temporal structure of systems in ecological systems these clues inform us of the possibility that the ecological functions of the system are close to a point of transition or collapse scheffer 2010 scheffer et al 2012 in recent years several studies have formalized the type of information that needs to be obtained from ecological systems to understand and predict these critical transitions and new rigorous statistical tools have been developed to detect early signals k√©fi et al 2014 yet there is still an important gap in the literature in terms of how to incorporate this information into management strategies that can improve conservation and restoration in landscapes shared by human activities and natural ecosystems k√©fi et al 2011 in semi desert environments clues about the spatial structure of vegetation are associated with the formation of patches of different sizes k√©fi et al 2007 the lack of water in semi desert environments generates harsh conditions for plants to germinate in bare soil far from the shade of adult vegetation some trees and bushes are more likely to germinate close to other plants which facilitates the growth of juveniles from a spatial scale larger than individual plants it is possible to observe patches of vegetation of different sizes while the complexity of the ecological interactions make generalization of early warning signals challenging moreno de las heras et al 2011 theoretical studies at local scales with test plots in areas of mediterranean semi deserts have shown that the patch size distributions relationship between the patch sizes of a system and their frequencies change from closely resembling power law like patterns i e there are many small patches and only few that are very large to truncated power laws similar to power laws but lacking the largest patch sizes when the system approaches a point of imminent collapse k√©fi et al 2007 studies at regional scales have confirmed the melting of the power law like patterns in ecosystems associated with the loss of function and processes of desertification berdugo et al 2017 in the semi arid region of central chile the landscape has been dominated by a dense evergreen forest known as matorral the matorral is composed primarily of perennial sclerophyllous trees such as peumus boldus boldo cryptocarya alba peumo and quillaja saponaria quillay as well as woody sclerophyllous scrubs small trees such as cassia coquimbensis schinus polygamous and litrea caustica gajardo 1994 over the last 100 years this forest has been extensively reduced more than 80 of the native and highly endemic vegetation has been depleted fuentes and simonetti 1981 fuentes et al 1986 holmgren 2002 the fall of the forest gave rise to a savanna like type of environment dominated by the species acacia caven known as espinales fuentes et al 1989 ovalle et al 1996 between 1975 and 2009 more than 45 of the land covered by forest has transitioned to espinales van de wouw et al 2011 today acacia trees are the most common species in central chile ovalle et al 1990 according to the literature and fieldwork herbivory and pastoralism activities have played a key role in this transition and the transformation from forest to savanna has been mostly human induced due to overgrazing and browsing by large livestock mammals goats and cows the introduction of invasive species rabbits and land clearing for agriculture and mining fuentes et al 1989 1986 1983 pickett et al 1987 first the presence of livestock influences vegetation dynamics by increasing mortality changing species composition and decreasing biodiversity livestock grazing induces soil compaction which subsequently can increase rainfall runoff soil erosion and finally the depletion of nutrients in the soil silva et al 1978 second the presence of domestic livestock has an indirect benefit on the colonization of acacia caven specifically acacia trees provide succulent pods that are eaten by livestock and in return germination is facilitated the distance of seed dispersal increases and acacia intraspecific competition is reduced this ecological mechanism thus creates an advantage for acacia over the native vegetation in livestock dominated landscapes holmgren 2002 armesto and pickett 1985 significant distinctions exist between these two ecosystems as mentioned above forest coverage is highly dense acacia dominated environments on the other hand are characterized by large open areas with sparse vegetation coverage and low biodiversity ovalle et al 1996 fuentes et al 1989 bahre 1979 an important ecological characteristic of the matorral forest is the role of local positive interactions between species the colonization success of seeds inside the forest is facilitated by the presence of nearby sclerophyllous vegetation which helps reduce water loss in a water limited environment fuentes et al 1984 dry summers and short rainfall seasons characterize the climate of this region the long and dry summers combined with long lasting droughts generate adverse conditions for seedlings from sclerophyllous species adult plants near seedlings can create favorable microclimatic conditions that help the soil retain moisture and reduce its temperature in summers cares et al 2013 these local conditions provide a nursing effect fuentes et al 1984 that facilitates the successful establishment of young trees and shrubs cuevas et al 2013 jim√©nez and armesto 1992 fuentes et al 1984 the interaction of the biotic effect of local facilitation and the abiotic effect of rainfall plays an important role in the persistence of seedlings low rainfall availability especially at sites with high exposure to sunlight generates more arid conditions recurrent and prolonged droughts reduce seedling recruitment of many species holmgren et al 2001 intense rainfall on the other hand causes soil erosion and nutrient runoff that negatively affect soil fertility the two ecosystems in the desert region of chile sclerophyllous and acacia dominated communities are considered to be two alternative stable states with hysteresis holmgren 2002 this implies that if the forest crosses a threshold of degradation it can collapse to a savanna environment without the possibility of a fast recovery in this region therefore a system for the development of early indicators of the transition is an important management tool needed to support the conservation and restoration of the remaining matorral ecosystems holmgren et al 2006 while previous studies have provided a framework to consider the interaction among forest acacia and management holmgren 2002 armesto and pickett 1985 so far there has not been an attempt to simulate the dynamics of the transition and the ecological interactions within the same analytical framework the purpose of this work is therefore to explore the mechanisms of disturbance that may play a role in promoting the transition of the chilean matorral to savanna and to investigate the interaction between the signals of degradation and the management of the system the forest community of central chile has a type of semi desert vegetation that is prone to forming patchy landscapes composed of woody vegetation and several studies have confirmed the fragility of the system when faced with human perturbation furthermore recent studies have investigated the local interaction within the system and the possibility of detecting these changes based on spatially explicit information associated with the patchiness of the vegetation fuentes castillo et al 2012 therefore this work proposes an important model for investigating the interaction between the signals of degradation and their association with conservation and management efforts a type of environmental management that could benefit from incorporating this information is the use of rotational and resting strategies rotational and resting schemes or multi paddock grazing strategies involve rotating livestock to distribute the grazing pressure over large areas the use of multi paddock rotation systems hart et al 1988 is a widely used strategy by pastoral communities around the world briske et al 2008 and it involves the movement of animals from one paddock to another for the sake of providing resting time for vegetation biomass to regenerate two important properties of multi paddock rotation management are 1 the number of animals to be moved and 2 the time required to do so hart et al 1988 three specific questions guide this research 1 under what conditions of aridity and livestock pressure are the two alternative stable states more likely to be observed 2 what kind of spatial patterns and early indicators of transition emerge as the system transitions to savanna 3 how do rotational management strategies influence the likelihood of this transition to provide insight into these questions a cellular automata model was developed to simulate the birth death process of sclerophyllous vegetation and acacia in the chilean matorral the model was then simulated in a gradient of aridity and livestock pressure and under different strategies of rotation to investigate the trajectories of the forest under different pulses of livestock pressure 2 methods the model a cellular automata is a type of spatially explicit model that allows for the incorporation of local ecological interactions into models of population and community dynamics using a discrete set of sites and discrete time steps balzter et al 1998 durrett and levin 1994 hogeweg 1988 here the cellular automata approach is used to simulate the dynamics of a landscape composed of four land types a bare soil type d annual grasses g acacia a and forest f fig 1 in each time step t the probability that a site will change from one state to another is determined by the state of the nearest neighbors which are defined as the sites in radius 1 within a moore neighborhood structure the possible land type transitions are depicted in fig 1 the model includes the influence of livestock pressure represented by symbol l and the effect of aridity or lack of rainfall œï livestock pressure influences the mortality rates and aridity influences colonization rates livestock pressure additionally influences the rate of colonization of acacia individuals the model assumes that the colonization of woody plants a f only occurs in land that already support grasses that is g t a t 1 and g t f t 1 thus land type g represents land with soil nutrients and water to support the growth and establishment of woody vegetation state d symbolizes an opposite land type one whose soil lacks nutrients and water thus restoration in the model implies the establishment of annual grasses in bare soil that is d t g t 1 aridity œï can thus be interpreted as the effect of dry conditions on the loss of soil and biomass due to lack of water the model was implemented in a square lattice of 200 200 sites with periodic boundary conditions and synchronous monthly updating with the size of each site representing 1 square meter in sections 2 1 2 3 the transition rates of the birth and death processes colonization and mortality of the model are formalized and the numerical experiments conducted to examine the transition are described along with presentation of the statistical analyses conducted to detect early warning indicators figs 2 and 3 2 1 transition rates in the cellular automata 2 1 1 grass colonization a d s i t e can only be recolonized by grasses this transition occurs at rate Œ≥ g 1 œï r f a g q w d where Œ≥ g is the grass colonization rate dependent on the natural seeding rate r and the effect of facilitation f a g q w d facilitation represents an increase in the probability that grass will colonize a site when it is surrounded by any type of woody vegetation that is w a f thus q d a is the fraction of a sites sites in the neighborhood of a site in state d by convention qxy is defined as the fraction of y sites sites in the surrounding neighborhood of an x site the factor 1 œï represents the negative effect of dryness or aridity on the recruitment of new individuals 2 1 2 forest and acacia colonization the model assumes that a g site can be colonized by either a seedling individual of acacia or sclerophyllous forest this process is dictated by the colonization rate of acacia Œ≥ f and forest Œ≥ f for acacia the rate is formally defined as Œ≥ a 1 œï Œ≤ a 1 d q a g d f l œÅ a where Œ≤ a is the per capita production of acacia seeds q a g is the proportion of a sites surrounding a g site œÅ a is the global fraction of a sites parameter d represents the proportion of seeds that get dispersed from other sites in the landscape finally f l represents a function that connects the density of livestock with the colonization success of acacia in a positive way f l l l l where l is the number of animals in the landscape and l is the so called half saturation constant this parameter can be interpreted as the number of animals needed for acacia seeds to reach any site in the landscape with 50 chance the function f l behaves linearly for low values of livestock and it saturates for larger values since lim l f l 1 as for the forest colonization rate Œ≥ f this is defined as Œ≥ f 1 œï Œ≤ f f f f q g f where Œ≤ f is the seeding rate q g f is the proportion of f sites in the neighborhood of a g site and f f f is the facilitation effect parameter of forest on the colonization success of forest individuals this colonization rate thus assumes that forest colonization is strictly localized facilitated by f sites fuentes et al 1986 and negatively influenced by aridity œï 2 1 3 mortality grass and forest mortality are functions that depend on the intrinsic and density independent mortality of a plant mg mf and on the browsing and grazing pressure per livestock m l x such that m x m x m x l l where m x is the rate at which an x site with x g f transitions to state d m x is the natural mortality rate and m x l is the livestock induced mortality rate m x l represents the per capita effect of livestock on vegetation due to direct ingestion of plant tissue or indirect effects from the myriad processes of degradation that accompany pastoralist activities the model assumes that livestock pressure on vegetation mortality is equal across the landscape in the case of acacia it has been shown that its mortality is affected by intraspecific competition that is competition among acacia caven trees navarro 1995 to capture this effect the model includes a density dependent mechanism that controls the mortality rate of acacia based on local density q a a such that m a m a 1 c q a a m a l l where c q a a is the increase in mortality due to the local density of acacia 2 2 parameterization the range of parameters used in the simulations were derived when possible from available literature for those parameters without available information local and global sensitivity analyses were conducted results of these analyses are presented in appendix a these values are presented in table 1 and additional information about the studies from which parameters were derived is presented in appendix a 2 3 numerical experiments and analysis of early warning indicators the exploration of the model begins by considering the ecological dynamics of the matorral in a gradient of aridity and livestock pressure over a period of time t years 100 simulations were conducted in a landscape representing 4 hectares thus each site denotes 1 square meter and the landscape is composed of 200 200 sites each simulation was evaluated for a livestock population size in the range l 1 40 and aridity œï 0 2 1 to identify alternative stable states each scenario resulting from combining a value of œï and l was evaluated using different initial conditions of the proportion of forest and acacia specifically for a particular simulation i with parameters œï i l i the initial conditions of the landscape are defined by d i 0 g i 0 0 1 f i 0 Œµ i and a i 0 1 Œµ i for Œµ i 0 1 0 7 and i 1 100 to increase the likelihood that the system would reach a stable state each simulation was run for t 500 years which is sufficient time for most of the scenarios of livestock and aridity to reach this state given the parameter values of colonization and mortality for initial conditions of low forest and low livestock pressure the system can take substantial computational time to reach a stable state in those cases the simulations were conducted for t 1000 years however this increment in time does not ensure that the system will reach a stable state in all of the simulations the final state of the landscape that is the proportion of land occupied by each possible state at time t t was recorded in each simulation along with the final spatial configuration 2 3 1 patch size distribution here the null hypothesis stating that the frequency distribution of forest patches at the point of imminent transition to acacia will appear to come from a truncated power law distribution model is presented and tested using the simulation results formally the patch size distribution of forest is defined as p x x Œ± x x m i n where in this case x is the size of each patch of forest and p x is the frequency of patches of size x Œ± is a constant of proportionality the power law relationship generally holds for some values greater than x m i n parameter Œ± needs to be estimated as well as x m i n to test this hypothesis the number of patches and their sizes were recorded at the end of each simulation a patch in the model is defined as a set of sites in the forest state that share at least one side assuming each patch is square and each site has four sides the size of the patch is the total number of sites using this information the patch size frequency is constructed and the frequency of the patch sizes were fitted to a pl model obtained for a range of simulations in a gradient of livestock pressure to illustrate how this transition changes depending on the number of animals present the methods for estimating the parameters of the distribution models and conducting the statistical analyses were obtained from the package powerlaw implemented in the statistical software r r core team 2013 and based on the work of clauset et al 2009 as the system approaches the tipping point the destruction of large patches will generate a smaller range of patch sizes k√©fi et al 2007 2011 such distributions may be defined as truncated power laws which are power laws with an exponential cut off that prevents the existence of big patches its formulation reads p x x Œ± e Œª x where Œª is a decay parameter of an exponential function e Œª x for low values of x the behavior is dominated by power law and for large values the exponential function dominates in the same gradient of livestock pressure the pl model is compared against the tpl model based on the akaike information criteria a i c which is a function that considers the log likelihood of the model fit and the number of parameters of the model formally an index of plausibility of the pl model versus the tpl model was constructed i a i c l a i c p l l a i c t p l l a i c p l l a i c t p l l in this way the plausibility of each model relative to the other can be visually examined for different values of l the level of livestock pressure at which one more individual will make the forest collapse was recorded and labeled as l 2 3 2 rotational schemes to evaluate the effect of rotational schemes numerical experiments were conducted in which the effect of livestock was suppressed for a period of œÅ years after which the livestock population was re introduced for the same number of years thus a scheme of œÅ 5 implies that the paddock landscape will be affected by livestock for five consecutive years and then unaffected for the next five years and so on the experiment simulated scenarios that assume an initial condition with abundant forest cover f 0 0 7 and low levels of acacia a 0 0 1 first 20 simulations were conducted within a range of rotational periods œÅ with œÅ 2 35 years for a landscape with the level of livestock pressure at which the system is at the tipping point l 27 for œï 0 at time t 1000 the percentage of landscape in state forest was obtained with f œÅ l 1 t d t t d t t f t where d 2 max œÅ is used to include the full variation of f t for any scheme from this experiment the range in the frequency of rotation in which f 0 was identified fig 4 b using œÅ 18 years the precence of the alternative states were compared in a range of livestock pressure l 1 50 results of this comparison are presented in fig 4a examples of the resulting dynamics of forest under two rotation schemes are represented in the time series in fig 4c along with those time series the value of aic i was calculated to evaluate how the signal changes over time 3 results 3 1 alternative stable states simulations of the model under different levels of aridity and livestock pressure show the presence of alternative stable states fig 2 illustrates the presence of two alternative stable states forest dominated environment f 0 and acacia dominated environment f 0 in the figure the livestock pressure that takes the system from forest to acacia that is the tipping point changes under different levels of aridity as aridity increases the maximum level of livestock at which the system will switch to a state of acacia dominated landscape is reduced when the environmental conditions are extremely dry blue dots the system changes from showing alternative stable transition to displaying a continuous but abrupt transition sensitivity analyses conducted to evaluate the uncertainty around unknown parameters show that the point of collapse is highly sensitive to the parameterization of the livestock induced mortality livestock induced colonization parameters appendix a figs s1 s4 and facilitation parameters appendix a fig s5 nevertheless the presence of alternative stable states is observed under a large range of aridity and livestock pressure 3 2 spatial patterns and early warning signal the frequency distribution of patches in the landscape under different levels of livestock pressure shows the emergence of a clear warning signal before the system transitions to acacia panels a b and c of fig 3 show the landscape patterns before the system approaches the tipping point of imminent transition to savanna when the system is far from the tipping point forest patch size distribution closely matches the pl model i a i c 18 l 0 fig 3d f which means the frequency of patches of all sizes including the formation of very large ones are observed as the system gets closer to the critical point 18 l 26 no large patches are observed at this point the distribution that explains the forest patterns is now the tpl fig 3g thus as the system moves toward the tipping point the plausibility of the pl distribution in explaining the patterns is reduced but the plausibility of the tpl distribution increases fig 3g 3 3 livestock management results from simulating the management of the forest to acacia using rotational livestock illustrate that maintaining rotation schemes can influence the transient time before the forest collapses the results show that the frequency of the rotation influences the success of the strategy for example strategies with resting periods longer than 15 years but shorter than 22 years can maintain forest cover for longer periods fig 4b however not all the scenarios in that range ended in forest cover indicating that rotation alone cannot take the system out of the trajectory of collapse it only avoid collapse for a longer period nevertheless rotation schemes under the right frequency of resting and pressure can help to sustain a forest cover f œÅ l for longer time and they can modify the characteristics of the transition from abrupt to continuous fig 4a the effect of rotation on the signal that precedes the transition is presented in fig 4c and d with examples of the dynamics of the forest under different schemes of rotation the statistical early signals that emerge over time are higher when the system is close to collapse and they increase as the system gets closer fig 4d 4 discussion and conclusions the model presented in this work synthesizes the situation of the chilean matorral where a transition from forest to a savanna type environment dominated by the species acacia caven has occurred over the last 100 years and while efforts have been made to conceptualize the processes that led to this ecological transition pickett et al 1987 fuentes et al 1986 the present work can inform future conservation and restoration endeavors by providing a synthesis of the ecological interactions involved in this transition as a result the analyses conducted here provide a better understanding of the possible trajectories that the system can take under different environmental and management conditions the presence of alternative states reveals the importance of positive interactions and feedback between the biotic and abiotic systems as previously suggested by holmgren the system can present two alternative stable states one in which the state of a landscape is covered by forest and the other in which it is covered with acacia and grasses holmgren 2002 two ecological factors underlying the presence of the alternative states may explain the presence of abrupt collapses and deserve further discussion the first is the effect of local facilitation of forest it has been shown that a local facilitation process in the matorral known as the nursing effect generates spatial clustering of the matorral holmgren et al 1997 fuentes et al 1984 this nursing effect has long been recognized as an important mechanism for promoting the formation of patches in the matorral cuevas et al 2013 fuentes castillo et al 2012 and as shown here it can be a critical factor behind the signature of the transition to acacia the second mechanism is the indirect and positive effect of livestock on acacia colonization the positive influence of livestock in propelling successful colonization events of acacia speeds up the transition and reduces the possibility of recovery once the system crosses a threshold in the size of the acacia population fig 3c larger livestock populations generate wider dispersion of acacia seeds an advantage in colonization compared to forest species the influence of these large mammals also seems to be a key factor in driving the emergence of alternative states in the matorral an insight gained from the analyses presented here is that considering both the frequency of restoration periods and the signal of degradation can favor the persistence of the forest ecosystem for longer periods of time as both biotic and abiotic factors can preclude the emergence of alternative stable states when interacting k√©fi et al 2016 forest colonization and livestock disturbance are processes that operate at different spatial scales at a large scale livestock represents a well mixed disturbance process that influences each site in the same way forest colonization on the other hand is a local process regulated by facilitation and the fecundity of individuals from neighboring sites local recovery and well mixed disturbances then create conditions for the formation of patches whose sizes follow power law distributions that lack a specific scale when the system approaches the edge of transition as the system reaches the tipping point no large patches are observed at this point a truncated power law emerges as the best model these results mimic those of k√©fi et al 2007 where the power laws are observed far from the tipping point of transition but are maintained for a range of conditions before the system collapses these results show that the matorral resembles an ecosystem with robustness criticality pascual and guichard 2005 these are ecosystems that generate power law like patterns with a larger range of parameter values with local interactions and a melt down of large patches before extinction k√©fi et al 2011 the results from the model simulations including the position of the tipping point are sensitive to the influence of livestock herbivory before early warning systems can be incorporated into monitoring tools therefore empirical research is needed on the role of livestock pressure and other biotic and abiotic factors on the spatial patterns of the matorral forest studies that have investigated the linkage between livestock pressure and colonization henriquez and simonetti 2001 and the preference of livestock for particular species of the matorral paton et al 1997 azocar et al 1987 report important consequences for the recruitment of juveniles and the production of green biomass other biotic and abiotic factors can also influence the spatial patterns observed fuentes castillo et al 2012 topography is one example such that sun facing exposed hillside can affect seedling survival holmgren et al 2000b other studies have shown that dry conditions can influence the competition between adults and these conditions can vary with topography badano et al 2005 holmgren et al 2000a the distance at which seeds from individuals of the sclerophyllous can be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors can in turn affect the scale of the colonization process for instance the dispersion of seeds by birds can influence the spatial scale of colonization in the matorral however seed dispersion by birds is only an important contributor near bird perches which are located in large mature patches of forest fuentes et al 1986 finally human made fires can also significantly alter the seedling survival rate and growth holmgren et al 2000b all of these factors interact in complex ways and those can affect the spatial distribution of patches in semi desert regions meloni et al 2017 the model can be expanded to pose new hypotheses to understand how these factors may alter the presence of alternative stable states the tipping point and the spatial distribution of forest patches nevertheless the results presented here provide insights for conservation on their own first they provide evidence to suggest that the interaction between ecological processes acting at regional and local scales and pulses of resting can maintain the system for longer periods however the results also suggest that resting by itself is not enough more research is needed to identify management strategies that can take the system out of the trajectory of collapse when the system is already past the tipping point combining early information to recognize areas close to collapse should be an active area of empirical research in the chilean matorral as this research would provide valuable information for developing tailored conservation efforts in multi purpose landscapes especially when full protection status cannot be enforced therefore this information would be of importance if a policy that integrates feasible conservation strategies with economic benefits is pursued finally the northern boundary of the matorral region is strongly influenced by enso related rainfall variability that generates longer and more frequent droughts and intense rainfall seasons montecinos and aceituno 2003 these large scale climatic patterns will likely impact interannual variability of rainfall and therefore may increase the abundance of grasses and changes in seedling establishment holmgren et al 2006 which may then influence the possibility of changes in vegetation states holmgren et al have shown that environmental variability in this region can have a positive effect on vegetation patterns holmgren et al 2013 and their work supports the hypothesis that years of enso influence provide a window of opportunity for restoration as these events can increase mesic conditions management strategies that consider these climate patterns should continue to be a focus of investigation holmgren and scheffer 2001 theoretical studies for instance have demonstrated that small perturbations with pulses of replanted vegetation can prevent collapse in semi deserts even after the tipping point when the ecosystem is on a trajectory of collapse vidiella et al 2018 empirical studies in peru have shown how rainfall driven strategies for restoration can successfully be implemented sitters et al 2012 developing these management strategies in central chile should be an important and active area of research results from this type of research will be important for informing and monitoring the restoration and conservation efforts of the matorral the model would be helpful to further understand how the interannual variability of rainfall interacts with the ecological processes and management strategies to provide more tailored interventions making these parameters dynamic and interdependent in the model e g l t f œï t i a i c can help in the exploration of such strategies in conclusion this work aimed to provide a spatial and dynamic modeling perspective on the ecological mechanisms that have fostered the transition to an acacia dominated environment and the emergent patterns that can shed light on early signals of degradation the results suggest that the system can show abrupt collapses and alternative stable states the signals of this transition in the landscape should be of relevance in the development of conservation plans to prevent the transition however the results are highly sensitive to the effect of acacia colonization which in turn is influenced by livestock related parameters therefore it is concluded that long term research linking forest dynamics to livestock pressure is needed however the results also indicate that incorporating strategies for livestock management is not enough especially in highly degraded forest landscapes livestock control must be integrated with restoration plans considering regional climate patterns combining both will open opportunities for conservation in shared human forest landscapes a future use of the model should be to evaluate integrated conservation strategies that consider indicators of forest collapse livestock management

25179,semi desert areas are sensitive to changes in rainfall and agricultural pressure prone to abrupt changes and to the collapse of ecological functions the sclerophyllous evergreen forest of central chile known as matorral has been extensively overgrazed by domestic livestock as a consequence the native and endemic species of this forest community have been replaced by a savanna type environment dominated by the species acacia caven known as espinales it has been hypothesized that the collapse of matorral forest can be abrupt and the two ecosystems represent two alternative stable states to understand the ecological dynamics that occur during this transition their signature in space and the consequences of livestock management a cellular automata model that considers the local interaction among forest vegetation acacia and livestock management was developed by simulating and analyzing the process of fragmentation in space and time in a gradient of livestock pressure and aridity the results show that the system exhibits properties of robust criticality with a shift of patch size distributions from models matching power laws to models matching truncated power laws as livestock pressure increases nearby the point of collapse simulation results in scenarios with rotation of livestock at the tipping point reveal the interaction between resting frequency and forest conservation these results provide information to design better management strategies in human modified landscapes in the remaining chilean matorral keywords acacia caven alternative ecosystem states ecosystem shift matorral robust criticality 1 introduction semi desert areas cover more than 41 of the surface of the planet and sustain 2 billion people via agriculture and livestock these are ecological systems highly vulnerable to climate and human induced changes as a consequence these environments have been largely degraded millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 grazing and browsing pressure from livestock along with extensive droughts and heavy rains are the major drivers of degradation in semi desert areas more than 70 of the total pastoral terrain and rangeland in semi desert areas has been somehow degraded millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 obtaining early warning indicators that can provide timely information about the condition of the ecological functions in semi desert ecosystems is critical for developing a new generation of preventive rangeland management strategies reynolds et al 2007 early warning indicators of transitions are clues provided by the spatial and temporal structure of systems in ecological systems these clues inform us of the possibility that the ecological functions of the system are close to a point of transition or collapse scheffer 2010 scheffer et al 2012 in recent years several studies have formalized the type of information that needs to be obtained from ecological systems to understand and predict these critical transitions and new rigorous statistical tools have been developed to detect early signals k√©fi et al 2014 yet there is still an important gap in the literature in terms of how to incorporate this information into management strategies that can improve conservation and restoration in landscapes shared by human activities and natural ecosystems k√©fi et al 2011 in semi desert environments clues about the spatial structure of vegetation are associated with the formation of patches of different sizes k√©fi et al 2007 the lack of water in semi desert environments generates harsh conditions for plants to germinate in bare soil far from the shade of adult vegetation some trees and bushes are more likely to germinate close to other plants which facilitates the growth of juveniles from a spatial scale larger than individual plants it is possible to observe patches of vegetation of different sizes while the complexity of the ecological interactions make generalization of early warning signals challenging moreno de las heras et al 2011 theoretical studies at local scales with test plots in areas of mediterranean semi deserts have shown that the patch size distributions relationship between the patch sizes of a system and their frequencies change from closely resembling power law like patterns i e there are many small patches and only few that are very large to truncated power laws similar to power laws but lacking the largest patch sizes when the system approaches a point of imminent collapse k√©fi et al 2007 studies at regional scales have confirmed the melting of the power law like patterns in ecosystems associated with the loss of function and processes of desertification berdugo et al 2017 in the semi arid region of central chile the landscape has been dominated by a dense evergreen forest known as matorral the matorral is composed primarily of perennial sclerophyllous trees such as peumus boldus boldo cryptocarya alba peumo and quillaja saponaria quillay as well as woody sclerophyllous scrubs small trees such as cassia coquimbensis schinus polygamous and litrea caustica gajardo 1994 over the last 100 years this forest has been extensively reduced more than 80 of the native and highly endemic vegetation has been depleted fuentes and simonetti 1981 fuentes et al 1986 holmgren 2002 the fall of the forest gave rise to a savanna like type of environment dominated by the species acacia caven known as espinales fuentes et al 1989 ovalle et al 1996 between 1975 and 2009 more than 45 of the land covered by forest has transitioned to espinales van de wouw et al 2011 today acacia trees are the most common species in central chile ovalle et al 1990 according to the literature and fieldwork herbivory and pastoralism activities have played a key role in this transition and the transformation from forest to savanna has been mostly human induced due to overgrazing and browsing by large livestock mammals goats and cows the introduction of invasive species rabbits and land clearing for agriculture and mining fuentes et al 1989 1986 1983 pickett et al 1987 first the presence of livestock influences vegetation dynamics by increasing mortality changing species composition and decreasing biodiversity livestock grazing induces soil compaction which subsequently can increase rainfall runoff soil erosion and finally the depletion of nutrients in the soil silva et al 1978 second the presence of domestic livestock has an indirect benefit on the colonization of acacia caven specifically acacia trees provide succulent pods that are eaten by livestock and in return germination is facilitated the distance of seed dispersal increases and acacia intraspecific competition is reduced this ecological mechanism thus creates an advantage for acacia over the native vegetation in livestock dominated landscapes holmgren 2002 armesto and pickett 1985 significant distinctions exist between these two ecosystems as mentioned above forest coverage is highly dense acacia dominated environments on the other hand are characterized by large open areas with sparse vegetation coverage and low biodiversity ovalle et al 1996 fuentes et al 1989 bahre 1979 an important ecological characteristic of the matorral forest is the role of local positive interactions between species the colonization success of seeds inside the forest is facilitated by the presence of nearby sclerophyllous vegetation which helps reduce water loss in a water limited environment fuentes et al 1984 dry summers and short rainfall seasons characterize the climate of this region the long and dry summers combined with long lasting droughts generate adverse conditions for seedlings from sclerophyllous species adult plants near seedlings can create favorable microclimatic conditions that help the soil retain moisture and reduce its temperature in summers cares et al 2013 these local conditions provide a nursing effect fuentes et al 1984 that facilitates the successful establishment of young trees and shrubs cuevas et al 2013 jim√©nez and armesto 1992 fuentes et al 1984 the interaction of the biotic effect of local facilitation and the abiotic effect of rainfall plays an important role in the persistence of seedlings low rainfall availability especially at sites with high exposure to sunlight generates more arid conditions recurrent and prolonged droughts reduce seedling recruitment of many species holmgren et al 2001 intense rainfall on the other hand causes soil erosion and nutrient runoff that negatively affect soil fertility the two ecosystems in the desert region of chile sclerophyllous and acacia dominated communities are considered to be two alternative stable states with hysteresis holmgren 2002 this implies that if the forest crosses a threshold of degradation it can collapse to a savanna environment without the possibility of a fast recovery in this region therefore a system for the development of early indicators of the transition is an important management tool needed to support the conservation and restoration of the remaining matorral ecosystems holmgren et al 2006 while previous studies have provided a framework to consider the interaction among forest acacia and management holmgren 2002 armesto and pickett 1985 so far there has not been an attempt to simulate the dynamics of the transition and the ecological interactions within the same analytical framework the purpose of this work is therefore to explore the mechanisms of disturbance that may play a role in promoting the transition of the chilean matorral to savanna and to investigate the interaction between the signals of degradation and the management of the system the forest community of central chile has a type of semi desert vegetation that is prone to forming patchy landscapes composed of woody vegetation and several studies have confirmed the fragility of the system when faced with human perturbation furthermore recent studies have investigated the local interaction within the system and the possibility of detecting these changes based on spatially explicit information associated with the patchiness of the vegetation fuentes castillo et al 2012 therefore this work proposes an important model for investigating the interaction between the signals of degradation and their association with conservation and management efforts a type of environmental management that could benefit from incorporating this information is the use of rotational and resting strategies rotational and resting schemes or multi paddock grazing strategies involve rotating livestock to distribute the grazing pressure over large areas the use of multi paddock rotation systems hart et al 1988 is a widely used strategy by pastoral communities around the world briske et al 2008 and it involves the movement of animals from one paddock to another for the sake of providing resting time for vegetation biomass to regenerate two important properties of multi paddock rotation management are 1 the number of animals to be moved and 2 the time required to do so hart et al 1988 three specific questions guide this research 1 under what conditions of aridity and livestock pressure are the two alternative stable states more likely to be observed 2 what kind of spatial patterns and early indicators of transition emerge as the system transitions to savanna 3 how do rotational management strategies influence the likelihood of this transition to provide insight into these questions a cellular automata model was developed to simulate the birth death process of sclerophyllous vegetation and acacia in the chilean matorral the model was then simulated in a gradient of aridity and livestock pressure and under different strategies of rotation to investigate the trajectories of the forest under different pulses of livestock pressure 2 methods the model a cellular automata is a type of spatially explicit model that allows for the incorporation of local ecological interactions into models of population and community dynamics using a discrete set of sites and discrete time steps balzter et al 1998 durrett and levin 1994 hogeweg 1988 here the cellular automata approach is used to simulate the dynamics of a landscape composed of four land types a bare soil type d annual grasses g acacia a and forest f fig 1 in each time step t the probability that a site will change from one state to another is determined by the state of the nearest neighbors which are defined as the sites in radius 1 within a moore neighborhood structure the possible land type transitions are depicted in fig 1 the model includes the influence of livestock pressure represented by symbol l and the effect of aridity or lack of rainfall œï livestock pressure influences the mortality rates and aridity influences colonization rates livestock pressure additionally influences the rate of colonization of acacia individuals the model assumes that the colonization of woody plants a f only occurs in land that already support grasses that is g t a t 1 and g t f t 1 thus land type g represents land with soil nutrients and water to support the growth and establishment of woody vegetation state d symbolizes an opposite land type one whose soil lacks nutrients and water thus restoration in the model implies the establishment of annual grasses in bare soil that is d t g t 1 aridity œï can thus be interpreted as the effect of dry conditions on the loss of soil and biomass due to lack of water the model was implemented in a square lattice of 200 200 sites with periodic boundary conditions and synchronous monthly updating with the size of each site representing 1 square meter in sections 2 1 2 3 the transition rates of the birth and death processes colonization and mortality of the model are formalized and the numerical experiments conducted to examine the transition are described along with presentation of the statistical analyses conducted to detect early warning indicators figs 2 and 3 2 1 transition rates in the cellular automata 2 1 1 grass colonization a d s i t e can only be recolonized by grasses this transition occurs at rate Œ≥ g 1 œï r f a g q w d where Œ≥ g is the grass colonization rate dependent on the natural seeding rate r and the effect of facilitation f a g q w d facilitation represents an increase in the probability that grass will colonize a site when it is surrounded by any type of woody vegetation that is w a f thus q d a is the fraction of a sites sites in the neighborhood of a site in state d by convention qxy is defined as the fraction of y sites sites in the surrounding neighborhood of an x site the factor 1 œï represents the negative effect of dryness or aridity on the recruitment of new individuals 2 1 2 forest and acacia colonization the model assumes that a g site can be colonized by either a seedling individual of acacia or sclerophyllous forest this process is dictated by the colonization rate of acacia Œ≥ f and forest Œ≥ f for acacia the rate is formally defined as Œ≥ a 1 œï Œ≤ a 1 d q a g d f l œÅ a where Œ≤ a is the per capita production of acacia seeds q a g is the proportion of a sites surrounding a g site œÅ a is the global fraction of a sites parameter d represents the proportion of seeds that get dispersed from other sites in the landscape finally f l represents a function that connects the density of livestock with the colonization success of acacia in a positive way f l l l l where l is the number of animals in the landscape and l is the so called half saturation constant this parameter can be interpreted as the number of animals needed for acacia seeds to reach any site in the landscape with 50 chance the function f l behaves linearly for low values of livestock and it saturates for larger values since lim l f l 1 as for the forest colonization rate Œ≥ f this is defined as Œ≥ f 1 œï Œ≤ f f f f q g f where Œ≤ f is the seeding rate q g f is the proportion of f sites in the neighborhood of a g site and f f f is the facilitation effect parameter of forest on the colonization success of forest individuals this colonization rate thus assumes that forest colonization is strictly localized facilitated by f sites fuentes et al 1986 and negatively influenced by aridity œï 2 1 3 mortality grass and forest mortality are functions that depend on the intrinsic and density independent mortality of a plant mg mf and on the browsing and grazing pressure per livestock m l x such that m x m x m x l l where m x is the rate at which an x site with x g f transitions to state d m x is the natural mortality rate and m x l is the livestock induced mortality rate m x l represents the per capita effect of livestock on vegetation due to direct ingestion of plant tissue or indirect effects from the myriad processes of degradation that accompany pastoralist activities the model assumes that livestock pressure on vegetation mortality is equal across the landscape in the case of acacia it has been shown that its mortality is affected by intraspecific competition that is competition among acacia caven trees navarro 1995 to capture this effect the model includes a density dependent mechanism that controls the mortality rate of acacia based on local density q a a such that m a m a 1 c q a a m a l l where c q a a is the increase in mortality due to the local density of acacia 2 2 parameterization the range of parameters used in the simulations were derived when possible from available literature for those parameters without available information local and global sensitivity analyses were conducted results of these analyses are presented in appendix a these values are presented in table 1 and additional information about the studies from which parameters were derived is presented in appendix a 2 3 numerical experiments and analysis of early warning indicators the exploration of the model begins by considering the ecological dynamics of the matorral in a gradient of aridity and livestock pressure over a period of time t years 100 simulations were conducted in a landscape representing 4 hectares thus each site denotes 1 square meter and the landscape is composed of 200 200 sites each simulation was evaluated for a livestock population size in the range l 1 40 and aridity œï 0 2 1 to identify alternative stable states each scenario resulting from combining a value of œï and l was evaluated using different initial conditions of the proportion of forest and acacia specifically for a particular simulation i with parameters œï i l i the initial conditions of the landscape are defined by d i 0 g i 0 0 1 f i 0 Œµ i and a i 0 1 Œµ i for Œµ i 0 1 0 7 and i 1 100 to increase the likelihood that the system would reach a stable state each simulation was run for t 500 years which is sufficient time for most of the scenarios of livestock and aridity to reach this state given the parameter values of colonization and mortality for initial conditions of low forest and low livestock pressure the system can take substantial computational time to reach a stable state in those cases the simulations were conducted for t 1000 years however this increment in time does not ensure that the system will reach a stable state in all of the simulations the final state of the landscape that is the proportion of land occupied by each possible state at time t t was recorded in each simulation along with the final spatial configuration 2 3 1 patch size distribution here the null hypothesis stating that the frequency distribution of forest patches at the point of imminent transition to acacia will appear to come from a truncated power law distribution model is presented and tested using the simulation results formally the patch size distribution of forest is defined as p x x Œ± x x m i n where in this case x is the size of each patch of forest and p x is the frequency of patches of size x Œ± is a constant of proportionality the power law relationship generally holds for some values greater than x m i n parameter Œ± needs to be estimated as well as x m i n to test this hypothesis the number of patches and their sizes were recorded at the end of each simulation a patch in the model is defined as a set of sites in the forest state that share at least one side assuming each patch is square and each site has four sides the size of the patch is the total number of sites using this information the patch size frequency is constructed and the frequency of the patch sizes were fitted to a pl model obtained for a range of simulations in a gradient of livestock pressure to illustrate how this transition changes depending on the number of animals present the methods for estimating the parameters of the distribution models and conducting the statistical analyses were obtained from the package powerlaw implemented in the statistical software r r core team 2013 and based on the work of clauset et al 2009 as the system approaches the tipping point the destruction of large patches will generate a smaller range of patch sizes k√©fi et al 2007 2011 such distributions may be defined as truncated power laws which are power laws with an exponential cut off that prevents the existence of big patches its formulation reads p x x Œ± e Œª x where Œª is a decay parameter of an exponential function e Œª x for low values of x the behavior is dominated by power law and for large values the exponential function dominates in the same gradient of livestock pressure the pl model is compared against the tpl model based on the akaike information criteria a i c which is a function that considers the log likelihood of the model fit and the number of parameters of the model formally an index of plausibility of the pl model versus the tpl model was constructed i a i c l a i c p l l a i c t p l l a i c p l l a i c t p l l in this way the plausibility of each model relative to the other can be visually examined for different values of l the level of livestock pressure at which one more individual will make the forest collapse was recorded and labeled as l 2 3 2 rotational schemes to evaluate the effect of rotational schemes numerical experiments were conducted in which the effect of livestock was suppressed for a period of œÅ years after which the livestock population was re introduced for the same number of years thus a scheme of œÅ 5 implies that the paddock landscape will be affected by livestock for five consecutive years and then unaffected for the next five years and so on the experiment simulated scenarios that assume an initial condition with abundant forest cover f 0 0 7 and low levels of acacia a 0 0 1 first 20 simulations were conducted within a range of rotational periods œÅ with œÅ 2 35 years for a landscape with the level of livestock pressure at which the system is at the tipping point l 27 for œï 0 at time t 1000 the percentage of landscape in state forest was obtained with f œÅ l 1 t d t t d t t f t where d 2 max œÅ is used to include the full variation of f t for any scheme from this experiment the range in the frequency of rotation in which f 0 was identified fig 4 b using œÅ 18 years the precence of the alternative states were compared in a range of livestock pressure l 1 50 results of this comparison are presented in fig 4a examples of the resulting dynamics of forest under two rotation schemes are represented in the time series in fig 4c along with those time series the value of aic i was calculated to evaluate how the signal changes over time 3 results 3 1 alternative stable states simulations of the model under different levels of aridity and livestock pressure show the presence of alternative stable states fig 2 illustrates the presence of two alternative stable states forest dominated environment f 0 and acacia dominated environment f 0 in the figure the livestock pressure that takes the system from forest to acacia that is the tipping point changes under different levels of aridity as aridity increases the maximum level of livestock at which the system will switch to a state of acacia dominated landscape is reduced when the environmental conditions are extremely dry blue dots the system changes from showing alternative stable transition to displaying a continuous but abrupt transition sensitivity analyses conducted to evaluate the uncertainty around unknown parameters show that the point of collapse is highly sensitive to the parameterization of the livestock induced mortality livestock induced colonization parameters appendix a figs s1 s4 and facilitation parameters appendix a fig s5 nevertheless the presence of alternative stable states is observed under a large range of aridity and livestock pressure 3 2 spatial patterns and early warning signal the frequency distribution of patches in the landscape under different levels of livestock pressure shows the emergence of a clear warning signal before the system transitions to acacia panels a b and c of fig 3 show the landscape patterns before the system approaches the tipping point of imminent transition to savanna when the system is far from the tipping point forest patch size distribution closely matches the pl model i a i c 18 l 0 fig 3d f which means the frequency of patches of all sizes including the formation of very large ones are observed as the system gets closer to the critical point 18 l 26 no large patches are observed at this point the distribution that explains the forest patterns is now the tpl fig 3g thus as the system moves toward the tipping point the plausibility of the pl distribution in explaining the patterns is reduced but the plausibility of the tpl distribution increases fig 3g 3 3 livestock management results from simulating the management of the forest to acacia using rotational livestock illustrate that maintaining rotation schemes can influence the transient time before the forest collapses the results show that the frequency of the rotation influences the success of the strategy for example strategies with resting periods longer than 15 years but shorter than 22 years can maintain forest cover for longer periods fig 4b however not all the scenarios in that range ended in forest cover indicating that rotation alone cannot take the system out of the trajectory of collapse it only avoid collapse for a longer period nevertheless rotation schemes under the right frequency of resting and pressure can help to sustain a forest cover f œÅ l for longer time and they can modify the characteristics of the transition from abrupt to continuous fig 4a the effect of rotation on the signal that precedes the transition is presented in fig 4c and d with examples of the dynamics of the forest under different schemes of rotation the statistical early signals that emerge over time are higher when the system is close to collapse and they increase as the system gets closer fig 4d 4 discussion and conclusions the model presented in this work synthesizes the situation of the chilean matorral where a transition from forest to a savanna type environment dominated by the species acacia caven has occurred over the last 100 years and while efforts have been made to conceptualize the processes that led to this ecological transition pickett et al 1987 fuentes et al 1986 the present work can inform future conservation and restoration endeavors by providing a synthesis of the ecological interactions involved in this transition as a result the analyses conducted here provide a better understanding of the possible trajectories that the system can take under different environmental and management conditions the presence of alternative states reveals the importance of positive interactions and feedback between the biotic and abiotic systems as previously suggested by holmgren the system can present two alternative stable states one in which the state of a landscape is covered by forest and the other in which it is covered with acacia and grasses holmgren 2002 two ecological factors underlying the presence of the alternative states may explain the presence of abrupt collapses and deserve further discussion the first is the effect of local facilitation of forest it has been shown that a local facilitation process in the matorral known as the nursing effect generates spatial clustering of the matorral holmgren et al 1997 fuentes et al 1984 this nursing effect has long been recognized as an important mechanism for promoting the formation of patches in the matorral cuevas et al 2013 fuentes castillo et al 2012 and as shown here it can be a critical factor behind the signature of the transition to acacia the second mechanism is the indirect and positive effect of livestock on acacia colonization the positive influence of livestock in propelling successful colonization events of acacia speeds up the transition and reduces the possibility of recovery once the system crosses a threshold in the size of the acacia population fig 3c larger livestock populations generate wider dispersion of acacia seeds an advantage in colonization compared to forest species the influence of these large mammals also seems to be a key factor in driving the emergence of alternative states in the matorral an insight gained from the analyses presented here is that considering both the frequency of restoration periods and the signal of degradation can favor the persistence of the forest ecosystem for longer periods of time as both biotic and abiotic factors can preclude the emergence of alternative stable states when interacting k√©fi et al 2016 forest colonization and livestock disturbance are processes that operate at different spatial scales at a large scale livestock represents a well mixed disturbance process that influences each site in the same way forest colonization on the other hand is a local process regulated by facilitation and the fecundity of individuals from neighboring sites local recovery and well mixed disturbances then create conditions for the formation of patches whose sizes follow power law distributions that lack a specific scale when the system approaches the edge of transition as the system reaches the tipping point no large patches are observed at this point a truncated power law emerges as the best model these results mimic those of k√©fi et al 2007 where the power laws are observed far from the tipping point of transition but are maintained for a range of conditions before the system collapses these results show that the matorral resembles an ecosystem with robustness criticality pascual and guichard 2005 these are ecosystems that generate power law like patterns with a larger range of parameter values with local interactions and a melt down of large patches before extinction k√©fi et al 2011 the results from the model simulations including the position of the tipping point are sensitive to the influence of livestock herbivory before early warning systems can be incorporated into monitoring tools therefore empirical research is needed on the role of livestock pressure and other biotic and abiotic factors on the spatial patterns of the matorral forest studies that have investigated the linkage between livestock pressure and colonization henriquez and simonetti 2001 and the preference of livestock for particular species of the matorral paton et al 1997 azocar et al 1987 report important consequences for the recruitment of juveniles and the production of green biomass other biotic and abiotic factors can also influence the spatial patterns observed fuentes castillo et al 2012 topography is one example such that sun facing exposed hillside can affect seedling survival holmgren et al 2000b other studies have shown that dry conditions can influence the competition between adults and these conditions can vary with topography badano et al 2005 holmgren et al 2000a the distance at which seeds from individuals of the sclerophyllous can be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors can in turn affect the scale of the colonization process for instance the dispersion of seeds by birds can influence the spatial scale of colonization in the matorral however seed dispersion by birds is only an important contributor near bird perches which are located in large mature patches of forest fuentes et al 1986 finally human made fires can also significantly alter the seedling survival rate and growth holmgren et al 2000b all of these factors interact in complex ways and those can affect the spatial distribution of patches in semi desert regions meloni et al 2017 the model can be expanded to pose new hypotheses to understand how these factors may alter the presence of alternative stable states the tipping point and the spatial distribution of forest patches nevertheless the results presented here provide insights for conservation on their own first they provide evidence to suggest that the interaction between ecological processes acting at regional and local scales and pulses of resting can maintain the system for longer periods however the results also suggest that resting by itself is not enough more research is needed to identify management strategies that can take the system out of the trajectory of collapse when the system is already past the tipping point combining early information to recognize areas close to collapse should be an active area of empirical research in the chilean matorral as this research would provide valuable information for developing tailored conservation efforts in multi purpose landscapes especially when full protection status cannot be enforced therefore this information would be of importance if a policy that integrates feasible conservation strategies with economic benefits is pursued finally the northern boundary of the matorral region is strongly influenced by enso related rainfall variability that generates longer and more frequent droughts and intense rainfall seasons montecinos and aceituno 2003 these large scale climatic patterns will likely impact interannual variability of rainfall and therefore may increase the abundance of grasses and changes in seedling establishment holmgren et al 2006 which may then influence the possibility of changes in vegetation states holmgren et al have shown that environmental variability in this region can have a positive effect on vegetation patterns holmgren et al 2013 and their work supports the hypothesis that years of enso influence provide a window of opportunity for restoration as these events can increase mesic conditions management strategies that consider these climate patterns should continue to be a focus of investigation holmgren and scheffer 2001 theoretical studies for instance have demonstrated that small perturbations with pulses of replanted vegetation can prevent collapse in semi deserts even after the tipping point when the ecosystem is on a trajectory of collapse vidiella et al 2018 empirical studies in peru have shown how rainfall driven strategies for restoration can successfully be implemented sitters et al 2012 developing these management strategies in central chile should be an important and active area of research results from this type of research will be important for informing and monitoring the restoration and conservation efforts of the matorral the model would be helpful to further understand how the interannual variability of rainfall interacts with the ecological processes and management strategies to provide more tailored interventions making these parameters dynamic and interdependent in the model e g l t f œï t i a i c can help in the exploration of such strategies in conclusion this work aimed to provide a spatial and dynamic modeling perspective on the ecological mechanisms that have fostered the transition to an acacia dominated environment and the emergent patterns that can shed light on early signals of degradation the results suggest that the system can show abrupt collapses and alternative stable states the signals of this transition in the landscape should be of relevance in the development of conservation plans to prevent the transition however the results are highly sensitive to the effect of acacia colonization which in turn is influenced by livestock related parameters therefore it is concluded that long term research linking forest dynamics to livestock pressure is needed however the results also indicate that incorporating strategies for livestock management is not enough especially in highly degraded forest landscapes livestock control must be integrated with restoration plans considering regional climate patterns combining both will open opportunities for conservation in shared human forest landscapes a future use of the model should be to evaluate integrated conservation strategies that consider indicators of forest collapse livestock management
