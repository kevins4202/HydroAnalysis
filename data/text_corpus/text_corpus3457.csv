17285,during decay the sediment microenvironment and water quality are severely affected by excessive proliferation of harmful algae such as filamentous green algae fga the frequency of this fga is increased through global warming and water eutrophication in the present study the degradation processes of a common advantage fga cladophora oligoclora and its effect on nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient structure and bacterial community composition at the sediment water interface were investigated by stable isotope labelling and high throughput sequencing the results showed that the decomposition process of c oligoclona was fast stable and difficult to degrade the changes in sediment δ15n values reached 66 68 on day 40 which indicated that some of the nitrogen had migrated to the sediment from c oligoclona litter tn and nh4 n in the overlying water rapidly increased between days 0 10 nh4 n rose to 78 21 of tn on day 40 resulting in severe pollution of ammonia in the overlying water the nitrogen forms and contents in the sediment are mainly derived from the increasing ammonia nitrogen release the tp and ip in the overlying water increased to the highest concentrations of 6 68 0 64 6 59 0 79 mg l 1 during the decomposition process respectively resulting in the migration of phosphate to the sediments with increasing phosphorus content the abundance of the main dominant bacterial communities such as acinetobacter 0 08 62 48 and pseudomonas 0 13 20 36 in sediments and overlying water has changed significantly the correlation analysis results suggested that the phosphorus was mainly related to the bacterial community in the overlying water while the various forms of nitrogen demonstrated a high relevance with the bacterial community in the sediment our research results will be valuable in evaluating the potential ecological risk of fga decomposition and provide scientific support for shallow lake management and submerged vegetation restoration

introduction in the context of global climate change eutrophication is accelerating to become a serious threat to global water security the increase in nutrient input and inorganic carbon sources resulted in the dense biomass of epiphytes and phytoplankton richardson et al 2018 in particular filamentous green algae fga can proliferate in large numbers to form a population advantage el shoubaky 2013 for example the over proliferation of cladophora is already a widespread global problem it is commonly reported in many regions such as east siberia lake baikal the united states laurentian great lakes united kingdom little budworth pool indonesia the philippines australia japan and the baltic region higgins et al 2008 timoshkin et al 2016 such an increase not only accelerates the degradation of lakes but also introduces a series of new ecological problems fga can form a dense algal mat for excessive proliferation which often causes shading hypoxia and interference in the substance circulation zhang et al 2020 decayed fga also adversely affects the growth and metabolism of submerged macrophytes and their propagators and seedlings zhang et al 2018a furthermore the nutrients released by decayed fga would cause abnormal proliferation of algae and aggravate the change from a clean water state to a turbid state the decomposition capacity of plants is related to the c n p content or c n p mass ratio su et al 2016 species with high decomposition rates usually show high initial n and p contents and low initial c n c p and n p ratios xiao et al 2017 moreover the degradation process of plant litter is also correlated with the physical and chemical conditions and microbial activities in the water environment research has shown that the initial litter degradation is affected by ambient temperature ph and nutrient availability lemley et al 2014 the sediment water interface swi is the main site for fga decay in which coupling of organic matter between geochemical cycles and biological systems could occur kinsman costello et al 2017 most of the unutilised nitrogen phosphorus and plant litters during plant decay are deposited in the subsoil and nutrient accumulation in surface sediments is usually several times higher than that in the water column zhou et al 2016 the exchange of nitrogen and phosphorus in swi is the primary method to regulate the flow of nutrients from the sediment to the water column liu et al 2019 in this process the nutrients released by the sediment first exist in the intermediate medium interstitial water and then diffuse into the upper water column under a concentration gradient through migration and transformation zhang et al 2013 different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus have different biological effects and can directly affect the absorption and utilisation of primary productivity for instance nitrate and ammonium are the primary inorganic nitrogen forms available to phytoplankton and plants ortigosa et al 2020 an appropriate amount of ammonium can promote phytoplankton and plant growth however an excess of ammonium can cause phytotoxicity setien et al 2013 such as destroying the chloroplast ultrastructure and carbon skeleton which disrupts the balance of c n yu et al 2017 the flux rate of nutrients in different forms showed significant temporal and spatial variation in different aquatic systems under the influence of ph hypoxia hydrodynamics and other environmental factors boynton et al 2018 in addition to environmental factors microorganisms also affect the distribution of nutrients between sediments and overlying water the effective aerobic degradation of organic matter by aerobic microorganisms would be replaced by inefficient fermentation degradation of anaerobic bacteria under anoxic conditions mckew et al 2013 a few studies on the decomposition of fga have analysed the effect of nutrient cycling on the formation of marine red tides wang et al 2012 the changes in element composition and decomposition products peller et al 2014 and the effects on phosphorus release from sediments gao et al 2013 however there remains a lack of research on the specific decomposition characteristics of fga compared with advanced hydrophytes the specific surface area of fga is larger and attaching decomposing microorganisms and protozoa is easier the nutrient elements and cellulose content are also higher making the study of the key nutrient migration and transformation in the decomposition process of fga and its biogeochemical effects particularly relevant from a comprehensive perspective analysis regarding the above theoretical basis we hypothesised that under certain conditions the fga released different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients into the water column and migrated to the sediment during the decomposition process which was accompanied by changes in the physical and chemical properties of the microenvironment at the swi in this study the stable isotope 13c and 15n tracers and different forms of nutrients were used to analyse the migration and transformation of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sediment overlying water system during the decomposition of cladophora oligoclora high throughput sequencing technology was used to explore further the changes in bacterial community structure in the overlying water and sediment the main research objectives are as follows 1 to examine the effect of the decomposition process on the carbon and nitrogen nutrition structure of sediments 2 to analyse the migration and transformation of nutrients in different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sediment overlying water system during decomposition 3 to reveal the response of the microbial community structure change in overlying water and sediment during decomposition this research will clarify the effects of the fga decomposition process on the microenvironments of swi and reveal its potential ecological threats to the restoration of submerged macrophytes these results will be important for shallow lake management and submerged vegetation restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation of isotopic labelled samples fresh cladophora oligoclora was collected from the donghu lake wuhan china 30 55 n 114 36e water samples and sediments were collected simultaneously the water sample was filtered using a 1 2 μm whatman filter to remove particulate matter while the sediment was sieved using an 80 mesh sieve to remove impurities such as shellfish animal and plant litters the clean c oligoclora was cultured in bg11 medium containing 0 1 mm na15no3 and 0 5 mm nah13co3 at 2000 lx light intensity 25 c and a 12 12 h photoperiod for preparation of isotopically labelled samples c oligoclora would be taken out from the culture system when the adsorption of carbon and nitrogen isotopes reached a stable state after 240 h the samples were lyophilised and preserved for subsequent experiments 2 2 experimental design and operation water samples and sediments from the east lake were deposited in the 21 aquariums 14 cm 19 cm 30 cm the sediment was 15 cm and the overlying water was

isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo usa and inductively coupled plasma icp method respectively the surface sediments 0 3 cm below the sediment overlying water were collected at each

same time the collected surface sediment samples were subjected to pre treatments such as drying and grinding to determine δ13c and δ15n fifty millilitres of the collected surficial sediments were centrifuged for 15 min at a speed of 5000 r min 1 and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane pes jinteng china to obtain interstitial water tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n tp and ip

high throughput sequencing were performed according to the approach described by xu et al 2017 and analysed using the illumina miseq platform at shanghai sangon biotech co ltd after sequencing was completed each sample sequence was distinguished by barcode and quality control was performed for each sample sequence 2 4 data analysis the mean values of data and standard error are expressed as the mean sd of three replicate measurements spss 23 0 software was used for all statistical analyses one way anova was performed to analyse the differences in dynamic changes in physical and chemical

used for the comparison between sample groups in order to understand the effects of environmental factors on the bacterial community and its dominant bacterial species during the decomposition process of c oligoclora the rda method was used to perform redundant analysis with ph do toc cond tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n tp and ip as ten environmental factors the results would show the information about the seven effective environmental factors before ranking all charts were drawn using origin 9 0 3 results 3 1 changes of ph do cond and toc in overlying water and sediment the distributions of ph do cond and toc in the overlying water and sediment are shown in fig 1 the ph of the overlying water decreased to the lowest value 6 85 0 07 in the early stage of decomposition and there was a significant upward trend p 0 001 anova in contrast to the overlying water the ph of the sediment was relatively stable in the early stage and increased to the maximum at day 40 fig 1a do decreased sharply for c oligoclora decomposition in the water column and reached the anaerobic state 0 2 mg l 1 at day 5 p 0 001 anova fig 1b cond showed the same tendency to first increase before decreasing with time in the overlying water and sediment p 0 001 p 0 001 anova the final cond values of both the overlying water and sediment increased 1 58 and 2 58 fold than that at day 0 respectively fig 1c the toc concentration in the overlying water reached the highest value at day 5 33 37 3 79 mg l 1 p 0 001 anova and there were no significant differences in sediments fig 1d 3 2 the decomposition dynamic characteristics and its relationship with n p c of c oligoclora the results showed that the decomposition rate reached the highest value 0 17 0 01 d 1 at day 3 and then decreased to 0 05 0 08 d 1 from day 5 to day 20 and finally became 0 03 0 00 d 1 at day 40 fig 2 a from the change in the remaining biomass the decomposition process can be divided into three phases fig 2b stage ⅰ pre decomposition 0 5 days the weight loss of c oligoclora was very rapid reaching 44 41 at day 5 the results indicated that the n content decreased to 87 86 of the initial n content at day 5 fig 2c and the n content in stage i showed a significant positive correlation with the remaining biomass r 0 835 p 0 05 3d r 0 782 p 0 05 day 5 fig 2d correspondingly the c n value increased to 12 39 at day 5 fig 2c which negatively correlated with the remaining biomass r 0 984 p 0 01 in addition c p and n p in stage i were highly negatively correlated with the remaining biomass p 0 01 p 0 01 and p content showed a highly positive correlation p 0 01 stage ii 5 20 days was the main stage of the biomass loss of c oligoclora on day 20 the remaining biomass decreased to 38 59 of the initial biomass indicating that more than 50 of the biomass was lost however there was no correlation between the n content and the remaining biomass in stage ii the c n also showed a high negative correlation and a significant negative correlation only at days 10 and 15 r 0 756 p 0 01 r 0 577 p 0 05 the p content increased slightly and had a highly negative correlation with the remaining biomass stage ⅲ 20 40 days late decaying phase the residual biomass loss and decomposition rate gradually flattened at this stage the c content decreased the n content continued to increase and the c n ratio decreased there was no correlation between c n and the remaining biomass the p content has a consistently increasing trend with the n content and a highly positive correlation with the remaining biomass c p and n p also showed a highly negative correlation 3 3 δ13c and δ15n changes in sediments and c oligoclora the carbon stable isotope δ13c value of c oligoclora during the pre decomposition and middle period 0 10 days continued to decrease and reduced to the lowest value 2 67 at day 10 fig 3 a relative to δ13c the nitrogen stable isotope δ15n in c oligoclora litter and sediments showed extremely significant differences over time p 0 001 p 0 001 anova fig 3b from day 10 the δ13c value of c oligoclora litter displayed a slight increase and entered the stages of more difficult decomposition however the variation of 13c was no more than 0 42 with an average of 21 35 at the end and the δ15n value reached 66 68 in the sediment 3 4 changes of nitrogen and phosphorus forms and their content at swi 3 4 1 for nitrogen the concentrations of tn nh4 n no3 n and no2 n in the overlying water were significantly different from day 0 p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 001 and p 0 001 anova the tn concentration slightly increased after a short decrease while nh4 n continued to decrease and no3 n and no2 n increased correspondingly during 10 15 days fig 4 a on day 40 tn and nh4 n reached 16 29 1 75 and 12 74 1 74 mg l 1 nh4 n accounted for 78 21 of tn and no3 n and no2 n accounted for only 6 32 it could be seen that nh4 n was the main form of nitrogen in the overlying water the main form of nitrogen in the interstitial water was also nh4 n no3 n showed a cumulative process from day 3 to day 10 moreover the results of the diffusion flux of no3 n showed that the no3 n in the sediment diffused upward from the interstitial water on day 10 this finding explains that a large amount of ammonia nitrogen was nitrated in the sediment and released into the interstitial water fig 5 however the concentration of no3 n soon fell back to a lower level after a brief rise p 0 001 anova no2 n displayed a lower concentration level in the hypoxic reducing environment p 0 001 anova fig 4b the composition of tn nh4 n no3 n and no2 n in the surface sediments are shown in fig 4 c at day 0 nh4 n accounted for 2 29 of tn no3 n and no2 n accounted for only 0 36 during the decay process of c oligoclora the fluctuation range of tn concentration was 2246 80 51 83 2489 32 183 46 mg kg 1 and the proportion of nh4 n was 6 42 7 43 p 0 001 anova the proportions of no3 n and no2 n were only 0 12 0 74 p 0 001 p 0 001 anova 3 4 2 for phosphorus tp and ip in the overlying water showed the same change trend during the entire period of decomposition and both had significant differences with time p 0 001 p 0 001 anova fig 4d at day 40 tp and ip rose to the highest concentration 6 68 0 64 6 59 0 79 mg l 1 while in interstitial water tp and ip decreased to 1 25 0 14 1 05 0 03 mg l 1 respectively p 0 001 p 0 001 anova fig 4e from fig 4 h it can be seen that the phosphorus in the sediments at day 0 was mainly ip and the tp concentration of the sediments increased with time ranging from 2 06 0 14 to 2 36 0 16 mg g 1 with a distinct difference p 0 001 anova ip in sediments ranged from 1 46 0 04 to 1 66 0 18 mg g 1 accounting for 67 37 70 28 of tp naoh p showed a fluctuating trend which decreased to 0 50 0 08 mg g 1 at day 40 accounting for 22 79 of tp hci p in this study showed an overall upward trend reaching a maximum value 1 04 0 08 mg g 1 at day 30 accounting for 48 00 of tp the op change was the opposite to that of the ip which was stable at 29 43 of tp in the late stage of decomposition 3 5 change of bacteria community structure 3 5 1 bacteria community abundance and diversity the identification of the microbial communities from the overlying water and sediment samples generated 307 142 valid sequences with an average of 38 393 sequences for subsequent analysis after the initial sequence was processed an average of 2026 otus were obtained the sequence information calculated the coverage percentage good richness estimator chao 1 and ace and diversity index simpson and shannon of the samples which are listed in table 1 based on the ace and chao1 indexes the highest bacterial community richness was found in d15s among all samples the order of bacterial community richness in sediment samples was d15s d30s d3s os and the bacterial community richness in sediment samples was higher than that in the overlying water sample the order of richness in the overlying water sample was ow d15w d30w d3w the results of the simpson and shannon indices revealed that the sediment sample d15s has higher diversity 6 36 than that of other samples the homogeneity of the bacterial community in the overlying water ow sample was poor and there was a phenomenon of a large concentration of acinetobacter and brevundimonas 3 5 2 taxonomic identification of the bacterial community the relative bacterial community abundance was characterised at the phylum and genus levels in the sediment overlying water system fig 6 shows a total of 36 phyla the dominant phyla were proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes bacteroidetes planctomycetes and acidobacteria with the relative abundances of 31 31 92 62 0 03 25 88 1 37 19 06 0 89 14 38 0 04 11 11 and 0 02 9 7 respectively the abundance of proteobacteria in both the overlying water and sediment was higher than that in other phyla the abundance in the overlying water ow reached 92 62 and accounted for 27 36 38 31 of the total number of bacteria in sediments the relative abundance of chloroflexi planctomycetes and acidobacteria changed similarly all of which decreased in the early stage of decomposition and then increased in the middle and later stages among them planctomycetes of d30w increased by 25 43 times compared to that of ow whose change was the largest among the several dominant bacteria firmicutes showed a fluctuating trend and the relative abundance of d3w and d30w were both greater than 3 50 bacteroidetes relative abundance was the largest during the pre decomposition period and the relative abundance reached 14 38 at day 30 which increased by 16 16 times compared to that of ow before decreasing in the later decomposition period a comparative analysis of the overlying water group and the sediment group revealed significant differences in the abundance changes of proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and acidobacteria p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 001 and p 0 001 welch s t test the composition and relative abundance of genus horizontal bacteria showed that the composition of dominant bacteria in the overlying water and sediment groups was significantly different p 0 05 welch s t test fig s1 the main dominant bacteria were acinetobacter 0 08 62 48 brevundimonas 2 62 29 07 pseudomonas 0 13 20 36 and clostridium sensu stricto 0 08 11 89 others such as flavobacterium only have a relatively high abundance 3 24 in the overlying water d15w in the middle stage 3 5 3 bacterial community difference the samples in the overlying water group did not have many otus in common accounting for only 45 of the total otus shown in fig 7 it showed that with the decomposition of c oligoclora the composition of the bacterial community in each sample of the overlying water group changed significantly and the diversity was relatively single it is worth noting that the relative abundance of otu1 in the overlying water group was highest but only appeared in ow and a small amount appeared in os compared to the group in the overlying water the group in the sediment contained more common otus the relative abundances of otu664 belonging to the proteobacteria and otu16698 belonging to firmicutes were relatively high 3 5 4 relationship between environmental factors and bacteria community structure the redundancy analysis showed that samples of d15w and d30w have a positive correlation with tp and ip d3w and ow have a positive correlation with toc and do and os d3s d15s and d30s have a positive correlation with tn nh4 n no3 n fig s2 among all bacterial genera gp17 litorilinea and proteiniclasticum were more affected by environmental factors and had significant positive correlations with tn nh4 n and no3 n the dominant genus acinetobacter in the overlying water group was positively correlated with do and negatively correlated with cond the dominant bacteria brevundimonas and clostridium sensu stricto showed significant negative and highly positive correlations with tn and nh4 n respectively table s1 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the decomposition regularity of c oligoclora at swi the decomposition process of c oligoclora in swi contains three distinct stages the early decay period with very rapid biomass loss followed by the middle decomposition period of microorganisms decomposing organic matter and finally the late decomposition period of microorganisms acting on difficult to degrade organic matter such as cellulose which may inhibit the activity of microorganisms kristensen 1994 li et al 2014 the rapid biomass loss at the early stage may be the reason for the accelerated dissolution of low molecular weight substances such as sugars organic acids proteins k ca and other substances davis et al 2003 moreover the cell wall composition of c oligoclora is less complex with low phenols content which is conducive to plant degradation zimmer et al 2001 the leaching rate at this stage mainly depends on the property of the residual and the natural decomposition before settlement longhi et al 2008 when the litter property c n 25 the decrease in n content indicated that c oligoclora released a large amount of n related nutrients into the water column at the early stage rejmankova and houdkova 2006 continuous reduction of the remaining biomass in stage ii was associated with the transformation and utilisation of the non structural compounds released from c oligoclora by microorganisms where c and n were converted into the microbial biomass and products cotrufo et al 2013 the decrease in c n may be due to carbon loss caused by the metabolism of carbon respiration by microorganisms the pearson correlation results indicated that in stage ii the n content of the c oligoclora litter was not the main factor affecting the decomposition rate and the p content had a more significant effect this difference may be caused by different demands for n and p of the decomposing microbes which have a relatively high demand for p xie et al 2004 the n content continued to increase in stage ⅲ which has been reported in other extensive algae studies paalme et al 2002 twilley et al 1986 the increase in n content may be related to the accumulation of nitrogen structure complexes phenol proteins drug resistant amino groups and nitrogen containing humic acids caused by microbial metabolic processes conover et al 2016 twilley et al 1986 the c n ratio continues to decrease at this stage which is consistent with the results of some studies on large opportunistic algae kristensen 1994 olafsson et al 2013 c n did not correlate with the remaining biomass which indicated that the c n did not play a key role in the later stage of the decomposition of c oligoclora 4 2 effects of the decomposition process of c oligoclora on nitrogen and phosphorus migration and transformation the amount and direction of δ13c and δ15n migration during decomposition and assimilation can be changed according to the diversity of microorganisms and substrates banks and frost 2017 compared to δ15n the migration of δ13c is more conservative fellerhoff et al 2003 the attachment growth of microorganisms that used 13c released from the decomposition of c oligoclora may have cushioned the higher variation of 13c dai et al 2005 moreover when comparing the high c to nutrient ratio of plant litter to microbial biomass much more c is lost as co2 rather than retained in biomass during litter decomposition mooshammer et al 2014 therefore there was no significant change in δ13c in the sediment because microorganisms can absorb 15n dissolved organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen enriched from the outside world and retain and fix some organic nitrogen compounds 15n enrichment of c oligoclora litter was promoted which manifested a small δ15n accumulation in the later stage of decomposition olafsson et al 2013 the part of 15n in c oligoclora will have a process of migration to sediment for microorganisms which may affect the nutrient structure of swi in the early and middle stages of decomposition the significant increase in cond of the overlying water meant that the high concentration of electrolytes consisted of rich organic matter and inorganic ions were produced by c oligoclora decomposition batish et al 2009 organic acids such as fatty acids and phenolic acids were released unpublished data and proteins also produced a large number of amino acids in the decomposition process moon et al 2016 therefore the ph value of the overlying water also decreased correspondingly in the early stage of decomposition which was conducive to ammoniation ammoniating bacteria decompose organic nitrogen and transform it into nh4 n leading to an increase in the concentration of nh4 n watanabe et al 2015 due to the decrease in oxygen consumption in the middle and late stages of decomposition do began to increase slightly a large number of nutrients in the overlying water stimulated the massive reproduction and growth of heterotrophic microorganisms which consume co2 in water and increase the ph value we can deduce that the ammoniation was weakened in the mid degradation period and nitrification increased with increased dissolved oxygen parts of nh4 n were converted into no3 n and no2 n by active nitrifying bacteria thus showing a cumulative result for no3 n luo et al 2020 although the do in the middle and late stages of decomposition gradually increased it was still at a low do level 0 87 0 15 mg l 1 at day 40 the low do environment is not disadvantageous for the nitrification reaction ammoniation was still the primary process and nh4 n was the main form of nitrogen in the overlying water which are similar to those of previous studies on nitrogen structure in the overlying water of decomposing aquatic macrophytes wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 during the decomposition process there was not much structural change in the nitrogen of the surface sediments after the evaluation by the organic index method it belonged to the sediment of the organic nitrogen pollution type lu et al 2012 it can be seen that the nitrogen background value of surface sediments was organic nitrogen org n as the main form while the inorganic nitrogen was nh4 n as the main form the deposition of large amounts of organic matter and dissolved organic nitrogen may be the reason for the large accumulation of org n in sediments kaushal et al 2014 these results indicate that in the early stage of degradation on the one hand the organic nitrogen in the surface sediment underwent mineralisation to generate inorganic ions such as nh4 n no3 n and no2 n which were first accumulated in interstitial water and subsequently diffused into the overlying water kuypers et al 2018 on the other hand a lack of consumption and utilisation by primary producers leads to a large amount of nh4 n being adsorbed and fixed by the sediment and the concentration rose sharply tn and nh4 n concentrations in the overlying water also rose sharply for subsequent diffusion however no3 n and no2 n in the overlying water in the middle and later stages of decomposition were diffused back into the surface sediments in an anoxic reduction environment through interstitial water then they were denitrified and reduced to n2o n2 etc before escaping into the air the concentrations of tn and nh4 n in the late stage were relatively stable fig 4c it was speculated that the mineral fixation of nh4 n caused nitrogen accumulation in the sediment and the amount of nitrogen involved in the cycle decreased nieder et al 2011 therefore the decomposition of c oligoclora aggravated the eutrophication of the overlying water in a short period causing severe pollution of nh4 n in the overlying water the effect on the nitrogen structure of the sediment was the increase in the concentration of nh4 n which had a high release risk he et al 2015 phosphorus in the overlying water mainly existed as inorganic phosphorus which explained that the organic phosphorus released by c oligoclora in the pre decomposition period was largely converted to inorganic phosphorus by microorganisms other research results also proved that microbial action resulted in a faster rate of phosphorus release during the first 6 days in the process of algae decomposition chuai et al 2011 gillan et al 2012 the po4 3 p release flux moved from the overlying water to the sediment during the entire experimental period more po4 3 p entered the anoxic environment of the surface sediments in the research system the microorganisms related to the phosphorus cycle may locally increase po4 3 p activities through metabolic activity under anoxic conditions causing phosphorus precipitation and accumulation in the sediment cosmidis et al 2014 the changing trend of naoh p indicated that the surface sediments had continuously consumed oxygen due to the decomposition of organic matter which led the environment of surface sediments to become relatively deoxidised a small amount of naoh p passed through the interstitial water due to the higher oxidation reduction potential it was concentrated and contained re formed mineral deposits fig 4h hartono et al 2006 however hcl p which is not easily released or used by biological organisms has a higher distribution in the ip of sediments the input of a large amount of phosphate for the decomposition of c oligoclora in the overlying water caused phosphate migration from the overlying water to the sediment making the sediment become the sink of phosphorus and changed the distribution of phosphorus fraction in the sediment zhang et al 2018b also found that the phosphorus released by dying algae accounted for more than 90 of the water body tp this part of phosphorus may be deposited in the sediment when the environment or biological factors change at swi endogenous phosphorus may re enter the overlying water through desorption dissolution or biological decomposition chen et al 2018 which would provide a nutritional basis for a new round of algal blooms 4 3 effects of the decomposition process of c oligoclora on bacterial community proteobacteria the dominant bacterial phylum showed the highest relative abundance in this study some studies have reported that it is the most abundant freshwater bacterial phylum associated with plant litters and it could break down stubborn carbon compounds in the litters or use degradation products and plant extracts such as acetate and phenol besemer et al 2012 zamanzadeh et al 2016 acinetobacter is a typical genus of denitrifying bacteria belonging to proteobacteria which has a strong ability to accumulate p guo et al 2018 it was relatively abundant in the late stage which also indicated that denitrification was more substantial than other chemical transformation processes there were a few noteworthy results that the relative abundance of anaerobic ammonia oxidising bacteria in this study was extremely low all 0 01 these results showed that denitrification mainly occurred in the anoxic and even anaerobic conditions which was consistent with the previous results of nitrogen distribution in various forms the relative abundance of acinetobacter in overlying water and sediments in the early stage was higher than that in the middle and late stages which indicated that the decomposition process of c oligoclora changed the composition of the dominant bacterial community the dominant genus pseudomonas which has a strong ability to decompose organic nitrogenous compounds to produce ammonia has also been affected du et al 2013 the relative abundance change showed the opposite trends in overlying water and sediment the variation of relative abundance in sediment and the overlying water also indicated that pseudomonas proliferated in large quantities after spreading from surface sediments to overlying water in the early stages this phylum then distributed to the surface sediments from the overlying water due to the stage of microbial colonisation and decomposition of difficult to decompose organic matter in the middle and later stages it confirmed that pseudomonas with ammoniation was the microorganism that mainly affected the concentration change of nh4 n at swi in this system brevundimonas is mostly reported to have the ability to degrade organic matter and it is common in fresh water zakharova et al 2013 bacteroidetes are another representative dominant phylum that can break down sugars to produce organic acids such as acetic acid and propionic acid ali et al 2014 and can quickly colonise and grow on plant surfaces wymore et al 2016 the massive growth of this bacterium verified the results that c oligoclora rapidly decayed and reduced biomass in the early stage of decomposition the functional bacteria flavobacterium belonging to bacteroidetes which can degrade proteins lipid cellulose and other macromolecular substances dong and reddy 2010 only have a relatively high abundance in the overlying water this abundance means that the soluble macromolecules produced by the c oligoclora degrading process mainly infiltrated the overlying water in the early and middle stages the release of a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in the early stage also stimulated the growth of rhizobium azohydromonas and azotobacterm associated with nitrogen fixation ability 0 2 which could promote the accumulation of nitrogen in the surface sediments in the late stage of decomposition anaerobes such as clostridium sensu stricto belonging to firmicutes a bacterium widely distributed in nature spread to the surface sediments after the decomposition began in this research zhao et al 2017 this spread of anaerobes revealed the gradual occurrence of an anaerobic reduction environment caused by decomposition it is also worth noting that in the late stage the growth of planctomycetes in both the overlying water and the sediment was significantly higher than that of other bacteria this finding may be related to the polysaccharide sulphate which could provide planctomycetes with more energy for growth during the later decomposing stage cai et al 2013 the decomposition process of c oligoclora in swi is summarised in the schematic diagram in fig 8 the abundance of the dominant bacterial communities in sediments and overlying water has changed significantly the specific acinetobacter with denitrification and phosphorus accumulation ability tended to spread from overlying water to surface sediments with the result of the relative abundance of acinetobacter in the sediment in stage iii significantly higher than that in the overlying water the redundancy analysis revealed that phosphorus mainly affected the bacterial community in the overlying water in the middle and late stages of decay and the correlation was greater therefore due to the microbial action po4 3 p could migrate to the sediment however pseudomonas promoted ammoniation and the migration of nh4 n from sediments to overlying water in stages ⅰ and ⅱ the nh4 n began to move from the overlying water to the sediments in stage iii caused by the distribution of pseudomonas to surface sediments the relative abundance of the other major dominant bacteria with degradation ability such as brevundimonas flavobacterium and clostridium sensu stricto were concentrated in stage ⅱ which also indicated that there was a stage of microbial mass reproduction and decomposition of organic matter in the decomposition process of c oligoclora moreover the correlation between the bacterial community and nitrogen in sediments was higher therefore the migration and transformation activities of various forms of nitrogen were relatively active it should be noted that our analysis has focused on the nutrient migration transformation and response of bacterial community structure during the degradation process of fga however some complex environmental condition limitations such as water flow sediment resuspension interference of growth and metabolism of aquatic animals and macrophytes and the aquarium wall effect of its own experimental system such as nutrient cycling chemical dynamics and physicochemical properties could occur during the process the priority of our future work will further refine the contribution of other environmental conditions and aquatic animal and macrophyte disturbances to the degradation of fga in combination with large scale experiments 5 conclusion our work illustrates that decaying c oligoclora will worsen the water environment in a short period and also cause drastic changes in the physical and chemical properties and bacterial community structure of the sediment microenvironment such changes are reflected in secondary pollution of the sediment and increasing the risk of releasing endogenous nutrients which greatly increases the possibility of phytoplankton blooms and will be detrimental to the restoration of aquatic ecology in addition the relative abundance and composition of major dominant bacteria in the microbial community changed significantly affecting the material cycle and energy flow of the ecosystem to a certain extent the potential ecological threat of opportunistic macroalgae such as cladophora means an abnormal proliferation needs more attention and research

17285,during decay the sediment microenvironment and water quality are severely affected by excessive proliferation of harmful algae such as filamentous green algae fga the frequency of this fga is increased through global warming and water eutrophication in the present study the degradation processes of a common advantage fga cladophora oligoclora and its effect on nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient structure and bacterial community composition at the sediment water interface were investigated by stable isotope labelling and high throughput sequencing the results showed that the decomposition process of c oligoclona was fast stable and difficult to degrade the changes in sediment δ15n values reached 66 68 on day 40 which indicated that some of the nitrogen had migrated to the sediment from c oligoclona litter tn and nh4 n in the overlying water rapidly increased between days 0 10 nh4 n rose to 78 21 of tn on day 40 resulting in severe pollution of ammonia in the overlying water the nitrogen forms and contents in the sediment are mainly derived from the increasing ammonia nitrogen release the tp and ip in the overlying water increased to the highest concentrations of 6 68 0 64 6 59 0 79 mg l 1 during the decomposition process respectively resulting in the migration of phosphate to the sediments with increasing phosphorus content the abundance of the main dominant bacterial communities such as acinetobacter 0 08 62 48 and pseudomonas 0 13 20 36 in sediments and overlying water has changed significantly the correlation analysis results suggested that the phosphorus was mainly related to the bacterial community in the overlying water while the various forms of nitrogen demonstrated a high relevance with the bacterial community in the sediment our research results will be valuable in evaluating the potential ecological risk of fga decomposition and provide scientific support for shallow lake management and submerged vegetation restoration

introduction in the context of global climate change eutrophication is accelerating to become a serious threat to global water security the increase in nutrient input and inorganic carbon sources resulted in the dense biomass of epiphytes and phytoplankton richardson et al 2018 in particular filamentous green algae fga can proliferate in large numbers to form a population advantage el shoubaky 2013 for example the over proliferation of cladophora is already a widespread global problem it is commonly reported in many regions such as east siberia lake baikal the united states laurentian great lakes united kingdom little budworth pool indonesia the philippines australia japan and the baltic region higgins et al 2008 timoshkin et al 2016 such an increase not only accelerates the degradation of lakes but also introduces a series of new ecological problems fga can form a dense algal mat for excessive proliferation which often causes shading hypoxia and interference in the substance circulation zhang et al 2020 decayed fga also adversely affects the growth and metabolism of submerged macrophytes and their propagators and seedlings zhang et al 2018a furthermore the nutrients released by decayed fga would cause abnormal proliferation of algae and aggravate the change from a clean water state to a turbid state the decomposition capacity of plants is related to the c n p content or c n p mass ratio su et al 2016 species with high decomposition rates usually show high initial n and p contents and low initial c n c p and n p ratios xiao et al 2017 moreover the degradation process of plant litter is also correlated with the physical and chemical conditions and microbial activities in the water environment research has shown that the initial litter degradation is affected by ambient temperature ph and nutrient availability lemley et al 2014 the sediment water interface swi is the main site for fga decay in which coupling of organic matter between geochemical cycles and biological systems could occur kinsman costello et al 2017 most of the unutilised nitrogen phosphorus and plant litters during plant decay are deposited in the subsoil and nutrient accumulation in surface sediments is usually several times higher than that in the water column zhou et al 2016 the exchange of nitrogen and phosphorus in swi is the primary method to regulate the flow of nutrients from the sediment to the water column liu et al 2019 in this process the nutrients released by the sediment first exist in the intermediate medium interstitial water and then diffuse into the upper water column under a concentration gradient through migration and transformation zhang et al 2013 different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus have different biological effects and can directly affect the absorption and utilisation of primary productivity for instance nitrate and ammonium are the primary inorganic nitrogen forms available to phytoplankton and plants ortigosa et al 2020 an appropriate amount of ammonium can promote phytoplankton and plant growth however an excess of ammonium can cause phytotoxicity setien et al 2013 such as destroying the chloroplast ultrastructure and carbon skeleton which disrupts the balance of c n yu et al 2017 the flux rate of nutrients in different forms showed significant temporal and spatial variation in different aquatic systems under the influence of ph hypoxia hydrodynamics and other environmental factors boynton et al 2018 in addition to environmental factors microorganisms also affect the distribution of nutrients between sediments and overlying water the effective aerobic degradation of organic matter by aerobic microorganisms would be replaced by inefficient fermentation degradation of anaerobic bacteria under anoxic conditions mckew et al 2013 a few studies on the decomposition of fga have analysed the effect of nutrient cycling on the formation of marine red tides wang et al 2012 the changes in element composition and decomposition products peller et al 2014 and the effects on phosphorus release from sediments gao et al 2013 however there remains a lack of research on the specific decomposition characteristics of fga compared with advanced hydrophytes the specific surface area of fga is larger and attaching decomposing microorganisms and protozoa is easier the nutrient elements and cellulose content are also higher making the study of the key nutrient migration and transformation in the decomposition process of fga and its biogeochemical effects particularly relevant from a comprehensive perspective analysis regarding the above theoretical basis we hypothesised that under certain conditions the fga released different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients into the water column and migrated to the sediment during the decomposition process which was accompanied by changes in the physical and chemical properties of the microenvironment at the swi in this study the stable isotope 13c and 15n tracers and different forms of nutrients were used to analyse the migration and transformation of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sediment overlying water system during the decomposition of cladophora oligoclora high throughput sequencing technology was used to explore further the changes in bacterial community structure in the overlying water and sediment the main research objectives are as follows 1 to examine the effect of the decomposition process on the carbon and nitrogen nutrition structure of sediments 2 to analyse the migration and transformation of nutrients in different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sediment overlying water system during decomposition 3 to reveal the response of the microbial community structure change in overlying water and sediment during decomposition this research will clarify the effects of the fga decomposition process on the microenvironments of swi and reveal its potential ecological threats to the restoration of submerged macrophytes these results will be important for shallow lake management and submerged vegetation restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation of isotopic labelled samples fresh cladophora oligoclora was collected from the donghu lake wuhan china 30 55 n 114 36e water samples and sediments were collected simultaneously the water sample was filtered using a 1 2 μm whatman filter to remove particulate matter while the sediment was sieved using an 80 mesh sieve to remove impurities such as shellfish animal and plant litters the clean c oligoclora was cultured in bg11 medium containing 0 1 mm na15no3 and 0 5 mm nah13co3 at 2000 lx light intensity 25 c and a 12 12 h photoperiod for preparation of isotopically labelled samples c oligoclora would be taken out from the culture system when the adsorption of carbon and nitrogen isotopes reached a stable state after 240 h the samples were lyophilised and preserved for subsequent experiments 2 2 experimental design and operation water samples and sediments from the east lake were deposited in the 21 aquariums 14 cm 19 cm 30 cm the sediment was 15 cm and the overlying water was

lan et al 2012 the remaining litter was grounded carefully and then used to measure δ13c δ15n c n and p content which were determined by the carlo erba ea 1110 elemental analyser connected to an isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo usa and inductively coupled plasma icp method respectively the surface sediments 0 3 cm below the sediment overlying water were collected at each experimental time point after removing the overlying water for sediment samples tn was determined by the persulfate digestion method ebina et al 1983 nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were extracted by potassium

same time the collected surface sediment samples were subjected to pre treatments such as drying and grinding to determine δ13c and δ15n fifty millilitres of the collected surficial sediments were centrifuged for 15 min at a speed of 5000 r min 1 and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane pes jinteng china to obtain interstitial water tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n tp and ip

high throughput sequencing were performed according to the approach described by xu et al 2017 and analysed using the illumina miseq platform at shanghai sangon biotech co ltd after sequencing was completed each sample sequence was distinguished by barcode and quality control was performed for each sample sequence 2 4 data analysis the mean values of data and standard error are expressed as the mean sd of three replicate measurements spss 23 0 software was used for all statistical analyses one way anova was performed to analyse the differences in dynamic changes in physical and chemical indicators over time the bonferroni post test was used for the significance test of pairwise comparative differences between time points tukey s honest significance test was used to determine the

seven effective environmental factors before ranking all charts were drawn using origin 9 0 3 results 3 1 changes of ph do cond and toc in overlying water and sediment the distributions of ph do cond and toc in the overlying water and sediment are shown in fig 1 the ph of the overlying water decreased to the lowest value 6 85 0 07 in the early stage of decomposition and there was a significant upward trend p 0 001 anova in contrast to the overlying water the ph of the sediment was relatively stable in the early stage and increased to the maximum at day 40 fig 1a do decreased sharply for c oligoclora decomposition in the water column and reached the anaerobic state 0 2 mg l 1 at day 5 p 0 001 anova fig 1b cond showed the same tendency to first increase before decreasing with time in the overlying water and sediment p 0 001 p 0 001 anova the final cond values of both the overlying water and sediment increased 1 58 and 2 58 fold than that at day 0 respectively fig 1c the toc concentration in the overlying water reached the highest value at day 5 33 37 3 79 mg l 1 p 0 001 anova and there were no significant differences in sediments fig 1d 3 2 the decomposition dynamic characteristics and its relationship with n p c of c oligoclora the results showed that the decomposition rate reached the highest value 0 17 0 01 d 1 at day 3 and then decreased to 0 05 0 08 d 1 from day 5 to day 20 and finally became 0 03 0 00 d 1 at day 40 fig 2 a from the change in the remaining biomass the decomposition process can be divided into three phases fig 2b stage ⅰ pre decomposition 0 5 days the weight loss of c oligoclora was very rapid reaching 44 41 at day 5 the results indicated that the n content decreased to 87 86 of the initial n content at day 5 fig 2c and the n content in stage i showed a significant positive correlation with the remaining biomass r 0 835 p 0 05 3d r 0 782 p 0 05 day 5 fig 2d correspondingly the c n value increased to 12 39 at day 5 fig 2c which negatively correlated with the remaining biomass r 0 984 p 0 01 in addition c p and n p in stage i were highly negatively correlated with the remaining biomass p 0 01 p 0 01 and p content showed a highly positive correlation p 0 01 stage ii 5 20 days was the main stage of the biomass loss of c oligoclora on day 20 the remaining biomass decreased to 38 59 of the initial biomass indicating that more than 50 of the biomass was lost however there was no correlation between the n content and the remaining biomass in stage ii the c n also showed a high negative correlation and a significant negative correlation only at days 10 and 15 r 0 756 p 0 01 r 0 577 p 0 05 the p content increased slightly and had a highly negative correlation with the remaining biomass stage ⅲ 20 40 days late decaying phase the residual biomass loss and decomposition rate gradually flattened at this stage the c content decreased the n content continued to increase and the c n ratio decreased there was no correlation between c n and the remaining biomass the p content has a consistently increasing trend with the n content and a highly positive correlation with the remaining biomass c p and n p also showed a highly negative correlation 3 3 δ13c and δ15n changes in sediments and c oligoclora the carbon stable isotope δ13c value of c oligoclora during the pre decomposition and middle period 0 10 days continued to decrease and reduced to the lowest value 2 67 at day 10 fig 3 a relative to δ13c the nitrogen stable isotope δ15n in c oligoclora litter and sediments showed extremely significant differences over time p 0 001 p 0 001 anova fig 3b from day 10 the δ13c value of c oligoclora litter displayed a slight increase and entered the stages of more difficult decomposition however the variation of 13c was no more than 0 42 with an average of 21 35 at the end and the δ15n value reached 66 68 in the sediment 3 4 changes of nitrogen and phosphorus forms and their content at swi 3 4 1 for nitrogen the concentrations of tn nh4 n no3 n and no2 n in the overlying water were significantly different from day 0 p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 001 and p 0 001 anova the tn concentration slightly increased after a short decrease while nh4 n continued to decrease and no3 n and no2 n increased correspondingly during 10 15 days fig 4 a on day 40 tn and nh4 n reached 16 29 1 75 and 12 74 1 74 mg l 1 nh4 n accounted for 78 21 of tn and no3 n and no2 n accounted for only 6 32 it could be seen that nh4 n was the main form of nitrogen in the overlying water the main form of nitrogen in the interstitial water was also nh4 n no3 n showed a cumulative process from day 3 to day 10 moreover the results of the diffusion flux of no3 n showed that the no3 n in the sediment diffused upward from the interstitial water on day 10 this finding explains that a large amount of ammonia nitrogen was nitrated in the sediment and released into the interstitial water fig 5 however the concentration of no3 n soon fell back to a lower level after a brief rise p 0 001 anova no2 n displayed a lower concentration level in the hypoxic reducing environment p 0 001 anova fig 4b the composition of tn nh4 n no3 n and no2 n in the surface sediments are shown in fig 4 c at day 0 nh4 n accounted for 2 29 of tn no3 n and no2 n accounted for only 0 36 during the decay process of c oligoclora the fluctuation range of tn concentration was 2246 80 51 83 2489 32 183 46 mg kg 1 and the proportion of nh4 n was 6 42 7 43 p 0 001 anova the proportions of no3 n and no2 n were only 0 12 0 74 p 0 001 p 0 001 anova 3 4 2 for phosphorus tp and ip in the overlying water showed the same change trend during the entire period of decomposition and both had significant differences with time p 0 001 p 0 001 anova fig 4d at day 40 tp and ip rose to the highest concentration 6 68 0 64 6 59 0 79 mg l 1 while in interstitial water tp and ip decreased to 1 25 0 14 1 05 0 03 mg l 1 respectively p 0 001 p 0 001 anova fig 4e from fig 4 h it can be seen that the phosphorus in the sediments at day 0 was mainly ip and the tp concentration of the sediments increased with time ranging from 2 06 0 14 to 2 36 0 16 mg g 1 with a distinct difference p 0 001 anova ip in sediments ranged from 1 46 0 04 to 1 66 0 18 mg g 1 accounting for 67 37 70 28 of tp naoh p showed a fluctuating trend which decreased to 0 50 0 08 mg g 1 at day 40 accounting for 22 79 of tp hci p in this study showed an overall upward trend reaching a maximum value 1 04 0 08 mg g 1 at day 30 accounting for 48 00 of tp the op change was the opposite to that of the ip which was stable at 29 43 of tp in the late stage of decomposition 3 5 change of bacteria community structure 3 5 1 bacteria community abundance and diversity the identification of the microbial communities from the overlying water and sediment samples generated 307 142 valid sequences with an average of 38 393 sequences for subsequent analysis after the initial sequence was processed an average of 2026 otus were obtained the sequence information calculated the coverage percentage good richness estimator chao 1 and ace and diversity index simpson and shannon of the samples which are listed in table 1 based on the ace and chao1 indexes the highest bacterial community richness was found in d15s among all samples the order of bacterial community richness in sediment samples was d15s d30s d3s os and the bacterial community richness in sediment samples was higher than that in the overlying water sample the order of richness in the overlying water sample was ow d15w d30w d3w the results of the simpson and shannon indices revealed that the sediment sample d15s has higher diversity 6 36 than that of other samples the homogeneity of the bacterial community in the overlying water ow sample was poor and there was a phenomenon of a large concentration of acinetobacter and brevundimonas 3 5 2 taxonomic identification of the bacterial community the relative bacterial community abundance was characterised at the phylum and genus levels in the sediment overlying water system fig 6 shows a total of 36 phyla the dominant phyla were proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes bacteroidetes planctomycetes and acidobacteria with the relative abundances of 31 31 92 62 0 03 25 88 1 37 19 06 0 89 14 38 0 04 11 11 and 0 02 9 7 respectively the abundance of proteobacteria in both the overlying water and sediment was higher than that in other phyla the abundance in the overlying water ow reached 92 62 and accounted for 27 36 38 31 of the total number of bacteria in sediments the relative abundance of chloroflexi planctomycetes and acidobacteria changed similarly all of which decreased in the early stage of decomposition and then increased in the middle and later stages among them planctomycetes of d30w increased by 25 43 times compared to that of ow whose change was the largest among the several dominant bacteria firmicutes showed a fluctuating trend and the relative abundance of d3w and d30w were both greater than 3 50 bacteroidetes relative abundance was the largest during the pre decomposition period and the relative abundance reached 14 38 at day 30 which increased by 16 16 times compared to that of ow before decreasing in the later decomposition period a comparative analysis of the overlying water group and the sediment group revealed significant differences in the abundance changes of proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and acidobacteria p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 001 and p 0 001 welch s t test the composition and relative abundance of genus horizontal bacteria showed that the composition of dominant bacteria in the overlying water and sediment groups was significantly different p 0 05 welch s t test fig s1 the main dominant bacteria were acinetobacter 0 08 62 48 brevundimonas 2 62 29 07 pseudomonas 0 13 20 36 and clostridium sensu stricto 0 08 11 89 others such as flavobacterium only have a relatively high abundance 3 24 in the overlying water d15w in the middle stage 3 5 3 bacterial community difference the samples in the overlying water group did not have many otus in common accounting for only 45 of the total otus shown in fig 7 it showed that with the decomposition of c oligoclora the composition of the bacterial community in each sample of the overlying water group changed significantly and the diversity was relatively single it is worth noting that the relative abundance of otu1 in the overlying water group was highest but only appeared in ow and a small amount appeared in os compared to the group in the overlying water the group in the sediment contained more common otus the relative abundances of otu664 belonging to the proteobacteria and otu16698 belonging to firmicutes were relatively high 3 5 4 relationship between environmental factors and bacteria community structure the redundancy analysis showed that samples of d15w and d30w have a positive correlation with tp and ip d3w and ow have a positive correlation with toc and do and os d3s d15s and d30s have a positive correlation with tn nh4 n no3 n fig s2 among all bacterial genera gp17 litorilinea and proteiniclasticum were more affected by environmental factors and had significant positive correlations with tn nh4 n and no3 n the dominant genus acinetobacter in the overlying water group was positively correlated with do and negatively correlated with cond the dominant bacteria brevundimonas and clostridium sensu stricto showed significant negative and highly positive correlations with tn and nh4 n respectively table s1 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the decomposition regularity of c oligoclora at swi the decomposition process of c oligoclora in swi contains three distinct stages the early decay period with very rapid biomass loss followed by the middle decomposition period of microorganisms decomposing organic matter and finally the late decomposition period of microorganisms acting on difficult to degrade organic matter such as cellulose which may inhibit the activity of microorganisms kristensen 1994 li et al 2014 the rapid biomass loss at the early stage may be the reason for the accelerated dissolution of low molecular weight substances such as sugars organic acids proteins k ca and other substances davis et al 2003 moreover the cell wall composition of c oligoclora is less complex with low phenols content which is conducive to plant degradation zimmer et al 2001 the leaching rate at this stage mainly depends on the property of the residual and the natural decomposition before settlement longhi et al 2008 when the litter property c n 25 the decrease in n content indicated that c oligoclora released a large amount of n related nutrients into the water column at the early stage rejmankova and houdkova 2006 continuous reduction of the remaining biomass in stage ii was associated with the transformation and utilisation of the non structural compounds released from c oligoclora by microorganisms where c and n were converted into the microbial biomass and products cotrufo et al 2013 the decrease in c n may be due to carbon loss caused by the metabolism of carbon respiration by microorganisms the pearson correlation results indicated that in stage ii the n content of the c oligoclora litter was not the main factor affecting the decomposition rate and the p content had a more significant effect this difference may be caused by different demands for n and p of the decomposing microbes which have a relatively high demand for p xie et al 2004 the n content continued to increase in stage ⅲ which has been reported in other extensive algae studies paalme et al 2002 twilley et al 1986 the increase in n content may be related to the accumulation of nitrogen structure complexes phenol proteins drug resistant amino groups and nitrogen containing humic acids caused by microbial metabolic processes conover et al 2016 twilley et al 1986 the c n ratio continues to decrease at this stage which is consistent with the results of some studies on large opportunistic algae kristensen 1994 olafsson et al 2013 c n did not correlate with the remaining biomass which indicated that the c n did not play a key role in the later stage of the decomposition of c oligoclora 4 2 effects of the decomposition process of c oligoclora on nitrogen and phosphorus migration and transformation the amount and direction of δ13c and δ15n migration during decomposition and assimilation can be changed according to the diversity of microorganisms and substrates banks and frost 2017 compared to δ15n the migration of δ13c is more conservative fellerhoff et al 2003 the attachment growth of microorganisms that used 13c released from the decomposition of c oligoclora may have cushioned the higher variation of 13c dai et al 2005 moreover when comparing the high c to nutrient ratio of plant litter to microbial biomass much more c is lost as co2 rather than retained in biomass during litter decomposition mooshammer et al 2014 therefore there was no significant change in δ13c in the sediment because microorganisms can absorb 15n dissolved organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen enriched from the outside world and retain and fix some organic nitrogen compounds 15n enrichment of c oligoclora litter was promoted which manifested a small δ15n accumulation in the later stage of decomposition olafsson et al 2013 the part of 15n in c oligoclora will have a process of migration to sediment for microorganisms which may affect the nutrient structure of swi in the early and middle stages of decomposition the significant increase in cond of the overlying water meant that the high concentration of electrolytes consisted of rich organic matter and inorganic ions were produced by c oligoclora decomposition batish et al 2009 organic acids such as fatty acids and phenolic acids were released unpublished data and proteins also produced a large number of amino acids in the decomposition process moon et al 2016 therefore the ph value of the overlying water also decreased correspondingly in the early stage of decomposition which was conducive to ammoniation ammoniating bacteria decompose organic nitrogen and transform it into nh4 n leading to an increase in the concentration of nh4 n watanabe et al 2015 due to the decrease in oxygen consumption in the middle and late stages of decomposition do began to increase slightly a large number of nutrients in the overlying water stimulated the massive reproduction and growth of heterotrophic microorganisms which consume co2 in water and increase the ph value we can deduce that the ammoniation was weakened in the mid degradation period and nitrification increased with increased dissolved oxygen parts of nh4 n were converted into no3 n and no2 n by active nitrifying bacteria thus showing a cumulative result for no3 n luo et al 2020 although the do in the middle and late stages of decomposition gradually increased it was still at a low do level 0 87 0 15 mg l 1 at day 40 the low do environment is not disadvantageous for the nitrification reaction ammoniation was still the primary process and nh4 n was the main form of nitrogen in the overlying water which are similar to those of previous studies on nitrogen structure in the overlying water of decomposing aquatic macrophytes wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 during the decomposition process there was not much structural change in the nitrogen of the surface sediments after the evaluation by the organic index method it belonged to the sediment of the organic nitrogen pollution type lu et al 2012 it can be seen that the nitrogen background value of surface sediments was organic nitrogen org n as the main form while the inorganic nitrogen was nh4 n as the main form the deposition of large amounts of organic matter and dissolved organic nitrogen may be the reason for the large accumulation of org n in sediments kaushal et al 2014 these results indicate that in the early stage of degradation on the one hand the organic nitrogen in the surface sediment underwent mineralisation to generate inorganic ions such as nh4 n no3 n and no2 n which were first accumulated in interstitial water and subsequently diffused into the overlying water kuypers et al 2018 on the other hand a lack of consumption and utilisation by primary producers leads to a large amount of nh4 n being adsorbed and fixed by the sediment and the concentration rose sharply tn and nh4 n concentrations in the overlying water also rose sharply for subsequent diffusion however no3 n and no2 n in the overlying water in the middle and later stages of decomposition were diffused back into the surface sediments in an anoxic reduction environment through interstitial water then they were denitrified and reduced to n2o n2 etc before escaping into the air the concentrations of tn and nh4 n in the late stage were relatively stable fig 4c it was speculated that the mineral fixation of nh4 n caused nitrogen accumulation in the sediment and the amount of nitrogen involved in the cycle decreased nieder et al 2011 therefore the decomposition of c oligoclora aggravated the eutrophication of the overlying water in a short period causing severe pollution of nh4 n in the overlying water the effect on the nitrogen structure of the sediment was the increase in the concentration of nh4 n which had a high release risk he et al 2015 phosphorus in the overlying water mainly existed as inorganic phosphorus which explained that the organic phosphorus released by c oligoclora in the pre decomposition period was largely converted to inorganic phosphorus by microorganisms other research results also proved that microbial action resulted in a faster rate of phosphorus release during the first 6 days in the process of algae decomposition chuai et al 2011 gillan et al 2012 the po4 3 p release flux moved from the overlying water to the sediment during the entire experimental period more po4 3 p entered the anoxic environment of the surface sediments in the research system the microorganisms related to the phosphorus cycle may locally increase po4 3 p activities through metabolic activity under anoxic conditions causing phosphorus precipitation and accumulation in the sediment cosmidis et al 2014 the changing trend of naoh p indicated that the surface sediments had continuously consumed oxygen due to the decomposition of organic matter which led the environment of surface sediments to become relatively deoxidised a small amount of naoh p passed through the interstitial water due to the higher oxidation reduction potential it was concentrated and contained re formed mineral deposits fig 4h hartono et al 2006 however hcl p which is not easily released or used by biological organisms has a higher distribution in the ip of sediments the input of a large amount of phosphate for the decomposition of c oligoclora in the overlying water caused phosphate migration from the overlying water to the sediment making the sediment become the sink of phosphorus and changed the distribution of phosphorus fraction in the sediment zhang et al 2018b also found that the phosphorus released by dying algae accounted for more than 90 of the water body tp this part of phosphorus may be deposited in the sediment when the environment or biological factors change at swi endogenous phosphorus may re enter the overlying water through desorption dissolution or biological decomposition chen et al 2018 which would provide a nutritional basis for a new round of algal blooms 4 3 effects of the decomposition process of c oligoclora on bacterial community proteobacteria the dominant bacterial phylum showed the highest relative abundance in this study some studies have reported that it is the most abundant freshwater bacterial phylum associated with plant litters and it could break down stubborn carbon compounds in the litters or use degradation products and plant extracts such as acetate and phenol besemer et al 2012 zamanzadeh et al 2016 acinetobacter is a typical genus of denitrifying bacteria belonging to proteobacteria which has a strong ability to accumulate p guo et al 2018 it was relatively abundant in the late stage which also indicated that denitrification was more substantial than other chemical transformation processes there were a few noteworthy results that the relative abundance of anaerobic ammonia oxidising bacteria in this study was extremely low all 0 01 these results showed that denitrification mainly occurred in the anoxic and even anaerobic conditions which was consistent with the previous results of nitrogen distribution in various forms the relative abundance of acinetobacter in overlying water and sediments in the early stage was higher than that in the middle and late stages which indicated that the decomposition process of c oligoclora changed the composition of the dominant bacterial community the dominant genus pseudomonas which has a strong ability to decompose organic nitrogenous compounds to produce ammonia has also been affected du et al 2013 the relative abundance change showed the opposite trends in overlying water and sediment the variation of relative abundance in sediment and the overlying water also indicated that pseudomonas proliferated in large quantities after spreading from surface sediments to overlying water in the early stages this phylum then distributed to the surface sediments from the overlying water due to the stage of microbial colonisation and decomposition of difficult to decompose organic matter in the middle and later stages it confirmed that pseudomonas with ammoniation was the microorganism that mainly affected the concentration change of nh4 n at swi in this system brevundimonas is mostly reported to have the ability to degrade organic matter and it is common in fresh water zakharova et al 2013 bacteroidetes are another representative dominant phylum that can break down sugars to produce organic acids such as acetic acid and propionic acid ali et al 2014 and can quickly colonise and grow on plant surfaces wymore et al 2016 the massive growth of this bacterium verified the results that c oligoclora rapidly decayed and reduced biomass in the early stage of decomposition the functional bacteria flavobacterium belonging to bacteroidetes which can degrade proteins lipid cellulose and other macromolecular substances dong and reddy 2010 only have a relatively high abundance in the overlying water this abundance means that the soluble macromolecules produced by the c oligoclora degrading process mainly infiltrated the overlying water in the early and middle stages the release of a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in the early stage also stimulated the growth of rhizobium azohydromonas and azotobacterm associated with nitrogen fixation ability 0 2 which could promote the accumulation of nitrogen in the surface sediments in the late stage of decomposition anaerobes such as clostridium sensu stricto belonging to firmicutes a bacterium widely distributed in nature spread to the surface sediments after the decomposition began in this research zhao et al 2017 this spread of anaerobes revealed the gradual occurrence of an anaerobic reduction environment caused by decomposition it is also worth noting that in the late stage the growth of planctomycetes in both the overlying water and the sediment was significantly higher than that of other bacteria this finding may be related to the polysaccharide sulphate which could provide planctomycetes with more energy for growth during the later decomposing stage cai et al 2013 the decomposition process of c oligoclora in swi is summarised in the schematic diagram in fig 8 the abundance of the dominant bacterial communities in sediments and overlying water has changed significantly the specific acinetobacter with denitrification and phosphorus accumulation ability tended to spread from overlying water to surface sediments with the result of the relative abundance of acinetobacter in the sediment in stage iii significantly higher than that in the overlying water the redundancy analysis revealed that phosphorus mainly affected the bacterial community in the overlying water in the middle and late stages of decay and the correlation was greater therefore due to the microbial action po4 3 p could migrate to the sediment however pseudomonas promoted ammoniation and the migration of nh4 n from sediments to overlying water in stages ⅰ and ⅱ the nh4 n began to move from the overlying water to the sediments in stage iii caused by the distribution of pseudomonas to surface sediments the relative abundance of the other major dominant bacteria with degradation ability such as brevundimonas flavobacterium and clostridium sensu stricto were concentrated in stage ⅱ which also indicated that there was a stage of microbial mass reproduction and decomposition of organic matter in the decomposition process of c oligoclora moreover the correlation between the bacterial community and nitrogen in sediments was higher therefore the migration and transformation activities of various forms of nitrogen were relatively active it should be noted that our analysis has focused on the nutrient migration transformation and response of bacterial community structure during the degradation process of fga however some complex environmental condition limitations such as water flow sediment resuspension interference of growth and metabolism of aquatic animals and macrophytes and the aquarium wall effect of its own experimental system such as nutrient cycling chemical dynamics and physicochemical properties could occur during the process the priority of our future work will further refine the contribution of other environmental conditions and aquatic animal and macrophyte disturbances to the degradation of fga in combination with large scale experiments 5 conclusion our work illustrates that decaying c oligoclora will worsen the water environment in a short period and also cause drastic changes in the physical and chemical properties and bacterial community structure of the sediment microenvironment such changes are reflected in secondary pollution of the sediment and increasing the risk of releasing endogenous nutrients which greatly increases the possibility of phytoplankton blooms and will be detrimental to the restoration of aquatic ecology in addition the relative abundance and composition of major dominant bacteria in the microbial community changed significantly affecting the material cycle and energy flow of the ecosystem to a certain extent the potential ecological threat of opportunistic macroalgae such as cladophora means an abnormal proliferation needs more attention and research

17286,humic acids ha are common mediators in redox reactions in the aquatic environment the structures and properties of ha are greatly influenced by environmental factors such as external electrons in this study qualitative changes in electron modified ha and the underlying mechanisms were reported which not only contribute to understanding the fate of ha and their impact on organic pollutants but could facilitate their potential use for water purification the photochemical activity and electron donating capacity of ha were improved due to the increase of phenolic and carboxyl components via the reduction modification by electrons creating a novel and efficient photo bio electro fenton system mediated by ha under neutral conditions without the use of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the in situ continuous production of h2o2 ensured an adequate supply of hydroxyl radicals in this coupled system achieving mineralization 92 of ha and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 a common synthetic estrogen with high estrogenic potency two degradation pathways with five degradation intermediates of ee2 were identified in our study effluents from the coupled system showed decreased endocrine disrupting activity our findings demonstrated a new approach for the in situ modification and potential use of ha for water treatment and particularly the concurrent degradation of ha and organic pollutants

introduction humic acids ha are a form of dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitous in the aquatic environment bolan et al 2011 indeed they play a pivotal role in adsorbing other organics chelating trace metals and mediating the transformation of pollutants dong et al 2020 porras et al 2014 sharpless et al 2014 ha also act as the carbon and nitrogen sources and electron shuttles for microorganisms lovley et al 1996 ha are therefore crucial for the carbon cycle and material conversion in the global environment al reasi et al 2013 sankar et al 2019 although the chemical behavior of ha is a focus of research in the environmental field ma and yates 2018 the processes by which their transformation and interaction with environmental factors such as electrons and photons remains uncertain therefore in depth mechanism investigation and analysis are essential to advance the understanding of the environmental fate of ha and facilitate the development of their potential application in addition to their mediating abilities ha also help promote photo fenton reactions fujii et al 2015 photo fenton is an important method for water purification and has been studied for years pesqueira et al 2020 but there still are considerable challenges in applying this in practical applications including ph control and the risks involved in using h2o2 effective regeneration of fe ii has been another topic actively researched in recent decades li et al 2020a some researchers have reported the chelation of ha with metal ions wang et al 2020 the carboxyl in ha will provide sites that bind iron then transfer electrons to iron under illumination by a process called ligand metal charge transfer lmct and such lmct process accelerates the cycle of fe iii fe ii goncalves et al 2020 what is required is a kind of ha with many binding sites and a system with continuous electrons generated there have however been few reports of the modification of ha to increase their chemical activity and mediating ability especially in the reduction modification by exogenetic electrons it is well known that ha can accept electrons from bacteria or other electron donors but the qualitative changes of ha during its modification need further research to utilize and treat it better bioelectrochemical system bes is a suitable tool to achieve the reduction modification of ha electrons produced by bacteria can be transmitted to another chamber through a bes with specificity and excellent controllability li et al 2020b a bes in fact is a useful technology to remove contaminants and it can also generate electricity jafary et al 2017 however it has some limitations for its commercial application for instance electrons at a bes cathode reduce fe iii and o2 to fe ii and h2o2 thereby triggering the bio electro fenton bef reaction but the h2o2 production rate is low and the treatment period is too long li et al 2018 therefore it is conducive to the sustainable treatment of wastewater when it integrated with other technologies li et al 2014 ha excited by irradiation may make contribution to the bef system some chromophores in ha can absorb light energy to generate reactive oxygen species such as excited ha 3ha h2o2 1o2 oh etc latch and mcneill 2006 wenk et al 2011 based on the photochemical activity of ha and the reaction mechanism of photo fenton the mediation of ha and the assist of irradiation might help alleviate these drawbacks in theory that is the coupled photo bio electro fenton system mediated by ha might be a promising technique to break the inherent limits of traditional fenton reaction while ha are often used to modify functional materials and to mediate degradation of pollutants in water treatment they also have been found to be the ubiquitous pollutants in drinking water trellu et al 2016 ha also have an adverse effect on the running of a single phase or semi continuous anaerobic digestion li et al 2019a li et al 2019b condensation and membrane filtration are practical methods for removing ha hwang et al 2013 but an efficient mineralization technique is needed to deal with the secondary pollutants produced in the treatment process yao et al 2017 the coupled photo bio electro fenton system may be the answer moreover the conjunction of ha with estrogens is a common phenomenon which may alter or even increase the ecological risks of the latter one such contaminant is 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 which is known to disrupt the hormone balance in some organisms its endocrine disrupting effects exceed those of some other estrogens by three orders of magnitude yao et al 2018 however ee2 cannot be entirely degraded by conventional wastewater treatment processes gu et al 2016 huang et al 2013 the efficient removal of it and other similar estrogens has been attracting much research attention in the field of water treatment in recent years adeel et al 2017 varga et al 2019 yao et al 2018 it is essential to develop a high efficiency advanced oxidation system capable of removing both ha and ee2 in neutral condition this study investigated the modified mechanism of ha and found its novel application to mediate the coupled fenton reaction in neutral water these relied primarily on spectroscopic and electrochemical methods ha as both mediators and pollutants were added to a photolytic system assisted by a bes ee2 was selected as a representative of estrogen to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment using a new coupled photo bio electro fenton technique the degradation pathways and the estrogenic activity were examined to assess ecological risk these findings should not only help explain how ha can be used efficiently but also allow the development of an optimized effective and energy saving method for treating or even reclaiming wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 modification and degradation experiments all information on chemicals was presented in text s1 of the supplementary materials solutions of ha and sodium anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs dissolved in 0 5 mm anaerobic phosphate buffer ph 6 2 were added into bes to be the catholyte respectively ha 10 mg l were modified in this way for 10 30 60 120 and 240 min all degradation processes were operated under aerobic conditions through continuous air sparging at a rate of 500 ml min the experimental setup is shown in text s2 and fig s1 the detection of degradation and mineralization rate is described in text s2 all samples were examined using the spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses described in text s3 2 2 the effects of reactive species two reactive oxygen species oh and 1o2 were analyzed to account for the mediating capacity of ha and modified ha mha via electron paramagnetic resonance epr the h2o2 and fe ii concentrations were also detected to explore the roles of reactive oxygen species in a single only bes or photolysis and coupled bes assisted photolytic systems qualitative and quantitative quenching experiments were carried out he et al 2016 200 0 μm tba 500 0 μm sa and 200 0 μm ffa were used to quench oh 3ha and 1o2 respectively the tpa reacted with oh to generate 2 hydroxyl terephthalic acid molecules which were used to quantify the oh produced in the reactions he et al 2018 detailed methods are provided in text s3 2 3 analytical methods uv visible spectroscopy three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission spectra 3d eems fourier transform infrared spectra ftir and high pressure size exclusion chromatography hpsec were used for the characterization of changes in structures and properties of ha and ee2 the changes in redox activity of mha were analyzed by measuring its electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc details of these methods can be found in text s3 suva254 is a good indicator of the surrogate aromaticity of ha it is defined as the ratio of uv absorbance at 254 nm in m 1 to the toc concentration in mg l δlgk and the fluorescence index fi were also used to indicate the oxidability and aromaticity chen et al 2012 the humification index hix is a measure of humic substance content or the extent of humification lee et al 2018 these indicators were quantified as follows 1 suv a 254 a 254 toc 2 δ lgk lg a 400 a 600 the a α is the value of absorbance at α nm 3 fi f e x 370 nm e m 470 nm f e x 370 nm e m 520 nm

methods text s5 the cell viability was calculated as 7 cell viability a t a b 100 where a t and a b are the absorbances of the treated and blank cultures respectively 2 4 electrochemical characterization of the bes an electrochemical workstation was used to detect the voltage in the external circuit the output current the power density using cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis a scanning electron microscope was used to observe the morphology and structure of the microbial membrane on the anode plate fig s2 the results of biodiversity analysis are shown in fig s3 detailed methods are provided in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 modified mechanisms of ha 3 1 1 changes in optical properties for modification the modified ha in bes were detected at different times to reveal the specific effect of electron on the properties photochemical and electrochemical activity and components functional groups and molecular weights of ha and to investigate the modified mechanism via uv visible spectra 3d eems ftir hpsec and electrochemical workstation with a conventional three electrode cell the epr was used to test the photogenerated reactive oxygen species of modified ha and the pristine one uv visible spectra were used to monitor any changes in the light absorption characteristics of modified aqs and ha aqs as a quinone model has photochemical behavior similar to that of ha gu et al 2016 the aqs was modified for 10 hours with the results shown in fig 1 a all the modified samples showed absorption peaks near 216 nm which were attributed to the e absorption band generated by benzene like structure of aqs the two absorption bands showed a slight blueshift and an obvious redshift respectively with increasing time of modification the blueshift was caused by intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group in the benzene like structure that suggests that the external electrons affected the bonds of the functional groups on the benzene ring besides the production of some auxochrome was one of the reasons for the redshift which produced a p π conjugation effect peaks near 330 nm of the r absorption band attributed to n π transition of the carbonyl group in the quinone structure weakened significantly during the modification at the same time an energetic absorption band appeared at 381 nm assigned to semiquinone radicals gan and whitten 1993 the weak absorption band near 430 nm was probably caused by the triplet absorption of aqs these results indicate that exogenous electrons can transform functional groups and change electron arrangements and transitions a notable change occurred in the absorbance spectra of ha fig 1b the absorption of mha in the 200 700 nm interval strengthened unlike the aqs this suggests that the mha contained more or stronger light absorbing functional groups and with time a hyperchromic effect appeared at 216 nm and 400 nm the two strengthened absorption bands were assigned to the conjugation effect of aromatic structure and the generation of semiquinone or hydroquinone reszka et al 2003 aromaticity is characterized by a cyclic closed conjugated system whose π electrons are highly delocalized this structure has low energy and relative stability which results in the reaction of electrophilic substitution rather than addition reactions the modified ha have a higher aromaticity than the pristine one the reaction between aromatic structure and oh mainly relies on addition reaction but the strong conjugated effect made this reaction more difficult to achieve as a result an increase in the aromaticity of ha reduced its ability of quenching for oh suva254 and δlgk were also calculated as surrogate indicators of aromaticity with the results shown in table 1 the values of suva254 show that the aromaticity of mha was greater than that of pristine ha pha the δlgk data provided the same evidence in fig s4 the decrease in fluorescence intensity is clear the fluorescence quenching in mha was intensified and the groups with fluorescence effect were changed greatly in the modification calculated fi and hix are presented in table 1 to represent the aromaticity and humification of ha the modification increased both indicators significantly these results further confirm sharpless conjecture sharpless et al 2014 that phenols are more critical for ha photosensitivity in water than quinones 3 1 2 changes of redox activity in modification the redox activity of ha is derived from the mutual transformation between phenolic and quinone groups sharpless and blough 2014 the eacs and edcs of ha and mha were analyzed to investigate the changes of their redox activities as a result of accepting electrons some oxidizable groups like quinones were reduced which decreased the eac and increased the edc of mha figs 1c d interestingly the eac and edc both increased after 60 minutes the nonlinear change in eac may be due to the production of new functional groups that is the modification process not only involved simple reduction but caused cleavage of molecules or interactions between different molecules eqs 8 and 9 suggest some possibilities the changes in functional groups and molecular weight of mha are therefore important toinvestigate 8 h a ox e h a red 9 h a ox h a red 2 mha 3 1 3 changes of molecular composition in modification the irregular changes in the redox activity of mha were investigated by characterizing the functional groups and molecular weight of ha as the modification proceeded there could have been bond stretching in oh c o mainly cooh and coc bonds ren et al 2017 as shown in fig 1e importantly oh and c o were the primary chromophores in ha and their increase would enhance the light absorption of ha at the same time oh and cooh influence the hydrophilic properties of ha that is why the hydrophilicity of the ha was enhanced in the modification process to verify these results hpsec was used to evaluate the changes in molecular weights of mha the components of the pha indicated by peaks i and iv in fig 1f were two major parts as the time of modification increased peaks ii and v indicating smaller molecular weights gradually appeared and increased that shows a decomposition of macromolecules caused by electron transfer or the intermolecular interactions during the modification of ha in the bes fig s5 calculation results in our previous study he et al 2018 indicated that compared with high molecular weight dom low molecular weight dom contributed more to the carboxyl group content and less to the phenolic hydroxyl group main chromophoric group content the low molecular weight dom also had a much higher quinone group content these properties are beneficial to the redox activity but not the photolysis however difference was found in this study that both the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl group contents were increased with the decrease of the molecular weight of ha the increase of phenolic hydroxyl content was mainly due to the reduction of some quinone groups by electrons therefore the low molecular weight ha from the modification process played a more important role for both the photolysis and the electron shuttle 3 1 4 changes in the production of reactive oxygen species under illumination the relative concentration levels of two main reactive oxygen species oh and 1o2 were detected via epr method compared with ha there was a stronger intensity of oh for mha solution the production of oh in mha solution is derived from the reaction between hared and o2 page et al 2012 fig 2 a however the 1o2 intensity of mha was lower than that of pha fig 2b it is consistent with the previous report that the processes generating 1o2 and h2o2 were competing dalrymple et al 2010 the phenols in ha are more favorable for oh generation in water than the quinones the modification thus improved the ability of ha to help in the degradation of pollutants 3 2 effects of ha and irradiation on the performance of the bes the voltage power density cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance of the bes were measured with four cathode conditions to reveal the influence of ha fe iii and illumination on performance of bes shown in fig 3 compared with the i group the control the voltages of the ii iii and iv groups in the external circuit were higher by 4 6 8 7 and 12 9 respectively over 10 hours fig 3a the power output improved by 7 8 with the addition of ferric ions and by 19 6 with both light and ferric ions and by 34 0 with light ferric ions and ha fig 3b figure 3c shows that the background current increased under irradiation indicating that illumination accelerated the rate of redox reaction this process made contribution to the electron transfer from anode to cathode in bes the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data were fitted using an equivalent circuit diagram as shown in table s1 figure 3d shows the alternating current impedance spectra of the different catholytes r ct charge transfer internal resistance was significantly reduced with the addition of ha under illumination which also indicates that the ha and its photochemical reaction process accelerated the flow of electrons from electrode to solution ha played a role of electron shuttle in the photoreaction process increasing the utilization of electrons moreover there was a low r s ohmic internal resistance of the solution value in the irradiated ha fe iii electrolyte better charge transfer resulted in higher electron utilization that suggests that the coupled system had lower resistance in the electron shuttling which improved the electricity generation 3 3 removal of ee2 and ha in single and coupled systems 3 3 1 removal effectiveness of ee2 and ha the influence of the concentrations of fe iii and ha on ee2 photodegradation was investigated to obtain a suitable fe iii to ha concentration ratio the results shown in fig s6 led to 5 mg c l of ha and 100 μm fe iii being used in the subsequent experiments degradation and mineralization of ee2 and ha in three systems are compared in fig 4 a when the solution contained only ferric ions the ee2 degradation rates ranked as coupled system bes photolytic system with both ha and ferric ions degradation rates were in order of couple system photolytic system bes coupling photolytic with bioelectrochemical reaction significantly increased the degradation rate it is worth noting that the degradation in the coupled system mediated by ha and ferric ions showed a distinctive mode of removal compared with the other conditions the high degradation rate was maintained even in the second half of process this indicates that the generation and utilization of reactive oxygen species were continuous in the coupled systems the combination of ha and ferric ions was more effective than either ha or ferric ions alone under illumination but in the bes ha competed with fe iii and o2 for electrons which impeded the fenton reaction that process was however helpful for the photolysis of ha due to the in situ modification of ha on average the mineralization rates in photolysis system bes and coupled fenton processes were 45 57 and 79 respectively fig 4b therefore the coupled system had a greater mineralization rate than the other two and the result is consistent with the degradation rates 3 3 2 concentrations of h2o2 and fe ii and their influence on production of oh the h2o2 concentration and fe iii fe ii cycles are two main impact factors on fenton reaction efficiency it can be inferred from fig s7 that the concentrations of h2o2 and fe ii were positively correlated with ee2 degradation in single photolytic system and it is well known that 3ha is a crucial h2o2 precursor eqs 10 and 11 dalrymple et al 2010 fe ii was produced by the photolysis of fe oh 2 eq 12 and lmct process eq 13 both processes are vital for photo fenton efficiency 10 ha hv 1 ha hv 3 ha 11 3 ha o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 1 ha 12 fe oh 2 hv f e 2 oh 13 fe iii ha hv h a fe ii to fully understand the roles of h2o2 and fe ii in the various systems their concentrations were detected through the entire degradation process as is shown in fig 5 a the h2o2 concentrations also correlated positively with the extent of ee2 degradation in single bes and coupled systems remarkably h2o2 concentration increased over time in the coupled systems eqs 11 14 and 15 show some of the ways in which it was generated 14 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 15 2 fe iii 2 h 2 o o 2 hv 2 fe ii 2 h 2 o 2 fe ii can be produced in three ways shown in eqs 13 15 and 16 however concentrations of fe ii were not positively correlated with ee2 degradation rate in single bes and coupled systems fig 5b it suggests that the coupled fenton system weakened the influence of fe ii concentration on the production of oh eq 17 16 fe iii e fe ii 17 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh o h the concentrations of oh were positively correlated with those of h2o2 and with the degradation and mineralization rates in three systems fig 5c hence the oh was mainly produced through the decomposition of h2o2 besides the fe ii decomposing h2o2 there were other ways in which h2o2 decomposed eqs 18 and 19 in the coupled system and the strong reducer ha reacting with o2 also generated oh eqs 20 and 21 18 h 2 o 2 e aq hv oh o h 19 h 2 o 2 e oh o h 20 3 ha e h a 21 h a o 2 2 h ha 2 oh 3 3 3 contribution of reactive oxygen species on ee2 degradation to evaluate the influence of reactive oxygen species on the degradation of ee2 sa ffa and tba were added to quench 3ha 1o2 and oh in the ha mediated photolytic and coupled systems the quenching inhibited ee2 degradation after 8 hours of photolytic in the order oh 3ha 1o2 and in the coupled system the order was oh 1o2 3ha as shown in fig 5d in both cases oh was the most important reactive oxygen species oh is a typical electrophile with many ways to oxidize organic pollutants moreira et al 2017 with ee2 it can add to an unsaturated carbon atom structure such as c c cc and aromatic ring oh often extracts electrons from aromatic rings carbon carbon double bonds and carboxylate or ester structures nosaka and nosaka 2017 moreover ha react with photons to produce 1ha and 3ha under illumination eq 14 wenk et al 2011 quenching 3ha reduced the ee2 degradation in the coupled system by 13 7 which was more than in the photolytic process 10 5 this result further demonstrates that in situ modification improved the photochemical activity of ha and the utilization of 3ha 3 4 degradation mechanism of ee2 in the coupled system 3 4 1 effects of controllable reactor elements on removal effectiveness to understand the roles of two controllable reactor elements photolytic chamber s volume and cathode plate s area in the coupled system the reactor was retrofitted to increase the volume of the photolytic chamber vp and thus improve the luminous flux fig 6 a shows that enlarging the vp increased the degradation rate significantly when the vp v was 6 10 the maximum degradation rate of ee2 was 87 2 at the end of the reaction after 3 hours the area of the cathode plate was also increased to improve the utilization of electrons as fig 6b shows the degradation rate increased with the augmented cathode plate area however the changes in degradation patterns caused by the changes in the two factors were different it is noteworthy that the degradation rate within 30 min was much higher than that in the subsequent process fig 6b according to a previous study xu et al 2013 this rule of degradation could be caused by a change in the concentration ratio of fenton reagent the observed total mineralization is shown in figs 6c and d consistent with the results of degradation rates maximum mineralization reached 92 in the larger configuration for irradiation at the end of the reaction furthermore unlike the one hour data there was almost no difference in mineralization at 8 h among the four plate with different areas fig 6d and the maximum was only 82 therefore the photochemical processes dominated in the coupled system with the unmodified plate for the application of this coupling system enhancing the photochemical process is a better option compared with the improvement of the part of electrochemistry 3 4 2 changes in the composition and structure of ha fe iii and ee2 ftir absorbance spectra were recorded to examine the changes in functional groups during degradation in figs 7 a c the bands assigned to oh and coo stretching declined in the reaction peak stretching vibrations decreased more obviously in the coupled system than that in single two but there were no significant changes during the first half of the reaction time which might result from the increase of oh and coo through the modification of ha and the hydroxylation reaction fig 1e the disintegration and mineralization of macromolecules mainly occurred in second half of the reaction thus the continuous generation of oh was vital to effective ee2 decomposition mapping 3d eems data is a useful tool for evaluating the changes in the composition and structure of ha and ee2 chen et al 2003 li and sun 2014 those spectra in the coupled system are presented in figs 7d f there were two ee2 characteristic peaks and one ha fe iii characteristic peak the peak position changed markedly when ha complexed with fe iii the main peak locations fluorescence intensities and their ratios are summarized in table 2 as the ha were mineralized gradually the fluorescence response was faded besides there were blue shifts of peaks i and ii in both the excitation and emission spectra which was associated with the decomposition of concentrated aromatic groups a decrease in aromatic ring content and the fragmentation of macromolecules li and sun 2014 therefore the stable benzene ring and other macromolecular structures could be destroyed in the coupled system to improve further degradation of by products 3 4 3 by products and ee2 degradation pathways ee2 degradation pathways in the coupled fenton system were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer running in positive ion mode the mass spectra are shown in fig s8 compounds with parent ions at m z 250 m z 297 m z 268 m z 280 and m z 148 were detected there were two ee2 degradation pathways in the coupled system structural formula b in fig s9 shows that the phenolic hydroxyl group is converted to a ketone carbonyl group the carbonyl groups were then further oxidized to co2 and h2o by active oxidizing groups such as oh and 3ha and hydroxyl groups substituted for hydrogen atoms at the ortho positions those hydroxyl groups were then oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids pan et al 2014 there was also an oxidation triggered by 1o2 as shown in structural formula c phenolic hydroxyl group of ee2 was dehydrogenated at the same time the hydrogen atoms bonded with the carbon atoms were replaced by peroxy groups min and boff 2002 and olefin elimination reactions occurred in the six membered ring which is not a benzene ring double bonds were cyclo added by 1o2 to form the dioxetane like structural formula g the parent ion at m z 148 was obtained through two elimination reactions after oxidative cleavage of the six membered ring at the position of benzene ring 3 5 evaluation of estrogenic activity mcf 7 cells were used to evaluate the estrogenic activity of the final treated solutions in coupled system the original solutions were diluted to 10 5 and 10 4 v v for the testing the results are presented in fig 8 more concentrated suspensions had slower rates of proliferation given that the cells were able to accept and utilize the estrogenic activity more fully at lower concentrations but the suspensions showed a declining effect of estrogenic activity overtime at both diluted concentrations although the treated solutions still contained some intermediates the oxidation of the phenolic hydroxyl group and the decomposition of the benzene ring suppressed the estrogenic activity significantly overall the coupled system is a feasible way to degrade ee2 and ha to low estrogenic activity 4 conclusion in this study the modification on ha in bes dramatically improved its mediating capacity these changes in structures and molecular compositions for modified ha suggested that new components with small molecular weight and more chromophoric group mainly phenolic hydroxyl group were considerable determinants of aquatic ha optical properties a high mineralization rate of ha and ee2 92 was achieved by the bes assisted photo fenton system in neutral condition the multiple production pathways of oh reduced the threats of fe ii concentration change and guaranteed the continuous oxidative degradation in the coupling system thus a bes assisted photolysis technology is a high efficiency modified fenton method for treating residual ee2 and ha in reclaimed water besides the photochemical reaction process of ha fe iii in cathode improved the performance of bes via accelerating the consumption of electrons overall these findings demonstrated a new way for the application of ha and bes in the field of water purification and water reclamation while also provided a basis for concurrent

17286,humic acids ha are common mediators in redox reactions in the aquatic environment the structures and properties of ha are greatly influenced by environmental factors such as external electrons in this study qualitative changes in electron modified ha and the underlying mechanisms were reported which not only contribute to understanding the fate of ha and their impact on organic pollutants but could facilitate their potential use for water purification the photochemical activity and electron donating capacity of ha were improved due to the increase of phenolic and carboxyl components via the reduction modification by electrons creating a novel and efficient photo bio electro fenton system mediated by ha under neutral conditions without the use of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the in situ continuous production of h2o2 ensured an adequate supply of hydroxyl radicals in this coupled system achieving mineralization 92 of ha and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 a common synthetic estrogen with high estrogenic potency two degradation pathways with five degradation intermediates of ee2 were identified in our study effluents from the coupled system showed decreased endocrine disrupting activity our findings demonstrated a new approach for the in situ modification and potential use of ha for water treatment and particularly the concurrent degradation of ha and organic pollutants

introduction humic acids ha are a form of dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitous in the aquatic environment bolan et al 2011 indeed they play a pivotal role in adsorbing other organics chelating trace metals and mediating the transformation of pollutants dong et al 2020 porras et al 2014 sharpless et al 2014 ha also act as the carbon and nitrogen sources and electron shuttles for microorganisms lovley et al 1996 ha are therefore crucial for the carbon cycle and material conversion in the global environment al reasi et al 2013 sankar et al 2019 although the chemical behavior of ha is a focus of research in the environmental field ma and yates 2018 the processes by which their transformation and interaction with environmental factors such as electrons and photons remains uncertain therefore in depth mechanism investigation and analysis are essential to advance the understanding of the environmental fate of ha and facilitate the development of their potential application in addition to their mediating abilities ha also help promote photo fenton reactions fujii et al 2015 photo fenton is an important method for water purification and has been studied for years pesqueira et al 2020 but there still are considerable challenges in applying this in practical applications including ph control and the risks involved in using h2o2 effective regeneration of fe ii has been another topic actively researched in recent decades li et al 2020a some researchers have reported the chelation of ha with metal ions wang et al 2020 the carboxyl in ha will provide sites that bind iron then transfer electrons to iron under illumination by a process called ligand metal charge transfer lmct and such lmct process accelerates the cycle of fe iii fe ii goncalves et al 2020 what is required is a kind of ha with many binding sites and a system with continuous electrons generated there have however been few reports of the modification of ha to increase their chemical activity and mediating ability especially in the reduction modification by exogenetic electrons it is well known that ha can accept electrons from bacteria or other electron donors but the qualitative changes of ha during its modification need further research to utilize and treat it better bioelectrochemical system bes is a suitable tool to achieve the reduction modification of ha electrons produced by bacteria can be transmitted to another chamber through a bes with specificity and excellent controllability li et al 2020b a bes in fact is a useful technology to remove contaminants and it can also generate electricity jafary et al 2017 however it has some limitations for its commercial application for instance electrons at a bes cathode reduce fe iii and o2 to fe ii and h2o2 thereby triggering the bio electro fenton bef reaction but the h2o2 production rate is low and the treatment period is too long li et al 2018 therefore it is conducive to the sustainable treatment of wastewater when it integrated with other technologies li et al 2014 ha excited by irradiation may make contribution to the bef system some chromophores in ha can absorb light energy to generate reactive oxygen species such as excited ha 3ha h2o2 1o2 oh etc latch and mcneill 2006 wenk et al 2011 based on the photochemical activity of ha and the reaction mechanism of photo fenton the mediation of ha and the assist of irradiation might help alleviate these drawbacks in theory that is the coupled photo bio electro fenton system mediated by ha might be a promising technique to break the inherent limits of traditional fenton reaction while ha are often used to modify functional materials and to mediate degradation of pollutants in water treatment they also have been found to be the ubiquitous pollutants in drinking water trellu et al 2016 ha also have an adverse effect on the running of a single phase or semi continuous anaerobic digestion li et al 2019a li et al 2019b condensation and membrane filtration are practical methods for removing ha hwang et al 2013 but an efficient mineralization technique is needed to deal with the secondary pollutants produced in the treatment process yao et al 2017 the coupled photo bio electro fenton system may be the answer moreover the conjunction of ha with estrogens is a common phenomenon which may alter or even increase the ecological risks of the latter one such contaminant is 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 which is known to disrupt the hormone balance in some organisms its endocrine disrupting effects exceed those of some other estrogens by three orders of magnitude yao et al 2018 however ee2 cannot be entirely degraded by conventional wastewater treatment processes gu et al 2016 huang et al 2013 the efficient removal of it and other similar estrogens has been attracting much research attention in the field of water treatment in recent years adeel et al 2017 varga et al 2019 yao et al 2018 it is essential to develop a high efficiency advanced oxidation system capable of removing both ha and ee2 in neutral condition this study investigated the modified mechanism of ha and found its novel application to mediate the coupled fenton reaction in neutral water these relied primarily on spectroscopic and electrochemical methods ha as both mediators and pollutants were added to a photolytic system assisted by a bes ee2 was selected as a representative of estrogen to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment using a new coupled photo bio electro fenton technique the degradation pathways and the estrogenic activity were examined to assess ecological risk these findings should not only help explain how ha can be used efficiently but also allow the development of an optimized effective and energy saving method for treating or even reclaiming wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 modification and degradation experiments all information on chemicals was presented in text s1 of the supplementary materials solutions of ha and sodium anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs dissolved in 0 5 mm anaerobic phosphate buffer ph 6 2 were added into bes to be the catholyte respectively ha 10 mg l were modified in this way for 10 30 60 120 and 240 min all degradation processes were operated under aerobic conditions through continuous air sparging at a rate of 500 ml min the experimental setup is shown in text s2 and fig s1 the detection of degradation and mineralization rate is described in text s2 all samples were examined using the spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses described in text s3 2 2 the effects of reactive species two reactive oxygen species oh and 1o2 were analyzed to account for the mediating capacity of ha and modified ha mha via electron paramagnetic resonance epr the h2o2 and fe ii concentrations were also detected to explore the roles of reactive oxygen species in a single only bes or photolysis and coupled bes assisted photolytic systems qualitative and quantitative quenching experiments were carried out he et al 2016 200 0 μm tba 500 0 μm sa and 200 0 μm ffa were used to quench oh 3ha and 1o2 respectively the tpa reacted with oh to generate 2 hydroxyl terephthalic acid molecules which were used to quantify the oh produced in the reactions he et al 2018 detailed methods are provided in text s3 2 3 analytical methods uv visible spectroscopy three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission spectra 3d eems fourier transform infrared spectra ftir and high pressure size exclusion chromatography hpsec were used for the characterization of changes in structures and properties of ha and ee2 the changes in redox activity of mha were analyzed by measuring its electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc details of these methods can be found in text s3 suva254 is a good indicator of the surrogate aromaticity of ha it is defined as the ratio of uv absorbance at 254 nm in m 1 to the toc concentration in mg l δlgk and the fluorescence index fi were also used to indicate the oxidability and aromaticity chen et al 2012 the humification index hix is a measure of humic substance content or the extent of humification lee et al 2018 these indicators were quantified as follows 1 suv a 254 a 254 toc 2 δ lgk lg a 400 a 600 the a α is the value of absorbance at α nm 3 fi f e x 370 nm e m 470 nm f e x 370 nm e m 520 nm

methods text s5 the cell viability was calculated as 7 cell viability a t a b 100 where a t and a b are the absorbances of the treated and blank cultures respectively 2 4 electrochemical characterization of the bes an electrochemical workstation was used to detect the voltage in the external circuit the output current the power density using cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis a scanning electron microscope was used to observe the morphology and structure of the microbial membrane on the anode plate fig s2 the results of biodiversity analysis are shown in fig s3 detailed methods are provided in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 modified mechanisms of ha 3 1 1 changes in optical properties for modification the modified ha in bes were detected at different times to reveal the specific effect of electron on the properties photochemical and electrochemical activity and components functional groups and molecular weights of ha and to investigate the modified mechanism via uv visible spectra 3d eems ftir hpsec and electrochemical workstation with a conventional three electrode cell the epr was used to test the photogenerated reactive oxygen species of modified ha and the pristine one uv visible spectra were used to monitor any changes in the light absorption characteristics of modified aqs and ha aqs as a quinone model has photochemical behavior similar to that of ha gu et al 2016 the aqs was modified for 10 hours with the results shown in fig 1 a all the modified samples showed absorption peaks near 216 nm which were attributed to the e absorption band generated by benzene like structure of aqs the two absorption bands showed a slight blueshift and an obvious redshift respectively with increasing time of modification the blueshift was caused by intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group in the benzene like structure that suggests that the external electrons affected the bonds of the functional groups on the benzene ring besides the production of some auxochrome was one of the reasons for the redshift which produced a p π conjugation effect peaks near 330 nm of the r absorption band attributed to n π transition of the carbonyl group in the quinone structure weakened significantly during the modification at the same time an energetic absorption band appeared at 381 nm assigned to semiquinone radicals gan and whitten 1993 the weak absorption band near 430 nm was probably caused by the triplet absorption of aqs these results indicate that exogenous electrons can transform functional groups and change electron arrangements and transitions a notable change occurred in the absorbance spectra of ha fig 1b the absorption of mha in the 200 700 nm interval strengthened unlike the aqs this suggests that the mha contained more or stronger light absorbing functional groups and with time a hyperchromic effect appeared at 216 nm and 400 nm the two strengthened absorption bands were assigned to the conjugation effect of aromatic structure and the generation of semiquinone or hydroquinone reszka et al 2003 aromaticity is characterized by a cyclic closed conjugated system whose π electrons are highly delocalized this structure has low energy and relative stability which results in the reaction of electrophilic substitution rather than addition reactions the modified ha have a higher aromaticity than the pristine one the reaction between aromatic structure and oh mainly relies on addition reaction but the strong conjugated effect made this reaction more difficult to achieve as a result an increase in the aromaticity of ha reduced its ability of quenching for oh suva254 and δlgk were also calculated as surrogate indicators of aromaticity with the results shown in table 1 the values of suva254 show that the aromaticity of mha was greater than that of pristine ha pha the δlgk data provided the same evidence in fig s4 the decrease in fluorescence intensity is clear the fluorescence quenching in mha was intensified and the groups with fluorescence effect were changed greatly in the modification calculated fi and hix are presented in table 1 to represent the aromaticity and humification of ha the modification increased both indicators significantly these results further confirm sharpless conjecture sharpless et al 2014 that phenols are more critical for ha photosensitivity in water than quinones 3 1 2 changes of redox activity in modification the redox activity of ha is derived from the mutual transformation between phenolic and quinone groups sharpless and blough 2014 the eacs and edcs of ha and mha were analyzed to investigate the changes of their redox activities as a result of accepting electrons some oxidizable groups like quinones were reduced which decreased the eac and increased the edc of mha figs 1c d interestingly the eac and edc both increased after 60 minutes the nonlinear change in eac may be due to the production of new functional groups that is the modification process not only involved simple reduction but caused cleavage of molecules or interactions between different molecules eqs 8 and 9 suggest some possibilities the changes in functional groups and molecular weight of mha are therefore important toinvestigate 8 h a ox e h a red 9 h a ox h a red 2 mha 3 1 3 changes of molecular composition in modification the irregular changes in the redox activity of mha were investigated by characterizing the functional groups and molecular weight of ha as the modification proceeded there could have been bond stretching in oh c o mainly cooh and coc bonds ren et al 2017 as shown in fig 1e importantly oh and c o were the primary chromophores in ha and their increase would enhance the light absorption of ha at the same time oh and cooh influence the hydrophilic properties of ha that is why the hydrophilicity of the ha was enhanced in the modification process to verify these results hpsec was used to evaluate the changes in molecular weights of mha the components of the pha indicated by peaks i and iv in fig 1f were two major parts as the time of modification increased peaks ii and v indicating smaller molecular weights gradually appeared and increased that shows a decomposition of macromolecules caused by electron transfer or the intermolecular interactions during the modification of ha in the bes fig s5 calculation results in our previous study he et al 2018 indicated that compared with high molecular weight dom low molecular weight dom contributed more to the carboxyl group content and less to the phenolic hydroxyl group main chromophoric group content the low molecular weight dom also had a much higher quinone group content these properties are beneficial to the redox activity but not the photolysis however difference was found in this study that both the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl group contents were increased with the decrease of the molecular weight of ha the increase of phenolic hydroxyl content was mainly due to the reduction of some quinone groups by electrons therefore the low molecular weight ha from the modification process played a more important role for both the photolysis and the electron shuttle 3 1 4 changes in the production of reactive oxygen species under illumination the relative concentration levels of two main reactive oxygen species oh and 1o2 were detected via epr method compared with ha there was a stronger intensity of oh for mha solution the production of oh in mha solution is derived from the reaction between hared and o2 page et al 2012 fig 2 a however the 1o2 intensity of mha was lower than that of pha fig 2b it is consistent with the previous report that the processes generating 1o2 and h2o2 were competing dalrymple et al 2010 the phenols in ha are more favorable for oh generation in water than the quinones the modification thus improved the ability of ha to help in the degradation of pollutants 3 2 effects of ha and irradiation on the performance of the bes the voltage power density cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance of the bes were measured with four cathode conditions to reveal the influence of ha fe iii and illumination on performance of bes shown in fig 3 compared with the i group the control the voltages of the ii iii and iv groups in the external circuit were higher by 4 6 8 7 and 12 9 respectively over 10 hours fig 3a the power output improved by 7 8 with the addition of ferric ions and by 19 6 with both light and ferric ions and by 34 0 with light ferric ions and ha fig 3b figure 3c shows that the background current increased under irradiation indicating that illumination accelerated the rate of redox reaction this process made contribution to the electron transfer from anode to cathode in bes the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data were fitted using an equivalent circuit diagram as shown in table s1 figure 3d shows the alternating current impedance spectra of the different catholytes r ct charge transfer internal resistance was significantly reduced with the addition of ha under illumination which also indicates that the ha and its photochemical reaction process accelerated the flow of electrons from electrode to solution ha played a role of electron shuttle in the photoreaction process increasing the utilization of electrons moreover there was a low r s ohmic internal resistance of the solution value in the irradiated ha fe iii electrolyte better charge transfer resulted in higher electron utilization that suggests that the coupled system had lower resistance in the electron shuttling which improved the electricity generation 3 3 removal of ee2 and ha in single and coupled systems 3 3 1 removal effectiveness of ee2 and ha the influence of the concentrations of fe iii and ha on ee2 photodegradation was investigated to obtain a suitable fe iii to ha concentration ratio the results shown in fig s6 led to 5 mg c l of ha and 100 μm fe iii being used in the subsequent experiments degradation and mineralization of ee2 and ha in three systems are compared in fig 4 a when the solution contained only ferric ions the ee2 degradation rates ranked as coupled system bes photolytic system with both ha and ferric ions degradation rates were in order of couple system photolytic system bes coupling photolytic with bioelectrochemical reaction significantly increased the degradation rate it is worth noting that the degradation in the coupled system mediated by ha and ferric ions showed a distinctive mode of removal compared with the other conditions the high degradation rate was maintained even in the second half of process this indicates that the generation and utilization of reactive oxygen species were continuous in the coupled systems the combination of ha and ferric ions was more effective than either ha or ferric ions alone under illumination but in the bes ha competed with fe iii and o2 for electrons which impeded the fenton reaction that process was however helpful for the photolysis of ha due to the in situ modification of ha on average the mineralization rates in photolysis system bes and coupled fenton processes were 45 57 and 79 respectively fig 4b therefore the coupled system had a greater mineralization rate than the other two and the result is consistent with the degradation rates 3 3 2 concentrations of h2o2 and fe ii and their influence on production of oh the h2o2 concentration and fe iii fe ii cycles are two main impact factors on fenton reaction efficiency it can be inferred from fig s7 that the concentrations of h2o2 and fe ii were positively correlated with ee2 degradation in single photolytic system and it is well known that 3ha is a crucial h2o2 precursor eqs 10 and 11 dalrymple et al 2010 fe ii was produced by the photolysis of fe oh 2 eq 12 and lmct process eq 13 both processes are vital for photo fenton efficiency 10 ha hv 1 ha hv 3 ha 11 3 ha o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 1 ha 12 fe oh 2 hv f e 2 oh 13 fe iii ha hv h a fe ii to fully understand the roles of h2o2 and fe ii in the various systems their concentrations were detected through the entire degradation process as is shown in fig 5 a the h2o2 concentrations also correlated positively with the extent of ee2 degradation in single bes and coupled systems remarkably h2o2 concentration increased over time in the coupled systems eqs 11 14 and 15 show some of the ways in which it was generated 14 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 15 2 fe iii 2 h 2 o o 2 hv 2 fe ii 2 h 2 o 2 fe ii can be produced in three ways shown in eqs 13 15 and 16 however concentrations of fe ii were not positively correlated with ee2 degradation rate in single bes and coupled systems fig 5b it suggests that the coupled fenton system weakened the influence of fe ii concentration on the production of oh eq 17 16 fe iii e fe ii 17 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh o h the concentrations of oh were positively correlated with those of h2o2 and with the degradation and mineralization rates in three systems fig 5c hence the oh was mainly produced through the decomposition of h2o2 besides the fe ii decomposing h2o2 there were other ways in which h2o2 decomposed eqs 18 and 19 in the coupled system and the strong reducer ha reacting with o2 also generated oh eqs 20 and 21

on the degradation of ee2 sa ffa and tba were added to quench 3ha 1o2 and oh in the ha mediated photolytic and coupled systems the quenching inhibited ee2 degradation after 8 hours of photolytic in the order oh 3ha 1o2 and in the coupled system the order was oh 1o2 3ha as shown in fig 5d in both cases oh was the most important reactive oxygen species oh is a typical electrophile with many ways to oxidize organic pollutants moreira et al 2017 with ee2 it can add to an unsaturated carbon atom structure such as c c cc and aromatic ring oh often extracts electrons from aromatic rings carbon carbon double bonds and carboxylate or ester structures nosaka and nosaka 2017 moreover ha react with photons to produce 1ha and 3ha under illumination eq 14 wenk et al 2011 quenching 3ha reduced the ee2 degradation in the coupled system by 13 7 which was more than in the photolytic process 10 5 this result further demonstrates that in situ modification improved the photochemical activity of ha and the utilization of 3ha 3 4 degradation mechanism of ee2 in the coupled system 3 4 1 effects of controllable reactor elements on removal effectiveness to understand the roles of two controllable reactor elements photolytic chamber s volume and cathode plate s area in the coupled system the reactor was retrofitted to increase the volume of the photolytic chamber vp and thus improve the luminous flux fig 6 a shows that enlarging the vp increased the degradation rate significantly when the vp v was 6 10 the maximum degradation rate of ee2 was 87 2 at the end of the reaction after 3 hours the area of the cathode plate was also increased to improve the utilization of electrons as fig 6b shows the degradation rate increased with the augmented cathode plate area however the changes in degradation patterns caused by the changes in the two factors were different it is noteworthy that the degradation rate within 30 min was much higher than that in the subsequent process fig 6b according to a previous study xu et al 2013 this rule of degradation could be caused by a change in the concentration ratio of fenton reagent the observed total mineralization is shown in figs 6c and d consistent with the results of degradation rates maximum mineralization reached 92 in the larger configuration for irradiation at the end of the reaction furthermore unlike the one hour data there was almost no difference in mineralization at 8 h among the four plate with different areas fig 6d and the maximum was only 82 therefore the photochemical processes dominated in the coupled system with the unmodified plate for the application of this coupling system enhancing the photochemical process is a better option compared with the improvement of the part of electrochemistry 3 4 2 changes in the composition and structure of ha fe iii and ee2 ftir absorbance spectra were recorded to examine the changes in functional groups during degradation in figs 7 a c the bands assigned to oh and coo stretching declined in the reaction peak stretching vibrations decreased more obviously in the coupled system than that in single two but there were no significant changes during the first half of the reaction time which might result from the increase of oh and coo through the modification of ha and the hydroxylation reaction fig 1e the disintegration and mineralization of macromolecules mainly occurred in second half of the reaction thus the continuous generation of oh was vital to effective ee2 decomposition mapping 3d eems data is a useful tool for evaluating the changes in the composition and structure of ha and ee2 chen et al 2003 li and sun 2014 those spectra in the coupled system are presented in figs 7d f there were two ee2 characteristic peaks and one ha fe iii characteristic peak the peak position changed markedly when ha complexed with fe iii the main peak locations fluorescence intensities and their ratios are summarized in table 2 as the ha were mineralized gradually the fluorescence response was faded besides there were blue shifts of peaks i and ii in both the excitation and emission spectra which was associated with the decomposition of concentrated aromatic groups a decrease in aromatic ring content and the fragmentation of macromolecules li and sun 2014 therefore the stable benzene ring and other macromolecular structures could be destroyed in the coupled system to improve further degradation of by products 3 4 3 by products and ee2 degradation pathways ee2 degradation pathways in the coupled fenton system were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer running in positive ion mode the mass spectra are shown in fig s8 compounds with parent ions at m z 250 m z 297 m z 268 m z 280 and m z 148 were detected there were two ee2 degradation pathways in the coupled system structural formula b in fig s9 shows that the phenolic hydroxyl group is converted to a ketone carbonyl group the carbonyl groups were then further oxidized to co2 and h2o by active oxidizing groups such as oh and 3ha and hydroxyl groups substituted for hydrogen atoms at the ortho positions those hydroxyl groups were then oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids pan et al 2014 there was also an oxidation triggered by 1o2 as shown in structural formula c phenolic hydroxyl group of ee2 was dehydrogenated at the same time the hydrogen atoms bonded with the carbon atoms were replaced by peroxy groups min and boff 2002 and olefin elimination reactions occurred in the six membered ring which is not a benzene ring double bonds were cyclo added by 1o2 to form the dioxetane like structural formula g the parent ion at m z 148 was obtained through two elimination reactions after oxidative cleavage of the six membered ring at the position of benzene ring 3 5 evaluation of estrogenic activity mcf 7 cells were used to evaluate the estrogenic activity of the final treated solutions in coupled system the original solutions were diluted to 10 5 and 10 4 v v for the testing the results are presented in fig 8 more concentrated suspensions had slower rates of proliferation given that the cells were able to accept and utilize the estrogenic activity more fully at lower concentrations but the suspensions showed a declining effect of estrogenic activity overtime at both diluted concentrations although the treated solutions still contained some intermediates the oxidation of the phenolic hydroxyl group and the decomposition of the benzene ring suppressed the estrogenic activity significantly overall the coupled system is a feasible way to degrade ee2 and ha to low estrogenic activity 4 conclusion in this study the modification on ha in bes dramatically improved its mediating capacity these changes in structures and molecular compositions for modified ha suggested that new components with small molecular weight and more chromophoric group mainly phenolic hydroxyl group were considerable determinants of aquatic ha optical properties a high mineralization rate of ha and ee2 92 was achieved by the bes assisted photo fenton system in neutral condition the multiple production pathways of oh reduced the threats of fe ii concentration change and guaranteed the continuous oxidative degradation in the coupling system thus a bes assisted photolysis technology is a high efficiency modified fenton method for treating residual ee2 and ha in reclaimed water besides the photochemical reaction process of ha fe iii in cathode improved the performance of bes via accelerating the consumption of electrons overall these findings demonstrated a new way for the application of ha and bes in the field of water purification and water reclamation while also provided a basis for concurrent

17287,dissolved organic matter dom is a complex pool of compounds with a key role in the global carbon cycle to understand its role in natural and engineered systems efficient approaches are necessary for tracking dom quality and quantity fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis parafac is very widely used to identify and quantify different fractions of dom as proxies of dom source concentration and biogeochemical processing a major limitation of the parafac approach is the requirement for a large data set containing many variable samples in which the fractions vary independently this severely curtails the possibilities to study fluorescence composition and behavior in small or unique datasets herein we present a simple and inexpensive experimental procedure that makes it possible to mathematically decompose a small dataset containing only highly correlated fluorescent fractions the approach which uses widely available commercial extraction sorbents and previously established protocols to expand the original dataset and inject the missing chemical variability can be widely implemented at low cost a demonstration of the procedure shows how a robust six component parafac model can be extracted from even a river water dataset with only five bulk samples widespread adoption of the procedure for analyzing small fluorescence datasets is needed to confirm the suspected ubiquity of certain dom fluorescence fractions and to create a shared inventory of ubiquitous components such an inventory could greatly simplify and improve the use of fluorescence as a tool to investigate biogeochemical processing of dom in diverse water sources keywords chemometrics fdom cdom biogeochemistry data mining machine learning abbreviations dom dissolved

engineered aquatic environments bianchi 2011 ridgwell and arndt 2014 a variety of different approaches identify and quantify dom with varying degrees of molecular insight and analytical complexity mccallister et al 2018 mopper et al 2007 amongst the more rapid and affordable techniques ultraviolet visible spectroscopy gives insight into the optically active fractions termed chromophoric dom cdom determined via absorbance measurements and fluorescent dom fdom characterized through fluorescence measurements despite decades of study the chemical origin of dom s optical properties and the chemical interpretation of the obtained signals remains poorly constrained aiken 2014 rosario ortiz and korak 2017 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems of dom consist of broad emission spectra whose maxima tend to increase with increasing excitation wavelength coble et al 1990 in an effort to assign chemical interpretations fluorescence emission in different wavelength regions is commonly attributed to chemical fractions or else is assigned a primary source such as terrestrial organic matter coble 2007 eems can be analyzed quantitatively under the assumption that the observed signals are due to the superposition of distinct fluorescence phenomena that could theoretically convert to concentrations if the true fluorescence quantum yields were known however fluorophores and meaningful fluorescence quantum yields remain largely unknown additionally there is an ongoing debate on the origin and behavior of dom fluorescence signals and part of dom s fluorescence emission has been attributed to charge transfer interactions between donor and acceptor species mckay 2020 mckay et al 2018 sharpless and blough 2014 regardless of the underlying principles that cause dom fluorescence it has been observed that eems dominated by autochthonous or allochthonous material seem to largely consist of statistically similar fluorescence spectra suggesting that ubiquitous signals may exist murphy et al 2018 to appropriately interpret fluorescence eems and reliably establish the properties and biogeochemical distribution of fluorescence signals overlapping fluorescence spectra must be reliably separated mathematical approaches are often deployed to separate and distinguish between superimposed fluorescence phenomena in eems murphy et al 2014a stedmon et al 2003 the most widely adopted tool is a chemometric model called parallel factor analysis parafac which identifies the underlying fluorescence spectra that best explain the observed patterns in the data set assuming linearly additive signals under ideal conditions when model assumptions are fulfilled see murphy et al 2013 all systematic fluorescence emission will be accounted for and the true spectra of underlying fluorophores can be well approximated bro 1997 most importantly parafac assumes that fluorescence eems are made up of a limited number of fluorescence phenomena with invariant excitation and emission spectra frustratingly dom fluorescence eems are typically very similar and many eems are needed so that a parafac analysis produces meaningful components stedmon and bro 2008 there are several scenarios in which the conditions for a successful application of parafac may not be met in particular since parafac identifies the spectra of underlying fractions via their change in abundance relative to other fractions it fails when samples are few and or the abundances of underlying fractions are too correlated in that case parafac will represent multiple discrete fractions as a single component with intermediate spectral properties with only a small number of fractions being identified in total increasing sample size by supplementing a dataset with unrelated samples is not usually a solution to this problem since at the other extreme parafac fails if samples are too different and can t be represented by the linear superposition of a relatively small number of spectra typically 10 plus only random error numerous studies have attempted to overcome this problem by redeploying models that were previously established using large datasets fellman et al 2009 miller et al 2006 romera castillo et al 2014 yamashita and jaffé 2008 but this approach relies on presumptions that are impossible to verify including that the original model recovered only chemically meaningful spectra and that both the underlying fluorescence phenomena and the instrumental measurement error structures have remained constant between developing and redeploying the model earlier work demonstrated that numerous processes including size fractionation metal quenching and biodegradation each introduce compositional variability that can be exploited by parafac to separate underlying fluorescence fractions cuss and guéguen 2012 guéguen et al 2013 stedmon and markager 2005 only recently however have various approaches been optimised with the aim of establishing reliable methods for extracting spectra from extremely small datasets containing as few as one bulk sample photodegradation size exclusion chromatography and asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation have been shown to produce the missing variability needed to overcome the basic limitations of one sample datasets guéguen et al 2013 lin and guo 2020 murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2017 however spectral averaging still occurs in some cases and the above mentioned one sample methods each involved expensive equipment together with complex analytical workflows which detracts from the inexpensive and rapid nature of dom fluorescence measurements the goal of this study was to develop a simple widely applicable method for extracting fluorescence spectra from datasets that cannot be reliably decomposed by traditional parafac methods due to too few samples and or the presence of strongly covarying fractions recent work highlights the widespread deficiencies caused by ignoring these critical constraints murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2017 the basic method involves augmenting the target dataset with fractionations obtained using three inexpensive and widely available solid phase extraction spe cartridges fig 1 this method is shown to overcome the dual limitations of small sample size and low chemical variability by introducing statistically meaningful variability and reducing covariance between the underlying fluorescence components 2 materials and procedures 2 1 samples whole water samples n 10 were collected at a drinking water treatment plant in southern sweden on september 24 october 14 and november 5 2019 n 9 as well as may 25 2020 n 1 the treatment plant is fed directly from the göta älv a 93 km long river at the west coast of sweden sourced from lake vänern that drains into the kattegat at the city of gothenburg the 2020 sample was taken at the river intake whereas the 2019 samples were taken at either the river intake n 3 or after primary biofilters n 6 all samples were filled into pre combusted amber glass bottles and transported directly from the sampling location to the laboratory where they were filtered with pre combusted gf f filters 0 7 µm 2019 samples or water flushed 0 2 µm syringe filters polysulfonate 2020 samples filters with 0 2µm pores remove a small additional fraction of absorbing and fluorescing colloidal matter compared with filtering through 0 7 µm pore size filters massicotte et al 2017 nimptsch et al 2014 we thus carried out our study under the assumption that samples filtered through 0 2 and 0 7 µm pores can be compared qualitatively if not quantitatively after filtration the samples were stored at 4 c in the dark all subsequent measurements below were done within five days of sampling dissolved organic carbon doc

technique solid phase extractions to supplement the small whole water dataset solid phase extractions spe were carried out on a single sample taken in may 2020 initially a range of pre packed commercially available sorbent materials were tested silica c2 c8 styrene divinylbenzene nh2 sax to identify those that produced high spectral variability across all permeates indicating varying time profiles for extracting different dom fractions each column was first cleaned by a methanol soak for a minimum of 24 h followed by a rinse with three column volumes of fresh methanol and ultrapure water at circumneutral ph before extractions were performed initial tests led to a shortlist of three well performing commercial sorbents sax strong anion exchange sorbent 100 mg agilent technologies nh2 aminopropyl bonded ion exchange sorbent 200 mg agilent technologies and ppl reverse phase sorbent 200 mg agilent technologies permeates from only these three sorbent materials were combined to produce the dataset analysed in this study fig 1 note that while the combination of sax nh2 and ppl permeates appeared to effectively fractionate fluorescent dom in the studied riverine samples other dom sources may require different or additional sorbents and or modified experimental protocols to achieve comparable success approximately 45 ml of sample at ambient ph approx 6 8 was subsequently applied onto each of the three columns a luer slip three way valve was installed after the column in order to divert the column permeate through a 5 ml luer slip syringe fig s1 the three way valve and sampling syringe were cleaned with 10 hcl and rinsed thoroughly with ultrapure water before use permeate samples 3 ml were drawn slowly by hand then the flow of sample was stopped until the next permeate collection the fluorescence cuvette was rinsed with one ml of the permeate sample and the remaining two ml were used for spectroscopic measurements this procedure was repeated until approximately 45 ml had passed over each of the columns since optical measurements and extractions were performed simultaneously the flow over the spe cartridge was stopped regularly for intervals of between five and fifteen minutes each extraction took between three and five hours to produce and measure up to 15 subsamples depending on the fluorometer settings below the three extractions were carried out sequentially and all measurements completed within 2 days 2 3 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence and absorbance measurements were obtained using a horiba aqualog fluorometer using a 10 mm quartz cuvette helma gmbh fluorescence emission was detected in the range of 220 800 nm increment 3 3 nm with an integration time between 3 and 9 s at excitation wavelengths between 240 nm and 450 nm increment 3 nm for the samples measured in 2020 and between 241 nm and 700 nm increment 3 nm for the 2019 samples the accuracy of the excitation monochromator emission detector and the optical immaculacy of cuvettes were validated daily following a previously described protocol wünsch et al 2015 excitation and emission offsets on each axis were corrected by adding three nm to the values reported by the instrument 2 4 data processing chemometrics spectroscopy data were processed in matlab v9 8 mathworks inc using the dreem toolbox version 0 6 0 murphy et al 2013 inner filter effects were eliminated with the absorbance based method kothawala et al 2013 and signals in each eem normalized using the raman peak area of ultrapure water since excitation wavelengths settings differed slightly between samples measured in 2019 compared to 2020 a 2d gridded linear interpolation was carried out to adjust the excitation axis of the 2019 eems to correspond to the eems measured in 2020 the two data sets were subsequently merged and 1st and 2nd order physical scatter was replaced with missing numbers no interpolation fluorescence emission longer than 650 nm or shorter than 310 nm was excluded from further analyses moreover emission scans at 358 1 312 6 and 519 7 nm were deleted after a preliminary analysis indicated frequent signal instability at these wavelengths frequent noisy measurements at excitation 246 nm also necessitated the exclusion of this excitation wavelength from further analyses several of the spe permeate eems were then removed from the data set either because of very low fluorescence signals or excessive instrument noise n 8 the underlying components of fluorescent dom in the samples were isolated with parafac using the dreem toolbox in conjunction with the n way toolbox andersson and bro 2000 murphy et al 2013 to avoid high leverages from the most fluorescent samples all eems were scaled by the 3 2th root of the standard deviation of each eem this scaling did not amplify measurement noise in low signal samples as severely as established methods scaling to unit variance but increased the weighting of these samples compared to the unscaled data set fig s2 models with two to seven components were explored all models were constrained to fit components with positive scores and loadings non negativity constraint each model was initialized with random orthogonalized numbers and the best model with lowest sse sum of squared errors out of 50 random initializations was selected a maximum of 104 iterations was allowed and relative change in fit of 10 8 was chosen as the convergence criterion 2 5 modeling approach parallel factor analysis was applied to two different data sets table 1 1 the small dataset consisting of ten whole water samples this first approach represents a conventional parafac analysis with the caveat that sample size and variability were likely insufficient for it to be possible to derive a valid parafac model 2 the augmented dataset consisting of the ten whole water samples and 37 spe permeates in line with previous research on extractions of dom andrew et al 2016 li et al 2017 li et al 2016 rosario ortiz et al 2007 wünsch et al 2018 it was assumed that different chemical fractions would be extracted at different rates moreover we hypothesized that permeates represent sub samples of the same original sample and not a set of wholly independent samples these assumptions were tested by viewing model residuals to ensure randomness investigating the degree of autocorrelation between components representing different fdom fractions and through cross validation to ensure that highly similar models were reached using different subsets of the dataset the obtained models were split half validated as follows the data set was divided into two randomly sampled halves consisting of approximately half the number of bulk and half the number of available spe permeate eems then the models obtained from each half compared visually and statistically all internal within study comparisons between spectra were based on the tucker congruence coefficient tcc for excitation spectra and the shift and shape sensitive congruence ssc for emission spectra where values larger than 0 95 signified indistinguishable spectra lorenzo seva and ten berge 2006 wünsch et al 2019 since the ssc is more sensitive toward differences between spectra this validation is more stringent than using tcc on both emission and excitation spectra inter study comparisons with 145 fluorescence models describing dom fluorescence was carried out using the openfluor database murphy et al 2014b all spectra with tccex 0 97 and tccem 0 98 were exported and compared further 3 results discussion the whole water samples from the drinking water treatment plant exhibited typical properties for water dominated by terrestrial dom for the two doc samples carbon concentrations were 4 3 and 3 7 mg l and the specific ultraviolet absorbance was 2 8 and 2 9 l x mg x c 1 x m 1 the fluorescence properties were highly similar across all ten bulk samples once concentration effects were removed by unit variance scaling fig 2 a c for example the coefficient of variation standard deviation divided by mean multiplied by 100 for peaks t excitation emission 275 340 c highest signal seen for excitation emission 320 360 420 460 and d excitation emission 390 509 was 7 5 1 6 and 5 6 coble 2007 lochmüller and saavedra 1986 similarly the humification ohno 2002 freshness parlanti et al 2000 and fluorescence indices maie et al 2006 were stable in all whole water samples 0 89 0 8 0 67 1 3 and 1 43 0 9 respectively the spectra of bulk fluorescence eems varied most in the range of excitation emission ex em 350 430 450 500 and 250 290 310 280 fig 2c for reference an average whole water eem is provided in figure s3a an attempt to obtain a valid parafac model from only the ten whole water eems was unsuccessful fig s4 because the small data set lacked the variability required by parafac to distinguish between several highly correlated fractions this failure is evidenced by models with between two and seven components containing one or more components with atypical features fig s4 highlighted components including multiple distinct emission peaks and nonsensical excitation spectra lacking absorption between consecutive absorption bands due to the small number of samples only a two component model could be split half validated 4 the augmentation approach augmenting the original whole water data set with the 37 spe permeates added the missing chemical and mathematical variability needed to acquire a valid parafac model the first indication of success was the significantly increased spectral variability in the raw eems fig 2b d which can be seen by the increased variation in predefined fluorescence peaks definitions above and fig 2 the coefficient of variation of peaks c and d increased from 1 6 and 5 6 in whole water samples to 6 4 and 14 1 in the augmented data set respectively similar results were seen for fluorescence indices covering different wavelength regions of the ultraviolet visible eem fig 2b d the average eem in the augmented data set also had visibly higher contributions of emission at short wavelengths low end of the visible spectrum fig s3 panel b compared to panel a in contrast to the model from only whole water samples the components in the augmented data set matched commonly observed spectra in fluorescent dom models with between three and six components described between 99 61 and 99 95 of the augmented data set a seven component model was excluded from further consideration since it seemed to overfit the data by using multiple highly similar components and multimodal emission peaks fig s5 bottom panel considering the component loadings and modelling error the six component model was the most appropriate representation of the augmented data set the model consisted of components with emission maxima at 330 390 410 450 and 510 nm fig 3 the components will henceforth be referred to by their longest excitation and sole emission maximum e g c280 330 components c280 330 c320 390 c300 410 c320 450 c350 450 and c380 510 had stokes shifts between 0 64 and 1 14 ev table 2 fluorescence emission of the whole water samples was dominated by c300 410 c350 450 and c380 510 which each contributed between 22 and 25 to the overall modelled fluorescence on average followed by c320 390 c320 450 with approx 10 and 13 on average lastly an average of 6 5 of the whole water eems were attributable to c280 330 table 2 see table for standard deviation of these averages each of the three spe sorbents differed in their removal efficiency for different spectra this meant that the autocorrelation between components in the entire augmented data set was never severe fig s6 in contrast whole water eems are often highly autocorrelated because dilution primarily affects all fractions of dom simultaneously murphy et al 2013 stedmon and markager 2005 yamashita et al 2008 since the decomposition of fluorescence eems with parafac assumes that no two fluorescence phenomena covary perfectly in their spectra or fluorescence intensities severe autocorrelations may invalidate a model bro 1997 murphy et al 2013 in future applications of eem parfac the augmentation of whole water eems with spe permeates thus provides a new method to decrease the autocorrelation between eems in a data set by introducing independent variability that would not occur naturally after the initial model exploration the six component model describing the augmented data set was successfully split half validated two models derived from random data set halves containing half of whole water samples and spe permeates each were highly similar to the model derived from the entire augmented dataset fig 3 it should be noted that a split half validation is usually conducted by modeling independent samples identifying the same model independently subsequently indicates that the model is an appropriate representation of the data set bro 1997 in our study the augmented data set consisted of ten independent whole water samples and 37 dependent spe permeate samples random halves thus partly consist of samples that originated from the fractionation of the same whole water sample in this case external comparisons with previously published models should be included to increase confidence in the identified model such comparisons are discussed below in the augmented data set the spe permeates outnumber the whole water samples this raises the possibility that the identified model could fit the spe permeates better than the whole water samples the lack of fit for permeates and whole water samples was therefore compared to assess the appropriateness of the model for the whole water samples the percentage of unexplained fluorescence was largest for the sax permeates and approximately equal for the remaining permeates and whole water samples fig s7 the larger residual for sax permeates was likely a consequence of the high removal efficiency of the sax resin which resulted in low fluorescence intensities and a high proportion of measurement noise in contrast the whole water samples were described well by the model and sample leverages indicated that permeates and whole water samples were equally important for the model fig s7a the overall model error was low and spectral residuals were reasonably flat and typical for dom fluorescence fig s7b c fig s8 overall this confirmed that whole water samples and permeates were equally well approximated by the model despite differences in sample size however future applications of the augmentation approach may require adjustments in data preprocessing particularly data scaling to carefully balance model outcome and sample weighting the dom samples from the göta älv had relatively high concentrations of doc along with abundant fluorescence emission given the abundance of whole water fluorescence signals the monitoring of spe permeates still recovered reasonable fluorescence signals despite the loss of material through the extraction in applications where the fractionated whole water sample has little fluorescence emission to start with e g marine samples the augmentation approach may require modification for example it may be not be feasible to obtain reasonable fluorescence signals from spe permeates in this case it may be necessary to focus on the spe extract instead of the permeate an elution of the spe dom with an increasing concentration of methanol and or acetone will likely reveal similar variability in terms of fluorescence composition 4 1 solid phase extraction performance in addition to new opportunities for fluorescence decomposition the monitoring of spe permeates also allows the characterization of dom polarity similar to the polarity rapid assessment method rosario ortiz et al 2007 contrary to usual protocols for ppl and c18 sorbents but similar to the polarity rapid assessment method samples were not acidified in our study rather ph was kept at ambient levels ph 6 8 to avoid possible ph induced changes to the fluorescence spectra of dom esteves et al 1999 after passing 45 ml though each cartridge the spe sorbents removed an average of 31 ppl 52 nh2 and 78 sax of whole water fluorescent dom from the extracted sample all sorbents were most efficient at the beginning of the extraction process and performance decreased with increasing permeate volume fig s9a among the three tested sorbents the permeate fluorescence properties changed least for ppl in contrast permeate fluorescence properties during nh2 and sax extractions changed considerably fig s9b the noticeably low efficiency of the ppl sorbent was expected due to the circumneutral ph during extraction in contrast the efficiency of the nh2 sorbent was comparable to previously reported values for extractions of suwanee river nom at ph 2 while the sax sorbent appeared more efficient than previously reported li et al 2017 we observed that none of the sax extract could be eluted with methanol and that the sorbent remained discolored after the attempted elution data not shown since extraction efficiencies are commonly estimated by comparing whole water and methanol eluate doc dittmar et al 2008 the previously reported low extraction efficiencies of the sax sorbent may simply be an artefact of the failure to elute extracted dom instead of a lack of dom adsorption onto the sorbent in this context continuous or sporadic fluorescence based monitoring of permeates during the extraction process may help to better understand the extraction process of dom in future studies the performance of spe sorbents depends on the interaction between dom and sorbent analyzing permeates may thus provide some degree of insight into the chemical properties of the extracted fluorescence components and the spe process itself future studies could compare the extractability of fdom at different ph or the extractability between dom from different sources at a constant ph four of the six identified components c280 330 c300 410 c320 450 and c380 510 showed significant spectral overlap with a previous study that investigated the spe performance of the ppl sorbent for marine dom samples fig 4 however a comparison in spe performance between the two studies is beyond the scope of this work since the two studies deviate with respect to both sample ph and dom source 4 2 comparison of fluorescence components with previous studies recent studies argue for the ubiquitous occurrence of fluorescence spectra in dom across a wide range of different aquatic environments ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2017 quantitative assessments of similarity have been made for all studies where data was available in repositories the longest emitting component c380 510 matches reoccurring component c2 identified by ishii and boyer 2012 c530 in lin guo 2020 c510 in wünsch et al 2017 and ubiquitous f520 in murphy et al 2018 furthermore c300 410 and c320 450 table 2 match further components that occur ubiquitously in different environments murphy et al 2018 c320 450 and c320 390 were also found in a single sample parafac study describing fdom in the milwaukee river lin and guo 2020 these findings provide further evidence for the ubiquitous occurrence of certain fluorescence spectra in dom and increase confidence in the identified six component model furthermore the agreement between previous single sample studies and the approach presented herein shows that intricate photochemistry murphy et al 2018 or chromatography type lin and guo 2020 wünsch et al 2017 fractionations can be replaced by or amended with a simplified methodology we further compared the fluorescence spectra identified

information in relation to the total number of compared studies the low rate of matches may suggest that our study identified rare components however we previously demonstrated that many published parafacpublished models likely rely on too few components in the visible wavelength range wünsch et al 2019 in contrast our study identified four components with emission maxima in the visible spectrum a degree of divergence to many of openfluors reference spectra is therefore to be expected the model in our study includes a component with broad emission peaking at 450 nm c320 450 that found few close matches in the openfluor database this component may occur less frequently i e is specific to the modelled data set or more likely it represents the combined signal from multiple unresolved fractions future applications of the augmentation approach for different samples should help to better constrain the distribution and spectral properties of this component numerous previous studies have observed that distinguishing signals in the ultraviolet a emission range is especially difficult murphy et al 2018 murphy et al 2010 in the ultraviolet a emission range 1st order raman and rayleigh scatter intersect and the energy output of fluorometer lamps is noticeably low cory et al 2010 nonetheless eem parafac models often feature at least one ultraviolet a emitting component wünsch et al 2019 in our study the only protein like fluorescence spectrum observed c280208 330 did not resemble a typical tryptophan like spectrum but instead emitted at shorter wavelengths since the model residuals were relatively flat in the tryptophan like region it is most likely that c2802 330 represents a mixture of multiple ultraviolet a emitting signals that could not be further separated due to similar extractability with different spe sorbents and overall low abundance of signals future implementations of the augmentation approach should focus on improving the separation in this regard emission in the ultraviolet a range is often associated with labile dom and capturing the turnover of this material depends on there being models that accurately reflect this material 5 conclusions future directions it is often claimed that at least 50 environmental samples are required for it to be possible to reliably isolate the underlying fluorescence spectra of dom the approach presented herein achieved this using only a few whole water samples combined with a simple experiment to generate solid phase extraction permeates ppl sax and nh2 sorbent we demonstrated the successful application of this approach by resolving the optical properties of six independently varying fluorescent fractions in dom samples from a swedish drinking water treatment facility while there is mounting evidence that certain fluorescence spectra occur ubiquitously in terrestrially and autochthonously derived dom most published studies do not include them spectral libraries like openfluor facilitate comparisons between studies but a logical next step is to incorporate the growing knowledge about ubiquitous spectra into a next generation modeling approach this requires rapid reliable and highly reproducible methods for resolving overlapping signals and isolating independent fluorescence spectra from small dom datasets the approaches presented here represent another critical step in this direction in addition to aiding the identification of fluorescence phenomena studying fdom behavior during extraction offers valuable insights into the chemical properties of these phenomena future research should aim to combine this approach with others that deliver insights into e g apparent molecular size guéguen et al 2013 lin and guo 2020 romera castillo et al 2014

17287,dissolved organic matter dom is a complex pool of compounds with a key role in the global carbon cycle to understand its role in natural and engineered systems efficient approaches are necessary for tracking dom quality and quantity fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis parafac is very widely used to identify and quantify different fractions of dom as proxies of dom source concentration and biogeochemical processing a major limitation of the parafac approach is the requirement for a large data set containing many variable samples in which the fractions vary independently this severely curtails the possibilities to study fluorescence composition and behavior in small or unique datasets herein we present a simple and inexpensive experimental procedure that makes it possible to mathematically decompose a small dataset containing only highly correlated fluorescent fractions the approach which uses widely available commercial extraction sorbents and previously established protocols to expand the original dataset and inject the missing chemical variability can be widely implemented at low cost a demonstration of the procedure shows how a robust six component parafac model can be extracted from even a river water dataset with only five bulk samples widespread adoption of the procedure for analyzing small fluorescence datasets is needed to confirm the suspected ubiquity of certain dom fluorescence fractions and to create a shared inventory of ubiquitous components such an inventory could greatly simplify and improve the use of fluorescence as a tool to investigate biogeochemical processing of dom in diverse water sources keywords chemometrics fdom cdom biogeochemistry data mining machine learning abbreviations dom dissolved

engineered aquatic environments bianchi 2011 ridgwell and arndt 2014 a variety of different approaches identify and quantify dom with varying degrees of molecular insight and analytical complexity mccallister et al 2018 mopper et al 2007 amongst the more rapid and affordable techniques ultraviolet visible spectroscopy gives insight into the optically active fractions termed chromophoric dom cdom determined via absorbance measurements and fluorescent dom fdom characterized through fluorescence measurements despite decades of study the chemical origin of dom s optical properties and the chemical interpretation of the obtained signals remains poorly constrained aiken 2014 rosario ortiz and korak 2017 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems of dom consist of broad emission spectra whose maxima tend to increase with increasing excitation wavelength coble et al 1990 in an effort to assign chemical interpretations fluorescence emission in different wavelength regions is commonly attributed to chemical fractions or else is assigned a primary source such as terrestrial organic matter coble 2007 eems can be analyzed quantitatively under the assumption that the observed signals are due to the superposition of distinct fluorescence phenomena that could theoretically convert to concentrations if the true fluorescence quantum yields were known however fluorophores and meaningful fluorescence quantum yields remain largely unknown additionally there is an ongoing debate on the origin and behavior of dom fluorescence signals and part of dom s fluorescence emission has been attributed to charge transfer interactions between donor and acceptor species mckay 2020 mckay et al 2018 sharpless and blough 2014 regardless of the underlying principles that cause dom fluorescence it has been observed that eems dominated by autochthonous or allochthonous material seem to largely consist of statistically similar fluorescence spectra suggesting that ubiquitous signals may exist murphy et al 2018 to appropriately interpret fluorescence eems and reliably establish the properties and biogeochemical distribution of fluorescence signals overlapping fluorescence spectra must be reliably separated mathematical approaches are often deployed to separate and distinguish between superimposed fluorescence phenomena in eems murphy et al 2014a stedmon et al 2003 the most widely adopted tool is a chemometric model called parallel factor analysis parafac which identifies the underlying fluorescence spectra that best explain the observed patterns in the data set assuming linearly additive signals under ideal conditions when model assumptions are fulfilled see murphy et al 2013 all systematic fluorescence emission will be accounted for and the true spectra of underlying fluorophores can be well approximated bro 1997 most importantly parafac assumes that fluorescence eems are made up of a limited number of fluorescence phenomena with invariant excitation and emission spectra frustratingly dom fluorescence eems are typically very similar and many eems are needed so that a parafac analysis produces meaningful components stedmon and bro 2008 there are several scenarios in which the conditions for a successful application of parafac may not be met in particular since parafac identifies the spectra of underlying fractions via their change in abundance relative to other fractions it fails when samples are few and or the abundances of underlying fractions are too correlated in that case parafac will represent multiple discrete fractions as a single component with intermediate spectral properties with only a small number of fractions being identified in total increasing sample size by supplementing a dataset with unrelated samples is not usually a solution to this problem since at the other extreme parafac fails if samples are too different and can t be represented by the linear superposition of a relatively small number of spectra typically 10 plus only random error numerous studies have attempted to overcome this problem by redeploying models that were previously established using large datasets fellman et al 2009 miller et al 2006 romera castillo et al 2014 yamashita and jaffé 2008 but this approach relies on presumptions that are impossible to verify including that the original model recovered only chemically meaningful spectra and that both the underlying fluorescence phenomena and the instrumental measurement error structures have remained constant between developing and redeploying the model earlier work demonstrated that numerous processes including size fractionation metal quenching and biodegradation each introduce compositional variability that can be exploited by parafac to separate underlying fluorescence fractions cuss and guéguen 2012 guéguen et al 2013 stedmon and markager 2005 only recently however have various approaches been optimised with the aim of establishing reliable methods for extracting spectra from extremely small datasets containing as few as one bulk sample photodegradation size exclusion chromatography and asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation have been shown to produce the missing variability needed to overcome the basic limitations of one sample datasets guéguen et al 2013 lin and guo 2020 murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2017 however spectral averaging still occurs in some cases and the above mentioned one sample methods each involved expensive equipment together with complex analytical workflows which detracts from the inexpensive and rapid nature of dom fluorescence measurements the goal of this study was to develop a simple widely applicable method for extracting fluorescence spectra from datasets that cannot be reliably decomposed by traditional parafac methods due to too few samples and or the presence of strongly covarying fractions recent work highlights the widespread deficiencies caused by ignoring these critical constraints murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2017 the basic method involves augmenting the target dataset with fractionations obtained using three inexpensive and widely available solid phase extraction spe cartridges fig 1 this method is shown to overcome the dual limitations of small sample size and low chemical variability by introducing statistically meaningful variability and reducing covariance between the underlying fluorescence components 2 materials and procedures 2 1 samples whole water samples n 10 were collected at a drinking water treatment plant in southern sweden on september 24 october 14 and november 5 2019 n 9 as well as may 25 2020 n 1 the treatment plant is fed directly from the göta älv a 93 km long river at the west coast of sweden sourced from lake vänern that drains into the kattegat at the city of gothenburg the 2020 sample was taken at the river intake whereas the 2019 samples were taken at either the river intake n 3 or after primary biofilters n 6 all samples were filled into pre combusted amber glass bottles and transported directly from the sampling location to the laboratory where they were filtered with pre combusted gf f filters 0 7 µm 2019 samples or water flushed 0 2 µm syringe filters polysulfonate 2020 samples filters with 0 2µm pores remove a small additional fraction of absorbing and fluorescing colloidal matter compared with filtering through 0 7 µm pore size filters massicotte et al 2017 nimptsch et al 2014 we thus carried out our study under the assumption that samples filtered through 0 2 and 0 7 µm pores can be compared qualitatively if not quantitatively after filtration the samples were stored at 4 c in the dark all subsequent measurements below were done within five days of sampling dissolved organic carbon doc was determined for one of the whole water samples taken in 2019 after biofilter treatment step and 2020 raw water using high temperature catalytic combustion with a toc vcp h shimadzu 2 2 augmentation technique solid phase extractions to supplement the small whole water dataset solid phase extractions spe were carried out on a single sample taken in may 2020 initially a range of pre packed commercially available sorbent materials were tested silica c2 c8 styrene divinylbenzene nh2 sax to identify those that produced high spectral variability across all permeates indicating varying time profiles for extracting different dom fractions each column was first cleaned by a methanol soak for a minimum of 24 h followed by a rinse with three column volumes of fresh methanol and ultrapure water at circumneutral ph before extractions were performed initial tests led to a shortlist of three well performing commercial sorbents sax strong anion exchange sorbent 100 mg agilent technologies nh2 aminopropyl bonded ion exchange sorbent 200 mg agilent technologies and ppl reverse phase sorbent 200 mg agilent technologies permeates from only these three sorbent materials were combined to produce the dataset analysed in this study fig 1 note that while the combination of sax nh2 and ppl permeates appeared to effectively fractionate fluorescent dom in the studied riverine samples other dom sources may require different or additional sorbents and or modified experimental protocols to achieve comparable success approximately 45 ml of sample at ambient ph approx 6 8 was subsequently applied onto each of the three columns a luer slip three way valve was installed after the column in order to divert the column permeate through a 5 ml luer slip syringe fig s1 the three way valve and sampling syringe were cleaned with 10 hcl and rinsed thoroughly with ultrapure water before use permeate samples 3 ml were drawn slowly by hand then the flow of sample was stopped until the next permeate collection the fluorescence cuvette was rinsed with one ml of the permeate sample and the remaining two ml were used for spectroscopic measurements this procedure was repeated until approximately 45 ml had passed over each of the columns since optical measurements and extractions were performed simultaneously the flow over the spe cartridge was stopped regularly for intervals of between five and fifteen minutes each extraction took between three and five hours to produce and measure up to 15 subsamples depending on the fluorometer settings below the three extractions were carried out sequentially and all measurements completed within 2 days 2 3 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence and absorbance measurements were obtained using a horiba aqualog fluorometer using a 10 mm quartz cuvette helma gmbh fluorescence emission was detected in the range of 220 800 nm increment 3 3 nm with an integration time between 3 and 9 s at excitation wavelengths between 240 nm and 450 nm increment 3 nm for the samples measured in 2020 and between 241 nm and 700 nm increment 3 nm for the 2019 samples the accuracy of the excitation monochromator emission detector and the optical immaculacy of cuvettes were validated daily following a previously described protocol wünsch et al 2015 excitation and emission offsets on each axis were corrected by adding three nm to the values reported by the instrument 2 4 data processing chemometrics spectroscopy data were processed in matlab v9 8 mathworks inc using the dreem toolbox version 0 6 0 murphy et al 2013 inner filter effects were eliminated with the absorbance based method kothawala et al 2013 and signals in each eem normalized using the raman peak area of ultrapure water since excitation wavelengths settings differed slightly between samples measured in 2019 compared to 2020 a 2d gridded linear interpolation was carried out to adjust the excitation axis of the 2019 eems to correspond to the eems measured in 2020 the two data sets were subsequently merged and 1st and 2nd order physical scatter was replaced with missing numbers no interpolation fluorescence emission longer than 650 nm or shorter than 310 nm was excluded from further analyses moreover emission scans at 358 1 312 6 and 519 7 nm were deleted after a preliminary analysis indicated frequent signal instability at these wavelengths frequent noisy measurements at excitation 246 nm also necessitated the exclusion of this excitation wavelength from further analyses several of the spe permeate eems were then removed from the data set either because of very low fluorescence signals or excessive instrument noise n 8 the underlying components of fluorescent dom in the samples were isolated with parafac using the dreem toolbox in conjunction with the n way toolbox andersson and bro 2000 murphy et al 2013 to avoid high leverages from the most fluorescent samples all eems were scaled by the 3 2th root of the standard deviation of each eem this scaling did not amplify measurement noise in low signal samples as severely as established methods scaling to unit variance but increased the weighting of these samples compared to the unscaled data set fig s2 models with two to seven components were explored all models were constrained to fit components with positive scores and loadings non negativity constraint each model was initialized with random orthogonalized numbers and the best model with lowest sse sum of squared errors out of 50 random initializations was selected a maximum of 104 iterations was allowed and relative change in fit of 10 8 was chosen as the convergence criterion 2 5 modeling approach parallel factor analysis was applied to two different data sets table 1 1 the small dataset consisting of ten whole water samples this first approach represents a conventional parafac analysis with the caveat that sample size and variability were likely insufficient for it to be possible to derive a valid parafac model 2 the augmented dataset consisting of the ten whole water samples and 37 spe permeates in line with previous research on extractions of dom andrew et al 2016 li et al 2017 li et al 2016 rosario ortiz et al 2007 wünsch et al 2018 it was assumed that different chemical fractions would be extracted at different rates moreover we hypothesized that permeates represent sub samples of the same original sample and not a set of wholly independent samples these assumptions were tested by viewing model residuals to ensure randomness investigating the degree of autocorrelation between components representing different fdom fractions and through cross validation to ensure that highly similar models were reached using different subsets of the dataset the obtained models were split half validated as follows the data set was divided into two randomly sampled halves consisting of approximately half the number of bulk and half the number of available spe permeate eems then the models obtained from each half compared visually and statistically all internal within study comparisons between spectra were based on the tucker congruence coefficient tcc for excitation spectra and the shift and shape sensitive congruence ssc for emission spectra where values larger than 0 95 signified indistinguishable spectra lorenzo seva and ten berge 2006 wünsch et al 2019 since the ssc is more sensitive toward differences between spectra this validation is more stringent than using tcc on both emission and excitation spectra inter study comparisons with 145 fluorescence models describing dom fluorescence was carried out using the openfluor database murphy et al 2014b all spectra with tccex 0 97 and tccem 0 98 were exported and compared further 3 results discussion the whole water samples from the drinking water treatment plant exhibited typical properties for water dominated by terrestrial dom for the two doc samples carbon concentrations were 4 3 and 3 7 mg l and the specific ultraviolet absorbance was 2 8 and 2 9 l x mg x c 1 x m 1 the fluorescence properties were highly similar across all ten bulk samples once concentration effects were removed by unit variance scaling fig 2 a c for example the coefficient of variation standard deviation divided by mean multiplied by 100 for peaks t excitation emission 275 340 c highest signal seen for excitation emission 320 360 420 460 and d excitation emission 390 509 was 7 5 1 6 and 5 6 coble 2007 lochmüller and saavedra 1986 similarly the humification ohno 2002 freshness parlanti et al 2000 and fluorescence indices maie et al 2006 were stable in all whole water samples 0 89 0 8 0 67 1 3 and 1 43 0 9 respectively the spectra of bulk fluorescence eems varied most in the range of excitation emission ex em 350 430 450 500 and 250 290 310 280 fig 2c for reference an average whole water eem is provided in figure s3a an attempt to obtain a valid parafac model from only the ten whole water eems was unsuccessful fig s4 because the small data set lacked the variability required by parafac to distinguish between several highly correlated fractions this failure is evidenced by models with between two and seven components containing one or more components with atypical features fig s4 highlighted components including multiple distinct emission peaks and nonsensical excitation spectra lacking absorption between consecutive absorption bands due to the small number of samples only a two component model could be split half validated 4 the augmentation approach augmenting the original whole water data set with the 37 spe permeates added the missing chemical and mathematical variability needed to acquire a valid parafac model the first indication of success was the significantly increased spectral variability in the raw eems fig 2b d which can be seen by the increased variation in predefined fluorescence peaks definitions above and fig 2 the coefficient of variation of peaks c and d increased from 1 6 and 5 6 in whole water samples to 6 4 and 14 1 in the augmented data set respectively similar results were seen for fluorescence indices covering different wavelength regions of the ultraviolet visible eem fig 2b d the average eem in the augmented data set also had visibly higher contributions of emission at short wavelengths low end of the visible spectrum fig s3 panel b compared to panel a in contrast to the model from only whole water samples the components in the augmented data set matched commonly observed spectra in fluorescent dom models with between three and six components described between 99 61 and 99 95 of the augmented data set a seven component model was excluded from further consideration since it seemed to overfit the data by using multiple highly similar components and multimodal emission peaks fig s5 bottom panel considering the component loadings and modelling error the six component model was the most appropriate representation of the augmented data set the model consisted of components with emission maxima at 330 390 410 450 and 510 nm fig 3 the components will henceforth be referred to by their longest excitation and sole emission maximum e g c280 330 components c280 330 c320 390 c300 410 c320 450 c350 450 and c380 510 had stokes shifts between 0 64 and 1 14 ev table 2 fluorescence emission of the whole water samples was dominated by c300 410 c350 450 and c380 510 which each contributed between 22 and 25 to the overall modelled fluorescence on average followed by c320 390 c320 450 with approx 10 and 13 on average lastly an average of 6 5 of the whole water eems were attributable to c280 330 table 2 see table for standard deviation of these averages each of the three spe sorbents differed in their removal efficiency for different spectra this meant that the autocorrelation between components in the entire augmented data set was never severe fig s6 in contrast whole water eems are often highly autocorrelated because dilution primarily affects all fractions of dom simultaneously murphy et al 2013 stedmon and markager 2005 yamashita et al 2008 since the decomposition of fluorescence eems with parafac assumes that no two fluorescence phenomena covary perfectly in their spectra or fluorescence intensities severe autocorrelations may invalidate a model bro 1997 murphy et al 2013 in future applications of eem parfac the augmentation of whole water eems with spe permeates thus provides a new method to decrease the autocorrelation between eems in a data set by introducing independent variability that would not occur naturally after the initial model exploration the six component model describing the augmented data set was successfully split half validated two models derived from random data set halves containing half of whole water samples and spe permeates each were highly similar to the model derived from the entire augmented dataset fig 3 it should be noted that a split half validation is usually conducted by modeling independent samples identifying the same model independently subsequently indicates that the model is an appropriate representation of the data set bro 1997 in our study the augmented data set consisted of ten independent whole water samples and 37 dependent spe permeate samples random halves thus partly consist of samples that originated from the fractionation of the same whole water sample in this case external comparisons with previously published models should be included to increase confidence in the identified model such comparisons are discussed below in the augmented data set the spe permeates outnumber the whole water samples this raises the possibility that the identified model could fit the spe permeates better than the whole water samples the lack of fit for permeates and whole water samples was therefore compared to assess the appropriateness of the model for the whole water samples the percentage of unexplained fluorescence was largest for the sax permeates and approximately equal for the remaining permeates and whole water samples fig s7 the larger residual for sax permeates was likely a consequence of the high removal efficiency of the sax resin which resulted in low fluorescence intensities and a high proportion of measurement noise in contrast the whole water samples were described well by the model and sample leverages indicated that permeates and whole water samples were equally important for the model fig s7a the overall model error was low and spectral residuals were reasonably flat and typical for dom fluorescence fig s7b c fig s8 overall this confirmed that whole water samples and permeates were equally well approximated by the model despite differences in sample size however future applications of the augmentation approach may require adjustments in data preprocessing particularly data scaling to carefully balance model outcome and sample weighting the dom samples from the göta älv had relatively high concentrations of doc along with abundant fluorescence emission given the abundance of whole water fluorescence signals the monitoring of spe permeates still recovered reasonable fluorescence signals despite the loss of material through the extraction in applications where the fractionated whole water sample has little fluorescence emission to start with e g marine samples the augmentation approach may require modification for example it may be not be feasible to obtain reasonable fluorescence signals from spe permeates in this case it may be necessary to focus on the spe extract instead of the permeate an elution of the spe dom with an increasing concentration of methanol and or acetone will likely reveal similar variability in terms of fluorescence composition 4 1 solid phase extraction performance in addition to new opportunities for fluorescence decomposition the monitoring of spe permeates also allows the characterization of dom polarity similar to the polarity rapid assessment method rosario ortiz et al 2007 contrary to usual protocols for ppl and c18 sorbents but similar to the polarity rapid assessment method samples were not acidified in our study rather ph was kept at ambient levels ph 6 8 to avoid possible ph induced changes to the fluorescence spectra of dom esteves et al 1999 after passing 45 ml though each cartridge the spe sorbents removed an average of 31 ppl 52 nh2 and 78 sax of whole water fluorescent dom from the extracted sample all sorbents were most efficient at the beginning of the extraction process and performance decreased with increasing permeate volume fig s9a among the three tested sorbents the permeate fluorescence properties changed least for ppl in contrast permeate fluorescence properties during nh2 and sax extractions changed considerably fig s9b the noticeably low efficiency of the ppl sorbent was expected due to the circumneutral ph during extraction in contrast the efficiency of the nh2 sorbent was comparable to previously reported values for extractions of suwanee river nom at ph 2 while the sax sorbent appeared more efficient than previously reported li et al 2017 we observed that none of the sax extract could be eluted with methanol and that the sorbent remained discolored after the attempted elution data not shown since extraction efficiencies are commonly estimated by comparing whole water and methanol eluate doc dittmar et al 2008 the previously reported low extraction efficiencies of the sax sorbent may simply be an artefact of the failure to elute extracted dom instead of a lack of dom adsorption onto the sorbent in this context continuous or sporadic fluorescence based monitoring of permeates during the extraction process may help to better understand the extraction process of dom in future studies the performance of spe sorbents depends on the interaction between dom and sorbent analyzing permeates may thus provide some degree of insight into the chemical properties of the extracted fluorescence components and the spe process itself future studies could compare the extractability of fdom at different ph or the extractability between dom from different sources at a constant ph four of the six identified components c280 330 c300 410 c320 450 and c380 510 showed significant spectral overlap with a previous study that investigated the spe performance of the ppl sorbent for marine dom samples fig 4 however a comparison in spe performance between the two studies is beyond the scope of this work since the two studies deviate with respect to both sample ph and dom source 4 2 comparison of fluorescence components with previous studies recent studies argue for the ubiquitous occurrence of fluorescence spectra in dom across a wide range of different aquatic environments ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2018 wünsch et al 2017 quantitative assessments of similarity have been made for all studies where data was available in repositories the longest emitting component c380 510 matches reoccurring component c2 identified by ishii and boyer 2012 c530 in lin guo 2020 c510 in wünsch et al 2017 and ubiquitous f520 in murphy et al 2018 furthermore c300 410 and c320 450 table 2 match further components that occur ubiquitously in different environments murphy et al 2018 c320 450 and c320 390 were also found in a single sample parafac study describing fdom in the milwaukee river lin and guo 2020 these findings provide further evidence for the ubiquitous occurrence of certain fluorescence spectra in dom and increase confidence in the identified six component model furthermore the agreement between previous single sample studies and the approach presented herein shows that intricate photochemistry murphy et al 2018 or chromatography type lin and guo 2020 wünsch et al 2017 fractionations can be replaced by or amended with a simplified methodology we further compared the fluorescence spectra identified in our study to 159 available parafac models in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014b between four c300 410 and 34 c380 510 highly similar components were identified tccex 0 97 and tccem 0 98 fig 4g l table 2 supplementary table 1 judged by a overall match criterion of tccex x tccem the most significant matches included dom describing arctic fjords c300 330 0 996 tropical rivers in venezuela c320 390 0 991 the deep west indian ocean c300 410 0 996 microcystis aeruginosa cultures c320 450 0 983 baltic coastal sea ice c350 450 0 991 and the otonabee river as source water for biofiltration experiements c380 510 0 985 bittar et al 2015 kim et al 2020 peleato et al 2016 stedmon et al 2007 wünsch et al 2018 yamashita et al 2010 to all openfluor matches are provided in the supporting information in relation to the total number of compared studies the low rate of matches may suggest that our study identified rare components however we previously demonstrated that many published parafacpublished models likely rely on too few components in the visible wavelength range wünsch et al 2019 in contrast our study identified four components with emission maxima in the visible spectrum a degree of divergence to many of openfluors reference spectra is therefore to be expected the model in our study includes a component with broad emission peaking at 450 nm c320 450 that found few close matches in the openfluor database this component may occur less frequently i e is specific to the modelled data set or more likely it represents the combined signal from multiple unresolved fractions future applications of the augmentation approach for different samples should help to better constrain the distribution and spectral properties of this component numerous previous studies have observed that distinguishing signals in the ultraviolet a emission range is especially difficult murphy et al 2018 murphy et al 2010 in the ultraviolet a emission range 1st order raman and rayleigh scatter intersect and the energy output of fluorometer lamps is noticeably low cory et al 2010 nonetheless eem parafac models often feature at least one ultraviolet a emitting component wünsch et al 2019 in our study the only protein like fluorescence spectrum observed c280208 330 did not resemble a typical tryptophan like spectrum but instead emitted at shorter wavelengths since the model residuals were relatively flat in the tryptophan like region it is most likely that c2802 330 represents a mixture of multiple ultraviolet a emitting signals that could not be further separated due to similar extractability with different spe sorbents and overall low abundance of signals future implementations of the augmentation approach should focus on improving the separation in this regard emission in the ultraviolet a range is often associated with labile dom and capturing the turnover of this material depends on there being models that accurately reflect this material 5 conclusions future directions it is often claimed that at least 50 environmental samples are required for it to be possible to reliably isolate the underlying fluorescence spectra of dom the approach presented herein achieved this using only a few whole water samples combined with a simple experiment to generate solid phase extraction permeates ppl sax and nh2 sorbent we demonstrated the successful application of this approach by resolving the optical properties of six independently varying fluorescent fractions in dom samples from a swedish drinking water treatment facility while there is mounting evidence that certain fluorescence spectra occur ubiquitously in terrestrially and autochthonously derived dom most published studies do not include them spectral libraries like openfluor facilitate comparisons between studies but a logical next step is to incorporate the growing knowledge about ubiquitous spectra into a next generation modeling approach this requires rapid reliable and highly reproducible methods for resolving overlapping signals and isolating independent fluorescence spectra from small dom datasets the approaches presented here represent another critical step in this direction in addition to aiding the identification of fluorescence phenomena studying fdom behavior during extraction offers valuable insights into the chemical properties of these phenomena future research should aim to combine this approach with others that deliver insights into e g apparent molecular size guéguen et al 2013 lin and guo 2020 romera castillo et al 2014

17288,nanosized plastics are considered as being a class of contaminants of emerging concern the interaction between nanoplastics and proteins may significantly influence the environmental behavior and fate of nanoplastics here we employed time resolved dynamic light scattering to explore the aggregation kinetics and stability of polystyrene nanoparticles psnps exposed to a model globular protein bovine serum albumin bsa in the presence of a number of typical electrolytes nacl cacl2 and na2so4 with the increase of the bsa concentration the amount of bsa adsorbed on the surface of negatively charged ps bare non modified and ps cooh carboxyl modified increased resulting in higher dispersibility in comparison to the treatment without bsa this stabilization effect derived from the protein corona structure was revealed by combining characterization techniques and visualized by transmission electron microscopy upon addition of nacl and cacl2 the aggregation of positively charged ps nh2 amino modified was inhibited by the bsa addition possibly due to the screening of the attractive patch charge force and the competition for adsorption of cations between ps nh2 and the protein when na2so4 was present in the suspension bsa addition significantly increased ps nh2 aggregation rate due to patch charge attraction and the high performance of so4 2 in attaching to particles and charge neutralization these findings shed light on the interactions between psnps and proteins which were shown to vary with the composition of the surface coatings of psnps the newly gained knowledge will help us to forecast the transport and fate of psnps in natural aqueous systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface functionalization polystyrene nanoplastics protein

along with the large scale production and commercial application of plastics the release of plastics into the natural aqueous environment is inevitable in aquatic environments plastic debris can be

care products industrial abrasives and in the medical field expedites their ubiquitous distribution in subsurface environments auta et al 2017 alimi et al 2018 increasing attention has been drawn towards the potential risk of nanoplastics to ecosystems and human health rillig 2012 scheurer and bigalke 2018 recent studies have shown that nanoplastics exert detrimental impacts on zebrafish plants nematodes and human cells gu et al 2020 he et al 2020 lian et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the mobility bioavailability and toxicity of nanoplastics are largely mediated by their aggregation behavior wu et al 2019 dong et al 2020 indeed the suspended psnps may act as a vector for toxic pollutants which thus aggravates the risk to biological acceptors because of the synergistic effects of psnps and contaminants singh et al 2019 hence a thorough understanding on the aggregation behavior of nanoplastics in the ambient environment is of significant importance to disclose the underlying ecological effects proteins are biological macromolecules which are commonly present in body fluids and in natural aquatic ecosystems wall and choppin 2003 philippe and schaumann 2014 when nanoparticles enter physiological environments proteins can adsorb on their surface to form a shell of protein aggregates known as protein corona ostermeyer et al 2013 he et al 2015 this formation of a protein structure can alter the physiochemical properties of nanoparticles enhance its physical stability and subsequently improve their performance in biomedical and biotechnological applications shen et al 2010 wang et al 2019 examples include the improvement of the antioxidant properties of particles and enhanced interactions with pathogens deepak et al 2011 yan et al 2019 although the interactions between proteins and nanoparticles in biological media are well understood there are just a few investigations on the aggregation behavior and colloidal stability of nanoplastics with proteins in aqueous systems under environmentally relevant conditions dong et al 2020 natural surface waters are usually characterized by various cations e g na ca2 and anions e g cl so4 2 which are widely known to reduce the energy barrier between particles and finally accelerate particles aggregation wang et al 2019 li et al 2020 it is therefore of significant interest to comprehensively investigate how proteins influence the fundamental processes particularly the aggregation kinetics of nanoplastics both in the presence and absence of mono and divalent cations and anions the adsorption process of proteins is clearly an important process influencing the aggregation of psnps which is significantly controlled by the original interfacial physicochemical properties of nanoparticles e g surface charge particle size and shape casals et al 2010 levak et al 2017 nattich rak et al 2017 sun et al 2018 thus a generalized prediction of the impacts of proteins on the aggregation behavior of psnps can be challenging because of the distinct physicochemical properties of psnps existing in realistic environments recently several studies demonstrated that particles size dramatically affects the adsorbed mass layer thickness and configuration of protein which in turn leads to significantly different impacts on the stability of the particles liu et al 2019 dong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 however the surface functionalization effects of psnps might also be a crucial yet overlooked factor to determine their interaction with protein and subsequent aggregation and stability the detailed characterization of the adsorbed proteins and the interaction mechanisms for aggregation is currently still lacking to gain a better understanding and prediction of the environmental behavior and fate of psnps further studies regarding the stability of psnps with different surface coatings in the co presence of proteins and cations anions are needed bovine serum albumin bsa one of the most abundant proteins in surface water is commonly used as model protein and thus employed as representative protein in the current study to explore its effect on the aggregation kinetic and colloidal stability of nanoplastics in association with different electrolyte compositions through time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls sheng et al 2016 ren et al 2017 three electrolytes nacl cacl2 and na2so4 were used to represent the common cation valence na or ca2 and anion valence cl or so4 2 in natural waters non modified ps bare carboxyl modified ps cooh and amino modified ps nh2 polystyrene nanoparticles psnps were applied in order to evaluate the impacts of surface properties of psnps on their environmental behavior in the presence of proteins we hypothesized that the interactions between psnps and bsa are dependent on the surface modification of psnps and the concentration of bsa the formation of a protein corona would alter the surface properties of psnps which subsequently influences their stability and aggregation to verify this hypothesis the interaction mechanisms were characterized by the combined application of ultraviolet spectrophotometer circular dichroism spectrometry fluorescence emission spectrometry transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoplastics and protein stock solutions of polystyrene nanoparticles 5 w v with different surface modifications ps bare ps cooh and ps nh2 were purchased from shanghai huge biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the morphology and size of the psnps were observed using transmission electron microscope tem talos l120c g2 thermo scientific with an acceleration voltage of 120 kv the averaged hydrodynamic diameters and point of zero charge of the three particles in milli q water were measured using dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk the functional groups of psnps were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir as displayed in fig s1 according to the supplier the density of surface groups was 0 4 mmol g for ps nh2 and 0 167 mmol g for ps cooh based on potentiometric titration bovine serum albumin was obtained from beyotime biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the total organic carbon toc content of bsa was calculated to be 47 4 as determined by using a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan a bsa stock solution 100 mg c l was prepared by suspending a certain amount of bsa powder into milli q water prior to use the bsa stock solution was preserved at 4 c in the dark 2 2 sample preparation the suspensions of psnps were prepared by adding a defined amount of a psnp stock solution to milli q water followed by ultrasonication 120 w for 15 min at ph 5 0 0 2 the selected ph lies within the typical ph range of 5 9 of surface waters deluchat et al 1997 the final concentration of psnps in the mixture was 10 mg l for achieving a proper dls measurement singh et al 2019 to obtain the desired concentration of bsa the bsa stock solution was freshly diluted with milli q water before each set of experiments the nacl cacl2 and na2so4 solutions with a wide range of concentrations were obtained by dissolving various salts with milli q water the ph of the bsa solutions and the electrolytes solutions were adjusted to 5 0 0 2 using 0 1 m hcl and or naoh solution 2 3 aggregation experiments the aggregation kinetics of psnps in different salt solutions with or without bsa were measured in terms of intensity weighted averaged hydrodynamic diameter dh using time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls after sonication for 15 min equal volumes of psnps suspension electrolyte solution nacl cacl2 or na2so4 and bsa solution 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 mg c l were pipetted into a quartz cuvette these bsa concentrations are within the range of dissolved organic matter concentrations in natural waters after vortexing for 1 s the cuvette was placed in the dls instrument the dh was continuously recorded at 30 s intervals for 30 min there was no delay between each measurement the dls instrument contains a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and 173 scattering angle in this study the early aggregation stage was defined as the time period from aggregation initiation t0 to the time when dh was up to 2 0 times the initial value d0 the initial aggregation rate constant k of psnps was calculated from the slope of the aggregation profile which is proportional to ddh t dt chen and elimelech 2006 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n0 is the initial psnps concentration and dh t is dh of the psnps at time t the attachment efficiency α also known as the inverse stability ratio 1 w is commonly used to evaluate the initial aggregation kinetics of psnps the α was obtained by normalizing the measured k in the reaction limited regime rlr to the diffusion limited regime dlr as follows 2 α k k f a s t 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 1 n 0 f a s t d d h t d t t 0 f a s t the critical coagulation concentration ccc the minimum electrolyte concentration at which fast aggregation α 1 is achieved was calculated by intersecting the linear regression of α values in the rlr to that in the case of dlr 2 4 characterization of the interactions between psnps and bsa the zeta potentials of psnps in the presence or absence of electrolytes nacl cacl2 and na2so4 over a wide range of bsa concentrations were measured by a malvern zetasizer fluorescence emission spectra circular dichroism spectra cd uv visible spectra and ftir spectra were employed to characterize the interactions between psnps and bsa specifically bsa at a fixed concentration was incubated with various concentrations of psnps a fls1000 fluorescence spectrofluorometer edinburgh instruments was applied to acquire the fluorescence spectra of these samples at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and emission wavelength ranging from 300 to 500 nm the uv vis absorption measurements of psnps bsa systems were performed at room temperature using an ev300 spectrophotometer thermo fisher equipped with 1 cm quartz cells the absorption spectra were recorded from 190 300 nm the secondary structure of bsa after psnps interaction was determined on a j 815 circular dichroism spectrometer jasoc with a 1 mm path length quartz cell in the range of 190 260 nm for ftir spectra analysis the mixture of psnps and bsa were incubated for 1 h at 150 rpm and 25 c and then freeze dried in a vacuum lyophilizer the ftir spectra of bsa interacted with psnps were scanned from 4000 400 cm 1 by a nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer thermo fisher 2 5 negative staining of nanoparticle protein complexes for protein corona observation grids were briefly treated 40 s by glow discharge to improve their hydrophilicity one drop 5 μl of a freshly prepared mixture nanoplastics solution 10 mg l protein solution 0 1 1 and 10 mg c l in ultrapure water was deposited onto a carbon coated copper grid for 3 min the excess liquid was blotted away with a strip of filter paper a drop 5 μl of 2 uranyl acetate negative stain was then added to the grids for 60 s before being blotted tem images of the nanoparticle protein complexes were generated on a talos l120c g2 at an acceleration voltage of 120 kv the samples of psnps incubated with cacl2 fixed at ccc bsa 1 mg c l co presence of cacl2 and bsa as well as ps nh2 in nacl and na2so4 were also stained with uranyl acetate for observation of aggregates 2 6 scanning electron microscopy the suspensions of psnps were incubated with electrolyte in the presence or absence of bsa for 30 min the morphological investigation of psnps in electrolyte solution nacl cacl2 and na2so4 and in cacl2 solution in the presence and absence of bsa was performed on a scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7800f jeol japan energy dispersive spectroscopy eds thermo fisher scientific inc usa was used to investigate the elemental composition of psnps aggregates during sem observations 2 7 calculation of interaction energy to understand the role of protein in the aggregation of psnps the interaction energy including waals forces electrostatic double layer interactions and steric hindrance was calculated according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory dong et al 2020 the detailed calculation of interaction energies presents in supporting information text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of psnps in the tem images all the three types of psnps displayed a regular spherical shape with an average diameter of 49 2 7 nm for ps bare 47 5 3 nm for ps cooh and 77 8 1 nm for ps nh2 respectively fig s2 according to the tr dls measurements the averaged hydrodynamic diameters of ps bare and ps cooh were 52 0 2 nm and 49 0 5 nm table s1 which were basically consistent with the analysis of tem images this suggested that ps bare and ps cooh were well dispersed in milli q water in contrast the dh of ps nh2 154 8 8 nm was much larger than its diameter obtained from the tem observation given that the polydispersivity index pdi value of ps nh2 was less than 0 3 table s1 aggregation or coagulation was unlikely to occur in the ps nh2 suspension yu et al 2019 the difference between the tem and the dls results can be ascribed to the fact that the tem only provides the core size whilst the dls also measures the thickness of the polymer layer and the hydration shell wang et al 2020 the surface charges of the psnps as a function of ph are shown in fig s3 the ps bare and ps cooh maintained a negative charge within the ph range 3 0 10 investigated considering that the ph of natural waters commonly ranges from 5 0 to 9 0 the ps bare and ps cooh may remain suspended for a long time in aqueous environments the surface charge of ps nh2 gradually decreased when increasing solution ph from 3 to 7 and then remained relatively stable from ph 7 to 10 fig s3 this phenomenon is indicative of dissociation of surface carboxyl and hydroxyl groups yi et al 2015 moreover the absolute zeta potentials of these three particles were higher than 30 mv at ph 5 0 meaning the psnps were electrostatically stable it was therefore favorable for conducting aggregation experiment under ph 5 0 3 2 surface modification dependent aggregation of psnps in nacl cacl2 and na2so4 the size evolution of ps bare ps cooh and ps nh2 as a function of cation and anion type as well as electrolyte concentrations are plotted in fig s4 the hydrodynamic diameters of the amino modified psnps increased barely at a wide range of electrolyte concentrations e g 1000 mm nacl 100 mm cacl2 and 500 mm na2so4 suggesting that they possess a good dispersion ability in moderate salt concentrations fig s4 this high dispersity of amino modified psnps may be derived from the branched polymer pei chain layer 0 4 mmol g on their surface which thus provides a steric repulsion to overcome the electrostatic attraction dong et al 2019 yu et al 2019 since the concentration of na ca2 cl and so4 2 in most of natural fresh water is prevalently lower than 100 mm ps nh2 will be stable for a long time in aquatic environments posing a potential risk to aquatic organisms it is worth noting that the dh of positively charged ps nh2 slightly increased even in 1000 mm nacl but significantly increased in 800 mm na2so4 fig 1 this result was in line with tem images fig s5a and s5c and was consistent with the so called hofmeister series which states that the ion specific impact on the aggregation of nanoparticles follows the sequence co3 2 so4 2 h2po4 f cl br no3 i clo4 confirming that so4 2 can provide more effective charge screening effects and is more accessible to the surface of particles as compared to cl oncsik et al 2015 he et al 2017 song et al 2020 in the three electrolytes studied negatively charged ps bare and ps cooh displayed a similar trend regarding to the increase of dh within a certain concentration range of electrolytes the increase of both cation and anion concentration enhanced the aggregation rate as revealed by the corresponding attachment efficiencies α fig 1 at higher ion concentration the aggregation rate approached the maximum and was independent of the electrolyte concentration α 1 fig 1 these findings showed that the aggregation behavior of ps bare and ps cooh in the presence of nacl cacl2 and na2so4 is consistent with the traditional dlvo theory this is similar to the observations for sulfate modified psnps zno nps and tio2 nps peng et al 2015 he et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the cccna and cccca of carboxyl modified psnps were significantly lower than the corresponding values of non modified psnps suggesting that aggregation of ps cooh was favored in nacl and cacl2 solution table 1 this finding is mainly attributed to the carboxyl group present on the surface of psnps which is capable of offering sorption sites for cations and complexation with cations song et al 2019 additionally divalent ca2 drove the aggregation of ps bare and ps cooh more aggressively than monovalent na as confirmed by the results of the ccc and sem measurements table 1 and fig s6 this can be explained by the fact that divalent cations possess more effective charge screening or charge neutralization than monovalent cations because of their higher electronic charges as described in previous publications ren et al 2014 tan et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the ccc for so4 2 in ps bare was determined to be 200 mm which was lower than the ccc for addition of cl table 1 it again confirmed that so4 2 was much more efficient in destabilizing psnps suspensions compared to cl as mainly resulting from its stronger charge neutralization ability as aforementioned he et al 2017 however the ccc of ps cooh followed the order cccso4 2 ccccl which was opposite to the results obtained in non modified psnps a similar trend was also reported by baalousha et al 2013 who found that cl was more efficient in destabilizing citrate coated ag nps in comparison to so4 2 these findings indicated that the environmental behavior of nanoparticles is controlled by the interaction between their surface properties and the composition of the aqueous solution yu et al 2019 3 3 protein corona mediated aggregation of psnps in nacl cacl2 and na2so4 the influence of bsa on the hydrodynamic diameter of the three psnps over a wide range of nacl cacl2 and na2so4 concentrations is illustrated in fig s7 compared with the case of absence of bsa 1 mg c l bsa addition inhibited the aggregation of amino modified psnps under 1000 mm nacl and 100 mm cacl2 solution fig 1g and 1h suggesting that the presence of bsa enhanced the stability of ps nh2 similar results were obtained by sheng et al 2016 who reported that the presence of bsa enhanced the stability of hematite nps at high salt concentration they concluded that at a high electrolyte level the patch charge attractive force can be screened being an electrostatic double layer force and thus the steric hinderance resulted from bsa corona stabilized hematite nps here we speculate the screening of the attractive patch charge force may involve in the well dispersity at high nacl and cacl2 solution furthermore this stabilization effect of bsa may be explained by competitive cation adsorption between protein molecules and ps nh2 as will be discussed later differently the presence of 1 mg c l bsa promoted the aggregation of ps nh2 in na2so4 solution as revealed by the measured dh fig 1i tem results provided additional evidence that in the presence of bsa obviously more compacted ps nh2 aggregates formed in the presence of na2so4 than that in the presence of nacl fig s5b and s5d these above mentioned results indicate that ion type and ion valence play important roles in mediating the aggregation behavior of nanoparticles the presence of bsa enhanced the colloidal stability of ps bare and ps cooh and shifted the cccs of ps bare and ps cooh to higher ionic concentrations for the three studied electrolytes table 1 ren et al 2017 reported a similar trend in the impact of bsa on the stability of tio2 nps while the underlying mechanism was not well discussed here the stabilizing role of bsa was visually corroborated by tem images of psnps incubated with bsa cacl2 and bsa cacl2 respectively fig 2 in the presence of cacl2 only ps bare or ps cooh formed clear bonds to yield larger and compressed aggregates fig 2a and 2b however the aggregates were relatively well dispersed and the clear bonds of particles completely disappeared in the presence of bsa and cacl2 in addition the xdlvo calculation confirmed that the energy barriers of psnps in the presence of bsa were higher than those of psnps without bsa addition fig s8 based on these observations we concluded that the elevated cccs result from steric hindrance due to bsa adsorption on the particle surface which also has been reported in non plastics nanomaterials li and sun 2011 wang et al 2015 song et al 2020 the detailed interaction mechanism will be discussed in the latter part remarkably even though 1 mg c l bsa did enhance the stability of ps bare and ps cooh in the presence of both mono and divalent electrolyte solutions the ccc values obtained in ps bare and ps cooh displayed a drastic difference in the absence of bsa the cccna and cccca of carboxyl modified psnps were significantly lower than the cccs of non modified psnps however after bsa addition the cccs of ps cooh in nacl cacl2 and na2so4 solution were significantly higher than in the case of ps bare indicating that ps cooh favors to suspend in aqueous systems containing proteins as compared with ps bare this finding again showed that surface properties of nanoparticles are a critical factor when evaluating the environmental behavior and fate of nanoparticles by further analysis of the cccs obtained with or without bsa we found that after bsa addition the ratio of cccna and cccca in ps bare was decreased from 0 11 to 0 09 whereas this ratio in case of ps cooh was increased from 0 08 to 0 16 table 1 the decrease of the ratio of cccna and cccca in case of ps bare can be attributed to formation of ca2 bridges in the presence of bsa as verified by the wider elemental calcium distribution in bsa treatment compared to the bsa free treatment fig 3 a and b although ca2 bridges also involved in the destabilization of ps cooh in the presence of bsa fig 3c and 3d however as compared with ps bare higher cacl2 concentrations are needed for achieving significant aggregation in ps cooh a reasonable explanation was the different surface properties of psnps which may lead to different interaction pattern with protein bhatkalkar et al 2020 the detailed interaction mechanism between psnps and bsa discussed in the later part 3 4 stability of psnps in typical natural waters the aggregation behavior of ps bare ps cooh and ps nh2 was further investigated in 9 realistic surface water samples including sea water river water and lake water the detailed sample information and physiochemical properties of the water samples are presented in table s2 and s3 it is clearly shown that the three psnps remained stable in river waters and lake waters fig s9 as shown in table s3 the contents of dissolved organic matter in river and lake water samples ranged from 4 42 to 14 6 mg c l which can stabilize particles via steric repulsion due to the formation of a nom natural organic matters corona tan et al 2019 this supported our above mentioned findings that nom plays a significant role in stabilization of psnps the combined effect of high ionic strength and divalent cations in the three sea water samples contributed to the significant aggregation of ps bare and ps cooh highlighting the importance of ion composition ion type and ionic strength of natural water in destabilizing psnps additionally the high concentration of so4 2 and cl in sea water samples did not lead to the aggregation of ps nh2 which was contrary to the results obtained from experimental conditions the complicated components in natural water such as cations nom inorganic colloids might contribute to the high stability of ps nh2 it implied that the environmental behavior of psnps is more complicated in realistic scenarios than in experimental conditions which thus deserves to further elaborate the exact aggregation behavior and stability of psnps in natural ecosystems undoubtedly the current study clearly depicts that psnps will suspend in the synthetic and natural fresh waters for a long time these findings improve our knowledge regarding the stability and aggregation of nanoparticles under relevantly environmental conditions containing noms and ions which is help us to better predict the environmental fate and toxicity of psnps 3 5 underlying mechanisms of protein corona mediated aggregation behavior of psnps based on the aforementioned discussion it can be concluded that the stability of psnps is controlled by the formation of a protein corona to disclose the intrinsic mechanisms by which bsa influences the aggregation of psnps the α of psnps at fixed electrolyte concentrations ccc as a function of bsa concentration were investigated fig 4 a c and s10 for the negatively charged ps bare and ps cooh the α values in the presence of nacl cacl2 and na2so4 exhibited similar trends specifically the addition of 0 1 mg c l bsa led to faster aggregation of ps bare and ps cooh compared to the condition without bsa addition this can be explained by the decreasing electrostatic repulsion as a consequence of adsorption of bsa molecules on particles as confirmed by the measured zeta potentials and the tem images fig 4d and e 5 a and b as the concentration of bsa increased from 1 to 10 mg c l bsa the α of ps bare and ps cooh decreased gradually and tended to 0 meaning that ps bare and ps cooh became more and more stabilized the unchanged zeta potentials and negative staining tem images demonstrated that the efficient dispersity of ps bare and ps cooh in the presence of high bsa content resulted from steric hinderance arising from the protein corona structure figs 4 and 5 this is in line with the findings of tan et al 2019 who demonstrated that the formation of a nom corona enhanced the stability of black phosphorus on the contrary the effects of bsa on the stability of positively charged ps nh2 did not display a bsa concentration dependent manner fig 4c in the presence of nacl and cacl2 the α of ps nh2 remained 0 at all studied bsa concentrations the addition of bsa significantly elevated this value in the presence of na2so4 the zeta potentials of ps nh2 as a function of bsa concentrations in the absence of electrolytes showed that bsa addition decreased the surface charge of ps nh2 and reversed its charge as the bsa concentration was further increased fig 4f similar results were also reported by sun et al 2018 this indirectly implied that bsa adsorbed on the surface of ps nh2 however tem results depicted that only a small amount of bsa molecules were attached on the surface of ps nh2 and the interaction between bsa and ps nh2 did not form a protein corona structure even in 10 mg c l bsa fig 5c f and i these results suggest that a distinct mechanism dominated the aggregation behavior of psnps with different surface coatings as bsa is present to better understand the mechanism of interaction between different surface functionalization of psnps and bsa ftir spectra were first applied as shown in fig s11 after incubation with bsa the ftir spectra of psnps became similar to that of free bsa implying the sorption and coverage of bsa on psnps however because of the nano size and low density of psnps the ftir cannot well differentiate the bound and unbound protein in the mixture during the freeze dried process thus uv vis spectra fluorescence spectra and cd spectra were further employed to corroborate the ftir results the results of the uv vis spectra exhibited obvious absorbance peaks at 226 and 280 nm which can be attributed to the secondary folding of the protein and the π π transition of aromatic amino acid residues such as tyrosine tryptophan and phenylalanine amara et al 2016 after interaction the absorbance of bsa increased significantly in the presence of two negatively charged psnps with no shift in the location of the characteristic peaks fig 6 a and b this suggests that the binding of ps bare ps cooh induced a conformational change of bsa the incubation of bsa with psnps with different surface coatings 0 100 mg l led to a reduction in the intrinsic tyrosin and or tryptophan and or phenylalanine fluorescence intensity of bsa confirming that psnps can complexed with aromatic amino acids residues of bsa fig 6d f sun et al 2018 the cd spectra of bsa depicted two typical bands at 208 and 222 nm which are usually used to reflect the α helical structure of the protein fig 6g i tian et al 2015 with the increase of the concentration of ps bare and ps cooh the ellipticity of bsa decreased gradually indicating that they can interact with the amino acid residues of bsa compared to negatively charged psnps the band corresponding to the positively charged ps nh2 interacting with bsa showed a slight increase in uv abs intensity a slight decrease in fluorescence intensity and a negligible change in the α helical structure this means that few proteins were adsorbed on the surface of ps nh2 this is in line with the tem results fig 5 hence for ps nh2 the addition of bsa enhanced the amount of protein molecules in solution which may alleviate the charge screening resulting from the increasing electrolyte concentration due to the complexation of protein and cations moreover at the experimental concentration 10 mg l psnps at which aggregation was studied ps cooh exhibited more efficiency in interacting with the amino acid residues of bsa in comparison to ps bare which qualitatively reflected that the interaction between protein and ps cooh was higher than the case of ps bare accordingly the protein corona structure provided more steric hindrance for ps cooh than for ps bare which in turn led to higher cccs for ps cooh than in case of ps bare 4 conclusions this study revealed the distinct effects of bsa on the aggregation kinetics of psnps with different surface coatings under environmentally relevant conditions the surface functional groups of psnps controlled the amount of adsorbed protein and subsequent steric stabilization or electrostatic destabilization of psnps upon addition of nacl and cacl2 a low amount of bsa accelerated the aggregation of the negatively charged ps bare and ps cooh aggregates but depressed the aggregation of the positively charged ps nh2 due to the distinct surface properties of the psnps and the different interactions between psnps and bsa the formation of a protein corona resulted in significant stabilization of the negatively charged ps bare and ps cooh indicating that these psnps are highly mobile in surface waters the aggregation behavior of the positively charged ps nh2 in na2so4 solution was considerably different from the case of addition of nacl in the presence of na2so4 the addition of bsa tended to stabilize the negatively charged psnps but destabilized the positively charged ps nh2 we thus suggest that the inherent properties of particles the interaction between particles and nom as well as the ion composition of a given aqueous environment need to be carefully considered when assessing the transport and bioavailability of nanoparticles in surface water it should be noted that the biotic and abiotic processes may significantly influence the properties and compositions of the discharged plastics debris hence the aging of plastics and the presence of

17288,nanosized plastics are considered as being a class of contaminants of emerging concern the interaction between nanoplastics and proteins may significantly influence the environmental behavior and fate of nanoplastics here we employed time resolved dynamic light scattering to explore the aggregation kinetics and stability of polystyrene nanoparticles psnps exposed to a model globular protein bovine serum albumin bsa in the presence of a number of typical electrolytes nacl cacl2 and na2so4 with the increase of the bsa concentration the amount of bsa adsorbed on the surface of negatively charged ps bare non modified and ps cooh carboxyl modified increased resulting in higher dispersibility in comparison to the treatment without bsa this stabilization effect derived from the protein corona structure was revealed by combining characterization techniques and visualized by transmission electron microscopy upon addition of nacl and cacl2 the aggregation of positively charged ps nh2 amino modified was inhibited by the bsa addition possibly due to the screening of the attractive patch charge force and the competition for adsorption of cations between ps nh2 and the protein when na2so4 was present in the suspension bsa addition significantly increased ps nh2 aggregation rate due to patch charge attraction and the high performance of so4 2 in attaching to particles and charge neutralization these findings shed light on the interactions between psnps and proteins which were shown to vary with the composition of the surface coatings of psnps the newly gained knowledge will help us to forecast the transport and fate of psnps in natural aqueous systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface functionalization polystyrene nanoplastics protein

along with the large scale production and commercial application of plastics the release of plastics into the natural aqueous environment is inevitable in aquatic environments plastic debris can be fragmented into nanoplastics via physical abrasion photodegradation chemical degradation and biodegradation alimi et al 2018 li et al 2018 besides the application of primary nanoplastics in personal care products industrial abrasives and in the medical field expedites their ubiquitous distribution in subsurface environments auta et al 2017 alimi et al 2018 increasing attention has been drawn towards the potential risk of nanoplastics to ecosystems and human health rillig 2012 scheurer and bigalke 2018 recent studies have shown that nanoplastics exert detrimental impacts on zebrafish plants nematodes and human cells gu et al 2020 he et al 2020 lian et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the mobility bioavailability and toxicity of nanoplastics are largely mediated by their aggregation behavior wu et al 2019 dong et al 2020 indeed the suspended psnps may act as a vector for toxic pollutants which thus aggravates the risk to biological acceptors because of the synergistic effects of psnps and contaminants singh et al 2019 hence a thorough understanding on the aggregation behavior of nanoplastics in the ambient environment is of significant importance to disclose the underlying ecological effects proteins are biological macromolecules which are commonly present in body fluids and in natural aquatic ecosystems wall and choppin 2003 philippe and schaumann 2014 when nanoparticles enter physiological environments proteins can adsorb on their surface to form a shell of protein aggregates known as protein corona ostermeyer et al 2013 he et al 2015 this formation of a protein structure can alter the physiochemical properties of nanoparticles enhance its physical stability and subsequently improve their performance in biomedical and biotechnological applications shen et al 2010 wang et al 2019 examples include the improvement of the antioxidant properties of particles and enhanced interactions with pathogens deepak et al 2011 yan et al 2019 although the interactions between proteins and nanoparticles in biological media are well understood there are just a few investigations on the aggregation behavior and colloidal stability of nanoplastics with proteins in aqueous systems under environmentally relevant conditions dong et al 2020 natural surface waters are usually characterized by various cations e g na ca2 and anions e g cl so4 2 which are widely known to reduce the energy barrier between particles and finally accelerate particles aggregation wang et al 2019 li et al 2020 it is therefore of significant interest to comprehensively investigate how proteins influence the fundamental processes particularly the aggregation kinetics of nanoplastics both in the presence and absence of mono and divalent cations and anions the adsorption process of proteins is clearly an important process influencing the aggregation of psnps which is significantly controlled by the original interfacial physicochemical properties of nanoparticles e g surface charge particle size and shape casals et al 2010 levak et al 2017 nattich rak et al 2017 sun et al 2018 thus a generalized prediction of the impacts of proteins on the aggregation behavior of psnps can be challenging because of the distinct physicochemical properties of psnps existing in realistic environments recently several studies demonstrated that particles size dramatically affects the adsorbed mass layer thickness and configuration of protein which in turn leads to significantly different impacts on the stability of the particles liu et al 2019 dong et al 2020 sun et al 2020 however the surface functionalization effects of psnps might also be a crucial yet overlooked factor to determine their interaction with protein and subsequent aggregation and stability the detailed characterization of the adsorbed proteins and the interaction mechanisms for aggregation is currently still lacking to gain a better understanding and prediction of the environmental behavior and fate of psnps further studies regarding the stability of psnps with different surface coatings in the co presence of proteins and cations anions are needed bovine serum albumin bsa one of the most abundant proteins in surface water is commonly used as model protein and thus employed as representative protein in the current study to explore its effect on the aggregation kinetic and colloidal stability of nanoplastics in association with different electrolyte compositions through time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls sheng et al 2016 ren et al 2017 three electrolytes nacl cacl2 and na2so4 were used to represent the common cation valence na or ca2 and anion valence cl or so4 2 in natural waters non modified ps bare carboxyl modified ps cooh and amino modified ps nh2 polystyrene nanoparticles psnps were applied in order to evaluate the impacts of surface properties of psnps on their environmental behavior in the presence of proteins we hypothesized that the interactions between psnps and bsa are dependent on the surface modification of psnps and the concentration of bsa the formation of a protein corona would alter the surface properties of psnps which subsequently influences their stability and aggregation to verify this hypothesis the interaction mechanisms were characterized by the combined application of ultraviolet spectrophotometer circular dichroism spectrometry fluorescence emission spectrometry transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoplastics and protein stock solutions of polystyrene nanoparticles 5 w v with different surface modifications ps bare ps cooh and ps nh2 were purchased from shanghai huge biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the morphology

zero charge of the three particles in milli q water were measured using dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk the functional groups of psnps were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir as displayed in fig s1 according to the supplier the density of surface groups was 0 4 mmol g for ps nh2 and 0 167 mmol g for ps cooh based on potentiometric titration bovine serum albumin was obtained from beyotime biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the total organic carbon toc content of bsa was calculated to be 47 4 as determined by using a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu japan a bsa stock solution 100 mg c l was prepared by suspending a certain amount of bsa powder into milli q water prior to use the bsa stock solution was preserved at 4 c in the dark 2 2 sample preparation the suspensions of psnps were prepared by adding a defined amount of a psnp stock solution to milli q water followed by ultrasonication 120 w for 15 min at ph 5 0 0 2 the selected ph lies within the typical ph range of 5 9 of surface waters deluchat et al 1997 the final concentration of psnps in the mixture was 10 mg l for achieving a proper dls measurement singh et al 2019 to obtain the desired concentration of bsa the bsa stock solution was freshly diluted with milli q water before each set of experiments the nacl cacl2 and na2so4 solutions with a wide range of concentrations were obtained by dissolving various salts with milli q water the ph of the bsa solutions and the electrolytes solutions were adjusted to 5 0 0 2 using 0 1 m hcl and or naoh solution 2 3 aggregation experiments the aggregation kinetics of psnps in different salt solutions with or without bsa were measured in terms of intensity weighted averaged hydrodynamic diameter dh using time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls after sonication for 15 min equal volumes of psnps suspension electrolyte solution nacl cacl2 or na2so4 and bsa solution 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 mg c l were pipetted into a quartz cuvette these bsa concentrations are within the range of dissolved organic matter concentrations in natural waters after vortexing for 1 s the cuvette was placed in the dls instrument the dh was continuously recorded at 30 s intervals for 30 min there was no delay between each measurement the dls instrument contains a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and 173 scattering angle in this study the early aggregation stage was defined as the time period from aggregation initiation t0 to the time when dh was up to 2 0 times the initial value d0 the initial aggregation rate constant k of psnps was calculated from the slope of the aggregation profile which is proportional to ddh t dt chen and elimelech 2006 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n0 is the initial psnps concentration and dh t is dh of the psnps at time t the attachment efficiency α also known as the inverse stability ratio 1 w is commonly used to evaluate the initial aggregation kinetics of psnps the α was obtained by normalizing the measured k in the reaction limited regime rlr to the diffusion limited regime dlr as follows 2 α k k f a s t 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 1 n 0 f a s t d d h t d t t 0 f a s t the critical coagulation concentration ccc the minimum electrolyte concentration at which fast aggregation α 1 is achieved was calculated by intersecting the linear regression of α values in the rlr to that in the case of dlr 2 4 characterization of the interactions between psnps and bsa the zeta potentials of psnps in the presence or absence of electrolytes nacl cacl2 and na2so4 over a wide range of bsa concentrations were measured by a malvern zetasizer fluorescence emission spectra circular dichroism spectra cd uv visible spectra and ftir spectra were employed to characterize the interactions between psnps and bsa specifically bsa at a fixed concentration was incubated with various concentrations of psnps a fls1000 fluorescence spectrofluorometer edinburgh instruments was applied to acquire the fluorescence spectra of these samples at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and emission wavelength ranging from 300 to 500 nm the uv vis absorption measurements of psnps bsa systems were performed at room temperature using an ev300 spectrophotometer thermo fisher equipped with 1 cm quartz cells the absorption spectra were recorded from 190 300 nm the secondary structure of bsa after psnps interaction was determined on a j 815 circular dichroism spectrometer jasoc with a 1 mm path length quartz cell in the range of 190 260 nm for ftir spectra analysis the mixture of psnps and bsa were incubated for 1 h at 150 rpm and 25 c and then freeze dried in a vacuum lyophilizer the ftir spectra of bsa interacted with psnps were scanned from 4000 400 cm 1 by a nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer thermo fisher 2 5 negative staining of nanoparticle protein complexes for protein corona observation grids were briefly treated 40 s by glow discharge to improve their hydrophilicity one drop 5 μl of a freshly prepared mixture nanoplastics solution 10 mg l protein solution 0 1 1 and 10 mg c l in ultrapure water was deposited onto a carbon coated copper grid for 3 min the excess liquid was blotted away with a strip of filter paper a drop 5 μl of 2 uranyl acetate negative stain was then added to the grids for 60 s before being blotted tem images of the nanoparticle protein complexes were generated on a talos l120c g2 at an acceleration voltage of 120 kv the samples of psnps incubated with cacl2 fixed at ccc bsa 1 mg c l co presence of cacl2 and bsa as well as ps nh2 in nacl and na2so4 were also stained with uranyl acetate for observation of aggregates 2 6 scanning electron microscopy the suspensions of psnps were incubated with electrolyte in the presence or absence of bsa for 30 min the morphological investigation of psnps in electrolyte solution nacl cacl2 and na2so4 and in cacl2 solution in the presence and absence of bsa was performed on a scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7800f jeol japan energy dispersive spectroscopy eds thermo fisher scientific inc usa was used to investigate the elemental composition of psnps aggregates during sem observations 2 7 calculation of interaction energy to understand the role of protein in the aggregation of psnps the interaction energy including waals forces electrostatic double layer interactions and steric hindrance was calculated according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory dong et al 2020 the detailed calculation of interaction energies presents in supporting information text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of psnps in the tem images all the three types of psnps displayed a regular spherical shape with an average diameter of 49 2 7 nm for ps bare 47 5 3 nm for ps cooh and 77 8 1 nm for ps nh2 respectively fig s2 according to the tr dls measurements the averaged hydrodynamic diameters of ps bare and ps cooh were 52 0 2 nm and 49 0 5 nm table s1 which were basically consistent with the analysis of tem images this suggested that ps bare and ps cooh were well dispersed in milli q water in contrast the dh of ps nh2 154 8 8 nm was much larger than its diameter obtained from the tem observation given that the polydispersivity index pdi value of ps nh2 was less than 0 3 table s1 aggregation or coagulation was unlikely to occur in the ps nh2 suspension yu et al 2019 the difference between the tem and the dls results can be ascribed to the fact that the tem only provides the core size whilst the dls also measures the thickness of the polymer layer and the hydration shell wang et al 2020 the surface charges of the psnps as a function of ph are shown in fig s3 the ps bare and ps cooh maintained a negative charge within the ph range 3 0 10 investigated considering that the ph of natural waters commonly ranges from 5 0 to 9 0 the ps bare and ps cooh may remain suspended for a long time in aqueous environments the surface charge of ps nh2 gradually decreased when increasing solution ph from 3 to 7 and then remained relatively stable from ph 7 to 10 fig s3 this phenomenon is indicative of dissociation of surface carboxyl and hydroxyl groups yi et al 2015 moreover the absolute zeta potentials of these three particles were higher than 30 mv at ph 5 0 meaning the psnps were electrostatically stable it was therefore favorable for conducting aggregation experiment under ph 5 0 3 2 surface modification dependent aggregation of psnps in nacl cacl2 and na2so4 the size evolution of ps bare ps cooh and ps nh2 as a function of cation and anion type as well as electrolyte concentrations are plotted in fig s4 the hydrodynamic diameters of the amino modified psnps increased barely at a wide range of electrolyte concentrations e g 1000 mm nacl 100 mm cacl2 and 500 mm na2so4 suggesting that they possess a good dispersion ability in moderate salt concentrations fig s4 this high dispersity of amino modified psnps may be derived from the branched polymer pei chain layer 0 4 mmol g on their surface which thus provides a steric repulsion to overcome the electrostatic attraction dong et al 2019 yu et al 2019 since the concentration of na ca2 cl and so4 2 in most of natural fresh water is prevalently lower than 100 mm ps nh2 will be stable for a long time in aquatic environments posing a potential risk to aquatic organisms it is worth noting that the dh of positively charged ps nh2 slightly increased even in 1000 mm nacl but significantly increased in 800 mm na2so4 fig 1 this result was in line with tem images fig s5a and s5c and was consistent with the so called hofmeister series which states that the ion specific impact on the aggregation of nanoparticles follows the sequence co3 2 so4 2 h2po4 f cl br no3 i clo4 confirming that so4 2 can provide more effective charge screening effects and is more accessible to the surface of particles as compared to cl oncsik et al 2015 he et al 2017 song et al 2020 in the three electrolytes studied negatively charged ps bare and ps cooh displayed a similar trend regarding to the increase of dh within a certain concentration range of electrolytes the increase of both cation and anion concentration enhanced the aggregation rate as revealed by the corresponding attachment efficiencies α fig 1 at higher ion concentration the aggregation rate approached the maximum and was independent of the electrolyte concentration α 1 fig 1 these findings showed that the aggregation behavior of ps bare and ps cooh in the presence of nacl cacl2 and na2so4 is consistent with the traditional dlvo theory this is similar to the observations for sulfate modified psnps zno nps and tio2 nps peng et al 2015 he et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the cccna and cccca of carboxyl modified psnps were significantly lower than the corresponding values of non modified psnps suggesting that aggregation of ps cooh was favored in nacl and cacl2 solution table 1 this finding is mainly attributed to the carboxyl group present on the surface of psnps which is capable of offering sorption sites for cations and complexation with cations song et al 2019 additionally divalent ca2 drove the aggregation of ps bare and ps cooh more aggressively than monovalent na as confirmed by the results of the ccc and sem measurements table 1 and fig s6 this can be explained by the fact that divalent cations possess more effective charge screening or charge neutralization than monovalent cations because of their higher electronic charges as described in previous publications ren et al 2014 tan et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the ccc for so4 2 in ps bare was determined to be 200 mm which was lower than the ccc for addition of cl table 1 it again confirmed that so4 2 was much more efficient in destabilizing psnps suspensions compared to cl as mainly resulting from its stronger charge neutralization ability as aforementioned he et al 2017 however the ccc of ps cooh followed the order cccso4 2 ccccl which was opposite to the results obtained in non modified psnps a similar trend was also reported by baalousha et al 2013 who found that cl was more efficient in destabilizing citrate coated ag nps in comparison to so4 2 these findings indicated that the environmental behavior of nanoparticles is controlled by the interaction between their surface properties and the composition of the aqueous solution yu et al 2019 3 3 protein corona mediated aggregation of psnps in nacl cacl2 and na2so4 the influence of bsa on the hydrodynamic diameter of the three psnps over a wide range of nacl cacl2 and na2so4 concentrations is illustrated in fig s7 compared with the case of absence of bsa 1 mg c l bsa addition inhibited the aggregation of amino modified psnps under 1000 mm nacl and 100 mm cacl2 solution fig 1g and 1h suggesting that the presence of bsa enhanced the stability of ps nh2 similar results were obtained by sheng et al 2016 who reported that the presence of bsa enhanced the stability of hematite nps at high salt concentration they concluded that at a high electrolyte level the patch charge attractive force can be screened being an electrostatic double layer force and thus the steric hinderance resulted from bsa corona stabilized hematite nps here we speculate the screening of the attractive patch charge force may involve in the well dispersity at high nacl and cacl2 solution furthermore this stabilization effect of bsa may be explained by competitive cation adsorption between protein molecules and ps nh2 as will be discussed later differently the presence of 1 mg c l bsa promoted the aggregation of ps nh2 in na2so4 solution as revealed by the measured dh fig 1i tem results provided additional evidence that in the presence of bsa obviously more compacted ps nh2 aggregates formed in the presence of na2so4 than that in the presence of nacl fig s5b and s5d these above mentioned results indicate that ion type and ion valence play important roles in mediating the aggregation behavior of nanoparticles the presence of bsa enhanced the colloidal stability of ps bare and ps cooh and shifted the cccs of ps bare and ps cooh to higher ionic concentrations for the three studied electrolytes table 1 ren et al 2017 reported a similar trend in the impact of bsa on the stability of tio2 nps while the underlying mechanism was not well discussed here the stabilizing role of bsa was visually corroborated by tem images of psnps incubated with bsa cacl2 and bsa cacl2 respectively fig 2 in the presence of cacl2 only ps bare or ps cooh formed clear bonds to yield larger and compressed aggregates fig 2a and 2b however the aggregates were relatively well dispersed and the clear bonds of particles completely disappeared in the presence of bsa and cacl2 in addition the xdlvo calculation confirmed that the energy barriers of psnps in the presence of bsa were higher than those of psnps without bsa addition fig s8 based on these observations we concluded that the elevated cccs result from steric hindrance due to bsa adsorption on the particle surface which also has been reported in non plastics nanomaterials li and sun 2011 wang et al 2015 song et al 2020 the detailed interaction mechanism will be discussed in the latter part remarkably even though 1 mg c l bsa did enhance the stability of ps bare and ps cooh in the presence of both mono and divalent electrolyte solutions the ccc values obtained in ps bare and ps cooh displayed a drastic difference in the absence of bsa the cccna and cccca of carboxyl modified psnps were significantly lower than the cccs of non modified psnps however after bsa addition the cccs of ps cooh in nacl cacl2 and na2so4 solution were significantly higher than in the case of ps bare indicating that ps cooh favors to suspend in aqueous systems containing proteins as compared with ps bare this finding again showed that surface properties of nanoparticles are a critical factor when evaluating the environmental behavior and fate of nanoparticles by further analysis of the cccs obtained with or without bsa we found that after bsa addition the ratio of cccna and cccca in ps bare was decreased from 0 11 to 0 09 whereas this ratio in case of ps cooh was increased from 0 08 to 0 16 table 1 the decrease of the ratio of cccna and cccca in case of ps bare can be attributed to formation of ca2 bridges in the presence of bsa as verified by the wider elemental calcium distribution in bsa treatment compared to the bsa free treatment fig 3 a and b although ca2 bridges also involved in the destabilization of ps cooh in the presence of bsa fig 3c and 3d however as compared with ps bare higher cacl2 concentrations are needed for achieving significant aggregation in ps cooh a reasonable explanation was the different surface properties of psnps which may lead to different interaction pattern with protein bhatkalkar et al 2020 the detailed interaction mechanism between psnps and bsa discussed in the later part 3 4 stability of psnps in typical natural waters the aggregation behavior of ps bare ps cooh and ps nh2 was further investigated in 9 realistic surface water samples including sea water river water and lake water the detailed sample information and physiochemical properties of the water samples are presented in table s2 and s3 it is clearly shown that the three psnps remained stable in river waters and lake waters fig s9 as shown in table s3 the contents of dissolved organic matter in river and lake water samples ranged from 4 42 to 14 6 mg c l which can stabilize particles via steric repulsion due to the formation of a nom natural organic matters corona tan et al 2019 this supported our above mentioned findings that nom plays a significant role in stabilization of psnps the combined effect of high ionic strength and divalent cations in the three sea water samples contributed to the significant aggregation of ps bare and ps cooh highlighting the importance of ion composition ion type and ionic strength of natural water in destabilizing psnps additionally the high concentration of so4 2 and cl in sea water samples did not lead to the aggregation of ps nh2 which was contrary to the results obtained from experimental conditions the complicated components in natural water such as cations nom inorganic colloids might contribute to the high stability of ps nh2 it implied that the environmental behavior of psnps is more complicated in realistic scenarios than in experimental conditions which thus deserves to further elaborate the exact aggregation behavior and stability of psnps in natural ecosystems undoubtedly the current study clearly depicts that psnps will suspend in the synthetic and natural fresh waters for a long time these findings improve our knowledge regarding the stability and aggregation of nanoparticles under relevantly environmental conditions containing noms and ions which is help us to better predict the environmental fate and toxicity of psnps 3 5 underlying mechanisms of protein corona mediated aggregation behavior of psnps based on the aforementioned discussion it can be concluded that the stability of psnps is controlled by the formation of a protein corona to disclose the intrinsic mechanisms by which bsa influences the aggregation of psnps the α of psnps at fixed electrolyte concentrations ccc as a function of bsa concentration were investigated fig 4 a c and s10 for the negatively charged ps bare and ps cooh the α values in the presence of nacl cacl2 and na2so4 exhibited similar trends specifically the addition of 0 1 mg c l bsa led to faster aggregation of ps bare and ps cooh compared to the condition without bsa addition this can be explained by the decreasing electrostatic repulsion as a consequence of adsorption of bsa molecules on particles as confirmed by the measured zeta potentials and the tem images fig 4d and e 5 a and b as the concentration of bsa increased from 1 to 10 mg c l bsa the α of ps bare and ps cooh decreased gradually and tended to 0 meaning that ps bare and ps cooh became more and more stabilized the unchanged zeta potentials and negative staining tem images demonstrated that the efficient dispersity of ps bare and ps cooh in the presence of high bsa content resulted from steric hinderance arising from the protein corona structure figs 4 and 5 this is in line with the findings of tan et al 2019 who demonstrated that the formation of a nom corona enhanced the stability of black phosphorus on the contrary the effects of bsa on the stability of positively charged ps nh2 did not display a bsa concentration dependent manner fig 4c in the presence of nacl and cacl2 the α of ps nh2 remained 0 at all studied bsa concentrations the addition of bsa significantly elevated this value in the presence of na2so4 the zeta potentials of ps nh2 as a function of bsa concentrations in the absence of electrolytes showed that bsa addition decreased the surface charge of ps nh2 and reversed its charge as the bsa concentration was further increased fig 4f similar results were also reported by sun et al 2018 this indirectly implied that bsa adsorbed on the surface of ps nh2 however tem results depicted that only a small amount of bsa molecules were attached on the surface of ps nh2 and the interaction between bsa and ps nh2 did not form a protein corona structure even in 10 mg c l bsa fig 5c f and i these results suggest that a distinct mechanism dominated the aggregation behavior of psnps with different surface coatings as bsa is present to better understand the mechanism of interaction between different surface functionalization of psnps and bsa ftir spectra were first applied as shown in fig s11 after incubation with bsa the ftir spectra of psnps became similar to that of free bsa implying the sorption and coverage of bsa on psnps however because of the nano size and low density of psnps the ftir cannot well differentiate the bound and unbound protein in the mixture during the freeze dried process thus uv vis spectra fluorescence spectra and cd spectra were further employed to corroborate the ftir results the results of the uv vis spectra exhibited obvious absorbance peaks at 226 and 280 nm which can be attributed to the secondary folding of the protein and the π π transition of aromatic amino acid residues such as tyrosine tryptophan and phenylalanine amara et al 2016 after interaction the absorbance of bsa increased significantly in the presence of two negatively charged psnps with no shift in the location of the characteristic peaks fig 6 a and b this suggests that the binding of ps bare ps cooh induced a conformational change of bsa the incubation of bsa with psnps with different surface coatings 0 100 mg l led to a reduction in the intrinsic tyrosin and or tryptophan and or phenylalanine fluorescence intensity of bsa confirming that psnps can complexed with aromatic amino acids residues of bsa fig 6d f sun et al 2018 the cd spectra of bsa depicted two typical bands at 208 and 222 nm which are usually used to reflect the α helical structure of the protein fig 6g i tian et al 2015 with the increase of the concentration of ps bare and ps cooh the ellipticity of bsa decreased gradually indicating that they can interact with the amino acid residues of bsa compared to negatively charged psnps the band corresponding to the positively charged ps nh2 interacting with bsa showed a slight increase in uv abs intensity a slight decrease in fluorescence intensity and a negligible change in the α helical structure this means that few proteins were adsorbed on the surface of ps nh2 this is in line with the tem results fig 5 hence for ps nh2 the addition of bsa enhanced the amount of protein molecules in solution which may alleviate the charge screening resulting from the increasing electrolyte concentration due to the complexation of protein and cations moreover at the experimental concentration 10 mg l psnps at which aggregation was studied ps cooh exhibited more efficiency in interacting with the amino acid residues of bsa in comparison to ps bare which qualitatively reflected that the interaction between protein and ps cooh was higher than the case of ps bare accordingly the protein corona structure provided more steric hindrance for ps cooh than for ps bare which in turn led to higher cccs for ps cooh than in case of ps bare 4 conclusions this study revealed the distinct effects of bsa on the aggregation kinetics of psnps with different surface coatings under environmentally relevant conditions the surface functional groups of psnps controlled the amount of adsorbed protein and subsequent steric stabilization or electrostatic destabilization of psnps upon addition of nacl and cacl2 a low amount of bsa accelerated the aggregation of the negatively charged ps bare and ps cooh aggregates but depressed the aggregation of the positively charged ps nh2 due to the distinct surface properties of the psnps and the different interactions between psnps and bsa the formation of a protein corona resulted in significant stabilization of the negatively charged ps bare and ps cooh indicating that these psnps are highly mobile in surface waters the aggregation behavior of the positively charged ps nh2 in na2so4 solution was considerably different from the case of addition of nacl in the presence of na2so4 the addition of bsa tended to stabilize the negatively charged psnps but destabilized the positively charged ps nh2 we thus suggest that the inherent properties of particles the interaction between particles and nom as well as the ion composition of a given aqueous environment need to be carefully considered when assessing the transport and bioavailability of nanoparticles in surface water it should be noted that the biotic and abiotic processes may significantly influence the properties and compositions of the discharged plastics debris hence the aging of plastics and the presence of naturally occurring colloids impacts the aggregation behavior and colloidal stability of nanoplastics this topic clearly warrants future investigations declaration of competing interest there is no

17289,deciphering responses of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton to environmental change crucial for understanding and mitigating of cyanobacterial blooms is an important but poorly investigated subject using miseq sequencing we investigated the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of rare and abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic lake nanhu before and after dredging we estimated environmental breadths and phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences of rare and abundant bacterioplankton and investigated community function and bacterioplankton assembly processes both taxonomic and phylogenic distances of rare and abundant bacterioplankton communities were significantly positively correlated with the dissimilarity of environmental factors threshold indicator taxa analysis and blomberg s k statistic indicated that rare taxa held broader environmental thresholds and stronger phylogenetic signals for ecological traits than abundant taxa environmental adaptations of both rare and abundant taxa exhibited distinct changes after dredging higher functional redundancy occurred in the abundant compared to the rare bacterioplankton with functions of rare bacterioplankton decreasing and for the abundant ones increasing after dredging the null model revealed that dispersal limitation belonging to stochastic processes determined the abundant bacterioplankton community assembly whereas variable selection belonging to deterministic processes drove the rare one rare bacterioplankton was more environmentally constrained than the abundant one dissolved oxygen was the decisive factor in determining the balance between stochasticity and determinism in both rare and abundant bacterioplankton our study extends our knowledge of environmental

heterotrophic bacteria play significant roles in key element cycling of aquatic systems e g carbon degradation nitrogen fixation phosphorus solubilization and sulfur transformation lavik et al 2009 stegen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 and represent important resources in aquatic food webs azam et al 1983 graham et al 2014 cyanobacteria one of the most important members of bacteriaplankton in both marine and freshwater ecosystems are responsible for providing essential oxygen to most living organisms hamilton et al 2016 soo et al 2017 lately excessive growth of cyanobacteria following eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems forms massive blooms which become a global environmental issue leading to extensive oxygen depletion during bloom breakdown te et al 2017 as a consequence they directly affect the diversity of aquatic organisms and indirectly threaten environmental and human health by releasing algal toxins and causing lack of oxygen huisman et al 2018 cyanobacterial mass blooms in aquatic ecosystems are strongly correlated with the superfluous loading of nitrogen n and phosphorus p paerl et al 2011 li et al 2020 and their seasonal massive growth mainly rely on the dynamic changes in nutrient and temperature bunse and pinhassi 2017 yan et al 2017a huisman et al 2018 in addition a prior study reveals that non cyanobacterial bacterioplankton might also affect cyanobacterial biomass te et al 2017 flavobacterium oxalobacteraceae and streptomyces have positive effects on cyanobacterial growth and arthrobacter gracilibacteria parcubacteria and pedobacter exhibit negative effects berg et al 2009 te et al 2017 wan et al 2020a thereby diversity community composition interactions and function of the bacterioplankton are closely correlated with both water and sediment physicochemical properties especially n and p sources zhang et al 2017 wan et al 2020a consequently understanding bacterioplankton community dynamics in response to environmental changes would provide mechanistic insights for cyanobacterial bloom mitigation bacterioplankton α and β diversity substantially vary along environmental gradients e g nutrient temperature and oxygen lindström et al 2006 lindström and östman 2011 lindström and langenheder 2012 shen et al 2018 several ecological theories that attempt to explain diversity environment relationships mainly consider live strategies of species e g competition and cooperation and its in situ resource e g space and nutrient availability niño garcía et al 2016 lu et al 2019 huber et al 2020 heterogeneity in substrate preference and environmental stress adaptations of species result in differences in bacterioplankton growth rate and abundance li et al 2011 salcher et al 2013 this can lead to an inhomogeneous distribution of bacterioplankton abundance in a local microbial community with relatively few dominant and a large number of rare species alternatively known as rare biosphere sogin et al 2006 prior studies have described that rare and abundant species often exhibit distinct distribution patterns and functional traits liu et al 2015 jiao and lu 2020a therefore deciphering the distribution pattern and community assembly process of rare and abundant species is vital for understanding microbe driven ecosystem processes and functions environmental heterogeneity is an important determinant in shaping species distribution patterns and affecting abundance in aquatic ecosystems pontarp et al 2013 marshall et al 2019 richness of a rare or abundant species is the result of a balance between its growth and death rates pedrós alió 2007 ratzke et al 2018 but both groups of microbial taxa show diverse responses to environmental change mo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 environmental thresholds of species reflect changes in taxa distributions along an environmental gradient over space or time baker and king 2010 for example environmental thresholds of bacterioplankton in streams and rivers along the oklahoma arkansas border are evaluated by using the accumulated values of change points of all the species in a given bacterial community lebrun et al 2018 optional environmental thresholds rarely integrate the whole richness occurrence and directionality of microbial responses at the species level and the limited research is concentrated on standardized phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis of aquatic ecosystems affected by human activity in addition responses of microorganisms to environmental change reveal phylogenetic conservatism with species being non randomly distributed along the tree of life martiny et al 2013 martiny et al 2015 for example rare bacterioplankton show strong conservatism of negative responses to total nitrogen and total phosphorus while abundant bacterioplankton exhibit strong conservatism of positive responses li et al 2017 salinity and ph are crucial determinants in shaping bacterial distribution patterns in aquatic ecosystems cottrel et al 2005 silveira et al 2011 bunse et al 2016 comte et al 2017 lu et al 2019 and the response traits of ph and salinity preferences are reported to be relatively deeply conserved martiny et al 2015 therefore evaluating the phylogenetic patterns of microbial response traits provides predictions for microbial distribution pattern and their responses to environmental change however phylogenetic pattern and response threshold of bacterioplankton communities to ongoing environmental change especially rare and abundant taxa have not been simultaneously studied in eutrophic lakes with massive cyanobacterial blooms disentangling different community assembly processes and their contributions is a key issue in microbial ecology stegen et al 2016 huber et al 2020 wan et al 2021 generally stochastic and deterministic i e species sorting processes have been evaluated in respect to their contributions to microbial community assembly yan et al 2017b wang et al 2020 thereby rare bacterial taxa seem to be limited more by local environmental conditions than abundant ones e g in chinese inland freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2015 in addition in three subtropical bays of china dispersal of rare bacterial taxa seems to be more limited than abundant ones mo et al 2018 environmental factors play important roles in balancing stochastic and deterministic processes jiao and lu 2020b wan et al 2021 for example availability of organic carbon can shift bacterial community assembly from stochastic to deterministic stegen et al 2016 yet it remains unknown whether similar environmental factors mediate the governance of stochasticity and determinism in community assembly of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems lake nanhu located in wuhan china plays important roles in providing entertainment controlling flood and supplying aquatic products in the last decades lake nanhu suffered from seasonally and periodically massive cyanobacterial blooms wuhan water authority 2014 http en 0430 com cn web113017 many ecological restoration measures have been used to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms dredging alternatively named as removal of sediment has been reported and implemented to enhance the water quality of lake nanhu since july 2017 dredging represents a massive disturbance for the lake ecosystems and caught our interest in exploring the responses of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton in a previous study we observed diversity losses in bacterioplankton communities after dredging and noticeable declines in nutrient content of both water and sediment after dredging wan et al 2020a additionally our prior study also indicated that dredging could mitigate cyanobacterial bloom development by altering the interconnectivity between bacterioplankton communities in the overlying water and sediment biogeochemistry wan et al 2020a in the present study we aimed to i estimate the potential environmental thresholds and phylogenetic distributions of rare and abundant bacterioplankton across diverse environmental gradients before and after dredging ii investigate the major environmental variables influencing assembly processes of rare and abundant bacterioplankton and iii determine relationships between community function and assembly before and after the disturbance event given the low competition potential and growth rate of rare taxa at natural sites pedrós alió 2007 campbell et al 2011 we hypothesize that rare bacterioplankton taxa might be characterized by relatively narrow environmental thresholds and relatively weak phylogenetic signals for traits compared to abundant taxa community assembly processes can be imperative for coupling microbial community structure with their ecosystem functions bannar martin et al 2017 wan et al 2021 we hypothesize community assembly could be indicative for bacterioplankton community function to address our hypotheses we performed 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton in relation to 16 environmental factors and we found rare bacterioplankton exhibited broader environmental thresholds and stronger phylogenetic signals for ecological traits than abundant bacterioplankton 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection dredging occurred in august september and november 2017 and in january and march 2018 but no dredging was performed between april and july 2018 a detailed description of dredging in the lake nanhu is given in our previous study wan et al 2020a a total of 36 each water and sediment samples were collected from nine sites located in eutrophic lake nanhu wuhan china before april and july 2017 and after april and july 2018 intensive lake dredging we measured water

comprised total carbon tc total nitrogen tn inorganic phosphorus ip organic phosphorus op non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip apatite phosphorus ap total phosphorus tp and olsen p were also determined the detailed information about sampling water processing and measuring methods of physicochemical properties are described in detail by wan et al 2020a the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene of bacterioplankton in water were amplified using the universal primer sets 338f 5 act cct acg gga ggc agc a 3 and 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 wan et al 2020a pcr products were purified and then sequenced on an illumina miseq platform detailed procedures of the harvesting of bacterioplankton in water dna extraction gene amplification and raw data processing are described by wan et al 2020a and also summarized in supplemental material experiment 1 the purified sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level against the silva v128 reference the miseq sequencing raw data were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov short read archive sra database under accession numbers prjna391223 2017 water samples and prjna541122 2018 water samples 2 2 data analysis a total of 1528 otus were identified from 1 201 742 purified reads based on the distribution patterns described in prior studies otus with relative abundances less than 0 01 of the total sequences were named as rare those with relative abundances above 0 1 were designated as abundant and the remaining otus 0 01 0 1 were defined as intermediate jiao and lu 2020a to evaluate the pairwise phylogenetic distance between communities beta mean nearest taxon distance βmntd was calculated using the comdistnt function in the picante package functional profiling of bacterioplankton taxa was conducted by applying the package tax4fun2 in r and the functional redundancy index fri of each sample was determined based on the similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences wan et al 2020b wemheuer et al 2020 the fri refers to the proportion of species capable of possessing a particular kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg https www kegg jp function and their phylogenetic relationship to each other wemheuer et al 2020 besides we estimated the effects of physiochemical factors on bacterioplankton community composition by applying permutational multivariate analysis of variance permavona to determine threshold values of rare and abundant bacterioplankton taxa in response to individual physicochemical factors threshold indicator taxa analysis titan was carried out using the titan2 package of r romero et al 2019 jiao and lu 2020b briefly we determined upper and lower thresholds of difference in the rare and abundant bacterioplankton by calculating the sums of taxa scores for otus for each physicochemical variable in addition the phylogenetic signals were estimated for rare and abundant bacterioplankton to test the link between the environmental preference of a bacterioplankton s otu and its phylogeny indicating the response of phylogenetic conservatism to complex habitats martiny et al 2015 goberna and verdú 2016 before achieving this analysis we firstly determined the potential trait information about both rare and abundant bacterioplankton otus in response to each individual physicochemical variable in brief the ecological preferences for each otu were assessed by computing spearman correlations between physicochemical variables and relative abundances of bacterioplankton taxa according to prior studies oliverio et al 2017 jiao and lu 2020b the otus positively or negatively correlated with ph were designated as alkaline preferred or acid preferred the otus positively or negatively correlated with temperature were identified as warm preferred or cold preferred in this study we employed blomberg s k statistic to determine the phylogenetic signals for the environmental preference of rare and abundant bacterioplankton taxa goberna and verdú 2016 oliverio et al 2017 the blomberg s k statistical analysis describes a phylogenetic signal that compares the observed signal in a trait to the signal under a brownian motion based metric of trait evolution on a phylogeny blomberg et al 2003 the k value was measured using the multiphylosigal function in the picante package of r kembel et al 2010 where k values closer to 0 represent a convergent or random pattern of evolution and k values higher than 1 imply strong phylogenetic signals and conservatism of traits goberna and verdú 2016 jiao and lu 2020b the ecological community assembly processes of rare and abundant bacterioplankton were estimated by applying the null model stegen et al 2016 yan et al 2017b huber et al 2020 the null model analysis was carried out to calculate the relative contributions of four ecological processes namely homogeneous selection homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation and variable selection yan et al 2017b huber et al 2020 wang et al 2020 briefly differences in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity were calculated according to the null model based bray curtis based raup crick rcbray and β nearest taxon index βnti using the picante package of r stegen et al 2012 wan et al 2021 βnti values 2 reflect significantly less than the expected phylogenetic turnover homogeneous selection whereas βnti values 2 indicate noticeably more than the expected phylogenetic turnover variable selection stegen et al 2012 the relative contribution of dispersal limitation was assessed as the proportion of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 whereas the relative contribution of homogenizing dispersal was evaluated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the remaining categories of βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 were estimated as the effect of undominated assembly namely no single process drives the variations in community structure stegen et al 2012 effects of physicochemical factors on the assemblies of rare and abundant bacterioplankton communities were estimated using the mantel test where physicochemical factor dissimilarities were calculated using euclidean distance matrices the linear regression between change in fri and βnti was generated based on ordinary least squares 3 results 3 1 distribution patterns of rare and abundant bacterioplankton before dredging a total of 553 327 reads were classified into 1280 otus rare bacterioplankton comprised 60 5 of the total community richness but their total relative abundance accounted for only 2 3 of the whole community abundant bacterioplankton comprised 12 5 of the total community richness but their total relative abundance accounted for 86 3 of the whole community in contrast a total of 648 415 reads were gained after dredging and these reads were assigned to 1274 otus after dredging rare bacterioplankton accounted for 68 4 of the total bacterioplankton community richness but their total relative abundance comprised only 2 1 of the entire community abundant bacterioplankton taxa represented 9 9 of the total bacterioplankton community richness but their total relative abundance accounted for 88 5 of the entire community both rare and abundant otus occupancies were significantly positively correlated with corresponding reads numbers in water samples taken before fig 1 a and after dredging fig 1b abundant otus were more widespread than rare ones in water samples taken before and after dredging before dredging 98 8 of abundant otus and only 22 8 of the rare ones were detected in more than 50 of all samples after dredging 100 of abundant otus and only 24 5 of the rare ones were found in more than 50 of all samples of the retained sequences 99 9 were classified at the phylum level before and after dredging before dredging 30 and 13 phyla were assigned to rare and abundant bacterioplankton respectively the rare bacterioplankton was dominated by proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes with corresponding relative abundances of 38 9 19 0 and 14 8 respectively the abundant bacterioplankton was mainly comprised of proteobacteria 41 8 actinobacteria 29 1 and bacteroidetes 16 7 fig 1c after dredging 32 and 12 phyla were attributed to rare and abundant bacterioplankton respectively rare bacterioplankton was dominated by proteobacteria 40 8 and bacteroidetes 20 0 and the abundant one was dominated by actinobacteria 51 1 proteobacteria 23 9 and bacteroidetes 12 8 fig 1d we estimated both taxonomic and phylogenetic distances for both rare and abundant bacterioplankton in water samples taken before and after dredging fig 2 the community distances based on bray curtis dissimilarity fig 2a and the phylogenetic distances based on βmntd matrices fig 2b of rare and abundant bacterioplankton showed significantly positive correlations with the dissimilarities of environmental factors in water samples taken before and after dredging these results indicated that environmental factors had strong effects on taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the bacterioplankton community additionally community fig 2c and phylogenetic distances fig 2d of rare bacterioplankton were significantly higher than of the abundant one before and after dredging p 0 001 redundancy analysis indicated that environmental factors explained 69 77 and 60 83 variations in abundant bacterioplankton community composition before and after dredging respectively fig s1 in contrast environmental factors explained relatively less variations in rare bacterioplankton community composition with 53 81 and 52 1 of the variations before and after dredging respectively permanova results showed that both water and sediment physicochemical variables revealed different effects on rare and abundant bacterioplankton composition before and after dredging table s1 for instance do exhibited significant effects on the compositions of rare r2 14 65 f 2 75 p 0 01 and abundant r2 23 81 f 5 00 p 0 01 bacterioplankton this implies that rare and abundant bacterioplankton taxa might respond differently to environmental changes 3 2 environmental responses of rare and abundant bacterioplankton abundances of the top 10 rare and abundant bacterioplankton taxa showed different correlations with both water and sediment physicochemical variables before and after dredging table s2 s5 for example otu1205 belonging to bacteroidetes occurred in water samples taken before the dredging and was significantly positively correlated with do environmental threshold analysis was employed to investigate the responses of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton to each of the studied environmental factors based on calculations of z and z fig s2 s5 the rare bacterioplankton exhibited a broader range of environmental thresholds compared to the abundant bacterioplankton for almost all tested variables in the same period fig 3 a it is worth noting that environmental thresholds of rare and abundant taxa in response to some variables declined and in response to some others increased after dredging for instance the environmental thresholds of both rare and abundant taxa decreased for ammonia but increased for nitrate fig 3a this suggested shifts in the adaptation of rare and abundant bacterioplankton to environmental change thus the strength of the relationship between environmental preferences and phylogeny of rare and abundant bacterioplankton was measured to estimate whether ecological traits are predictive for phylogenetic diversity fig 3b blomberg s k statistic revealed that rare bacterioplankton showed stronger phylogenetic signals for most environmental variables than the abundant bacterioplankton in the same period this suggested that within the rare bacterioplankton community closely correlated taxa exhibited similar ecological preferences to the measured environmental factors in addition phylogenetic signals of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton declined for most environmental variables after dredging 3 3 ecological assembly processes and functions of rare and abundant bacterioplankton based on our null model analysis the relative contribution of community assembly processes differed between rare and abundant bacterioplankton before and after dredging fig 4 dispersal limitation belonging to stochastic processes determined community assembly of the abundant bacterioplankton before and after dredging with corresponding relative contributions of 75 8 and 72 5 respectively variable selection belonging to deterministic processes had much smaller effects on community assembly of the abundant bacterioplankton before 24 2 and after 26 1 dredging variable selection 35 9 exhibited relatively larger effects on the community assembly of rare bacterioplankton than homogenizing dispersal 22 9 and dispersal limitation 29 4 before dredging similarly variable selection 33 3 showed relatively larger effects on the community assembly of rare bacterioplankton than homogenizing dispersal 24 8 and dispersal limitation 22 2 after dredging differentiating processes dominated both rare and abundant bacterioplankton community assembly before and after dredging while homogenizing processes contributed partially to rare bacterioplankton community assembly stochastic processes in rare bacterioplankton slightly increased but weakly decreased for abundant bacterioplankton after dredging fig 4 deterministic processes in rare bacterioplankton decreased but increased for abundant bacterioplankton after dredging the ratios of sorting dispersal limitation in rare bacterioplankton were higher than that in the abundant one before and after dredging fig s6 this indicated that rare bacterioplankton is more environmentally constrained than the abundant ones results of mantel test demonstrated that changes in dissolved oxygen do in the water was noticeably correlated with βnti of rare r 0 499 p 0 01 and abundant r 0 221 p 0 01 bacterioplankton before the dredging table 1 this also applied to rare r 0 230 p 0 01 and abundant r 0 127 p 0 05 bacterioplankton after the dredging table 1 this suggested that do serve as a good predictor of assembly processes in both rare and abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic lake nanhu in addition pairwise comparisons of βnti values for rare and abundant bacterioplankton before and after dredging were significantly positively correlated with changes in do fig s7 this indicated that an increasing divergence in dissolved oxygen resulted in an increase in stochasticity in the assembly of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton communities before and after dredging to further explore the interconnections between do and phylogenetic turnover βnti water samples were clustered into subgroups based on do content with increasing dissolved oxygen the relative contributions of stochasticity first increased and then decreased in the rare bacterioplankton before dredging and first declined and then increased in the abundant bacterioplankton before dredging fig s8 similarly the relative contributions of stochasticity increased and then decreased in both rare and abundant bacterioplankton after dredging based on functional profiling results at level 3 kegg orthology functional numbers in the abundant bacterioplankton was comparably higher than that in the rare bacterioplankton before and after dredging fig s9 additionally 5835 functions including c n p and s cycling related enzymes or proteins displayed a higher functional redundancy in the rare bacterioplankton before dredging whereas 2711 functions showed a higher redundancy in the rare bacterioplankton after dredging similarly 3304 and 4355 functions were separately found in abundant bacterioplankton before and after dredging suggesting functions increase in abundant bacterioplankton after dredging some functions were unique value 10 and value 10 in the corresponding communities and sampling period fig s9 for instance 73 functions e g phosphothreonine lyase ec 4 2 3 phosphonopyruvate hydrolase ec 3 11 1 3 and dapdiamide synthase ec 6 3 2 47 were exclusively found in rare bacterioplankton before dredging value 10 and 193 functions e g urease ec 3 5 1 5 arginine decarboxylase ec 4 1 1 19 sulfinoalanine decarboxylase ec 4 1 1 29 and phosphatidylinositol 4 5 bisphosphate 4 phosphatase ec 3 1 3 78 occurred exclusively in rare bacterioplankton after dredging value 10 this suggested the gain of several specific bacterioplankton functions after dredging additionally βnti was slightly and positively correlated with changes in fri of the rare r2 0 0045 p 0 05 fig 5 a and abundant r2 0 0068 p 0 05 fig 5b bacterioplankton before dredging interestingly βnti was significantly positively correlated with changes in fri of the rare r2 0 077 p 0 001 fig 5c and abundant r2 0 013 p 0 05 fig 5d bacterioplankton after dredging this implies that ecological community processes have strong effects on functions of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton after dredging 4 discussion 4 1 broader environmental adaptations of rare than abundant bacterioplankton taxa environmental filtering governs microbial diversity and as a consequence influences microbial and ecosystem functioning wagg et al 2014 a large number of studies have explored the effects of environmental variables on bacterioplankton community composition e g lindström et al 2006 lindström and östman 2011 lindström and langenheder 2012 zhang et al 2017 shen et al 2018 very few of them have investigated the community structures of rare and abundant bacterioplankton though some researches have reported that physical and chemical factors e g temperature ph do turbidity in particular nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus sources affect community composition of the rare and or abundant bacterioplankton liu et al 2015 liao et al 2017 nyirabuhoro et al 2020 only very few studies have reported on adaptations to environmental change of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton these studies have addressed the potential of adaptation to environmental drivers of rare and abundant bacterioplankton community by using two different measures i environmental breadth applying titan analysis baker and king 2010 romero et al 2019 and ii strengths of phylogenetic signals to ecological preference employing blomberg s k statistic blomberg et al 2003 goberna and verdú 2016 environmental breadth can reveal species niche breadth and phylogenetic signals could provide predictions for species evolutionary adaptation in response to environmental changes goberna and verdú 2016 jiao and lu 2020b firstly the rare bacterioplankton exhibited broader response thresholds to most physicochemical factors than the abundant bacterioplankton which is inconsistent with the finding that abundant fungi in agricultural soils present broader response thresholds to environmental factors jiao and lu 2020b this is opposite to our hypothesis and this discrepancy might be greatly due to the higher richness of rare contrary to abundant bacterioplankton additionally abundant bacterioplankton taxa were rather ubiquitous compared to the rare ones before and after dredging this agrees well with several previous findings liu et al 2015 mo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 jiao and lu 2020a in contrast rare bacterioplankton taxa were not distributed evenly and most occurred only in a few water samples which is in accordance with prior reports liu et al 2015 liao et al 2017 mo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 this phenomenon might be driven by the specific environmental condition mass blooms of cyanobacteria wan et al 2020a and rapid environmental changes in human activities e g dredging leading to nutrient loss this may promote the rapid adaptation of the rare bacterioplankton which shows a high phylogenetic and consequently functional richness microorganisms adapting to environmental changes have been characterized for both genetic and physicochemical level chen and zhang 2020 a previous study has revealed that non acidophilic and non thermophilic bacillus subtilis are capable to adapting to extreme temperatures 100 c for up to 8 h and acidic environments ph 1 50 for over 2 years and can maintain their activity by using an extracellular electron transfer chen et al 2019 in addition denitrifying phosphorus accumulating bacterium enterobacter cloacae hw 15 adapts to low nutrient conditions by hydrolyzing their intracellularly accumulated polyphosphate wan et al 2017 environmental threshold analysis using titan has been reported in some aquatic biodiversity related research monk et al 2017 lebrun et al 2018 romero et al 2019 for example total phosphorus in streams and rivers along the oklahoma arkansas border are correlated to the structure and functional capability of the bacterioplankton and archaeal communities lebrun et al 2018 findings of environmental breadths of microorganisms using environmental threshold analysis are appealing but are also controversially discussed regarding implications to the real field situation therefore confirmatory experiments are required to applying such statistical results for advising environmental policy nevertheless our results provide a solid statistical hint for the potentially broader environmental breadths of rare bacterioplankton taxa compared to abundant bacterioplankton taxa in eutrophic lakes these findings are to our knowledge novel and have not been reported before secondly based on blomberg s k statistic we found that rare bacterioplankton taxa exhibited stronger phylogenetic signals for environmental preference than the abundant ones this result is inconsistent to previous findings highlighting that abundant bacteria in chinese agricultural soils show stronger phylogenetic signals for environmental preference than rare ones jiao and lu 2020a this discrepancy can be partially explained by differences in bacterial community composition and environment heterogeneity e g soils are usually much more complex than aquatic ecosystems several previous studies have reported that functional traits derived from the ecological preferences of a species rely on its evolutionary history graham and fine 2008 saladin et al 2019 for example traits of bacteria in four forest ecosystems are to a higher degree constrained by evolutionary history than environmental heterogeneity e g temperature precipitation and dominant vegetation morrissey et al 2019 this notion is confirmed by more specific differences in evolution history of two novel ammonia oxidizing bacteria of canonical nitrospira and comammox nitrospira which leads to distinct responses to external nitrogen sources palomo et al 2018 high phylogenetic conservatism of microbial response traits to environmental preference has been studied earlier martiny et al 2015 thereafter microbial response traits to salinity and ph preferences are deeply phylogenetically conserved indicated generally by the decisive roles of salinity and ph in determining microbial distribution pattern cottrel et al 2005 silveira et al 2011 bunse et al 2016 comte et al 2017 in our study the rare bacterioplankton taxa showed stronger phylogenetic signals for ecological preferences which might indicate that rare taxa possess higher phylogenetic niche conservatism with respect to evolutionary history of environmental adaptation bennett et al 2010 the stronger phylogenetic signals of the rare bacterioplankton for ecological preferences could explain why rare bacterioplankton taxa have broader environmental breadths and distinct distribution patterns than the abundant ones in summary our results of environmental breadth and phylogenetic signal analyses indicate that rare and abundant bacterioplankton possess distinct adaptations to various environmental conditions in a eutrophic lake following environmental disturbance by dredging we found clear shifts decrease or increase in environmental adaptations of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton based on both environmental breadth and phylogenetic signal analyses 4 2 different assembly processes dominate rare and abundant bacterioplankton microbial community composition and functions are regarded as being governed by different ecological mechanisms and therefore it is important to estimate the relative contributions of stochastic and deterministic processes to microbial community assembly stegen et al 2016 bannar martin et al 2017 in the assemblies of abundant bacterioplankton communities stochastic processes i e dispersal limitation dominated before and after dredging for the assemblies of abundant bacterioplankton communities deterministic processes i e variable selection were more important than dispersal limitation and homogenizing dispersal before and after dredging these results are in line with findings that rare bacterial taxa are more constrained by environmental factors than abundant ones in agricultural soils jiao and lu 2020a and inland freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2015 these findings however differ from previous studies describing that dispersal of rare bacterial taxa is more limited than that of abundant ones in three subtropical bays of china mo et al 2018 and in wetland soils ji et al 2020 these discrepancies might be attributed to differences in habitat characteristics and geography jiao and lu 2020b for example it has been shown that stochastic processes increase with higher nutrient condition while deterministic processes seem to be more related to low nutrient conditions chase 2010 zhou et al 2014 bacteria in aquatic ecosystems can easier disperse and hence reach nutrient rich conditions or escape from unfavorable conditions e g predator and high temperature than those in a solid medium e g soil simon et al 2016 ariel et al 2017 the observed divergence in different ecological processes governing assemblies of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton communities might be also due to the environmental heterogeneity in general and the individual capability of taxa to handing environmental changes palomo et al 2018 morrissey et al 2019 abundant taxa are more generalists and rare taxa more specialists the high richness of rare taxa represents a high spectrum of specialist species which are doing quite well under different environmental conditions hence their high ecological breadth pedrós alió 2007 our findings however still support a prior report demonstrating that abundant microbial taxa are more limited by dispersion than rare taxa in inland freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2015 to understand microbial community assembly mechanisms it is critical to disentangle environmental factors influencing the relative contributions of both stochastic and deterministic processes stegen et al 2016 jiao et al 2020 wan et al 2021 yet there are only a few studies addressing environmental factors affecting the relative contributions of stochastic versus deterministic processes and their roles for bacterial community assembly in aquatic ecosystems using the null model analysis we found that βnti of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton is more closely correlated with dissolved oxygen than other variables before and after dredging this might indicate that dissolved oxygen represents a crucial factor adjusting the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes for both rare and abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems the critical role of dissolved oxygen in determining assembly processes of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton might be to a large extend attributed to the oxygen requirement for most living heterotrophic microorganisms soo et al 2017 oxygen availability is greatly determining the redox state of an ecosystem and hence is essential as the most potent electron acceptor for microbial respiration cao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 yet oxygen can be also a poison for some functional anaerobic bacteria in participating in key element cycling in aquatic ecosystems yan et al 2018 for instance nitrogen fixation and denitrification processes and methane and phosphine formation require anoxic or anaerobic condition for bacteria jenkins et al 2000 lavik et al 2009 kobayashi et al 2019 therefore it is likely that dissolved oxygen might determine bacterioplankton community assembly via its impact on both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and growth considering the importance of photosynthesis for oxygen generation factors directly or indirectly related to photosynthesis e g light intensity nutrient and metal ions might also be decisive for stochastic and deterministic processes future work needs to explore the precise role of various environmental factors for community assembly processes of bacterioplankton in more differing aquatic ecosystems ultimately we have constructed a conceptual framework to describe the environmental adaptation and community assembly processes of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic lake fig 6 rare bacterioplankton exhibited broader environmental breadths and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preference than the abundant one before and after dredging however environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacterioplankton varied differently after dredging the abundant bacterioplankton exhibited a higher functional redundancy than the rare bacterioplankton and functions of rare bacterioplankton decreased while functions of abundant bacterioplankton increased after dredging stochastic processes governed the abundant bacterioplankton community and deterministic processes dominated in the rare community before and after dredging dissolved oxygen was the crucial factor in determining community assembly processes of rare and abundant bacterioplankton indicating distinct changes in stochasticity with higher dissolved oxygen content 5 conclusions in this study we characterized taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacterioplankton along environmental gradients in the eutrophic lake nanhu to our knowledge our dna based datasets and statistical analysis is the first to reveal that rare bacterioplankton are more environmentally constrained than the abundant bacterioplankton and rare bacterioplankton have better environmental adaptation potentials than abundant one dissolved oxygen exhibits a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes in community assemblies of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton dredging as a disturbance could result in functional changes in bacterioplankton community and thus imply dredging is a useful approach in mitigating cyanobacterial blooms community assembly could be a bio indicator for evaluating the bacterioplankton community function our findings are of significance for understanding the maintenance of bacterioplankton diversity and offer a way to predict the response of bacterioplankton to environmental changes caused e g by dredging in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems considering the importance of bacterioplankton for health of

17289,deciphering responses of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton to environmental change crucial for understanding and mitigating of cyanobacterial blooms is an important but poorly investigated subject using miseq sequencing we investigated the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of rare and abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic lake nanhu before and after dredging we estimated environmental breadths and phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences of rare and abundant bacterioplankton and investigated community function and bacterioplankton assembly processes both taxonomic and phylogenic distances of rare and abundant bacterioplankton communities were significantly positively correlated with the dissimilarity of environmental factors threshold indicator taxa analysis and blomberg s k statistic indicated that rare taxa held broader environmental thresholds and stronger phylogenetic signals for ecological traits than abundant taxa environmental adaptations of both rare and abundant taxa exhibited distinct changes after dredging higher functional redundancy occurred in the abundant compared to the rare bacterioplankton with functions of rare bacterioplankton decreasing and for the abundant ones increasing after dredging the null model revealed that dispersal limitation belonging to stochastic processes determined the abundant bacterioplankton community assembly whereas variable selection belonging to deterministic processes drove the rare one rare bacterioplankton was more environmentally constrained than the abundant one dissolved oxygen was the decisive factor in determining the balance between stochasticity and determinism in both rare and abundant bacterioplankton our study extends our knowledge of environmental adaptation of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton to massive disturbing measures i e dredging and allows to estimate dredging performance for mitigating cyanobacterial blooms from a molecular ecology viewpoint graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords community assembly environmental breadth environmental disturbance heterotrophic bacteria phylogenetic signal 1 introduction heterotrophic bacteria play significant roles in key element cycling of aquatic systems e g carbon degradation nitrogen fixation phosphorus solubilization and sulfur transformation lavik et al 2009 stegen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 and represent important resources in aquatic food webs azam et al 1983 graham et al 2014 cyanobacteria one of the most important members of bacteriaplankton in both marine and freshwater ecosystems are responsible for providing essential oxygen to most living organisms hamilton et al 2016 soo et al 2017 lately excessive growth of cyanobacteria following eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems forms massive blooms which become a global environmental issue leading to extensive oxygen depletion during bloom breakdown te et al 2017 as a consequence they directly affect the diversity of aquatic organisms and indirectly threaten environmental and human health by releasing algal toxins and causing lack of oxygen huisman et al 2018 cyanobacterial mass blooms in aquatic ecosystems are strongly correlated with the superfluous loading of nitrogen n and phosphorus p paerl et al 2011 li et al 2020 and their seasonal massive growth mainly rely on the dynamic changes in nutrient and temperature bunse and pinhassi 2017 yan et al 2017a huisman et al 2018 in addition a prior study reveals that non cyanobacterial bacterioplankton might also affect cyanobacterial biomass te et al 2017 flavobacterium oxalobacteraceae and streptomyces have positive effects on cyanobacterial growth and arthrobacter gracilibacteria parcubacteria and pedobacter exhibit negative effects berg et al 2009 te et al 2017 wan et al 2020a thereby diversity community composition interactions and function of the bacterioplankton are closely correlated with both water and sediment physicochemical properties especially n and p sources zhang et al 2017 wan et al 2020a consequently understanding bacterioplankton community dynamics in response to environmental changes would provide mechanistic insights for cyanobacterial bloom mitigation bacterioplankton α and β diversity substantially vary along environmental gradients e g nutrient temperature and oxygen lindström et al 2006 lindström and östman 2011 lindström and langenheder 2012 shen et al 2018 several ecological theories that attempt to explain diversity environment relationships mainly consider live strategies of species e g competition and cooperation and its in situ resource e g space and nutrient availability niño garcía et al 2016 lu et al 2019 huber et al 2020 heterogeneity in substrate preference and environmental stress adaptations of species result in differences in bacterioplankton growth rate and abundance li et al 2011 salcher et al 2013 this can lead to an inhomogeneous distribution of bacterioplankton abundance in a local microbial community with relatively few dominant and a large number of rare species alternatively known as rare biosphere sogin et al 2006 prior studies have described that rare and abundant species often exhibit distinct distribution patterns and functional traits liu et al 2015 jiao and lu 2020a therefore deciphering the distribution pattern and community assembly process of rare and abundant species is vital for understanding microbe driven ecosystem processes and functions environmental heterogeneity is an important determinant in shaping species distribution patterns and affecting abundance in aquatic ecosystems pontarp et al 2013 marshall et al 2019 richness of a rare or abundant species is the result of a balance between its growth and death rates pedrós alió 2007 ratzke et al 2018 but both groups of microbial taxa show diverse responses to environmental change mo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 environmental thresholds of species reflect changes in taxa distributions along an environmental gradient over space or time baker and king 2010 for example environmental thresholds of bacterioplankton in streams and rivers along the oklahoma arkansas border are evaluated by using the accumulated values of change points of all the species in a given bacterial community lebrun et al 2018 optional environmental thresholds rarely integrate the whole richness occurrence and directionality of microbial responses at the species level and the limited research is concentrated on standardized phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analysis of aquatic ecosystems affected by human activity in addition responses of microorganisms to environmental change reveal phylogenetic conservatism with species being non randomly distributed along the tree of life martiny et al 2013 martiny et al 2015 for example rare bacterioplankton show strong conservatism of negative responses to total nitrogen and total phosphorus while abundant bacterioplankton exhibit strong conservatism of positive responses li et al 2017 salinity and ph are crucial determinants in shaping bacterial distribution patterns in aquatic ecosystems cottrel et al 2005 silveira et al 2011 bunse et al 2016 comte et al 2017 lu et al 2019 and the response traits of ph and salinity preferences are reported to be relatively deeply conserved martiny et al 2015 therefore evaluating the phylogenetic patterns of microbial response traits provides predictions for microbial distribution pattern and their responses to environmental change however phylogenetic pattern and response threshold of bacterioplankton communities to ongoing environmental change especially rare and abundant taxa have not been simultaneously studied in eutrophic lakes with massive cyanobacterial blooms disentangling different community assembly processes and their contributions is a key issue in microbial ecology stegen et al 2016 huber et al 2020 wan et al 2021 generally stochastic and deterministic i e species sorting processes have been evaluated in respect to their contributions to microbial community assembly yan et al 2017b wang et al 2020 thereby rare bacterial taxa seem to be limited more by local environmental conditions than abundant ones e g in chinese inland freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2015 in addition in three subtropical bays of china dispersal of rare bacterial taxa seems to be more limited than abundant ones mo et al 2018 environmental factors play important roles in balancing stochastic and deterministic processes jiao and lu 2020b wan et al 2021 for example availability of organic carbon can shift bacterial community assembly from stochastic to deterministic stegen et al 2016 yet it remains unknown whether similar environmental factors mediate the governance of stochasticity and determinism in community assembly of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems lake nanhu located in wuhan china plays important roles in providing entertainment controlling flood and supplying aquatic products in the last decades lake nanhu suffered from seasonally and periodically massive cyanobacterial blooms wuhan water authority 2014 http en 0430 com cn web113017 many ecological restoration measures have been used to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms dredging alternatively named as removal of sediment has been reported and implemented to enhance the water quality of lake nanhu since july 2017 dredging represents a massive disturbance for the lake ecosystems and caught our interest in exploring the responses of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton in a previous study we observed diversity losses in bacterioplankton communities after dredging and noticeable declines in nutrient content of both water and sediment after dredging wan et al 2020a additionally our prior study also indicated that dredging could mitigate cyanobacterial bloom development by altering the interconnectivity between bacterioplankton communities in the overlying water and sediment biogeochemistry wan et al 2020a in the present study we aimed to i estimate the potential environmental thresholds and phylogenetic distributions of rare and abundant bacterioplankton across diverse environmental gradients before and after dredging ii investigate the major environmental variables influencing assembly processes of rare and abundant bacterioplankton and iii determine relationships between community function and assembly before and after the disturbance event given the low competition potential and growth rate of rare taxa at natural sites pedrós alió 2007 campbell et al 2011 we hypothesize that rare bacterioplankton taxa might be characterized by relatively narrow environmental thresholds and relatively weak phylogenetic signals for traits compared to abundant taxa community assembly processes can be imperative for coupling microbial community structure with their ecosystem functions bannar martin et al 2017 wan et al 2021 we hypothesize community assembly could be indicative for bacterioplankton community function to address our hypotheses we performed 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton in relation to 16 environmental factors and we found rare bacterioplankton exhibited broader environmental thresholds and stronger phylogenetic signals for ecological traits than abundant bacterioplankton 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection dredging occurred in august september and november 2017 and in january and march 2018 but no dredging was performed between april and july 2018 a detailed description of dredging in the lake nanhu is given in our previous study wan et al 2020a a total of 36 each water and sediment samples were collected from nine sites located in eutrophic lake nanhu wuhan china before april and july 2017 and after april and july 2018 intensive lake dredging we measured water

comprised total carbon tc total nitrogen tn inorganic phosphorus ip organic phosphorus op non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip apatite phosphorus ap total phosphorus tp and olsen p were also determined the detailed information about sampling water processing and measuring methods of physicochemical properties are described in detail by wan et al 2020a the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene of bacterioplankton in water were amplified using the universal primer sets 338f 5 act cct acg gga ggc agc a 3 and 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 wan et al 2020a pcr products were purified and then sequenced on an illumina miseq platform detailed procedures of the harvesting of bacterioplankton in water dna extraction gene amplification and raw data processing are described by wan et al 2020a and also summarized in supplemental material experiment 1 the purified sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level against the silva v128 reference the miseq sequencing raw data were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov short read archive sra database under accession numbers prjna391223 2017 water samples and prjna541122 2018 water samples 2 2 data analysis a total of 1528 otus were identified from 1 201 742 purified reads based on the distribution patterns described in prior studies otus with relative abundances less than 0 01 of the total sequences were named as rare those with relative abundances above 0 1 were designated as abundant and the remaining otus 0 01 0 1 were defined as intermediate jiao and lu 2020a to evaluate the pairwise phylogenetic distance between communities beta mean nearest taxon distance βmntd was calculated using the comdistnt function in the picante package functional profiling of bacterioplankton taxa was conducted by applying the package tax4fun2 in r and the functional redundancy index fri of each sample was determined based on the similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences wan et al 2020b wemheuer et al 2020 the fri refers to the proportion of species capable of possessing a particular kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg https www kegg jp function and their phylogenetic relationship to each other wemheuer et al 2020 besides we estimated the effects of physiochemical factors on bacterioplankton community composition by applying permutational multivariate analysis of variance permavona to determine threshold values of rare and abundant bacterioplankton taxa in response to individual physicochemical factors threshold indicator taxa analysis titan was carried out using the titan2 package of r romero et al 2019 jiao and lu 2020b briefly we determined upper and lower thresholds of difference in the rare and abundant bacterioplankton by calculating the sums of taxa scores for otus for each physicochemical variable in addition the phylogenetic signals were estimated for rare and abundant bacterioplankton to test the link between the environmental preference of a bacterioplankton s otu and its phylogeny indicating the response of phylogenetic conservatism to complex habitats martiny et al 2015 goberna and verdú 2016 before achieving this analysis we firstly determined the potential trait information about both rare and abundant bacterioplankton otus in response to each individual physicochemical variable in brief the ecological preferences for each otu were assessed by computing spearman correlations between physicochemical variables and relative abundances of bacterioplankton taxa according to prior studies oliverio et al 2017 jiao and lu 2020b the otus positively or negatively correlated with ph were designated as alkaline preferred or acid preferred the otus positively or negatively correlated with temperature were identified as warm preferred or cold preferred in this study we employed blomberg s k statistic to determine the phylogenetic signals for the environmental preference of rare and abundant bacterioplankton taxa goberna and verdú 2016 oliverio et al 2017 the blomberg s k statistical analysis describes a phylogenetic signal that compares the observed signal in a trait to the signal under a brownian motion based metric of trait evolution on a phylogeny blomberg et al 2003 the k value was measured using the multiphylosigal function in the picante package of r kembel et al 2010 where k values closer to 0 represent a convergent or random pattern of evolution and k values higher than 1 imply strong phylogenetic signals and conservatism of traits goberna and verdú 2016 jiao and lu 2020b the ecological community assembly processes of rare and abundant bacterioplankton were estimated by applying the null model stegen et al 2016 yan et al 2017b huber et al 2020 the null model analysis was carried out to calculate the relative contributions of four ecological processes namely homogeneous selection homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation and variable selection yan et al 2017b huber et al 2020 wang et al 2020 briefly differences in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity were calculated according to the null model based bray curtis based raup crick rcbray and β nearest taxon index βnti using the picante package of r stegen et al 2012 wan et al 2021 βnti values 2 reflect significantly less than the expected phylogenetic turnover homogeneous selection whereas βnti values 2 indicate noticeably more than the expected phylogenetic turnover variable selection stegen et al 2012 the relative contribution of dispersal limitation was assessed as the proportion of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 whereas the relative contribution of homogenizing dispersal was evaluated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the remaining categories of βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 were estimated as the effect of undominated assembly namely no single process drives the variations in community structure stegen et al 2012 effects of physicochemical factors on the assemblies of rare and abundant bacterioplankton communities were estimated using the mantel test where physicochemical factor dissimilarities were calculated using euclidean distance matrices the linear regression between change in fri and βnti was generated based on ordinary least squares 3 results 3 1 distribution patterns of rare and abundant bacterioplankton before dredging a total of 553 327 reads were classified into 1280 otus rare bacterioplankton comprised 60 5 of the total community richness but their total relative abundance accounted for only 2 3 of the whole community abundant bacterioplankton comprised 12 5 of the total community richness but their total relative abundance accounted for 86 3 of the whole community in contrast a total of 648 415 reads were gained after dredging and these reads were assigned to 1274 otus after dredging rare bacterioplankton accounted for 68 4 of the total bacterioplankton community richness but their total relative abundance comprised only 2 1 of the entire community abundant bacterioplankton taxa represented 9 9 of the total bacterioplankton community richness but their total relative abundance accounted for 88 5 of the entire community both rare and abundant otus occupancies were significantly positively correlated with corresponding reads numbers in water samples taken before fig 1 a and after dredging fig 1b abundant otus were more widespread than rare ones in water samples taken before and after dredging before dredging 98 8 of abundant otus and only 22 8 of the rare ones were detected in more than 50 of all samples after dredging 100 of abundant otus and only 24 5 of the rare ones were found in more than 50 of all samples of the retained sequences 99 9 were classified at the phylum level before and after dredging before dredging 30 and 13 phyla were assigned to rare and abundant bacterioplankton respectively the rare bacterioplankton was dominated by proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes with corresponding relative abundances of 38 9 19 0 and 14 8 respectively the abundant bacterioplankton was mainly comprised of proteobacteria 41 8 actinobacteria 29 1 and bacteroidetes 16 7 fig 1c after dredging 32 and 12 phyla were attributed to rare and abundant bacterioplankton respectively rare bacterioplankton was dominated by proteobacteria 40 8 and bacteroidetes 20 0 and the abundant one was dominated by actinobacteria 51 1 proteobacteria 23 9 and bacteroidetes 12 8 fig 1d we estimated both taxonomic and phylogenetic distances for both rare and abundant bacterioplankton in water samples taken before and after dredging fig 2 the community distances based on bray curtis dissimilarity fig 2a and the phylogenetic distances based on βmntd matrices fig 2b of rare and abundant bacterioplankton showed significantly positive correlations with the dissimilarities of environmental factors in water samples taken before and after dredging these results indicated that environmental factors had strong effects on taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the bacterioplankton community additionally community fig 2c and phylogenetic distances fig 2d of rare bacterioplankton were significantly higher than of the abundant one before and after dredging p 0 001 redundancy analysis indicated that environmental factors explained 69 77 and 60 83 variations in abundant bacterioplankton community composition before and after dredging respectively fig s1 in contrast environmental factors explained relatively less variations in rare bacterioplankton community composition with 53 81 and 52 1 of the variations before and after dredging respectively permanova results showed that both water and sediment physicochemical variables revealed different effects on rare and abundant bacterioplankton composition before and after dredging table s1 for instance do exhibited significant effects on the compositions of rare r2 14 65 f 2 75 p 0 01 and abundant r2 23 81 f 5 00 p 0 01 bacterioplankton this implies that rare and abundant bacterioplankton taxa might respond differently to environmental changes 3 2 environmental responses of rare and abundant bacterioplankton abundances of the top 10 rare and abundant bacterioplankton taxa showed different correlations with both water and sediment physicochemical variables before and after dredging table s2 s5 for example otu1205 belonging to bacteroidetes occurred in water samples taken before the dredging and was significantly positively correlated with do environmental threshold analysis was employed to investigate the responses of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton to each of the studied environmental factors based on calculations of z and z fig s2 s5 the rare bacterioplankton exhibited a broader range of environmental thresholds compared to the abundant bacterioplankton for almost all tested variables in the same period fig 3 a it is worth noting that environmental thresholds of rare and abundant taxa in response to some variables declined and in response to some others increased after dredging for instance the environmental thresholds of both rare and abundant taxa decreased for ammonia but increased for nitrate fig 3a this suggested shifts in the adaptation of rare and abundant bacterioplankton to environmental change thus the strength of the relationship between environmental preferences and phylogeny of rare and abundant bacterioplankton was measured to estimate whether ecological traits are predictive for phylogenetic diversity fig 3b blomberg s k statistic revealed that rare bacterioplankton showed stronger phylogenetic signals for most environmental variables than the abundant bacterioplankton in the same period this suggested that within the rare bacterioplankton community closely correlated taxa exhibited similar ecological preferences to the measured environmental factors in addition phylogenetic signals of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton declined for most environmental variables after dredging 3 3 ecological assembly processes and functions of rare and abundant bacterioplankton based on our null model analysis the relative contribution of community assembly processes differed between rare and abundant bacterioplankton before and after dredging fig 4 dispersal limitation belonging to stochastic processes determined community assembly of the abundant bacterioplankton before and after dredging with corresponding relative contributions of 75 8 and 72 5 respectively variable selection belonging to deterministic processes had much smaller effects on community assembly of the abundant bacterioplankton before 24 2 and after 26 1 dredging variable selection 35 9 exhibited relatively larger effects on the community assembly of rare bacterioplankton than homogenizing dispersal 22 9 and dispersal limitation 29 4 before dredging similarly variable selection 33 3 showed relatively larger effects on the community assembly of rare bacterioplankton than homogenizing dispersal 24 8 and dispersal limitation 22 2 after dredging differentiating processes dominated both rare and abundant bacterioplankton community assembly before and after dredging while homogenizing processes contributed partially to rare bacterioplankton community assembly stochastic processes in rare bacterioplankton slightly increased but weakly decreased for abundant bacterioplankton after dredging fig 4 deterministic processes in rare bacterioplankton decreased but increased for abundant bacterioplankton after dredging the ratios of sorting dispersal limitation in rare bacterioplankton were higher than that in the abundant one before and after dredging fig s6 this indicated that rare bacterioplankton is more environmentally constrained than the abundant ones results of mantel test demonstrated that changes in dissolved oxygen do in the water was noticeably correlated with βnti of rare r 0 499 p 0 01 and abundant r 0 221 p 0 01 bacterioplankton before the dredging table 1 this also applied to rare r 0 230 p 0 01 and abundant r 0 127 p 0 05 bacterioplankton after the dredging table 1 this suggested that do serve as a good predictor of assembly processes in both rare and abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic lake nanhu in addition pairwise comparisons of βnti values for rare and abundant bacterioplankton before and after dredging were significantly positively correlated with changes in do fig s7 this indicated that an increasing divergence in dissolved oxygen resulted in an increase in stochasticity in the assembly of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton communities before and after dredging to further explore the interconnections between do and phylogenetic turnover βnti water samples were clustered into subgroups based on do content with increasing dissolved oxygen the relative contributions of stochasticity first increased and then decreased in the rare bacterioplankton before dredging and first declined and then increased in the abundant bacterioplankton before dredging fig s8 similarly the relative contributions of stochasticity increased and then decreased in both rare and abundant bacterioplankton after dredging based on functional profiling results at level 3 kegg orthology functional numbers in the abundant bacterioplankton was comparably higher than that in the rare bacterioplankton before and after dredging fig s9 additionally 5835 functions including c n p and s cycling related enzymes or proteins displayed a higher functional redundancy in the rare bacterioplankton before dredging whereas 2711 functions showed a higher redundancy in the rare bacterioplankton after dredging similarly 3304 and 4355 functions were separately found in abundant bacterioplankton before and after dredging suggesting functions increase in abundant bacterioplankton after dredging some functions were unique value 10 and value 10 in the corresponding communities and sampling period fig s9 for instance 73 functions e g phosphothreonine lyase ec 4 2 3 phosphonopyruvate hydrolase ec 3 11 1 3 and dapdiamide synthase ec 6 3 2 47 were exclusively found in rare bacterioplankton before dredging value 10 and 193 functions e g urease ec 3 5 1 5 arginine decarboxylase ec 4 1 1 19 sulfinoalanine decarboxylase ec 4 1 1 29 and phosphatidylinositol 4 5 bisphosphate 4 phosphatase ec 3 1 3 78 occurred exclusively in rare bacterioplankton after dredging value 10 this suggested the gain of several specific bacterioplankton functions after dredging additionally βnti was slightly and positively correlated with changes in fri of the rare r2 0 0045 p 0 05 fig 5 a and abundant r2 0 0068 p 0 05 fig 5b bacterioplankton before dredging interestingly βnti was significantly positively correlated with changes in fri of the rare r2 0 077 p 0 001 fig 5c and abundant r2 0 013 p 0 05 fig 5d bacterioplankton after dredging this implies that ecological community processes have strong effects on functions of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton after dredging 4 discussion 4 1 broader environmental adaptations of rare than abundant bacterioplankton taxa environmental filtering governs microbial diversity and as a consequence influences microbial and ecosystem functioning wagg et al 2014 a large number of studies have explored the effects of environmental variables on bacterioplankton community composition e g lindström et al 2006 lindström and östman 2011 lindström and langenheder 2012 zhang et al 2017 shen et al 2018 very few of them have investigated the community structures of rare and abundant bacterioplankton though some researches have reported that physical and chemical factors e g temperature ph do turbidity in particular nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus sources affect community composition of the rare and or abundant bacterioplankton liu et al 2015 liao et al 2017 nyirabuhoro et al 2020 only very few studies have reported on adaptations to environmental change of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton these studies have addressed the potential of adaptation to environmental drivers of rare and abundant bacterioplankton community by using two different measures i environmental breadth applying titan analysis baker and king 2010 romero et al 2019 and ii strengths of phylogenetic signals to ecological preference employing blomberg s k statistic blomberg et al 2003 goberna and verdú 2016 environmental breadth can reveal species niche breadth and phylogenetic signals could provide predictions for species evolutionary adaptation in response to environmental changes goberna and verdú 2016 jiao and lu 2020b firstly the rare bacterioplankton exhibited broader response thresholds to most physicochemical factors than the abundant bacterioplankton which is inconsistent with the finding that abundant fungi in agricultural soils present broader response thresholds to environmental factors jiao and lu 2020b this is opposite to our hypothesis and this discrepancy might be greatly due to the higher richness of rare contrary to abundant bacterioplankton additionally abundant bacterioplankton taxa were rather ubiquitous compared to the rare ones before and after dredging this agrees well with several previous findings liu et al 2015 mo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 jiao and lu 2020a in contrast rare bacterioplankton taxa were not distributed evenly and most occurred only in a few water samples which is in accordance with prior reports liu et al 2015 liao et al 2017 mo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 this phenomenon might be driven by the specific environmental condition mass blooms of cyanobacteria wan et al 2020a and rapid environmental changes in human activities e g dredging leading to nutrient loss this may promote the rapid adaptation of the rare bacterioplankton which shows a high phylogenetic and consequently functional richness microorganisms adapting to environmental changes have been characterized for both genetic and physicochemical level chen and zhang 2020 a previous study has revealed that non acidophilic and non thermophilic bacillus subtilis are capable to adapting to extreme temperatures 100 c for up to 8 h and acidic environments ph 1 50 for over 2 years and can maintain their activity by using an extracellular electron transfer chen et al 2019 in addition denitrifying phosphorus accumulating bacterium enterobacter cloacae hw 15 adapts to low nutrient conditions by hydrolyzing their intracellularly accumulated polyphosphate wan et al 2017 environmental threshold analysis using titan has been reported in some aquatic biodiversity related research monk et al 2017 lebrun et al 2018 romero et al 2019 for example total phosphorus in streams and rivers along the oklahoma arkansas border are correlated to the structure and functional capability of the bacterioplankton and archaeal communities lebrun et al 2018 findings of environmental breadths of microorganisms using environmental threshold analysis are appealing but are also controversially discussed regarding implications to the real field situation therefore confirmatory experiments are required to applying such statistical results for advising environmental policy nevertheless our results provide a solid statistical hint for the potentially broader environmental breadths of rare bacterioplankton taxa compared to abundant bacterioplankton taxa in eutrophic lakes these findings are to our knowledge novel and have not been reported before secondly based on blomberg s k statistic we found that rare bacterioplankton taxa exhibited stronger phylogenetic signals for environmental preference than the abundant ones this result is inconsistent to previous findings highlighting that abundant bacteria in chinese agricultural soils show stronger phylogenetic signals for environmental preference than rare ones jiao and lu 2020a this discrepancy can be partially explained by differences in bacterial community composition and environment heterogeneity e g soils are usually much more complex than aquatic ecosystems several previous studies have reported that functional traits derived from the ecological preferences of a species rely on its evolutionary history graham and fine 2008 saladin et al 2019 for example traits of bacteria in four forest ecosystems are to a higher degree constrained by evolutionary history than environmental heterogeneity e g temperature precipitation and dominant vegetation morrissey et al 2019 this notion is confirmed by more specific differences in evolution history of two novel ammonia oxidizing bacteria of canonical nitrospira and comammox nitrospira which leads to distinct responses to external nitrogen sources palomo et al 2018 high phylogenetic conservatism of microbial response traits to environmental preference has been studied earlier martiny et al 2015 thereafter microbial response traits to salinity and ph preferences are deeply phylogenetically conserved indicated generally by the decisive roles of salinity and ph in determining microbial distribution pattern cottrel et al 2005 silveira et al 2011 bunse et al 2016 comte et al 2017 in our study the rare bacterioplankton taxa showed stronger phylogenetic signals for ecological preferences which might indicate that rare taxa possess higher phylogenetic niche conservatism with respect to evolutionary history of environmental adaptation bennett et al 2010 the stronger phylogenetic signals of the rare bacterioplankton for ecological preferences could explain why rare bacterioplankton taxa have broader environmental breadths and distinct distribution patterns than the abundant ones in summary our results of environmental breadth and phylogenetic signal analyses indicate that rare and abundant bacterioplankton possess distinct adaptations to various environmental conditions in a eutrophic lake following environmental disturbance by dredging we found clear shifts decrease or increase in environmental adaptations of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton based on both environmental breadth and phylogenetic signal analyses 4 2 different assembly processes dominate rare and abundant bacterioplankton microbial community composition and functions are regarded as being governed by different ecological mechanisms and therefore it is important to estimate the relative contributions of stochastic and deterministic processes to microbial community assembly stegen et al 2016 bannar martin et al 2017 in the assemblies of abundant bacterioplankton communities stochastic processes i e dispersal limitation dominated before and after dredging for the assemblies of abundant bacterioplankton communities deterministic processes i e variable selection were more important than dispersal limitation and homogenizing dispersal before and after dredging these results are in line with findings that rare bacterial taxa are more constrained by environmental factors than abundant ones in agricultural soils jiao and lu 2020a and inland freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2015 these findings however differ from previous studies describing that dispersal of rare bacterial taxa is more limited than that of abundant ones in three subtropical bays of china mo et al 2018 and in wetland soils ji et al 2020 these discrepancies might be attributed to differences in habitat characteristics and geography jiao and lu 2020b for example it has been shown that stochastic processes increase with higher nutrient condition while deterministic processes seem to be more related to low nutrient conditions chase 2010 zhou et al 2014 bacteria in aquatic ecosystems can easier disperse and hence reach nutrient rich conditions or escape from unfavorable conditions e g predator and high temperature than those in a solid medium e g soil simon et al 2016 ariel et al 2017 the observed divergence in different ecological processes governing assemblies of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton communities might be also due to the environmental heterogeneity in general and the individual capability of taxa to handing environmental changes palomo et al 2018 morrissey et al 2019 abundant taxa are more generalists and rare taxa more specialists the high richness of rare taxa represents a high spectrum of specialist species which are doing quite well under different environmental conditions hence their high ecological breadth pedrós alió 2007 our findings however still support a prior report demonstrating that abundant microbial taxa are more limited by dispersion than rare taxa in inland freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2015 to understand microbial community assembly mechanisms it is critical to disentangle environmental factors influencing the relative contributions of both stochastic and deterministic processes stegen et al 2016 jiao et al 2020 wan et al 2021 yet there are only a few studies addressing environmental factors affecting the relative contributions of stochastic versus deterministic processes and their roles for bacterial community assembly in aquatic ecosystems using the null model analysis we found that βnti of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton is more closely correlated with dissolved oxygen than other variables before and after dredging this might indicate that dissolved oxygen represents a crucial factor adjusting the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes for both rare and abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic aquatic ecosystems the critical role of dissolved oxygen in determining assembly processes of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton might be to a large extend attributed to the oxygen requirement for most living heterotrophic microorganisms soo et al 2017 oxygen availability is greatly determining the redox state of an ecosystem and hence is essential as the most potent electron acceptor for microbial respiration cao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 yet oxygen can be also a poison for some functional anaerobic bacteria in participating in key element cycling in aquatic ecosystems yan et al 2018 for instance nitrogen fixation and denitrification processes and methane and phosphine formation require anoxic or anaerobic condition for bacteria jenkins et al 2000 lavik et al 2009 kobayashi et al 2019 therefore it is likely that dissolved oxygen might determine bacterioplankton community assembly via its impact on both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and growth considering the importance of photosynthesis for oxygen generation factors directly or indirectly related to photosynthesis e g light intensity nutrient and metal ions might also be decisive for stochastic and deterministic processes future work needs to explore the precise role of various environmental factors for community assembly processes of bacterioplankton in more differing aquatic ecosystems ultimately we have constructed a conceptual framework to describe the environmental adaptation and community assembly processes of rare versus abundant bacterioplankton in eutrophic lake fig 6 rare bacterioplankton exhibited broader environmental breadths and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preference than the abundant one before and after dredging however environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacterioplankton varied differently after dredging the abundant bacterioplankton exhibited a higher functional redundancy than the rare bacterioplankton and functions of rare bacterioplankton decreased while functions of abundant bacterioplankton increased after dredging stochastic processes governed the abundant bacterioplankton community and deterministic processes dominated in the rare community before and after dredging dissolved oxygen was the crucial factor in determining community assembly processes of rare and abundant bacterioplankton indicating distinct changes in stochasticity with higher dissolved oxygen content 5 conclusions in this study we characterized taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacterioplankton along environmental gradients in the eutrophic lake nanhu to our knowledge our dna based datasets and statistical analysis is the first to reveal that rare bacterioplankton are more environmentally constrained than the abundant bacterioplankton and rare bacterioplankton have better environmental adaptation potentials than abundant one dissolved oxygen exhibits a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes in community assemblies of both rare and abundant bacterioplankton dredging as a disturbance could result in functional changes in bacterioplankton community and thus imply dredging is a useful approach in mitigating cyanobacterial blooms community assembly could be a bio indicator for evaluating the bacterioplankton community function our findings are of significance for understanding the maintenance of bacterioplankton diversity and offer a way to predict the response of bacterioplankton to environmental changes caused e g by dredging in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems considering the importance of bacterioplankton for health of aquatic ecosystems experimental validation of the model should be implemented in more differing freshwater and marine ecosystems ethical statement this article does not contain any studies with human
