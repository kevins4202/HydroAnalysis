6225,an exact analytical solution for one dimensional fluid flow through rock matrix block is presented the nonlinearity induced from flow functions makes the governing equations describing this mechanism difficult to be analytically solved in this paper an analytical solution to the infiltration problems considering non linear relative permeability functions is presented for finite depth despite its profound and fundamental importance elimination of the nonlinear terms in the equation as a complex and tedious task is done by applying several successive mathematical manipulations including hopf cole transformation to obtain a diffusive type pde an exponential type transformation to get a convective diffusive type pde with suitable boundary conditions laplace transformation integral transformation to homogenize the boundary condition in the laplace domain and finally laplace inversion method to find the time domain solution the obtained solution is used for developing a new matrix fracture transfer function the developed analytical equations are used for prediction of drying front in the case of evaporation from deep water table the model results are in close

equation constant laplace domain 1 introduction transport processes modeling of wetting phase in fracture rock is one of the most practical topics in groundwater hydrology petroleum engineering environmental engineering and soil science in recent years a significant body of research has considered flow and transport in unsaturated fractured rock within arid environments glass et al 2002 manna et al 2017 fractured rock aquifers are complex heterogeneous and anisotropic systems hong et al 2002 fractured rocks are considered as systems which consist of matrix blocks and fracture networks it has been observed that matrix blocks store the fluid and fracture blocks provide the main flow path for the fluid produced from the matrix blocks type 2 fractured reservoirs in nelson classification nelson 2001 gravity drainage is an important recovery process in both fractured and unfractured reservoirs where gravity acts as the main driving force this mechanism may occur in primary stages of field development as well as an improved oil recovery process in which gas is supplied from an external source hagoort 1980 reports have indicated surprisingly high oil recoveries by gravity drainage in laboratory experiments in sand pack columns li and horne 2008 field observations have also reported similar results dykstra 1978 king et al 1970 in leverett 1941 and in lewis 1944 discussed the fundamental concepts of the gravity drainage process in 1949 the first analytical modeling of gravity drainage was presented by cardwell and parsons 1949 they simplified the governing equations by dropping the capillary pressure terms and solving equations for a gravity dominated process the first field scale study was presented by hall 1961 in which a computer based model was introduced to simulate gravity drainage in 1978 herman dykstra modified cardwell and parsons model by applying a movable saturation in relative permeability function however this model also neglected capillary terms dykstra 1978 he presented a good example of oil production by strictly considering gravity drainage in the lakeview pool midway sunset oilfield further studies were conducted by hagoort 1980 in which the effect of capillary effect was again neglected however he developed the equations based on fractional flow concept and tried to use centrifugal method for determination of relative permeability curves pavone et al in 1989 analytically solved the partial differential equation governing gravity drainage mechanism and derived a function to predict the saturation distribution and oil recovery for this mechanism in a low ift system pavone 1989 they used a few assumptions such as negligible gas potential gradient incompressible fluids straight line permeability curve and logarithmic capillary pressure trends the linear relative permeability function can only allow for simulation of low ift therefore this simplifying assumption affects the applicability of the solution hills and warrick 1993 developed a solution to burgers equation for a finite depth slab they considered upper boundary condition as a time dependent flux and the lower condition as a constant water content in 1994 firoozabadi and ishimoto solved the linearized the flow equation obtained by pavone et al for different boundary conditions using laplace transform method firoozabadi and ishimoto 1994 they also discussed the gravity drainage process in the presence of re infiltration in a stack of n equal blocks considering complete block to block interaction this model was also based on the linear relative permeability functions in 1994 longeron et al described gravity drainage from the point of view of capillary pressure measurement longeron et al 1994 in 1996 claudio et al presented the gravity drainage governing equation in terms of capillary potential claudio et al 1996 they solved the resulting nonlinear equation numerically and studied the gravity drainage concept in layered porous media in that year schechter and guo used film flow phenomena coupled with darcy s law to derive a new expression for recovery in gravity drainage process as a function of time schechter and guo 1996 in 2004 miguel hernandez et al developed the methods of scaling dimensionless factors to simplify the analysis of gravity drainage process and therefore to identify the main factors controlling this mechanism in naturally fractured reservoirs miguel h et al 2004 in 2006 di donato et al developed the analytical and numerical analysis of oil recovery on a one dimensional porous media subjected to gravity drainage mechanism di donato et al 2006 they validated their numerical model by predicting previously published experimental measurements by pedrera et al 2002 they developed simplified analytical models in gravity capillary dominated time regions the findings of their work showed that when gravity forces dominate the oil recovery scales as a power law with time the exponent in this relation depends on the oil mobility however when capillary forces dominate the oil recovery obeys an exponential behavior with time and also the ultimate recovery is lower than that of the gravity dominated process in 2008 nabipour et al developed a two phase flow model and solved it numerically to predict the oil saturation profile and the rate of oil recovery in layered porous medium under the gas oil gravity drainage mechanism nabipour et al 2008 in 2008 hoteit and firoozabadi used basic mixed finite element mfe framework and proposed a new formulation in 3d systems in which the total velocity was expressed in terms of wetting phase potential gradient and the capillary gradient the results of their study was numerically solved to obtain the simulated parameters hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 they combined mixed finite element with continuous galerkin methods to solve pressure and saturation equations their model could also consider the effect of capillarity heterogeneity later in 2009 boukadi et al presented a simulation code for mimicking gas oil gravity drainage in a fractured porous medium boukadi et al 2009 navier stokes darcy s law capillary pressure and relative permeability constitutive equations were used for numerical modeling of two phase transport phenomenon they also used other constraint equations to determine the phase saturation change with respect to time they solved the momentum and continuity equations to calculate velocities pressure saturation profiles and the recovery from gas oil gravity drainage mechanism they compared the results of their simulator model with experimental results and concluded that the simulation results are in accordance with the experimental observations in 2010 mashayekhizadeh et al used the numerical laplace transforms including stehfest fourier series zakian and schapery algorithms to solve dimensionless mathematical models for predicting drainage flow rate from a single matrix block and also a stack of n equal matrix blocks versus time mashayekhizadeh et al 2010 their results showed that the fourier series method is potentially more applicable for solving the models of re infiltration process in naturally fractured reservoirs the inspiration for their research came from a study which compared different numerical laplace inversion methods for engineering applications by hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2007 in 2010 dejam et al focused on the nonlinearity induced from the saturation dependent capillary pressure and relative permeability functions which makes gravity draining governing partial differential equation difficult to analytically and numerically solve dejam et al 2011 in order to overcome this challenge they attempted to relate the capillary pressure and relative permeability functions then they used the fourier laplace inversion method to numerically solve the developed linear model and generate the drainage flow rate and the oil saturation profiles at different values of exponents in flow function models farajzadeh et al 2012 used two different foam models to simulate foam behavior in matrix block and fracture they investigated the effects of different parameters such as foam quality flow rate and interfacial tension on the foam rheology to improve the gas oil gravity drainage mechanism infiltration is a profound characteristic phenomenon in hydrology in fact it is the process which defines the propagation of water into soil from ground surface on the contrary in the soil drainage process water comes out of the soil due to gravity force infiltration and soil drainage actions are controlled both by capillary and gravity forces whereas smaller pores can give larger resistance to gravity very small pores pull water through capillary action in spite of the force of gravity the model presented in this paper is based on the two phase flow in a porous medium that considers both gravity and capillary forces and is also applicable to modeling of non wetting phase i e air or oil and wetting phase i e water movement in the soil ioannidis et al 2006 wang et al 2017 hayek 2015 presented an analytical model for steady vertical flux through finite unsaturated soils with power law hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity functions wang et al 2017 presented a simple analytical infiltration model for short duration rainfall infiltration simulation they simulated infiltration and compared it with numerical experiments and soil column experiments as is clear from previous works much attention has been paid to analytical modeling and numerical simulation of one dimensional gravity drainage mechanism in a single matrix block in the gas invaded zone of naturally fractured reservoirs the nonlinearity caused by saturation dependent capillary pressure and relative permeability functions makes it extremely difficult to analytically solve the governing partial differential equation pde describing gas oil gravity drainage previous studies used simple particular forms of relative permeability and capillary pressure functions in modeling such as zero capillary pressure constant capillary pressure and linear relative permeability functions in this paper we use more realistic saturation dependent functions a quadratic form for relative permeability and an inversed relation for capillary pressure functions then the governing pdes are analytically solved by using suitable transformations this paper is the continuation of previous studies and the purpose is to develop a more realistic and more sophisticated model for gravity drainage mechanism also an exact analytical solution to the problem of infiltration coupled with non linear relative permeability functions is put forth for finite depth which is fundamentally important by implementing myriad consecutive mathematical manipulations the nonlinear terms within the derived equation is eliminated to remedy the tedious and complex method of solution the results of the analytical solution are compared with the available experimental data as well as the results of the numerical simulation of the model the obtained analytical solution is used to perform a sensitivity analysis based on design of experiment method for different parameters 2 analytical modeling and solution to 1d gravity drainage 2 1 modeling of saturation

pressure δ ρ is the density difference between fluids and g is the gravitational constant ϕ represents porosity and μ shows viscosity also the movement of water through unsaturated soils is described by the richards equation which combines the effects of both gravity and capillarity the governing equation of infiltration in porous media is hayek 2018 hills and warrick 1993 wang et al 2017 2 θ t z d θ θ θ z k θ θ z 0 where θ is water content d is soil water diffusivity and k is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity eqs 1a and 1b both represent same mechanism and terminology in this process gas oil or air water density difference provides the driving force to expel liquid and the voidage is replaced by gas or air the process continues until capillary forces balance gravity forces out dejam et al 2011 the analytical model presented is also applicable to the modeling of infiltration mechanism the obtained pde in eq 1a can be written in dimensionless form by introducing the following dimensionless parameters 3a z d z h 3b k rod k ro k ro 0 3c s od s o s or 1 s or s wi 3d p cd p c δ ρ g g c h 3e t d 2 k k ro 0 δ ρ g g c h ϕ μ o 1 s or s wi t 3f ν od μ o k k r o 0 δ ρ g ν o in this equation h is the effective height of the system neglecting the threshold height s denotes saturation and indexes o or and wi represent oil residual oil and interstitial water saturation vo represents the apparent oil velocity and the parameters with the d index represent dimensionless normalized parameters the definition of the dimensionless time is similar to definition proposed by other studies dejam et al 2011 miguel h et al 2004 however this parameter is multiplied by 2 which helps to simplify the solution in order to consider the effect of capillary threshold in the system the capillary length should be neglected in the dimensionless length z d combination of eqs 1a and 2 will result in 4 2 s od t d z d k rod p cd s od s od z d k rod 0 in order solve eq 3 we need to define appropriate functions of relative permeability and capillary pressure with respect to saturation brooks and corey combined their experimental correlation for capillary pressure with the approximation of relative permeability based on burdine s capillary tube model to present a relationship for prediction of relative permeability brooks and corey 1964 burdine 1953 their model used pore size distribution as the matching parameter for better prediction of relative permeability data the saturation exponent in brooks and corey is always predicted to be more than 3 to generalize this model is usually corrected to a power law model for relative permeability in which the saturation exponent can vary from 1 to 6 eqs 4 and 5 show the brooks corey and generalized power law format 5 k ro s o s or 1 s or 2 3 λ λ 6 k ro k r o 0 s od n the generalized power law format results in high nonlinearity in eq 3 which is extremely difficult to analytically solve in order to be able to develop an analytical model which can consider the interference between phases to some extent the quadratic power law function of mobilized saturation is used as relative permeability 7 k rod s od 2 and the following relationship can be used for capillary pressure 8 p cd p cd 0 s od p cd s od p cd 0 s od 2 applying the capillary pressure and relative permeability functions in eq 3 results in the final

in convection term combinations of eqs 1f a 1 and a 4 and assuming negligible gas mobility one may write miguel h et al 2004 10 ν od k rod p cd z d 1 the appropriate initial and auxiliary boundary conditions presented in fig a 1 can be stated as zero gas saturation initial condition zero oil flux from the top of the block and zero capillary pressure at the bottom of the block this is equivalent

boundary conditions can also be applied for a system with a threshold capillary height in such a system the matrix length h should be defined as the effective height of the oil column in the system in order to eliminate the nonlinear terms in the pde the hopf cole transformation can be used hills and warrick 1993 olver 2000 the hopf cole transformation is a transformation which can be applied for the solution of the nonlinear diffusion equations and also burger s equation burger s equation is a fundamental pde which occurs in fluid mechanics nonlinear acoustics gas dynamics and traffic flow sun and sun 2015 this transformation can be used to transform eq 8 into a diffusion equation a modified format of the hopf cole transformation can be written as below 12 1 w w z d 1 p cd 0 s od applying eq 11 to eq 8 results in 13 w t d p cd 0 2 2 w z d 2 with the following initial and boundary on w zd td 14a i c w z d t d 0 e z d p cd 0 14b b c 1 w z d 0 t d 1 14c b c 2 w z d w p cd 0 z d 1 0 eq 12 is called the diffusion equation this equation is widely used for solving the mass and heat transfer problems in rectangular coordinate systems crank 1979 ozisik 1993 the second boundary condition in the obtained formulation is difficult to deal with in order to handle this boundary condition the transformation presented in eq 14 can be used studies in the field of mass transfer often use the inverse of eq 14 to convert convection diffusion equations to a diffusion equation ozisik 1993 however in this study it was inferred that this equation can be used to transform the diffusion eq 12 with the difficult boundary condition 13c to a convection diffusion equation with more appropriate boundary conditions 15 ϒ z d t d w z d t d exp z d p cd 0 t d 2 p cd 0 implementation of eq 14 in eq 12 results in the following equation 16 ϒ t d p cd 0 2 2 ϒ z d 2 ϒ z d with the boundary conditions 17a i c ϒ z d t d 0 1 17b b c 1 ϒ z d 0 t d exp t d 2 p cd 0 17c b c 2 ϒ z d z d 1 0 eq 15 is called a convection diffusion equation this type of pde is usually used to describe diffusion in a system in which the diffusing matter is moving with an average velocity of 1 m s the analytical solution to eq 15 subject to eq 16 can be determined using the laplace transform with respect to td followed by a transformation in laplace domain and then the general integral transformation technique with respect to zd in the first step the laplace transform should be carried out on eq 15 with respect to td after the laplace transformation the governing equation eq 15 and boundary conditions eq 16 will change to 18 p cd 0 2 2 ϒ z d 2 ϒ z d s ϒ 1 0 19a b c 1 ϒ z d 0 s 1 s 1 2 p cd 0 f s 19b b c 2 ϒ z d z d 1 0 in which s represents the dimensionless laplace transform parameter corresponding to time and k denotes the transformation of k function in laplace domain 20 ϒ l ϒ z d t d 0 ϒ z d t d e st d dt d the first boundary condition in eq 17 is non homogeneous which makes it difficult to derive an analytical solution hence prior to applying the general integral transform technique a transformation is used to homogenize the boundary condition in eq 18a therefore eq 20 is used to obtain a new pde with homogeneous boundary conditions this approach was demonstrated previously by several authors chen and liu 2011 pérez guerrero et al 2009 21 n z d s ϒ z d s f s exp z d p

analytical solution of eq 21 and its auxiliary boundary conditions in eq 22 increasing attention has been paid to this technique in recent years further information can be found in perez guerreo et al chen and liu 2011 ozisik 1993 pérez guerrero et al 2009 the normalized eigen functions over zd corresponding to eq 21 satisfy the sturm liouville boundary conditions given by eq 22 24 2 x z d z d 2 β 2 x z d 0 25a b c 1 x z d 0 0 25b b c 2 x z d z d x z d p cd 0 z d 1 0 then the integral transform pair for the function n z d s with respect to the zd variable is readily obtained by splitting up the representation into two parts as 26 integral transform n β m s z d 0 z d 1 x β m z d n β m s d z d 27 inversion formula n β m s m 1 x β m z d n β m n β m s where 28 n β m z d 0 z d 1 x β m z d 2 dz d 1 2 β m 2 1 p cd 02 1 p cd 0 β m 2 1 p cd 02 making use of the above generalized integral transform on eq 21 and solving for n z d s one obtains 29 n β m s β m β m 2 1 p cd 02 2 p cd 0 2 p cd 0 s 1 p

should be determined by solving eq 32 this equation is a simple transcendental function and the corresponding roots can be simply determined using false position method chapra 2012 in order to calculate the summation series with an acceptable accuracy a finite number of terms are sufficient our investigations showed that using more than 200 terms in the series does not affect the results afterwards eq 32 should be determined for the calculated eigenvalues in the desired dimensionless time and height in the next step the series in the eq 33 should be calculated and finally based on these parameters the normalized saturation can be calculated 2 3 matrix fracture transfer function one of the key parameters in simulation of gravity drainage process is the amount of oil flux drained from the matrix block to fractures after the early time region in which the produced oil is mainly provided by the oil stored in the fracture region the effect of the matrix block increases in this time region matrix blocks are responsible for providing oil therefore it is important to determine the rate at which oil is flowing to fracture medium the amount of transfer between the matrix block as the source to the fracture can be determined by writing another diffusivity equation over the matrix region predicted oil production from the matrix block based on diffusivity equation can be used in conjunction with eq 33 to determine the matrix fracture transfer shape factor lim and aziz 1995 35 q σ ρ k μ p m p f in which σ represents transfer shape factor p m is the average matrix pressure and pf is the fracture pressure several studies assumed a pseudo steady state condition which simplifies derivation of the production rate from the matrix block gilman and kazemi 1988 warren and root 1963 these studies implement the a fracture as a boundary condition and derive a constant value for a shape factor however more recent studies showed that depending on fracture pressure the transfer shape factor can also be a function of time hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 in order to be able to provide more accurate predictions of the matrix fracture transfer and also the shape factor the production rate from the matrix block should be determined more accurately a new transfer function for a single block gravity drainage process can be derived based on the saturation distribution presented in eq 34 with respect to the conditions shown in fig a 1 in order to determine the transfer function between matrix and fracture one may use eqs 9 11 and 14 and write 36 ν od 2 p cd 0 ϒ ϒ t

may find the cumulative produced oil from the matrix block based on the following relationship 38 i d 0 t d ν d d t d 0 t d 2 p cd 0 ϒ ϒ t d 1 d t d 2 p cd 0 0 t d ln ϒ t d d t d 0 t d d t d 39 i d 2 p cd 0 l n ϒ z d 1 t d ϒ z d 1 0 t d eq 36 can be used as the transfer function from the matrix block to the fracture network the procedure to calculate this parameter is similar to the one described about saturation eq 38 shows the normalized recovery from the system due to the gravity drainage mechanism 3 results and discussion in this section the analytical model developed in section 2 is analyzed and compared with the experimental measurements conducted by ioannidis et al 2006 as well as an analytical model based on linear relative permeability and also numerical simulations due to the limitations of free fall gravity drainage laboratory data in the petroleum engineering laboratory data of gravity drainage in the presence of water and air was used in this study which also describes the applicability of equations in the hydrology ioannidis et al 2006 conducted gravity drainage of water from a column of glass beads of uniform size and compared the recovery from this mechanism with centrifuge tests and also field simulations in their study a long glass column filled to a height of 125 cm with glass beads of average diameter equal to 300 µm was used the results of this experimental setup were used to validate the new analytical model also a numerical model and firoozabadi model for modeling experimental results and its comparison with the results of new analytical model have been used in figs 1 and 2 the relative permeability of water is plotted in cartesian and semi log coordinates based on the saturation functions expressed in the numerical model firoozabadi model 1994 and the new analytical model are the best match of the relative permeability of the expressed models with the experimental data table 1 in order to match krw the basic least square fitting method was used in this method the digitized data points were extracted from ioannidis et al 2006 and used to fit linear quadratic and power law equations the list of krw models used to investigate different models is presented in table 2 objective function is coefficient of determination r 2 1 i k rwd m o d e l i k r rwd exp e r i m e n t a l i 2 i k r rwd exp e r i m e n t a l i k

accurate results for prediction of relative permeability the krwd equation of new model is also able to provide accurate predictions for relative permeability however krwd equation of firoozabadi model is limited fig 3 shows the experimental capillary pressure curve also based on the saturation functions expressed in the numerical model firoozabadi model 1994 and the new analytical model are the best match of the capillary pressure of the expressed models with the experimental data table 3 shows that the numerical model provides the most accurate results for prediction of capillary pressure the capillary pressure equation of new model is also able to provide accurate predictions for relative permeability fig 4 shows the experimental measurements of cumulative water production by the gravity drainage mechanism compared with the results of the analytical models and numerical finite difference method moreover the recovery is determined based on the amount of original oil in place the cumulative water production g is 40 cumulative w a t e r p r o d u c t i o n g r e c o v e r y p o r e v o l u m e cm 3 w a t e r d e n s i t y g cm 3 figs 4 and 5 show the cumulative water production in semi log and cartesian coordinates respectively as shown in the figures the numerical model predicts the amount of cumulative production of water due to the proper fitting of the saturation functions in the numerical model with the experimental data in the case of the firoozabadi model 1994 as shown in fig 1 in high water saturation values i e early times in fig 4 the relative permeability of firoozabadi model is less than the experimental data this has led to highly lower values of cumulative water production with respect to experimental data for high water saturation values which is observed in the early time region also based on fig 1 in the low water saturation late times in fig 4 the relative permeability of the firoozabadi model is greater than experimental data which has resulted in cumulative production at late times to be more than laboratory data based on fig 3 and the proper matching of the capillary pressure function with laboratory data firoozabadi model predicts precisely the final cumulative water production in fig 4 the cumulative water production of the new analytical model is also plotted due to the conformance of the new analytical model saturation functions with laboratory data the analytical model predicts well the results of the experimental model as shown in figs 4 and 5 although numerical model predicts the experimental data slightly better than analytical model analytical model do serve as a means for verifying many numerical models for gravity drainage and infiltration mechanism where numerical models often suffer from convergence and mass balance problems also the proposed analytical model is more efficient than the numerical model in terms of the run time which can be easily compared with the results of the experimental model and it can enhance our understanding of the gravity drainage and infiltration mechanism 4 sensitivity analysis in this section based on the validated analytical model an appropriate design of experiment doe method was selected to find the most important parameters affecting the gravity drainage mechanism the effects of various parameters such as absolute matrix permeability porosity oil gas density difference oil viscosity matrix block height relative permeability coefficient and capillary pressure coefficient were used to perform a parametric sensitivity analysis on the recovery factor from the matrix block the range of the parameters used in the sensitivity analysis is shown in table 4 in this study a full factorial design method was used which allows for the simultaneous study of the effects that several factors may have on recovery box and draper 1987 in order to study the simultaneous effects of different parameters on recovery rate from a block traditional single parameter sensitivity analysis might not provide reasonable results hence an efficient way in terms of time and cost is needed which allows for the study of interactions between the factors without the use of doe important interactions may remain undetected because interactions between the affecting parameters are the driving force in many processes in a full factorial doe characteristic time is determined at all combinations of the experimental inputs each combination of affecting input parameters is called a run and the response value for this combination is an observation the whole set of runs is the design montgomery 2008 in this study the effect of 7 parameters are investigated on recovery resulting in 27 runs recovery factor can be described by two different characteristics including the ultimate recovery and the recovery rate analytical models provide smooth results for the recovery curve which converges to ultimate recovery in infinite time therefore the time needed to reach 80 of the ultimate recovery was used as the characteristic recovery time crt of the gravity drainage mechanism a schematic representation of this method is shown in fig 6 in this figure it can be noted that the ultimate recovery is 0 3 therefore the time in which system produces 80 of this amount 0 24 is defined as the crt the effect of different parameters on the recovery rate is presented as a normal probability plot in fig 7 in this figure the standardized effect shown on x axis represents average effect of each input on crt and it is the difference between the average value for crt over high levels of each parameter minus the average value of crt over the low levels of that parameter stamatis 2002 41 effect σ y n σ y n where y represents the crt and n denotes the number of data points collected for each level for instance in order to calculate the sensitivity of crt to permeability the median value of k and the response crt at this k is determined then based on the number of data points in which k is higher or lower value than median of k the corresponding values for y y n and n are determined parameters with a positive negative effect on crt lie on the right left side of the red line the red line in fig 7 shows the random effect on crt or the noise which should be discarded in this figure the y axis shows the cumulative normal distribution of data points the results of this figure show that absolute permeability and oil viscosity have the highest influences on the recovery rate this can be justified by the fact that these parameters can change in a much wider region than other parameters moreover it can be deduced that porosity φ block height h and oil viscosity µo are directly proportional with the crt therefore increasing these parameters will slow down the gravity drainage mechanism other parameters including absolute permeability k relative permeability coefficient kro 0 capillary pressure coefficient pcd 0 and density difference δρ decrease the crt leading to faster recovery from the block the effect of different inputs on the ultimate recovery from the block is shown in fig 8 as shown in this figure most of the parameters do not affect the ultimate recovery from the block and only affect the recovery rate this result seems reasonable because the capillary gravity forces are the only forces which can affect the ultimate recovery consequently block height δ ρ h matrix and capillary pressure coefficient pcd 0 are the only parameters influencing the ultimate recovery 5 conclusions in this study a reliable analytical model is developed for gravity drainage or infiltration process from a single block in the fractured porous medium in order to model the flow in such a mechanism more realistic saturation dependent flow functions are used these functions include an inverse function of saturation for capillary pressure and quadratic function of saturation for relative permeability using several transformations the governing equations are solved and saturation distribution and transfer functions from the block including dimensionless flow rate and dimensionless recovery are determined based on the results the following can be concluded a new analytical transfer function for a dual porosity model is obtained which can be used to improve the reliability of naturally fractured reservoir simulators the results of the new model are compared with the experimental measurements as well as numerical simulation and the results are well matched based on the new model a design of experiment doe method is used to investigate the sensitivity of recovery to various affecting parameters including absolute matrix permeability porosity density difference viscosity matrix block height relative permeability coefficient and capillary pressure coefficient results of sensitivity analysis on the rate of recovery show that higher values of absolute permeability relative permeability coefficient capillary pressure coefficient and density difference results in faster gravity drainage or infiltration process while porosity block height and viscosity can adversely affect the recovery rate sensitivity analysis shows that among the discussed parameters only block height and capillary pressure coefficient can affect the ultimate recovery from the system taller blocks will have higher ultimate oil production and higher values of capillary pressure decreases the ultimate recovery finally in the proposed analytical solution the quadratic function for relative permeability was considered and other exponents in power law model for relative permeability require further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

this section hagoort model 1980 and the saidi model 1987 are presented to model the gravity drainage laboratory results a hagoort model 1980 the main focus of hagoort s study 1980 is to present a new

6225,an exact analytical solution for one dimensional fluid flow through rock matrix block is presented the nonlinearity induced from flow functions makes the governing equations describing this mechanism difficult to be analytically solved in this paper an analytical solution to the infiltration problems considering non linear relative permeability functions is presented for finite depth despite its profound and fundamental importance elimination of the nonlinear terms in the equation as a complex and tedious task is done by applying several successive mathematical manipulations including hopf cole transformation to obtain a diffusive type pde an exponential type transformation to get a convective diffusive type pde with suitable boundary conditions laplace transformation integral transformation to homogenize the boundary condition in the laplace domain and finally laplace inversion method to find the time domain solution the obtained solution is used for developing a

equation constant laplace domain 1 introduction transport processes modeling of wetting phase in fracture rock is one of the most practical topics in groundwater hydrology petroleum engineering environmental engineering and soil science in recent years a significant body of research has considered flow and transport in unsaturated fractured rock within arid environments glass et al 2002 manna et al 2017 fractured rock aquifers are complex heterogeneous and anisotropic systems hong et al 2002 fractured rocks are considered as systems which consist of matrix blocks and fracture networks it has been observed that matrix blocks store the fluid and fracture blocks provide the main flow path for the fluid produced from the matrix blocks type 2 fractured reservoirs in nelson classification nelson 2001 gravity drainage is an important recovery process in both fractured and unfractured reservoirs where gravity acts as the main driving force this mechanism may occur in primary stages of field development as well as an improved oil recovery process in which gas is supplied from an external source hagoort 1980 reports have indicated surprisingly high oil recoveries by gravity drainage in laboratory experiments in sand pack columns li and horne 2008 field observations have also reported similar results dykstra 1978 king et al 1970 in leverett 1941 and in lewis 1944 discussed the fundamental concepts of the gravity drainage process in 1949 the first analytical modeling of gravity drainage was presented by cardwell and parsons 1949 they simplified the governing equations by dropping the capillary pressure terms and solving equations for a gravity dominated process the first field scale study was presented by hall 1961 in which a computer based model was introduced to simulate gravity drainage in 1978 herman dykstra modified cardwell and parsons model by applying a movable saturation in relative permeability function however this model also neglected capillary terms dykstra 1978 he presented a good example of oil production by strictly considering gravity drainage in the lakeview pool midway sunset oilfield further studies were conducted by hagoort 1980 in which the effect of capillary effect was again neglected however he developed the equations based on fractional flow concept and tried to use centrifugal method for determination of relative permeability curves pavone et al in 1989 analytically solved the partial differential equation governing gravity drainage mechanism and derived a function to predict the saturation distribution and oil recovery for this mechanism in a low ift system pavone 1989 they used a few assumptions such as negligible gas potential gradient incompressible fluids straight line permeability curve and logarithmic capillary pressure trends the linear relative permeability function can only allow for simulation of low ift therefore this simplifying assumption affects the applicability of the solution hills and warrick 1993 developed a solution to burgers equation for a finite depth slab they considered upper boundary condition as a time dependent flux and the lower condition as a constant water content in 1994 firoozabadi and ishimoto solved the linearized the flow equation obtained by pavone et al for different boundary conditions using laplace transform method firoozabadi and ishimoto 1994 they also discussed the gravity drainage process in the presence of re infiltration in a stack of n equal blocks considering complete block to block interaction this model was also based on the linear relative permeability functions in 1994 longeron et al described gravity drainage from the point of view of capillary pressure measurement longeron et al 1994 in 1996 claudio et al presented the gravity drainage governing equation in terms of capillary potential claudio et al 1996 they solved the resulting nonlinear equation numerically and studied the gravity drainage concept in layered porous media in that year schechter and guo used film flow phenomena coupled with darcy s law to derive a new expression for recovery in gravity drainage process as a function of time schechter and guo 1996 in 2004 miguel hernandez et al developed the methods of scaling dimensionless factors to simplify the analysis of gravity drainage process and therefore to identify the main factors controlling this mechanism in naturally fractured reservoirs miguel h et al 2004 in 2006 di donato et al developed the analytical and numerical analysis of oil recovery on a one dimensional porous media subjected to gravity drainage mechanism di donato et al 2006 they validated their numerical model by predicting previously published experimental measurements by pedrera et al 2002 they developed simplified analytical models in gravity capillary dominated time regions the findings of their work showed that when gravity forces dominate the oil recovery scales as a power law with time the exponent in this relation depends on the oil mobility however when capillary forces dominate the oil recovery obeys an exponential behavior with time and also the ultimate recovery is lower than that of the gravity dominated process in 2008 nabipour et al developed a two phase flow model and solved it numerically to predict the oil saturation profile and the rate of oil recovery in layered porous medium under the gas oil gravity drainage mechanism nabipour et al 2008 in 2008 hoteit and firoozabadi used basic mixed finite element mfe framework and proposed a new formulation in 3d systems in which the total velocity was expressed in terms of wetting phase potential gradient and the capillary gradient the results of their study was numerically solved to obtain the simulated parameters hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 they combined mixed finite element with continuous galerkin methods to solve pressure and saturation equations their model could also consider the effect of capillarity heterogeneity later in 2009 boukadi et al presented a simulation code for mimicking gas oil gravity drainage in a fractured porous medium boukadi et al 2009 navier stokes darcy s law capillary pressure and relative permeability constitutive equations were used for numerical modeling of two phase transport phenomenon they also used other constraint equations to determine the phase saturation change with respect to time they solved the momentum and continuity equations to calculate velocities pressure saturation profiles and the recovery from gas oil gravity drainage mechanism they compared the results of their simulator model with experimental results and concluded that the simulation results are in accordance with the experimental observations in 2010 mashayekhizadeh et al used the numerical laplace transforms including stehfest fourier series zakian and schapery algorithms to solve dimensionless mathematical models for predicting drainage flow rate from a single matrix block and also a stack of n equal matrix blocks versus time mashayekhizadeh et al 2010 their results showed that the fourier series method is potentially more applicable for solving the models of re infiltration process in naturally fractured reservoirs the inspiration for their research came from a study which compared different numerical laplace inversion methods for engineering applications by hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2007 in 2010 dejam et al focused on the nonlinearity induced from the saturation dependent capillary pressure and relative permeability functions which makes gravity draining governing partial differential equation difficult to analytically and numerically solve dejam et al 2011 in order to overcome this challenge they attempted to relate the capillary pressure and relative permeability functions then they used the fourier laplace inversion method to numerically solve the developed linear model and generate the drainage flow rate and the oil saturation profiles at different values of exponents in flow function models farajzadeh et al 2012 used two different foam models to simulate foam behavior in matrix block and fracture they investigated the effects of different parameters such as foam quality flow rate and interfacial tension on the foam rheology to improve the gas oil gravity drainage mechanism infiltration is a profound characteristic phenomenon in hydrology in fact it is the process which defines the propagation of water into soil from ground surface on the contrary in the soil drainage process water comes out of the soil due to gravity force infiltration and soil drainage actions are controlled both by capillary and gravity forces whereas smaller pores can give larger resistance to gravity very small pores pull water through capillary action in spite of the force of gravity the model presented in this paper is based on the two phase flow in a porous medium that considers both gravity and capillary forces and is also applicable to modeling of non wetting phase i e air or oil and wetting phase i e water movement in the soil ioannidis et al 2006 wang et al 2017 hayek 2015 presented an analytical model for steady vertical flux through finite unsaturated soils with power law hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity functions wang et al 2017 presented a simple analytical infiltration model for short duration rainfall infiltration simulation they simulated infiltration and compared it with numerical experiments and soil column experiments as is clear from previous works much attention has been paid to analytical modeling and numerical simulation of one dimensional gravity drainage mechanism in a single matrix block in the gas invaded zone of naturally fractured reservoirs the nonlinearity caused by saturation dependent capillary pressure and relative permeability functions makes it extremely difficult to analytically solve the governing partial differential equation pde describing gas oil gravity drainage previous studies used simple particular forms of relative permeability and capillary pressure functions in modeling such as zero capillary pressure constant capillary pressure and linear relative permeability functions in this paper we use more realistic saturation dependent functions a quadratic form for relative permeability and an inversed relation for capillary pressure functions then the governing pdes are analytically solved by using suitable transformations this paper is the continuation of previous studies and the purpose is to develop a more realistic and more sophisticated model for gravity drainage mechanism also an exact analytical solution to the problem of infiltration coupled with non linear relative permeability functions is put forth for finite depth which is fundamentally important by implementing myriad consecutive mathematical manipulations the nonlinear terms within the derived equation is eliminated to remedy the tedious and complex method of solution the results of the analytical solution are compared with the available experimental data as well as the results of the numerical simulation of the model the obtained analytical solution is used to perform a sensitivity analysis based on design of experiment method for different parameters 2 analytical modeling and solution to 1d gravity drainage 2 1 modeling of saturation

pressure δ ρ is the density difference between fluids and g is the gravitational constant ϕ represents porosity and μ shows viscosity also the movement of water through unsaturated soils is described by the richards equation which combines the effects of both gravity and capillarity the governing equation of infiltration in porous media is hayek 2018 hills and warrick 1993 wang et al 2017 2 θ t z

or air water density difference provides the driving force to expel liquid and the voidage is replaced by gas or air the process continues until capillary forces balance gravity forces out dejam et al 2011 the analytical model presented is also applicable to the modeling of infiltration mechanism the obtained pde in eq 1a can be written in dimensionless form by introducing the following dimensionless parameters 3a z d z h 3b k rod k ro k ro 0 3c s od s o s or 1 s or s wi 3d p cd p c δ ρ g g c h 3e t d 2 k k ro 0 δ ρ g g c h ϕ μ o 1 s or s wi t 3f ν od μ o k k r o 0 δ ρ g ν o in this equation h is the effective height of the system neglecting the threshold height s denotes saturation and indexes o or and wi represent oil residual oil and interstitial water saturation vo represents the apparent oil velocity and the parameters with the d index represent dimensionless normalized parameters the definition of the dimensionless time is similar to definition proposed by other studies dejam et al 2011 miguel h et al 2004 however this parameter is multiplied by 2 which helps to simplify the solution in order to consider the effect of capillary threshold in the system the capillary length should be neglected in the dimensionless length z d combination of eqs 1a and 2 will result in 4 2 s od t d z d k rod p cd s od s od z d k rod 0 in order solve eq 3 we need to define appropriate functions of relative permeability and capillary pressure with respect to saturation brooks and corey combined their experimental correlation for capillary pressure with the approximation of relative permeability based on burdine s capillary tube model to present a relationship for prediction of relative permeability brooks and corey 1964 burdine 1953 their model used pore size distribution as the matching parameter for better prediction of relative permeability data the saturation exponent in brooks and corey is always predicted to be more than 3 to generalize this model is usually corrected to a power law model for relative permeability in which the saturation exponent can vary from 1 to 6 eqs 4 and 5 show the brooks corey and generalized power law format 5 k ro s o s or 1 s or 2 3 λ λ 6 k ro k r o 0 s od n the generalized power law format results in high nonlinearity in eq 3 which is extremely difficult to analytically solve in order to be able to develop an

in convection term combinations of eqs 1f a 1 and a 4 and assuming negligible gas mobility one may write miguel h et al 2004 10 ν od k rod p cd z d 1 the appropriate initial and auxiliary boundary conditions presented in fig a 1 can be stated as zero gas saturation initial condition zero oil flux from the top of the block and zero capillary pressure at the bottom of the block this is equivalent

boundary conditions can also be applied for a system with a threshold capillary height in such a system the matrix length h should be defined as the effective height of the oil column in the system in order to eliminate the nonlinear terms in the pde the hopf cole transformation can be used hills and warrick 1993 olver 2000 the hopf cole transformation is a transformation which can be applied for the solution of the nonlinear diffusion equations and also burger s equation burger s equation is a fundamental pde which occurs in fluid mechanics nonlinear acoustics gas dynamics and traffic flow sun and sun 2015 this transformation can be used to transform eq 8 into a diffusion equation a modified format of the hopf cole transformation can be written as below 12 1 w w z d 1 p cd 0 s od

use the inverse of eq 14 to convert convection diffusion equations to a diffusion equation ozisik 1993 however in this study it was inferred that this equation can be used to transform the diffusion eq 12 with the difficult boundary condition 13c to a convection diffusion equation with more appropriate boundary conditions 15 ϒ z d t d w z d t d exp z d p cd 0 t d 2 p cd 0 implementation of eq 14

called a convection diffusion equation this type of pde is usually used to describe diffusion in a system in which the diffusing matter is moving with an average velocity of 1 m s the analytical solution to eq 15 subject to eq 16 can be determined using the laplace transform with respect to td followed by a transformation in laplace domain and then the general integral transformation technique with respect to zd in the first step the laplace transform should be carried out on eq 15 with respect to td after the laplace transformation the governing equation eq 15 and boundary conditions eq 16 will change to 18 p cd 0 2 2 ϒ z d 2 ϒ z d s ϒ 1 0 19a b c 1 ϒ z d 0 s 1 s 1 2 p cd 0 f s 19b b c 2 ϒ z d z d 1 0 in which s represents the dimensionless laplace transform parameter corresponding to time and k denotes the transformation of k function in laplace domain 20 ϒ l ϒ z d t d 0 ϒ z d t d e st d dt d the first boundary condition in eq 17 is non homogeneous which makes it difficult to derive an analytical solution hence prior to applying the general integral transform technique a transformation is used to homogenize the boundary condition in eq 18a therefore eq 20 is used to obtain a new pde with homogeneous boundary conditions this approach was demonstrated previously by several authors chen and liu 2011 pérez guerrero et al 2009 21 n z d s ϒ z d s f s exp z d p

analytical solution of eq 21 and its auxiliary boundary conditions in eq 22 increasing attention has been paid to this technique in recent years further information can be found in perez guerreo et al chen and liu 2011 ozisik 1993 pérez guerrero et al 2009 the normalized eigen functions over zd corresponding to eq 21 satisfy the sturm liouville boundary conditions given by eq 22 24 2 x z d z d 2 β 2 x z d 0 25a b c 1 x z d 0 0 25b b c 2 x z d z d x z d p cd 0 z d 1 0 then the integral transform pair for the function n z d s with respect to the zd variable is readily obtained by splitting up the

should be determined by solving eq 32 this equation is a simple transcendental function and the corresponding roots can be simply determined using false position method chapra 2012 in order to calculate the summation series with an acceptable accuracy a finite number of terms are sufficient our investigations showed that using more than 200 terms in the series does not affect the results afterwards eq 32 should be determined for the calculated eigenvalues in the desired dimensionless time and height in the next step the series in the eq 33 should be calculated and finally based on these parameters the normalized saturation can be calculated 2 3 matrix fracture transfer function one of the key parameters in simulation of gravity drainage process is the amount of oil flux drained from the matrix block to fractures after the early time region in which the produced oil is mainly provided by the oil stored in the fracture region the effect of the matrix block increases in this time region matrix blocks are responsible for providing oil therefore it is important to determine the rate at which oil is flowing to fracture medium the amount of transfer between the matrix block as the source to the fracture can be determined by writing another diffusivity equation over the matrix region predicted oil production from the matrix block based on diffusivity equation can be used in conjunction with eq 33 to determine the matrix fracture transfer shape factor lim and aziz 1995 35 q σ ρ k μ p m p f in which σ represents transfer shape factor p m is the average matrix pressure and pf is the fracture pressure several studies assumed a pseudo steady state condition which simplifies derivation of the production rate from the matrix block gilman and kazemi 1988 warren and root 1963 these studies implement the a fracture as a boundary condition and derive a constant value for a shape factor however more recent studies showed that depending on fracture pressure the transfer shape factor can also be a function of time hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2006 in order to be able to provide more accurate predictions of the matrix fracture transfer and also the shape factor the production rate from the matrix block should be determined more accurately a new transfer function for a single block gravity drainage process can be derived based on the saturation distribution presented in eq 34 with respect to the conditions shown in fig a 1 in order to determine the transfer function between matrix and fracture one may use eqs 9 11 and 14 and write 36 ν od 2 p cd 0 ϒ ϒ t

p cd 0 l n ϒ z d 1 t d ϒ z d 1 0 t d eq 36 can be used as the transfer function from the matrix block to the fracture network the procedure to calculate this parameter is similar to the one described about saturation eq 38 shows the normalized recovery from the system due to the gravity drainage mechanism 3 results and discussion in this section the analytical model developed in section 2 is analyzed and compared with the experimental measurements conducted by ioannidis et al 2006 as well as an analytical model based on linear relative permeability and also numerical simulations due to the limitations of free fall gravity drainage laboratory data in the petroleum engineering laboratory data of gravity drainage in the presence of water and air was used in this study which also describes the applicability of equations in the hydrology ioannidis et al 2006 conducted gravity drainage of water from a column of glass beads of uniform size and compared the recovery from this mechanism with centrifuge tests and also field simulations in their study a long glass column filled to a height of 125 cm with glass beads of average diameter equal to 300 µm was used the results of this experimental setup were used to validate the new analytical model also a numerical model and firoozabadi model for modeling experimental results and its comparison with the results of new analytical model have been used in figs 1 and 2 the relative permeability of water is plotted in cartesian and semi log coordinates based on the saturation functions expressed in the numerical model firoozabadi model 1994 and the new analytical model are the best match of the relative permeability of the expressed models with the experimental data table 1 in order to match krw the basic least square fitting method was used in this method the digitized data points were extracted from ioannidis et al 2006 and used to fit linear quadratic and power law equations the list of krw models used to investigate different models is presented in table 2 objective function is coefficient of determination r 2 1 i k rwd m o d e l i k r rwd exp e r i m e n t a l i 2 i k r rwd exp e r i m e n t a l i k

model is limited fig 3 shows the experimental capillary pressure curve also based on the saturation functions expressed in the numerical model firoozabadi model 1994 and the new analytical model are the best match of the capillary pressure of the expressed models with the experimental data table 3 shows that the numerical model provides the most accurate results for prediction of capillary pressure the capillary pressure equation of new model is also able to provide accurate predictions for relative permeability fig 4 shows the experimental measurements of cumulative water production by the gravity drainage mechanism compared with the results of the analytical models and numerical finite difference method moreover the recovery is determined based on the amount of original oil in

production in semi log and cartesian coordinates respectively as shown in the figures the numerical model predicts the amount of cumulative production of water due to the proper fitting of the saturation functions in the numerical model with the experimental data in the case of the firoozabadi model 1994 as shown in fig 1 in high water saturation values i e early times in fig 4 the relative permeability of firoozabadi model is less than the experimental data this has led to highly lower values of cumulative water production with respect to experimental data for high water saturation values which is observed in the early time region also based on fig 1 in the low water saturation late times in fig 4 the relative permeability of the firoozabadi model is greater than experimental data which has resulted in cumulative production at late times to be more than laboratory data based on fig 3 and the proper matching of the capillary pressure function with laboratory data firoozabadi model predicts precisely the final cumulative water production in fig 4 the cumulative water production of the new analytical model is also plotted due to the conformance of the new analytical model saturation functions with laboratory data the analytical model predicts well the results of the experimental model as shown in figs 4 and 5 although numerical model predicts the experimental data slightly better than analytical model analytical model do serve as a means for verifying many numerical models for gravity drainage and infiltration mechanism where numerical models often suffer from convergence and mass balance problems also the proposed analytical model is more efficient than the numerical model in terms of the run time which can be easily compared with the results of the experimental model and it can enhance our understanding of the gravity drainage and infiltration mechanism 4 sensitivity analysis in this section based on the validated analytical model an appropriate design of experiment doe method was selected to find the most important parameters affecting the gravity drainage mechanism the effects of various parameters such as absolute matrix permeability porosity oil gas density difference oil viscosity matrix block height relative permeability coefficient and capillary pressure coefficient were used to perform a parametric sensitivity analysis on the recovery factor from the matrix block the range of the parameters used in the sensitivity analysis is shown in table 4 in this study a full factorial design method was used which allows for the simultaneous study of the effects that several factors may have on recovery box and draper 1987 in order to study the simultaneous effects of different parameters on recovery rate from a block traditional single parameter sensitivity analysis might not provide reasonable results hence an efficient way in terms of time and cost is needed which allows for the study of interactions between the factors without the use of doe important interactions may remain undetected because interactions between the affecting parameters are the driving force in many processes in a full factorial doe characteristic time is determined at all combinations of the experimental inputs each combination of affecting input parameters is called a run and the response value for this combination is an observation the whole set of runs is the design montgomery 2008 in this study the effect of 7 parameters are investigated on recovery resulting in 27 runs recovery factor can be described by two different characteristics including the ultimate recovery and the recovery rate analytical models provide smooth results for the recovery curve which converges to ultimate recovery in infinite time therefore the time needed to reach 80 of the ultimate recovery was used as the characteristic recovery time crt of the gravity drainage mechanism a schematic representation of this method is shown in fig 6 in this figure it can be noted that the ultimate recovery is 0 3 therefore the time in which system produces 80 of this amount 0 24 is defined as the crt the effect of different parameters on the recovery rate is presented as a normal probability plot in fig 7 in this figure the standardized effect shown on x axis represents average effect of each input on crt and it is the difference between the average value for crt over high levels of each parameter minus the average value of crt over the low levels of that parameter stamatis 2002 41 effect σ y n σ y n where y represents the crt and n denotes the number of data points collected for each level for instance in order to calculate the sensitivity of crt to permeability the median value of k and the response crt at this k is determined then based on the number of data points in which k is higher or lower value than median of k the corresponding values for y y n and n are determined parameters with a positive negative effect on crt lie on the right left side of the red line the red line in fig 7 shows the random effect on crt or the noise which should be discarded in this figure the y axis shows the cumulative normal distribution of data points the results of this figure show that absolute permeability and oil viscosity have the highest influences on the recovery rate this can be justified by the fact that these parameters can change in a much wider region than other parameters moreover it can be deduced that porosity φ block height h and oil viscosity µo are directly proportional with the crt therefore increasing these parameters will slow down the gravity drainage mechanism other parameters including absolute permeability k relative permeability coefficient kro 0 capillary pressure coefficient pcd 0 and density difference δρ decrease the crt leading to faster recovery from the block the effect of different inputs on the ultimate recovery from the block is shown in fig 8 as shown in this figure most of the parameters do not affect the ultimate recovery from the block and only affect the recovery rate this result seems reasonable because the capillary gravity forces are the only forces which can affect the ultimate recovery consequently block height δ ρ h matrix and capillary pressure coefficient pcd 0 are the only parameters influencing the ultimate recovery 5 conclusions in this study a reliable analytical model is developed for gravity drainage or infiltration process from a single block in the fractured porous medium in order to model the flow in such a mechanism more realistic saturation dependent flow functions are used these functions include an inverse function of saturation for capillary pressure and quadratic function of saturation for relative permeability using several transformations the governing equations are solved and saturation distribution and transfer functions from the block including dimensionless flow rate and dimensionless recovery are determined based on the results the following can be concluded a new analytical transfer function for a dual porosity model is obtained which can be used to improve the reliability of naturally fractured reservoir simulators the results of the new model are compared with the experimental measurements as well as numerical simulation and the results are well matched based on the new model a design of experiment doe method is used to investigate the sensitivity of recovery to various affecting parameters including absolute matrix permeability porosity density difference viscosity matrix block height relative permeability coefficient and capillary pressure coefficient results of sensitivity analysis on the rate of recovery show that higher values of absolute permeability relative permeability coefficient capillary pressure coefficient and density difference results in faster gravity drainage or infiltration process while porosity block height and viscosity can adversely affect the recovery rate sensitivity analysis shows that among the discussed parameters only block height and capillary pressure coefficient can affect the ultimate recovery from the system taller blocks will have higher ultimate oil production and higher values of capillary pressure decreases the ultimate recovery finally in the proposed analytical solution the quadratic function for relative permeability was considered and other exponents in power law model for relative permeability require further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests acknowledgment authors would like to thank professor mehran pooladi dervish who helped us continuously through his invaluable guidance suggestions and comments

this section hagoort model 1980 and the saidi model 1987 are presented to model the gravity drainage laboratory results a hagoort model 1980 the main focus of hagoort s study 1980 is to present a new simplified analytical model based on a few assumptions 1 capillary term is neglected 2 gas mobility is much greater than oil mobility according to eq a 13 and regardless of the capillary force the

of recovery at early time and eq b 3 represents the amount of recovery at late time by plotting eqs b 2 and b 3 versus time the point of their intersection is determined the hagoort model 1980 has neglected the threshold capillary pressure which predicts a recovery factor greater than the experimental data by multiplying the expressions h hth h in the cumulative production expressed in eqs b 2 and b 3 the modified model applies threshold capillary b saidi model 1987 saidi 1987 presented an analytical gravity drainage model based on a few assumptions 1 capillary pressure curve is l shape 2

and the results of hagoort model 1980 and saidi model 1987 are plotted in two semi log and cartesian coordinates the capillary pressure of hagoort model 1980 and saidi model 1987 is equal to the threshold capillary pressure which overestimate the amount of cumulative production by calculating the area under the experimental capillary pressure curve the final recovery from the matrix block is obtained to match hagoort model 1980 and saidi model 1987 with experimental results initial water saturation and threshold lengths can be used as shown in fig b 3 the area below the capillary pressure curve is 26 32 in table b 1 by changing the threshold length of the block to match the area below the graph hth match 28 76 is obtained figs b 4 and b 5 show the experimental results and the results of hagoort model 1980 and saidi model 1987 after matching threshold length of the block 
6226,evaluation of the engrossment of watershed surface characteristics on partitioning of precipitation to runoff and evapotranspiration is key to inspect the availability of water at watershed scale it is more evident in the cases of ungauged watersheds the present study develops models using multiple linear regression method and machine learning techniques ann artificial neural network and rvm relevance vector machine over 793 25 major river basins and 768 watersheds across india to estimate the watershed parameter ω in fu s budyko based equation that represents intrinsic watershed attributes in addition seasonality factor is incorporated in the model due to intra annual variability in vegetation across india the models attempt to explain the intricate relationship between vegetation alterations and regional water balance it is seen that the ann and rvm models have performed better in estimating ω than the mlr multiple linear regression models in addition ndvi has shown more engagement in explaining the partitioning process of water in intra annual low ndvi period compared to high ndvi period we have also found the present models to be more accurate than the previously developed budyko based methods in predicting ω the newly improved models have closely imitated the intrinsic basin attributes and enhanced the functionality of budyko framework in estimation of water availability which would play a crucial role in assessment of hydrology of ungauged watersheds of india keywords budyko framework india neural network relevance vector machine watershed characteristics 1 introduction hydrology plays a significant role in preserving the ecological balance regionally vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 understanding the complexities of hydrology at catchment scale and simplifying its processes is of highest importance for sustainability of human communities currently the biggest problem to human populations is the availability of water seckler et al 1999 yu 2016 water availability is evaluated by analysing the partitioning of precipitation to runoff and evapotranspiration that are subjected to anthropogenic and climatic forcing milly et al 2005 vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 anthropogenic interactions have agitated the water cycle globally jha et al 2019 findell et al 2007 min et al 2011 weiskel et al 2007 with substantial growth of urbanite population the demand for resources and services increases that leads to the conversion of land covers and ultimately disturbs the biodiversity grimm et al 2008 and intensifies the water scarcity problems furthermore removal of land cover has an adverse influence on the regional convection processes chase et al 2000 pielke 2001 anthropogenic activities are directly accountable for the alteration of inherent catchment properties like soil properties vegetation covers topographical characteristics etc wagener et al 2010 that eventually determines the partitioning of precipitation and available energy at the surface various lsms land surface model are developed to accurately simulate the energy and water fluxes among the atmosphere vegetation and land surface pitman 2003 rodell et al 2004 the models are further distinguished as first manabe 1969 second deardorff 1978 and third generation models based on their advancement in interpretations of surface characteristics like soil moisture soil temperature canopy conductance etc pitman 2003 sellers et al 1997 1992 the existing models require a good amount of datasets there is a need of a much simpler model that incorporates readily available data and takes less time to compute evaluation of watershed attributes correctly remains a challenging task which is more significant for ungauged watersheds with the advent of urbanization and industrialization there has been a huge heterogeneity in the land use and land covers patters soil properties etc in addition to it space time heterogeneity in climatic variables adds more ambiguity in prediction of hydrologic responses runoffs which is the heart of prediction in ungauged basins pub problems sivapalan 2003 recently budyko framework has been used in many studies to explain this intricate hydrological processes milly 1994 williams et al 2012 zhang et al 2001 budyko framework demonstrate the complex relationships between evaporative index ratio of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation e p and dryness index ration of potential evapotranspiration and precipitation e0 p that obeys the constraints of water availability and energy availability budyko 1974 sposito 2017 it describes the partitioning of precipitation to actual evapotranspiration and runoff and partitioning of energy at surface to sensible heat and latent heat donohue et al 2007 2010 the framework works on the assumption of steady state nature i e change in water storage is considered to be negligible pertaining to the consideration of long term water and energy balances gao et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 budyko framework is simple yet very robust and embraces the physicality of the water and energy cycles over the years researchers have introduced a parameter in the budyko hypothesis that epitomises the catchment attributes ascribing them to the explanation of deviations of the budyko curves non parametric budyko type equations from the observed hydro meteorological data donohue et al 2007 till date 4 one parameter budyko based equations are developed with different explanatory parameters eqs 1 4 out of which the first two equations given by fu 1981 and choudhury 1999 are well known furthermore yang et al 2008 have demonstrated that the parameters in both the equations are related as ω n 0 7 zhang et al 2004 has shown the value of ω to be 2 84 for forested and 2 55 for grassed catchments in australia respectively suggesting that evapotranspiration is higher for forested catchments further yang et al 2007 used fu s equation and showed that ω ranged nearly between 1 60 and 3 22 for non humid regions of china zhang et al 2001 have presented a parameter w eq 3 denoting plant available water coefficient that generally explains the transpiration process of plants with dissimilarities in their root zone depths for forest areas the best fit value of the parameter was shown to be 2 while for grasslands and croplands the value dropped down to 0 5 furthermore the parameter in budyko eq 4 wang and tang 2014 can be inferred as the ratio of initial evaporation to total evaporation 1 e p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p ω 1 ω fu 1981 yang et al 2007 2 e p 1 e 0 p n 1 n choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 3 e p 1 w e 0 p 1 w e 0 p e 0 p 1 zhang et al 2001 4 e p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p 2 4 ε 2 ε e 0 p 2 ε 2 ε wang and tang 2014 the use of budyko framework for modelling the catchment attributes was performed previously by xu et al 2013 for the entire land mass of earth using 256 watersheds positioned across the globe within the united states 224 small watersheds 10 000 km2 across different climatic and surface environments taken from mopex international model parameter estimation experiment were considered for the study only 32 large watersheds 230 000 to 600 000 km2 located at the six continents appointed from pan et al 2012 were included in the research see xu et al 2013 to understand the spatial distribution of all the considered watersheds the authors have provided both mlr multiple linear regression and nn neural network models that have shown r2 values of 0 53 and 0 69 respectively moreover the authors have computed et using the budyko framework and ω taken from the nn model for 36 000 basins across the entire earth mass to compare it with the independently satellite derived et from zhang et al 2010 it is seen that indus basin from south east asia which has been involved in building of the models has overlapped with a meagre portion of indian region in fact this issue would be prevalent in many nations due to selection of such widely dispersed watersheds thus applying the models for indian territory does not seem convincing responding to this argument would entail an inspection of the performance of the models in indian context and developing a regional based model that would more closely resemble the hydrological activities the present study discusses the issue with an attempt to develop a regional model for evaluation of the intrinsic watershed attributes ω in fu s equation spanning across india introduction of watershed characteristics into the framework by the parametric budyko equations eqs 1 4 have raised their ability to simulate the hydrology appropriately at watershed scale however yang et al 2008 have shown that the solution space of zhang s budyko equation eq 3 is not consistent with the state space of p aet and pet as it exceeds the energy limit also wang and tang 2014 have specified the non applicability of budyko eq 4 for watershed datasets of few studies roderick and farquhar 2011 yang et al 2007 due to the values of coming out of its lower bound value 0 sinha et al 2018 have also documented similar outcomes thus to maintain uniformity in the analysis equation given by fu 1981 is implemented with the parameter ω describing the watershed attributes the equation given by fu 1981 is implemented with the parameter ω describing the watershed attributes several studies have emphasized the importance of ndvi normal difference vegetation index in demonstrating the terrestrial hydrological processes donohue et al 2010 gentine et al 2012 li et al 2013 vegetation coverage introduces an integrated impact of soil characteristic topographical features etc into the framework the ndvi holds a strong correlation with precipitation at watershed scale and thus with intra annual variation in precipitation there would be heterogeneity in the ndvi magnitudes within a year therefore the impact of ndvi on partitioning of water and energy may vary with the seasons for example high ndvi period and low ndvi period in addition annual models may attenuate the influences of ndvi on the hydrology at a finer temporal scale thus to better understand the watershed hydrology more detailed quantitative analysis at narrower temporal scale is required in the study a total of 793 watersheds including the 25 major river basins in india are included in the analysis with datasets for the study period of 2000 2014 to investigate the diversity in the impacts of surface characteristics on the partitioning processes models are developed both at a spatial scale of bio geophysical classes explained in the result section and intra annual temporal scale in addition a comparative analysis is conducted to discuss the shortcomings in the previous study done by xu et al 2013 fig 1 describes the methodology framework adopted in the study each processes described in the method section in detail these studies of quantification of surface attributes are significant in cases of watersheds with unavailability of discharge datasets thus quantifying watershed parameters appropriately within an allowable range is of paramount importance for ungauged watersheds 2 study area the study is carried out in 25 major river basins and 768 watersheds within the major river basins all over india as shown in fig 2 the watersheds cover 90 32 of the total land mass of india topographical and surface details of all the major river basins are given in table 1 annual mean precipitation ranged between 561 988 mm and 3281 128 mm for the river basins of india moreover annual mean e and e0 values varied from 305 594 mm to 1457 621 mm and 1267 296 mm to 2548 461 mm respectively in the river basins spatial variations of annual mean p e and e0 are shown in supporting information fig 1 highest precipitation is observed in the north eastern and western ghat of india regardless of the temporal scale pertaining to the orographic features of the regions revadekar et al 2012 the watersheds are further separated on the basis of bio geophysical classifications rodgers et al 2002 as can be seen in fig 2 the class names are displayed within the figure table 1 also shows areal and surface details of the six classes 3 data used and methods 3 1 data used 3 1 1 river basins and watersheds the 25 major river basins have been taken from india wris water resources

nrsc gov in for the period of 2000 2011 3 2 methods 3 2 1 validation of satellite derived et datasets calculation of watershed characteristics parameter requires actual et values generally actual et for a longer time scale is calculated by subtracting observed discharge from observed precipitation datasets physical water balance approach or it is accessed from observational et flux towers in the study due to unavailability of discharge datasets for such finely located basins and absence of flux towers the et datasets are accessed from modis satellite these datasets have been used in many global studies montenegro et al 2009 mu et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 for validation of these satellite derived datasets 35 catchments with their gauging stations having daily discharge datasets are selected from india water resources information system india wris mean annual water balance approach is adopted as per the budyko hypothesis to perform the validation analysis 3 2 2 calibration of fu s equation budyko based equation given by fu 1981 is used in the present study for the total 793 watersheds including the 25 major river basins and 768 sub basins of these river basins the budyko model is calibrated with satellite derived datasets to obtain the watershed parameter ω for each of the watersheds the parameter describes the intrinsic properties of the watersheds that determine the partitioning processes thus calibrated values of ω are taken as standard to compare with the estimated ω from the models 3 2 3 regression model multiple linear regressions are performed using the backward elimination method for watersheds to estimate the ω parameter using land surface properties eight variables are considered for the evaluation they are latitude degree longitude degree altitude m area km2 cti compound topographic index ndvi slope degree and slope aspect cosine these variables minimise the correlations of input parameters with climatic variables that would better explain the partitioning processes xu et al 2013 the variables familiarize the intricate roles of surface attributes in the partitioning process of precipitation latitude decides the amount of incoming solar radiation that ultimately with surface reflectance provides net radiation longitude determines the distance from water bodies that coupling with wind direction cause differential precipitation elevation introduces the impacts of temperature and pressure gradients slope is responsible for lateral distribution of water that determines the water availability slope affects cti that determines the soil moisture of the location that controls the hydrological processes furthermore aspect along with slope governs the amount of solar radiation received by the location and determines the ecology of the place bennie et al 2008 oke 2002 ndvi refers to the vegetation greenery extent of the place that directly affects the evapotranspiration process here note that altitude cti ndvi slope and aspect values are spatial mean values the latitude and longitude values represent the position of basin centroids the regression models for watersheds hereafter are termed as mlr models irrespective of different classes of watersheds for example small watersheds large watersheds and classification based on bio geophysical characteristics on which they are performed 3 2 4 ann model with the advancement in computational and information processing capacity new methods such which involve the utilization of machine s learning ability to mimic human traits have become increasingly popular the artificial neural networks anns have been widely used to model complex processes in a variety of fields in hydrology gorgij et al 2017 noori and kalin 2016 rezaeianzadeh et al 2015 the complex nature of a hydrological phenomenon is often difficult to model for example conventional methods in rainfall runoff modelling fail to capture the linear relationship tanty and desmukh 2015 with the advent of anns the system conceptual modelling of hydrological processes has become relatively easier the anns allows us to establish a relationship between input and output even without the detailed knowledge of important physical parameters e g catchment characteristics although we do not provide weightage exclusively to these parameters these parameters are pretty much an integral part of the developed model there are many studies which can be referred to understand the capacity of anns in precise modelling of complex hydrological process kasiviswanathan et al 2018 kasiviswanathan and sudheer 2017 nourani 2017 taormina et al 2015 in this study along with the mlr models ann models are developed using the nn tool for annual and intra annual time scales high and low ndvi periods for the combined datasets of all the river basins and watersheds of india the eight surface parameters in mlr models are considered for ann models as inputs anns are considered to be advantageous over conceptual or statistical models as the application of ann does not require prior knowledge about the involved processes as black box models anns have inbuilt properties of capturing the nonlinearity offer greater flexibility to have multiple inputs and can identify the spatial temporal variability in this study a simple model is selected by representing parameter ω i as a function of set of basin characteristics selecting these significant basin characteristics is vital for a good estimation model bowden et al 2005 fernando et al 2009 galelli et al 2014 we employed the mutual information approach for selecting the variables for implementing the machine techniques the mutual information approach allows us to estimate the information of one variable contained in another the expected quantity of information confined in one variable is a function of entropy for this purpose we utilized the r package muti in r programming language scheuerell 2017 the package is used to compute the mutual information between all the input variables i e latitude longitude altitude area cti ndvi slope and slope aspect and the output variable observed ω once the mutual information is computed the critical threshold value on mutual information using monte carlo simulations at 95 significant level is estimated we selected only those variables whose mutual information value was greater than the critical value the details of best suitable variables and their corresponding mutual information values are provided in table 2 surprisingly it is seen that in annual time scale parameter ndvi got rejected as the input variable in the construction of the machine learning models this may be due to averaging out the intra annual variations of ndvi within a year that diminished its role in partitioning of precipitation in high and low ndvi periods longitude and area got rejected respectively further after normalization 70 15 and 15 of the data are selected as training testing and validation sets various ann configurations are trained and tested and the goodness of fit statistics are computed for both training and testing for each of the ann architectures the best architecture is obtained using the minimization of mean squared error as performance function finally ann architecture with 10 hidden layers employing levenberg marquardt algorithm is selected as the best one the net structures of the trained ann models for mean annual and intra annual time scale is provided in the supporting information 3 2 5 rvm model support vector machines svms are another very effective artificial intelligence based method that has attracted the attention of many in recent years adnan et al 2017 chiogna et al 2018 kisi and parmar 2016 the svms work on the theory of structural risk minimisation srm it is mainly a kernel based learning methodology established on the statistical learning principle relevance vector machines or the rvms are the improved versions of svm which incorporate the advantages such as automated estimation of model parameters capacity to utilize the arbitrary basis functions and probabilistic predictions the anns svms and rvms have been widely utilized in the field studies krishan et al 2019 goyal et al 2014 tanty and desmukh 2015 rezaeianzadeh et al 2015 ruiming 2019 samui and dixon 2012 zaman et al 2012 however all of them have their own set of advantages and limitations many studies suggest that svms and rvms perform better as compared to anns sachindra et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 rvm technique in this study is applied to the combined set of watershed datasets for all the temporal scales using the selected variables as per table 2 as discussed the rvm implements probabilistic background and implements prior over the model weights controlled by a set of hyper parameters whose plausible values are estimated iteratively from the data tipping 2001 the most convincing component of rvm is that it predicts accurately with fewer number of relevance vector and the performance can be comparable with other machine learning technique posterior distributions of the majority of weights are peaked around zero and the training vectors associated with the non zero weights are the relevance vectors the working of rvms typically depends on the kernels function used in training and predicting this parameter can be set to any function of class kernel which computes a dot product between two vector arguments rvm package in r provides the most popular kernel functions which can be used by setting the kernel parameter in this study radial basis function kernel or rbf kernel is used for training the data set to maintain scientific coherence 70 15 15 of the randomly sampled data are partitioned into training testing and validation sets respectively the datasets are further normalized before processing the optimal trained rvm model and the corresponding codes for mean annual and intra annual time scale are provided in the supporting information 4 results 4 1 relationship between ndvi and precipitation as discussed above this study aims at investigating the water balance of india at finer temporal resolution intra annual scale previous studies have documented that there exist a strong association between ndvi and precipitation at watershed scale prasad et al 2007 revadekar et al 2012 sarkar kafatos 2004 sharma and goyal 2018 noticeable intra annual variations in vegetation cover are observed this is because of the dependency of plant phenology on the availability of water that varies throughout the year revadekar et al 2012 fig 3 shows the monthly mean values of ndvi and precipitation for india spatial mean for the study period of 2000 2014 since the difference in values between the two parameters is high i e ndvi ranged between 0 329 and 0 586 whereas p varied between 19 925 mm and 504 004 mm for the months normalised values have been calculated and used for plotting a good resemblance in the datasets is observed the figure demonstrates that the south west monsoon which is more prominent in india provides precipitation for the vegetation growth in the country leading to an escalation in ndvi values from the onset of may that continues till february the vegetation manages water from north east or the winter monsoon during the final stages of the year the time lag between plots indicate the interval in which surface attains sufficient moisture to support vegetation cover across the country revadekar et al 2012 this substantial inconsistency in the values of ndvi within a year would greatly influence ω and thus to better understand the partitioning processes it is necessary to continue the analysis at intra annual scale the months of february march april may and june are considered to be the low ndvi months as evident from fig 3 intra annual time scale is developed taking these five months as the low ndvi period and the rest of the months as high ndvi period although there would be deviations of low ndvi months from this temporal range for some watersheds particularly for those in the south eastern regions of india for example watersheds near to or within the state tamil nadu that generally experiences rainfall in the months of october december considering same months seems to be the best choice as per the objective of developing models for estimation of ω for whole india 4 2 validation of mod16a2 et datasets the et algorithm used in mod16 products to derive the datasets has been validated with 46 in situ eddy covariance flux towers 232 global watersheds and past records of 11 years during 2000 2010 mu et al 2013 for the flux towers the et algorithm is implemented with two sets of meteorological data namely tower observed and nasa s global modelling and assimilation office gmao meteorological data on 3 3 1 km2 pixels having similar modis land cover with that of actual tower vegetation type the estimated et values are compared with the tower et observations graph shown for one tower for each biome in the documentation the average daily et biases are 0 11 kg m2 day with average mean absolute errors mae of 0 33 kg m2 day for tower meteorological data and 0 02 kg m2 day with mae of 0 31 kg m2 day for gmao meteorological datasets the mae values 24 6 and 24 1 are within the 10 30 range of accuracy of et observations at global scale the algorithm is implemented at 1 km2 resolution using pre processed modis remote sensing data gmao meteorological data during 2000 2006 and merra gmao meteorological data during 2000 2010 it is observed that the estimated modis et is very close to the actual et calculated from precipitation in addition for 232 global watersheds the estimated et obtained from merra gmao meteorological datasets are compared with the observed et obtained from budyko hypothesis during the period of 2000 2006 the relationship is obtained to be very strong r2 0 85 in this section furthermore for its applicability in indian context the actual et derived from the mean annual water balance to be consistent with the budyko hypothesis wang and zhou 2016 is compared with the modis et datasets note that the parameters are mean annual values for the period of twelve years 2000 2011 the daily discharge datasets are obtained from india water resources information system india wris a major drawback with this dataset is the discontinuity in it due to missing observations for certain period within a year in addition the datasets are not having the same temporal range meaning that the stations are set up at different times and periods ultimately this validation is done with 35 catchments locations shown in supporting information fig 2 delineated from gauging station points with daily discharge datasets provided by india wris the daily discharge datasets are converted to annual mean scale a fairly strong and significant relationship is observed between the et datasets fig 4 r 0 622 p 0 01 therefore modis actual et can be used for future analysis these authentications provide a promising assurance in the application of mod16 et datasets for the present study thus the observed values of watershed parameter ω for the study period are obtained using the budyko equation with annual mean values of modis et datasets moreover we acknowledge the fact that implementing observed or derived et from observed discharge values for quantifying omega would impart more confidence in the models developed 4 3 models for assessment of watershed parameter ω 4 3 1 mlr models the combined set of watersheds 25 river basins and 768 watersheds are divided into two groups namely small watersheds 15 000 km2 750 watersheds and big watersheds 43 watersheds depending on their sizes the final models for small watersheds is as follows 5 ω 1 25045 0 01062 l a t 0 015358 s 0 017069 c t i 3 15398 10 6 a 0 204910 a s p 0 126664 n d v i where lat is latitude s is slope a is area asp is slope aspect the model has explained a variance of 21 8 with lat explaining 12 2 s 6 2 cti 0 8 a 0 5 asp 0 2 and ndvi 1 9 the standard error is 0 104 the reason for such low r2 value may be due to huge amount of watersheds taken as sample that increased variability in the model for large watersheds the mlr model is shown below 6 ω 1 44269 0 03146 l a t 0 04820 s 0 07218 c t i 2 08 10 7 a the model explained 76 9 variance with latitude explaining 25 6 s 47 8 cti 2 8 and a 0 7 the standard error of this model is 0 160 the r2 of this model is much higher than the previous model of small watersheds finally with the combined set of watersheds the developed model is given by 7 ω 1 16784 0 01536 l a t 0 03065 s 0 04615 c t i 2 3587 10 7 a 0 23669 a s p 0 12122 n d v i the standard error for the model is 0 116 the mlr model for india has shown a very low r2 value of 0 363 lat explained 11 7 variance with s explaining 14 2 cti 8 8 a 0 3 asp 0 12 and ndvi 1 2 as mentioned above due to huge amount of sample data there is high variance in the model more advanced methods like machine learning techniques for example neural networks random vector method etc can further explain the observed variance effectively it can be clearly seen that for annual time scale in all sets of watersheds latitude and slope have the higher influence over other variables fig 5 a c table 3 shows the coefficients and variance explained by each significant parameter for intra annual time scale in the model developed latitude longitude and elevation have larger impact on the catchment parameter at intra annual scale with ndvi having high percentage variance explained value mainly in low ndvi months fig 5a c for small and combined set of watersheds the seasonality factor has improved the mlr models higher r2 values fig 6 fig 7 a interestingly for all sets of watersheds it can be seen that the variance explained by ndvi in low ndvi period models is higher compared to high ndvi period models fig 5 a c this highlights the fact that ndvi has higher impact in the partitioning processes of water and energy in the low ndvi months to improve the mlr models the watersheds are further divided based on their geographical locations rodgers et al 2002 has provided a map of india demarcated in 10 classes having distinctive bio geographical attributes in the study the 768 watersheds are grouped to six classes as shown in fig 2 a parameter ω would be greatly related to the distribution of biological species and ecosystems in geographical space and thus variance in the model could be narrowed down by classifying the watersheds accordingly the islands category is not considered in the study trans himalaya and the himalaya regions are considered as one class similarly indian desert and semi arid regions are categorised as one along with the deccan peninsula and coasts as one under the name deccan peninsula fig 2 a table 4 shows the coefficients and r2 of the models developed based on the bio geographic classification acronyms have been given to each class as mentioned in the table it also displays percentage variance explained by each parameter considering only the models developed at mean annual time scale it can be perceived from the table that the value of explained variance has increased in all the cases compared to the 36 of combined mean annual model for india although the r2 values are still low except the model for wg r2 0 775 fig 7 the main variable that explained highest variance in ω at every spatial scale of watersheds is latitude ndvi has the highest explained variance value in 2 cases i e tm and ds similar trend is observed with intra annual models having higher r2 compared to the corresponding intra annual models for combined watershed datasets except the model for dp high ndvi period case fig 7 seasonality factor has improved the models except the two cases i e tm high ndvi and dp high ndvi fig 7 b similar to earlier occasions latitude has explained significant variance in ω compared to other surface variables this proves the strong relation of lateral imbalance in net radiation of earth with the partitioning process of precipitation at mean annual scale catchment parameter ω has been calibrated with observed precipitation datasets it is evident from the budyko hypothesis that with increase in precipitation discharge increases that lessens the ω values fu s budyko curve therefore variability in precipitation would be reflected in the ω values in addition trends in precipitation are responsible for similar variability trends in ndvi as shown in fig 3 thus introducing seasonality high and low ndvi period in the analysis would bring down the variance in the catchment parameter which may lead to better performance of intra annual models compared to annual models compared to other surface parameters ndvi showed promising influence in the cases of ds gp tm and dp mainly in the low ndvi period months fig 5 in addition ndvi has higher influence in hydrological processes in the low ndvi months compared to high ndvi period for all the classes except tm class similar to the previous cases it can be observed from fig 3 that the high ndvi month period includes the entire range of highest and lowest values of precipitation due to the time lag of precipitation and ndvi values thus this non uniformity in precipitation brings heterogeneity high variance in ω values in the high ndvi period that may be the reason of poor performance of ndvi in explaining variance in catchment characteristics values in high ndvi period models this shows the importance of decomposing the models to intra annual time scale to effectively capture the role of vegetation on the hydrological processes at watershed scale the plots of observed ω and estimated ω for all the models are shown in fig 8 4 3 2 ann and rvm models in the present study two machine learning techniques namely ann and rvm have been incorporated to develop models to better estimate ω in fu s budyko equation for india at all temporal scales both mean annual and intra annual time scale note that the techniques have been applied on the combined set of watersheds 25 river basins and 768 watersheds as per the objectives of the study fig 9 display the training testing and validation results of the ann technique with the statistical parameters r2 se standard error to check the precision of the simulations since during the analysis the training datasets are used to calibrate the model and validation datasets are kept untouched during the training sessions as the models are tested on them it is better to compare the validation results for evaluation of performances of the models the low ndvi period ann model has performed better than the other models with highest r2 values r2 0 77 although se is lowest for mean annual ann model se 0 02 fig 9 thus positive influence of seasonality has been observed in the low ndvi case the ann models have performed well compared to the mlr models for combined watersheds at all time scales as evident from the r2 and se values of the plots in the case of rvm models the normalised values of observed and simulated ω are shown as scatter plots as displayed in fig 10 the low ndvi model has explained variance in ω values better like in the previous cases the low ndvi period model has performed better than the other two models with r2 and se values of 0 77 and 0 04 respectively like the ann models rvm models are superior to the mlr models in effective estimation of ω comparing the two machine learning techniques it is found that ann performed better in the cases of mean annual and high ndvi period models with same r2 values for low ndvi period although there is not much difference in the statistical parameters of the two in addition supporting information table s1 displays the results of the trained models on the six bio geographical classes it can be perceived that the machine learning techniques have better estimated the watershed parameter except for the cases of desert and semi arid ds and trans himalaya and himalaya tm when compared with mlr models therefore from the study it is observed that machine learning techniques have higher ability than regression methods in understanding the complexity involved in interaction of precipitation with land surface attributes 5 discussions the present study is motivated by the believe that the previous models developed at a global scale using the budyko framework would not be able to accurately estimate the watershed parameter in indian context because of the selection of highly dispersed watersheds across the globe thus in this section we would compare the results from ann and rvm models with the results obtained after implementing the mlr and ann models provided by xu et al 2013 one of the major purposes of the study was to develop a single model for whole india that incorporates an amalgamation of small and large watersheds therefore the models developed using machine learning techniques are applied on all the watersheds as a whole thus not considering the bio geographical classes separately however assessing each of the bio geographical classes separate trained models would certainly provide better estimations as the variance would be lessened in spite of that the results would not vary significantly with the present outcomes of the trained models as shown in table 5 for a single class western ghats that showed highest r2 value for the combined watersheds trained models supporting information table s1 fig 11 shows the estimation of ω with the previous models it is clearly seen that the previous budyko based models have not predicted the watershed parameter well the r2 values are extremely low when applied to the combined set of watershed datasets all watersheds for mean annual time scale mlrx r2 3e 05 nnx r2 5e 04 fig 11 the subscript x denotes the models given by xu et al 2013 moreover one peculiarity has been observed in the results of mlrx model surprisingly it is seen that a few estimated ω values have gone below the zero horizontal line negative values fig 11 a it is not possible for a watershed to bear a negative value of ω the parameter ω is an integration s constant and its values ranges between 0 and yang et al 2007 thus it is evident that the previous models are not reliable for indian context it is perceptible that for a model to evaluate the physics of hydrological processes that is very sensitive to the surface and topographical features when it is trained using input datasets demonstrating a particular spatial domain then testing and predicting parameters on other spatially varying domains seems unfeasible and inappropriate these kinds of estimation models may be implemented in areas that share similar ecosystem structures for example areas having alike ecological properties comprising of phenology stomatal conductance that gets influenced by moisture availability etc ewers et al 2007 grant et al 2009 and similar geographical features that has high chances of displaying similar partitioning characteristics of water and energy from the comparison of models the study shows confidence in the implementation of the newly developed models for indian context as stated above the issue of inaccurate estimation of ω using the previous budyko based model seems to be true for other countries also during the incorporation of machine learning techniques we obtained the best fit models for all three cases net high ndvi and low ndvi for ann and rvm in order to further analyse the sensitivity of the models with respect to data size a sensitivity analysis for the best fit model i e low ndvi period with two more cases i e 60 training 20 testing and 20 validation and 80 training 10 testing and 10 validation is performed it is observed from table 6 that 70 training 15 testing and 15 validation is the best suitable partition highest r2 and lowest rmse values for both the models in validation moreover it can be seen that for the case of ann model 14 3 change in training set and 33 3 change in both testing and validation set brings about 4 6 12 5 change for training 4 5 66 7 change for testing and 14 3 75 change for validation in r2 and rmse values respectively for the same percentages of changes in the three sets for the rvm model 6 02 33 33 change in training 16 5 100 change in testing and 6 5 25 change in validation occurred for r2 and rmse values respectively in the study the watersheds are separated based on their bio geographical characteristics into six classes bio geographical attributes take into account the impression of dispersion of biotic interactions within ecosystems across the geographical grades of latitudes longitudes elevations etc these factors would play promising roles in determining the hydrological behaviours of catchments eventually the individual models of these six classes have performed better in estimating the basin parameter ω compared to models with combined watershed datasets classification of watersheds is very crucial as it is hypothesized that the watersheds in the same class would function in a similar manner hydrologically rao and srinivas 2008 have documented an assemblage of clustering techniques namely hybrid clustering fuzzy clustering and self organizing feature maps sofms to obtain a group of watersheds with similar flood generating mechanisms for flood frequency analysis ffa these groups are termed as homogeneous regions and the process of forming the regions is called regionalization the basic idea behind the clustering process is to look for homogeneity in watershed attributes like topographical characteristics soil cover characteristics lulc geographical locations meteorological characteristics etc however it is sometimes appreciated to not classify watersheds based on physical geographic boundaries geomorphology biogeography climatology meteorology etc as this may not guarantee uniformity in hydrology rao and srinivas 2008 therefore more researches can be carried out with classification of watersheds on these attributes excluding the climatic parameters using various clustering algorithms to assess their impact on catchment hydrology estimating ω with homogeneous regions or groups of watersheds classified using the clustering analysis methods may improve the models based on combined watershed datasets similar to the performance of present models for six bio geographical classes as this would minimize the variance in the partitioning processes to be explained the estimation of watershed parameter is done taking variables that signify watersheds characteristics like soil moisture vegetation cover topographical features etc and thus have ignored climatic variables like precipitation temperature etc the impacts of meteorological parameters have already been considered in the analysis while using the budyko framework xu et al 2013 moreover it is reasonable to develop models with parameters that directly represent the inherent watersheds characteristics these watersheds characteristics mainly the surface attributes are highly sensitive to anthropogenic activities human interactions like surface and subsurface withdrawals construction of hydraulic structures alter the dynamics of hydrology it is important for this kind of studies to consider these anthropogenic factors to maintain the analysis close to the natural flow conditions of the catchments their impacts bring deviations in the hydrological responses away from the budyko curve that is explained by the catchment parameter therefore it is apparent that watershed parameter ω would change and never be constant the present study is conducted taking the mean annual average values of the parameters in order to be consistent with the mean annual water balance of budyko hypothesis therefore the models estimate the predominant attributes of the partitioning processes there is a need of new simple and dynamic models that would embrace the non stationarity characteristics of ω in addition human errors in collections of datasets may add more uncertainty in the study 6 conclusion acquiring information on inherent characteristics of a watershed is of great prominence as it explains the dynamics of water flux at the surface the importance of requirement of evidences of watershed attributes grows even more for ungauged watersheds kim and kaluarachchi 2008 the present study has emphasised on the development of regional models to predict ω in fu s budyko based equation which would significantly help in determining the partitioning of water and energy at watershed scale evaluating the results with previously developed global models based on budyko framework shows the ability of the present models to appropriately capture the roles of vegetation soil characteristics topological features etc on defining the hydrological mechanisms moreover separating the watersheds based on bio geographic classification has further enhanced the explanatory capacity of the variables monsoonal precipitation provides the water needed for growth of vegetation and thus changes in precipitation patterns would be reflected in the ndvi values the study has demonstrated the importance of intra annual variation of ndvi on eco hydrologic processes by showing that ndvi had higher capability in low ndvi months compared to high ndvi months in explaining the variance in observed datasets updated land surface models for example vic variable infiltration capacity etc can be implemented to further investigate the performance and genuineness of the models in explaining the hydrological processes under changing environments the study encourages the development of more regional based models with modest techniques like budyko hypothesis to appropriately encapsulate the partitioning processes within acceptable variability range

6226,evaluation of the engrossment of watershed surface characteristics on partitioning of precipitation to runoff and evapotranspiration is key to inspect the availability of water at watershed scale it is more evident in the cases of ungauged watersheds the present study develops models using multiple linear regression method and machine learning techniques ann artificial neural network and rvm relevance vector machine over 793 25 major river basins and 768 watersheds across india to estimate the watershed parameter ω in fu s budyko based equation that represents intrinsic watershed attributes in addition seasonality factor is incorporated in the model due to intra annual variability in vegetation across india the models attempt to explain the intricate relationship between vegetation alterations and regional water balance it is seen that the ann and rvm models have performed better in estimating ω than the mlr multiple linear regression models in addition ndvi has shown more engagement in explaining the partitioning process of water in intra annual low ndvi period compared to high ndvi period we have also found the present models to be more accurate than the previously developed budyko based methods in predicting ω the newly improved models have closely imitated the intrinsic basin attributes and enhanced the functionality of budyko framework in estimation of water availability which would play a crucial role in assessment of hydrology of ungauged watersheds of india keywords budyko framework india neural network relevance vector machine watershed characteristics 1 introduction hydrology plays a significant role in preserving the ecological balance regionally vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 understanding the complexities of hydrology at catchment scale and simplifying its processes is of highest importance for sustainability of human communities currently the biggest problem to human populations is the availability of water seckler et al 1999 yu 2016 water availability is evaluated by analysing the partitioning of precipitation to runoff and evapotranspiration that are subjected to anthropogenic and climatic forcing milly et al 2005 vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 anthropogenic interactions have agitated the water cycle globally jha et al 2019 findell et al 2007 min et al 2011 weiskel et al 2007 with substantial growth of urbanite population the demand for resources and services increases that leads to the conversion of land covers and ultimately disturbs the biodiversity grimm et al 2008 and intensifies the water scarcity problems furthermore removal of land cover has an adverse influence on the regional convection processes chase et al 2000 pielke 2001 anthropogenic activities are directly accountable for the alteration of inherent catchment properties like soil properties vegetation covers topographical characteristics etc wagener et al 2010 that eventually determines the partitioning of precipitation and available energy at the surface various lsms land surface model are developed to accurately simulate the energy and water fluxes among the atmosphere vegetation and land surface pitman 2003 rodell et al 2004 the models are further distinguished as first manabe 1969 second deardorff 1978 and third generation models based on their advancement in interpretations of surface characteristics like soil moisture soil temperature canopy conductance etc pitman 2003 sellers et al 1997 1992 the existing models require a good amount of datasets there is a need of a much simpler model that incorporates readily available data and takes less time to compute evaluation of watershed attributes correctly remains a challenging task which is more significant for ungauged watersheds with the advent of urbanization and industrialization there has been a huge heterogeneity in the land use and land covers patters soil properties etc in addition to it space time heterogeneity in climatic variables adds more ambiguity in prediction of hydrologic responses runoffs which is the heart of prediction in ungauged basins pub problems sivapalan 2003 recently budyko framework has been used in many studies to explain this intricate hydrological processes milly 1994 williams et al 2012 zhang et al 2001 budyko framework demonstrate the complex relationships between evaporative index ratio of actual evapotranspiration and precipitation e p and dryness index ration of potential evapotranspiration and precipitation e0 p that obeys the constraints of water availability and energy availability budyko 1974 sposito 2017 it describes the partitioning of precipitation to actual evapotranspiration and runoff and partitioning of energy at surface to sensible heat and latent heat donohue et al 2007 2010 the framework works on the assumption of steady state nature i e change in water storage is considered to be negligible pertaining to the consideration of long term water and energy balances gao et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 budyko framework is simple yet very robust and embraces the physicality of the water and energy cycles over the years researchers have introduced a parameter in the budyko hypothesis that epitomises the catchment attributes ascribing them to the explanation of deviations of the budyko curves non parametric budyko type equations from the observed hydro meteorological data donohue et al 2007 till date 4 one parameter budyko based equations are developed with different explanatory parameters eqs 1 4 out of which the first two equations given by fu 1981 and choudhury 1999 are well known furthermore yang et al 2008 have demonstrated that the parameters in both the equations are related as ω n 0 7 zhang et al 2004 has shown the value of ω to be 2 84 for forested and 2 55 for grassed catchments in australia respectively suggesting that evapotranspiration is higher for forested catchments further yang et al 2007 used fu s equation and showed that ω ranged nearly between 1 60 and 3 22 for non humid regions of china zhang et al 2001 have presented a parameter w eq 3 denoting plant available water coefficient that generally explains the transpiration process of plants with dissimilarities in their root zone depths for forest areas the best fit value of the parameter was shown to be 2 while for grasslands and croplands the value dropped down to 0 5 furthermore the parameter in budyko eq 4 wang and tang 2014 can be inferred as the ratio of initial evaporation to total evaporation 1 e p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p ω 1 ω fu 1981 yang et al

for modelling the catchment attributes was performed previously by xu et al 2013 for the entire land mass of earth using 256 watersheds positioned across the globe within the united states 224 small watersheds 10 000 km2 across different climatic and surface environments taken from mopex international model parameter estimation experiment were considered for the study only 32 large watersheds 230 000 to 600 000 km2 located at the six continents appointed from pan et al 2012 were included in the research see xu et al 2013 to understand the spatial distribution of all the considered watersheds the authors have provided both mlr multiple linear regression and nn neural network models that have shown r2 values of 0 53 and 0 69 respectively moreover the authors have computed et using the budyko framework and ω taken from the nn model for 36 000 basins across the entire earth mass to compare it with the independently satellite derived et from zhang et al 2010 it is seen that indus basin from south east asia which has been involved in building of the models has overlapped with a meagre portion of indian region in fact this issue would be prevalent in many nations due to selection of such widely dispersed watersheds thus applying the models for indian territory does not seem convincing responding to this argument would entail an inspection of the performance of the models in indian context and developing a regional based model that would more closely resemble the hydrological activities the present study discusses the issue with an attempt to develop a regional model for evaluation of the intrinsic watershed attributes ω in fu s equation spanning across india introduction of watershed characteristics into the framework by the parametric budyko equations eqs 1 4 have raised their ability to simulate the hydrology appropriately at watershed scale however yang et al 2008 have shown that the solution space of zhang s budyko equation eq 3 is not consistent with the state space of p aet and pet as it exceeds the energy limit also wang and tang 2014 have specified the non applicability of budyko eq 4 for watershed datasets of few studies roderick and farquhar 2011 yang et al 2007 due to the values of coming out of its lower bound value 0 sinha et al 2018 have also documented similar outcomes thus to maintain uniformity in the analysis equation given by fu 1981 is implemented with the parameter ω describing the watershed attributes the equation given by fu 1981 is implemented with the parameter ω describing the watershed attributes several studies have emphasized the importance of ndvi normal difference vegetation index in demonstrating the terrestrial hydrological processes donohue et al 2010 gentine et al 2012 li et al 2013 vegetation coverage introduces an integrated impact of soil characteristic topographical features etc into the framework the ndvi holds a strong correlation with precipitation at watershed scale and thus with intra annual variation in precipitation there would be heterogeneity in the ndvi magnitudes within a year therefore the impact of ndvi on partitioning of water and energy may vary with the seasons for example high ndvi period and low ndvi period in addition annual models may attenuate the influences of ndvi on the hydrology at a finer temporal scale thus to better understand the watershed hydrology more detailed quantitative analysis at narrower temporal scale is required in the study a total of 793 watersheds including the 25 major river basins in india are included in the analysis with datasets for the study period of 2000 2014 to investigate the diversity in the impacts of surface characteristics on the partitioning processes models are developed both at a spatial scale of bio geophysical classes explained in the result section and intra annual temporal scale in addition a comparative analysis is conducted to discuss the shortcomings in the previous study done by xu et al 2013 fig 1 describes the methodology framework adopted in the study each processes described in the method section in detail these studies of quantification of surface attributes are significant in cases of watersheds with unavailability of discharge datasets thus quantifying watershed parameters appropriately within an allowable range is of paramount importance for ungauged watersheds 2 study area the study is carried out in 25 major river basins and 768 watersheds within the major river basins all over india as shown in fig 2 the watersheds cover 90 32 of the total land mass of india topographical and surface details of all the major river basins are given in table 1 annual mean precipitation ranged between 561 988 mm and 3281 128 mm for the river basins of india moreover annual mean e and e0 values varied from 305 594 mm to 1457 621 mm and 1267 296 mm to 2548 461 mm respectively in the river basins spatial variations of annual mean p e and e0 are shown in supporting information fig 1 highest precipitation is observed in the north eastern and western ghat of india regardless of the temporal scale pertaining to the orographic features of the regions revadekar et al 2012 the watersheds are further separated on the basis of bio geophysical classifications rodgers et al 2002 as can be seen in fig 2 the class names are displayed within the figure table 1 also shows areal and surface details of the six classes 3 data used and methods 3 1 data used 3 1 1 river basins and watersheds the 25 major river basins have been taken from india wris water resources

impacts of climatic variables such as air temperature radiation vapour pressure and wind speed the datasets are quantified by adding the water vapour fluxes from soil evaporation wet canopy evaporation and transpiration from dry canopy regions daily observed discharge datasets for 35 watersheds are taken from india wris webgis water resources information system portal http www india wris nrsc gov in for the period of 2000 2011 3 2 methods 3 2 1 validation of satellite derived et datasets calculation of watershed characteristics parameter requires actual et values generally actual et for a longer time scale is calculated by subtracting observed discharge from observed precipitation datasets physical water balance approach or it is accessed from observational et flux towers in the study due to unavailability of discharge datasets for such finely located basins and absence of flux towers the et datasets are accessed from modis satellite these datasets have been used in many global studies montenegro et al 2009 mu et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 for validation of these satellite derived datasets 35 catchments with their gauging stations having daily discharge datasets are selected from india water resources information system india wris mean annual water balance approach is adopted as per the budyko hypothesis to perform the validation analysis 3 2 2 calibration of fu s equation budyko based equation given by fu 1981 is used in the present study for the total 793 watersheds including the 25 major river basins and 768 sub basins of these river basins the budyko model is calibrated with satellite derived datasets to obtain the watershed parameter ω for each of the watersheds the parameter describes the intrinsic properties of the watersheds that determine the partitioning processes thus calibrated values of ω are taken as standard to compare with the estimated ω from the models 3 2 3 regression model multiple linear regressions are performed using the backward elimination method for watersheds to estimate the ω parameter using land surface properties eight variables are considered for the evaluation they are latitude degree longitude degree altitude m area km2 cti compound topographic index ndvi slope degree and slope aspect cosine these variables minimise the correlations of input parameters with climatic variables that would better explain the partitioning processes xu et al 2013 the variables familiarize the intricate roles of surface attributes in the partitioning process of precipitation latitude decides the amount of incoming solar radiation that ultimately with surface reflectance provides net radiation longitude determines the distance from water bodies that coupling with wind direction cause differential precipitation elevation introduces the impacts of temperature and pressure gradients slope is responsible for lateral distribution of water that determines the water availability slope affects cti that determines the soil moisture of the location that controls the hydrological processes furthermore aspect along with slope governs the amount of solar radiation received by the location and determines the ecology of the place bennie et al 2008 oke 2002 ndvi refers to the vegetation greenery extent of the place that directly affects the evapotranspiration process here note that altitude cti ndvi slope and aspect values are spatial mean values the latitude and longitude values represent the position of basin centroids the regression models for watersheds hereafter are termed as mlr models irrespective of different classes of watersheds for example small watersheds large watersheds and classification based on bio geophysical characteristics on which they are performed 3 2 4 ann model with the advancement in computational and information processing capacity new methods such which involve the utilization of machine s learning ability to mimic human traits have become increasingly popular the artificial neural networks anns have been widely used to model complex processes in a variety of fields in hydrology gorgij et al 2017 noori and kalin 2016 rezaeianzadeh et al 2015 the complex nature of a hydrological phenomenon is often difficult to model for example conventional methods in rainfall runoff modelling fail to capture the linear relationship tanty and desmukh 2015 with the advent of anns the system conceptual modelling of hydrological processes has become relatively easier the anns allows us to establish a relationship between input and output even without the detailed knowledge of important physical parameters e g catchment characteristics although we do not provide weightage exclusively to these parameters these parameters are pretty much an integral part of the developed model there are many studies which can be referred to understand the capacity of anns in precise modelling of complex hydrological process kasiviswanathan et al 2018 kasiviswanathan and sudheer 2017 nourani 2017 taormina et al 2015 in this study along with the mlr models ann models are developed using the nn tool for annual and intra annual time scales high and low ndvi periods for the combined datasets of all the river basins and watersheds of india the eight surface parameters in mlr models are considered for ann models as inputs anns are considered to be advantageous over conceptual or statistical models as the application of ann does not require prior knowledge about the involved processes as black box models anns have inbuilt properties of capturing the nonlinearity offer greater flexibility to have multiple inputs and can identify the spatial temporal variability in this study a simple model is selected by representing parameter ω i as a function of set of basin characteristics selecting these significant basin characteristics is vital for a good estimation model bowden et al 2005 fernando et al 2009 galelli et al 2014 we employed the mutual information approach for selecting the variables for implementing the machine techniques the mutual information approach allows us to estimate the information of one variable contained in another the expected quantity of information confined in one variable is a function of entropy for this purpose we utilized the r package muti in r programming language scheuerell 2017 the package is used to compute the mutual information between all the input variables i e latitude longitude altitude area cti ndvi slope and slope aspect and the output variable observed ω once the mutual information is computed the critical threshold value on mutual information using monte carlo simulations at 95 significant level is estimated we selected only those variables whose mutual information value was greater than the critical value the details of best suitable variables and their corresponding mutual information values are provided in table 2 surprisingly it is seen that in annual time scale parameter ndvi got rejected as the input variable in the construction of the machine learning models this may be due to averaging out the intra annual variations of ndvi within a year that diminished its role in partitioning of precipitation in high and low ndvi periods longitude and area got rejected respectively further after normalization 70 15 and 15 of the data are selected as training testing and validation sets various ann configurations are trained and tested and the goodness of fit statistics are computed for both training and testing for each of the ann architectures the best architecture is obtained using the minimization of mean squared error as performance function finally ann architecture with 10 hidden layers employing levenberg marquardt algorithm is selected as the best one the net structures of the trained ann models for mean annual and intra annual time scale is provided in the supporting information 3 2 5 rvm model support vector machines svms are another very effective artificial intelligence based method that has attracted the attention of many in recent years adnan et al 2017 chiogna et al 2018 kisi and parmar 2016 the svms work on the theory of structural risk minimisation srm it is mainly a kernel based learning methodology established on the statistical learning principle relevance vector machines or the rvms are the improved versions of svm which incorporate the advantages such as automated estimation of model parameters capacity to utilize the arbitrary basis functions and probabilistic predictions the anns svms and rvms have been widely utilized in the field studies krishan et al 2019 goyal et al 2014 tanty and desmukh 2015 rezaeianzadeh et al 2015 ruiming 2019 samui and dixon 2012 zaman et al 2012 however all of them have their own set of advantages and limitations many studies suggest that svms and rvms perform better as compared to anns sachindra et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 rvm technique in this study is applied to the combined set of watershed datasets for all the temporal scales using the selected variables as per table 2 as discussed the rvm implements probabilistic background and implements prior over the model weights controlled by a set of hyper parameters whose plausible values are estimated iteratively from the data tipping 2001 the most convincing component of rvm is that it predicts accurately with fewer number of relevance vector and the performance can be comparable with other machine learning technique posterior distributions of the majority of weights are peaked around zero and the training vectors associated with the non zero weights are the relevance vectors the working of rvms typically depends on the kernels function used in training and predicting this parameter can be set to any function of class kernel which computes a dot product between two vector arguments rvm package in r provides the most popular kernel functions which can be used by setting the kernel parameter in this study radial basis function kernel or rbf kernel is used for training the data set to maintain scientific coherence 70 15 15 of the randomly sampled data are partitioned into training testing and validation sets respectively the datasets are further normalized before processing the optimal trained rvm model and the corresponding codes for mean annual and intra annual time scale are provided in the supporting information 4 results 4 1 relationship between ndvi and precipitation as discussed above this study aims at investigating the water balance of india at finer temporal resolution intra annual scale previous studies have documented that there exist a strong association between ndvi and precipitation at watershed scale prasad et al 2007 revadekar et al 2012 sarkar kafatos 2004 sharma and goyal 2018 noticeable intra annual variations in vegetation cover are observed this is because of the dependency of plant phenology on the availability of water that varies throughout the year revadekar et al 2012 fig 3 shows the monthly mean values of ndvi and precipitation for india spatial mean for the study period of 2000 2014 since the difference in values between the two parameters is high i e ndvi ranged between 0 329 and 0 586 whereas p varied between 19 925 mm and 504 004 mm for the months normalised values have been calculated and used for plotting a good resemblance in the datasets is observed the figure demonstrates that the south west monsoon which is more prominent in india provides precipitation for the vegetation growth in the country leading to an escalation in ndvi values from the onset of may that continues till february the vegetation manages water from north east or the winter monsoon during the final stages of the year the time lag between plots indicate the interval in which surface attains sufficient moisture to support vegetation cover across the country revadekar et al 2012 this substantial inconsistency in the values of ndvi within a year would greatly influence ω and thus to better understand the partitioning processes it is necessary to continue the analysis at intra annual scale the months of february march april may and june are considered to be the low ndvi months as evident from fig 3 intra annual time scale is developed taking these five months as the low ndvi period and the rest of the months as high ndvi period although there would be deviations of low ndvi months from this temporal range for some watersheds particularly for those in the south eastern regions of india for example watersheds near to or within the state tamil nadu that generally experiences rainfall in the months of october december considering same months seems to be the best choice as per the objective of developing models for estimation of ω for whole india 4 2 validation of mod16a2 et datasets the et algorithm used in mod16 products to derive the datasets has been validated with 46 in situ eddy covariance flux towers 232 global watersheds and past records of 11 years during 2000 2010 mu et al 2013 for the flux towers the et algorithm is implemented with two sets of meteorological data namely tower observed and nasa s global modelling and assimilation office gmao meteorological data on 3 3 1 km2 pixels having similar modis land cover with that of actual tower vegetation type the estimated et values are compared with the tower et observations graph shown for one tower for each biome in the documentation the average daily et biases are 0 11 kg m2 day with average mean absolute errors mae of 0 33 kg m2 day for tower meteorological data and 0 02 kg m2 day with mae of 0 31 kg m2 day for gmao meteorological datasets the mae values 24 6 and 24 1 are within the 10 30 range of accuracy of et observations at global scale the algorithm is implemented at 1 km2 resolution using pre processed modis remote sensing data gmao meteorological data during 2000 2006 and merra gmao meteorological data during 2000 2010 it is observed that the estimated modis et is very close to the actual et calculated from precipitation in addition for 232 global watersheds the estimated et obtained from merra gmao meteorological datasets are compared with the observed et obtained from budyko hypothesis during the period of 2000 2006 the relationship is obtained to be very strong r2 0 85 in this section furthermore for its applicability in indian context the actual et derived from the mean annual water balance to be consistent with the budyko hypothesis wang and zhou 2016 is compared with the modis et datasets note that the parameters are mean annual values for the period of twelve years 2000 2011 the daily discharge datasets are obtained from india water resources information system india wris a major drawback with this dataset is the discontinuity in it due to missing observations for certain period within a year in addition the datasets are not having the same temporal range meaning that the stations are set up at different times and periods ultimately this validation is done with 35 catchments locations shown in supporting information fig 2 delineated from gauging station points with daily discharge datasets provided by india wris the daily discharge datasets are converted to annual mean scale a fairly strong and significant relationship is observed between the et datasets fig 4 r 0 622 p 0 01 therefore modis actual et can be used for future analysis these authentications provide a promising assurance in the application of mod16 et datasets for the present study thus the observed values of watershed parameter ω for the study period are obtained using the budyko equation with annual mean values of modis et datasets moreover we acknowledge the fact that implementing observed or derived et from observed discharge values for quantifying omega would impart more confidence in the models developed 4 3 models for assessment of watershed parameter ω 4 3 1 mlr models the combined set of watersheds 25 river basins and 768 watersheds are divided into two groups namely small watersheds 15 000 km2 750 watersheds and big watersheds 43 watersheds depending on their sizes the final models for small watersheds is as follows 5 ω 1 25045 0 01062 l a t 0 015358 s 0 017069 c t i 3 15398 10 6 a 0 204910 a s p 0 126664 n d v i where lat is latitude s is slope a is area asp is slope aspect the model has explained a variance of 21 8 with lat explaining 12 2 s 6 2 cti 0 8 a 0 5 asp 0 2 and ndvi 1 9 the standard error is 0 104 the reason for such low r2 value may be due to huge amount of watersheds taken as sample that increased variability in the model for large watersheds the mlr model is shown below 6 ω 1 44269 0 03146 l a t 0 04820 s 0 07218 c t i 2 08 10 7 a the model explained 76 9 variance with latitude explaining 25 6 s 47 8 cti 2 8 and a 0 7 the standard error of this model is 0 160 the r2 of this model is much higher than the previous model of small watersheds finally with the combined set of watersheds the developed model is given by 7 ω 1 16784 0 01536 l a t 0 03065 s 0 04615 c t i 2 3587 10 7 a 0 23669 a s p 0 12122 n d v i the standard error for the model is 0 116 the mlr model for india has shown a very low r2 value of 0 363 lat explained 11 7 variance with s explaining 14 2 cti 8 8 a 0 3 asp 0 12 and ndvi 1 2 as mentioned above due to huge amount of sample data there is high variance in the model more advanced methods like machine learning techniques for example neural networks random vector method etc can further explain the observed variance effectively it can be clearly seen that for annual time scale in all sets of watersheds latitude and slope have the higher influence over other variables fig 5 a c table 3 shows the coefficients and variance explained by each significant parameter for intra annual time scale in the model developed latitude longitude and elevation have larger impact on the catchment parameter at intra annual scale with ndvi having high percentage variance explained value mainly in low ndvi months fig 5a c for small and combined set of watersheds the seasonality factor has improved the mlr models higher r2 values fig 6 fig 7 a interestingly for all sets of watersheds it can be seen that the variance explained by ndvi in low ndvi period models is higher compared to high ndvi period models fig 5 a c this highlights the fact that ndvi has higher impact in the partitioning processes of water and energy in the low ndvi months to improve the mlr models the watersheds are further divided based on their geographical locations rodgers et al 2002 has provided a map of india demarcated in 10 classes having distinctive bio geographical attributes in the study the 768 watersheds are grouped to six classes as shown in fig 2 a parameter ω would be greatly related to the distribution of biological species and ecosystems in geographical space and thus variance in the model could be narrowed down by classifying the watersheds accordingly the islands category is not considered in the study trans himalaya and the himalaya regions are considered as one class similarly indian desert and semi arid regions are categorised as one along with the deccan peninsula and coasts as one under the name deccan peninsula fig 2 a table 4 shows the coefficients and r2 of the models developed based on the bio geographic classification acronyms have been given to each class as mentioned in the table it also displays percentage variance explained by each parameter considering only the models developed at mean annual time scale it can be perceived from the table that the value of explained variance has increased in all the cases compared to the 36 of combined mean annual model for india although the r2 values are still low except the model for wg r2 0 775 fig 7 the main variable that explained highest variance in ω at every spatial scale of watersheds is latitude ndvi has the highest explained variance value in 2 cases i e tm and ds similar trend is observed with intra annual models having higher r2 compared to the corresponding intra annual models for combined watershed datasets except the model for dp high ndvi period case fig 7 seasonality factor has improved the models except the two cases i e tm high ndvi and dp high ndvi fig 7 b similar to earlier occasions latitude has explained significant variance in ω compared to other surface variables this proves the strong relation of lateral imbalance in net radiation of earth with the partitioning process of precipitation at mean annual scale catchment parameter ω has been calibrated with observed precipitation datasets it is evident from the budyko hypothesis that with increase in precipitation discharge increases that lessens the ω values fu s budyko curve therefore variability in precipitation would be reflected in the ω values in addition trends in precipitation are responsible for similar variability trends in ndvi as shown in fig 3 thus introducing seasonality high and low ndvi period in the analysis would bring down the variance in the catchment parameter which may lead to better performance of intra annual models compared to annual models compared to other surface parameters ndvi showed promising influence in the cases of ds gp tm and dp mainly in the low ndvi period months fig 5 in addition ndvi has higher influence in hydrological processes in the low ndvi months compared to high ndvi period for all the classes except tm class similar to the previous cases it can be observed from fig 3 that the high ndvi month period includes the entire range of highest and lowest values of precipitation due to the time lag of precipitation and ndvi values thus this non uniformity in precipitation brings heterogeneity high variance in ω values in the high ndvi period that may be the reason of poor performance of ndvi in explaining variance in catchment characteristics values in high ndvi period models this shows the importance of decomposing the models to intra annual time scale to effectively capture the role of vegetation on the hydrological processes at watershed scale the plots of observed ω and estimated ω for all the models are shown in fig 8 4 3 2 ann and rvm models in the present study two machine learning techniques namely ann and rvm have been incorporated to develop models to better estimate ω in fu s budyko equation for india at all temporal scales both mean annual and intra annual time scale note that the techniques have been applied on the combined set of watersheds 25 river basins and 768 watersheds as per the objectives of the study fig 9 display the training testing and validation results of the ann technique with the statistical parameters r2 se standard error to check the precision of the simulations since during the analysis the training datasets are used to calibrate the model and validation datasets are kept untouched during the training sessions as the models are tested on them it is better to compare the validation results for evaluation of performances of the models the low ndvi period ann model has performed better than the other models with highest r2 values r2 0 77 although se is lowest for mean annual ann model se 0 02 fig 9 thus positive influence of seasonality has been observed in the low ndvi case the ann models have performed well compared to the mlr models for combined watersheds at all time scales as evident from the r2 and se values of the plots in the case of rvm models the normalised values of observed and simulated ω are shown as scatter plots as displayed in fig 10 the low ndvi model has explained variance in ω values better like in the previous cases the low ndvi period model has performed better than the other two models with r2 and se values of 0 77 and 0 04 respectively like the ann models rvm models are superior to the mlr models in effective estimation of ω comparing the two machine learning techniques it is found that ann performed better in the cases of mean annual and high ndvi period models with same r2 values for low ndvi period although there is not much difference in the statistical parameters of the two in addition supporting information table s1 displays the results of the trained models on the six bio geographical classes it can be perceived that the machine learning techniques have better estimated the watershed parameter except for the cases of desert and semi arid ds and trans himalaya and himalaya tm when compared with mlr models therefore from the study it is observed that machine learning techniques have higher ability than regression methods in understanding the complexity involved in interaction of precipitation with land surface attributes 5 discussions the present study is motivated by the believe that the previous models developed at a global scale using the budyko framework would not be able to accurately estimate the watershed parameter in indian context because of the selection of highly dispersed watersheds across the globe thus in this section we would compare the results from ann and rvm models with the results obtained after implementing the mlr and ann models provided by xu et al 2013 one of the major purposes of the study was to develop a single model for whole india that incorporates an amalgamation of small and large watersheds therefore the models developed using machine learning techniques are applied on all the watersheds as a whole thus not considering the bio geographical classes separately however assessing each of the bio geographical classes separate trained models would certainly provide better estimations as the variance would be lessened in spite of that the results would not vary significantly with the present outcomes of the trained models as shown in table 5 for a single class western ghats that showed highest r2 value for the combined watersheds trained models supporting information table s1 fig 11 shows the estimation of ω with the previous models it is clearly seen that the previous budyko based models have not predicted the watershed parameter well the r2 values are extremely low when applied to the combined set of watershed datasets all watersheds for mean annual time scale mlrx r2 3e 05 nnx r2 5e 04 fig 11 the subscript x denotes the models given by xu et al 2013 moreover one peculiarity has been observed in the results of mlrx model surprisingly it is seen that a few estimated ω values have gone below the zero horizontal line negative values fig 11 a it is not possible for a watershed to bear a negative value of ω the parameter ω is an integration s constant and its values ranges between 0 and yang et al 2007 thus it is evident that the previous models are not reliable for indian context it is perceptible that for a model to evaluate the physics of hydrological processes that is very sensitive to the surface and topographical features when it is trained using input datasets demonstrating a particular spatial domain then testing and predicting parameters on other spatially varying domains seems unfeasible and inappropriate these kinds of estimation models may be implemented in areas that share similar ecosystem structures for example areas having alike ecological properties comprising of phenology stomatal conductance that gets influenced by moisture availability etc ewers et al 2007 grant et al 2009 and similar geographical features that has high chances of displaying similar partitioning characteristics of water and energy from the comparison of models the study shows confidence in the implementation of the newly developed models for indian context as stated above the issue of inaccurate estimation of ω using the previous budyko based model seems to be true for other countries also during the incorporation of machine learning techniques we obtained the best fit models for all three cases net high ndvi and low ndvi for ann and rvm in order to further analyse the sensitivity of the models with respect to data size a sensitivity analysis for the best fit model i e low ndvi period with two more cases i e 60 training 20 testing and 20 validation and 80 training 10 testing and 10 validation is performed it is observed from table 6 that 70 training 15 testing and 15 validation is the best suitable partition highest r2 and lowest rmse values for both the models in validation moreover it can be seen that for the case of ann model 14 3 change in training set and 33 3 change in both testing and validation set brings about 4 6 12 5 change for training 4 5 66 7 change for testing and 14 3 75 change for validation in r2 and rmse values respectively for the same percentages of changes in the three sets for the rvm model 6 02 33 33 change in training 16 5 100 change in testing and 6 5 25 change in validation occurred for r2 and rmse values respectively in the study the watersheds are separated based on their bio geographical characteristics into six classes bio geographical attributes take into account the impression of dispersion of biotic interactions within ecosystems across the geographical grades of latitudes longitudes elevations etc these factors would play promising roles in determining the hydrological behaviours of catchments eventually the individual models of these six classes have performed better in estimating the basin parameter ω compared to models with combined watershed datasets classification of watersheds is very crucial as it is hypothesized that the watersheds in the same class would function in a similar manner hydrologically rao and srinivas 2008 have documented an assemblage of clustering techniques namely hybrid clustering fuzzy clustering and self organizing feature maps sofms to obtain a group of watersheds with similar flood generating mechanisms for flood frequency analysis ffa these groups are termed as homogeneous regions and the process of forming the regions is called regionalization the basic idea behind the clustering process is to look for homogeneity in watershed attributes like topographical characteristics soil cover characteristics lulc geographical locations meteorological characteristics etc however it is sometimes appreciated to not classify watersheds based on physical geographic boundaries geomorphology biogeography climatology meteorology etc as this may not guarantee uniformity in hydrology rao and srinivas 2008 therefore more researches can be carried out with classification of watersheds on these attributes excluding the climatic parameters using various clustering algorithms to assess their impact on catchment hydrology estimating ω with homogeneous regions or groups of watersheds classified using the clustering analysis methods may improve the models based on combined watershed datasets similar to the performance of present models for six bio geographical classes as this would minimize the variance in the partitioning processes to be explained the estimation of watershed parameter is done taking variables that signify watersheds characteristics like soil moisture vegetation cover topographical features etc and thus have ignored climatic variables like precipitation temperature etc the impacts of meteorological parameters have already been considered in the analysis while using the budyko framework xu et al 2013 moreover it is reasonable to develop models with parameters that directly represent the inherent watersheds characteristics these watersheds characteristics mainly the surface attributes are highly sensitive to anthropogenic activities human interactions like surface and subsurface withdrawals construction of hydraulic structures alter the dynamics of hydrology it is important for this kind of studies to consider these anthropogenic factors to maintain the analysis close to the natural flow conditions of the catchments their impacts bring deviations in the hydrological responses away from the budyko curve that is explained by the catchment parameter therefore it is apparent that watershed parameter ω would change and never be constant the present study is conducted taking the mean annual average values of the parameters in order to be consistent with the mean annual water balance of budyko hypothesis therefore the models estimate the predominant attributes of the partitioning processes there is a need of new simple and dynamic models that would embrace the non stationarity characteristics of ω in addition human errors in collections of datasets may add more uncertainty in the study 6 conclusion acquiring information on inherent characteristics of a watershed is of great prominence as it explains the dynamics of water flux at the surface the importance of requirement of evidences of watershed attributes grows even more for ungauged watersheds kim and kaluarachchi 2008 the present study has emphasised on the development of regional models to predict ω in fu s budyko based equation which would significantly help in determining the partitioning of water and energy at watershed scale evaluating the results with previously developed global models based on budyko framework shows the ability of the present models to appropriately capture the roles of vegetation soil characteristics topological features etc on defining the hydrological mechanisms moreover separating the watersheds based on bio geographic classification has further enhanced the explanatory capacity of the variables monsoonal precipitation provides the water needed for growth of vegetation and thus changes in precipitation patterns would be reflected in the ndvi values the study has demonstrated the importance of intra annual variation of ndvi on eco hydrologic processes by showing that ndvi had higher capability in low ndvi months compared to high ndvi months in explaining the variance in observed datasets updated land surface models for example vic variable infiltration capacity etc can be implemented to further investigate the performance and genuineness of the models in explaining the hydrological processes under changing environments the study encourages the development of more regional based models with modest techniques like budyko hypothesis to appropriately encapsulate the partitioning processes within acceptable variability range

6227,an abrupt change is an important manifestation of hydroclimatic variability accurate detection of change points is a critical issue in hydroclimatic and climate change studies in the article we evaluated the performances of 12 methods including both parametric and non parametric for detecting change points in hydroclimatic time series by considering the influences of eight major factors different methods exhibited different efficiencies and eight of the methods performed better which are recommended for application furthermore the mean values of series and locations of change points were found to have little influence on the detection of change points however for a time series with smaller variance but bigger skewness and larger difference in the mean values before and after the change point the abrupt changes can be more easily and accurately detected detection of change points in shorter series would have larger uncertainty based on the monte carlo experiments the efficiency of each method was quantified and its capability was quantitatively clarified detection of abrupt changes in precipitation over southwest china showed that the indian monsoon had a dominant influence on precipitation in the regions south of 30 n and west of 110 e since 2007 the indian monsoon has maintained a weakening pattern causing a decrease in precipitation on the yunnan guizhou plateau which is one of the main causes of frequently occurring droughts results of this study can be a useful reference for choosing a method to detect change points in hydroclimate time series and

hydrological analysis and design are fundamental in water resources engineering practice favre et al 2004 raghunath 2006 kao and govindaraju 2007 climatic and hydrological processes are usually assumed stationary and observed hydroclimatic data are generally assumed to satisfy the consistency condition beighley and moglen 2003 renard and lang 2007 sang et al 2010 therefore many methods of hydrological analysis and design are based on the stationary and consistency assumptions xu and singh 2004 however the hydroclimatic system has been exhibiting significant variability over recent decades perhaps due to the impacts of global change allen et al 2002 trenberth et al 2014 in particular streamflow regimes in many basins worldwide have been changing because of the profound influence of human activities including water infrastructures channel modifications drainage works as well as land use and cover changes milly et al 2008 sang and yang 2017 statistically probability distributions of hydroclimatic data and their parameters are changing lópez and francés 2013 cheng et al 2014 how to detect the changed signals in the hydroclimatic system is of great socioeconomic significance diffenbaugh et al 2008 ipcc 2013 and remains a challenge an abrupt change is a phenomenon frequently encountered in hydroclimate studies it usually presents some physical process that causes an rapid switch or change from one mode of behavior to another thorne et al 2005 as an important manifestation of hydroclimatic variability for it intuitively reflects the changed signals in

water retaining constructions zhang et al 2014 tongal et al 2017 stosic et al 2016 there are many methods for detecting abrupt change points in hydroclimatic time series these methods with different mathematical hypotheses and scopes of application can be divided into two types parametric and non parametric tests kendall et al 1999 when using parametric tests such as moving t test welch 1947 and moving f test jackson et al 2016 a proper probability distribution should be preset and its statistical parameters should be estimated from observed data geisser and johnson 2006 non parametric tests such as mann kendall test kisi and ay 2014 and pettitt test pettitt 1979 need not to postulate any probability distribution and thus perform better compared with parametric tests all methods for the detection of change points in time series have advantages and disadvantages lloyd et al 2014 jeon et al 2016 turner et al 2016 and they may not suffice to meet practical needs for example the moving average method is suitable for detecting the change point at around the middle of a time series but performs poorly for the change point that is close to either of the two endpoints nigro et al 2014 the mann kendall test is commonly used for detecting change points but would be unreliable when there are several change points in a time series gocic and trajkovic 2013 the rescaled range analysis method mainly depends on the difference between a time series before the change point and that after the change point mandelbrot and wallis 1969 generally change points detected by a method are often not as reliable as expected and results vary with the methods used hence the reliability of detected abrupt changes in a hydroclimatic time series may be suspect which may lead to an unreasonable evaluation of global change impacts and biased hydrological design values however efficiency and applicability of different methods for detecting change points are not clearly clarified and how to accurately detect change points in a hydroclimatic time series still remains a challenge the objective of this study therefore is to evaluate the efficiencies of the twelve methods that are used widely for the detection of change points aiming at providing guidelines for choosing a proper method to that end the capabilities of these methods are first clarified through monte carlo experiments where the influences of eight factors are considered after that these methods are used to detect the variability and abrupt changes of annual precipitation in southwest china and their relationship with the climatic variability is investigated the conclusions are given finally 2 methods for detection of change points twelve methods that are used widely for the detection of change points were considered here with the aim to compare their performances and improve the accuracy of detection results these methods included moving f test moving t test lee heghinian bayesian method lee and heghinian 1977 ordered clustering method rescaled range analysis method brown forsythe test brown and forsythe 1974 moving rank sum test moving runs test optimal dimidiate partitioning method mann kendall test bayesian analysis method perreault et al 2000a b and pettitt test their abbreviations and applicable conditions are briefly listed in table 1 3 comparison of different methods 3 1 factors influencing detection of change point in order to quantitatively evaluate the performances of different methods the factors which influence the detection of change points in hydroclimatic time series should be first specified considering a general situation of hydrological variability for a time series xt t 1 2 nt with a length of nt it is assumed that there is one abrupt change at an unknown time point n 1 n 1 nt which is to be estimated by using the twelve methods the sub series before and after the change point n 1 is denoted as x 1 and x 2 fig 1 which follow a certain probability distribution 1 x 1 pdf ex cv cs x 2 pdf ex cv 2 cs 2 where pdf means the probability density function ex ex cv cv cs cs are the mean value coefficient of variation and coefficient of skewness of the series x 1 x 2 from eq 1 it is seen that eight factors would influence the detection of change point at n 1 that is the length n 1 of x 1 length nt n 1 of x 2 ex cv cs ex cv and cs to more clearly describe the difference between x 1 and x 2 some factors can be transformed to 2 θ 1 e x e x e x θ 2 c v c v c v θ 3 c s c s c s where θ 1 describes the relative difference between ex and ex θ 2 describes the relative difference between cv and cv and θ 3 describes the relative difference between cs and cs the eight new factors are then denoted as nt n 1 nt ex cv cs θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 and their influences on the detection of a change point can be more conveniently evaluated 3 2 design of mc experiments for investigating the influences of eight factors monte carlo mc experiments were done to investigate the influences of the above eight factors on the performances of 12 methods given in table 1 the specific steps are described as follows 1 set a group of values for parameter nt n 1 nt ex cv cs θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 and generate synthetic series with the total number of n n 10 000 here each synthetic series includes the same change point 2 use the ith i 1 2 12 method in table 1 to detect the change point in the jth j 1 2 10 000 synthetic series and evaluate the efficiency rij of the result using the following equation 3 r ij 1 n ij n 1 n t δ 1 0 n ij n 1 n t δ 1 i 1 2 12 j 1 2 10000 where n 1 is the change point preset and nij is the change point in the jth synthetic series detected by the ith method nt is the length of synthetic series and δ 1 is a threshold used to quantify the difference between n 1 and nij a method succeeds if the estimation nij is close to the true point n 1 with the criterion of nij n 1 n 1 δ 1 here δ 1 was set as 0 01 for the mc experiments 3 the efficiency of each method was described as ci i 1 2 12 4 c i 1 n j 1 n r ij 100 5 s i 2 1 n j 1 n r ij c i 2 where si 2 is the variance of the rij result and was used to describe its uncertainty 4 reset the kth group of values for eight parameters in step 1 and repeat the steps 1 3 to investigate the variation of methods efficiency with parameter values 3 3 influence of each factor on detection of change point through the mc experiments explained above the influences of eight factors nt n 1 nt ex cv cs θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 on the efficiency of the 12 methods were analyzed as discussed below 1 influence of nt here the pearson iii p iii probability distribution as applied commonly in hydrological design in china was used to generate the synthetic series the values of six parameters were set as ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the position of change point was set at the middle of synthetic series that is n 1 n t 0 5 then the data length i e parameter nt was increased from 50 to 500 with a length interval of 50 to investigate its influence on the efficiency of each method fig 2 shows performances of these methods the influence of data length nt on these methods is obviously different among them mft rst and odp performed poorly for any length with an efficiency smaller than 10 the results of mkt were also not as good as expected no matter the length with an efficiency smaller than 30 comparatively the other eight methods mtt lhb ocm bft mrs mrt bys and pet performed much better and pet performed the best with an efficiency bigger than 40 it is thus seen that the data length has a big influence on the detection of a change point the efficiency of the eight methods with satisfactory performance can be divided into three parts corresponding to the data length 200 200 400 and 400 respectively their efficiency was similar in each part but increased with the data length the efficiency was higher than 70 for the data length bigger than 400 note that the noncontinuous variation of methods efficiency is due to the threshold δ 1 0 01 preset interestingly it was found that the efficiency of each method for a smaller length had a bigger uncertainty described by the height of box in fig 2 and the change point in a time series with a longer length can be more easily detected considering that the result for a certain data length had similar uncertainty for each method it was not considered again in the following discussion the lengths of observed hydroclimatic time series are usually smaller than 100 years and the results with shorter data lengths have worse efficiencies in fig 2 thus the length of synthetic series was set as 100 to investigate the influence of other seven factors 2 influence of n 1 nt the parameters were set as nt 100 ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and parameter n 1 nt was valued as 1 5 1 4 2 5 1 2 2 3 3 5 4 5 mainly to investigate its influence fig 3 presents the results obtained from different methods which can be divided into four types based on their different efficiencies bft mrs mkt and rst were in the first type and their performances became better when the change point moved from the start point to the endpoint of the series when using pet and mrt in the second type the best results appeared when the change point was in the middle of the series i e n 1 nt 0 5 but the performance of the two methods became worse when the change point moved from the middle to the endpoint especially for mrt the mtt ocm lhb and bys methods belonged to the third type for which the results did not change with the position of change point but were stable for the mft and odp method in the fourth type the results were the worst and far away from the true results with an efficiency 10 3 influence of ex the parameters were set as nt 100 n 1 n t 0 5 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the mean value ex of the sub series before the change point was given different values mainly to investigate its influence on the detection fig 4 indicates that when the mean value increased from 0 to 5000 and other seven parameters were fixed at certain values there were no obvious changes in the results obtained from different methods it was found that the ex parameter had little influence on both the detection of change point and the efficiency of each method and it need not to be considered in practical analysis following the general understanding of hydrological variability it is known that the significance of abrupt change is mainly determined by the degree of relative difference between before and after the change point but should have little relationship with the mean value of the series explaining the reasonableness of the result in fig 4 4 influence of cv the parameters were set as nt 100 n 1 50 ex 1000 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the cv parameter increased from 0 to 1 5 to investigate its influence in fig 5 dramatic changes occur in the results of all methods except for mft rst and opd which kept their inferior performance and had an efficiency smaller than 10 the efficiency of other nine methods mtt lhb ocm bft mrs mrt mkt bys pet similarly declined quickly with the increase of cv value this can be qualitatively explained as follows if a time series shows a large variation that is large cv value the random component would occupy a large ratio in the original series and submerge the abrupt change occurring in the series causing the difficulty in detecting the change point 5 influence of cs the parameters were set as n 1 50 ex 1000 cv 0 5 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the cs parameter increased from 0 5 to 3 0 to investigate its influence in fig 6 the efficiency of the bft pet mrs and mrt methods increased with the increase of cs value comparatively the efficiency of mkt mtt bys lht and ocm kept stable but again they exhibited inferior performance for any cs value it was found that big skew characteristics i e big cs value of a time series would be favorable for the detection of change point which can be explained as follows for a hydrological time series with more skew statistical characteristics that is bigger cs value the values at most of data points are more likely concentrated to its modal value but far from its mean value causing more obvious difference between before and after the change point and the easier detection 6 influence of θ 1 the six parameters were set as n 1 50 ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the θ 1 parameter was increased from 0 to 2 0 to investigate its influence results in fig 7 show that the efficiency of all methods became better with the increase of parameter θ 1 except for rst and odp which kept their inferior performance it is known that parameter θ 1 just reflects the difference of mean values before and after the change point in the original series thus a bigger value of θ 1 indicates a more obvious abrupt change and it would more easily be detected 7 influence of θ 2 the parameters were set as n 1 50 ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 3 0 and the θ 2 parameter was increased from 0 to 1 5 to investigate its influence in fig 8 the results obtained from the 12 methods showed different changes to be specific the result of mft increased sharply but that of mkt mrs bft ocm lhb mtt bys and pet decreased interestingly the efficiency of mrt fell first in the θ 2 range of 0 0 5 and then increased afterwards the results of rst and opd were as small as 0 and did not change for any θ 2 value the increasing efficiency of mft with θ 2 was due to its own basic idea that is mft uses the f test to evaluate the significance between two variances bigger θ 2 value means bigger difference in the variance of the two sub series between before and after the change point which would more easily be detected by mft besides the varying efficiency of mrt was mainly due to the first increase and then decrease in the number of runs when considering the p iii pdf 8 influence of θ 3 the parameters were set as n 1 50 ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 and parameter θ 3 was increased from 0 to 2 to investigate its influence in fig 9 the efficiency of mft rst and ocm was at low level and did not change with the increase of parameter θ 3 the efficiency of mkt just increased slightly comparatively the efficiency of other eight methods increased obviously with parameter θ 3 the result here was similar to that in fig 6 and the reason was also closely related to the modal value of series as explained above 3 4 discussion of results overall the above results of mc experiments indicated that the efficiency of the twelve methods was mainly influenced by the parameters θ 1 cv and θ 2 when a time series had bigger θ 1 but smaller cv and θ 2 its change point would more easily be detected the cs and θ 3 parameters also had an influence on the results but the degree of influence was weaker than that of the former three factors the change point in a time series with bigger cs and θ 3 would more easily be detected the ex and n 1 nt parameters had little influence on the results the n 1 parameter had little influence on the efficiency of these methods but the results would have big uncertainty when parameter n 1 had smaller values as a result these factors should be carefully considered when choosing a proper method to detect change points in a hydroclimatic time series besides results also indicated different efficiencies of the 12 methods the mft rst mkt and odp methods performed poorly although the mft method can perform slightly better facing larger values of parameter θ 2 comparatively the efficiencies of mtt lhb ocm bft mrs mrt bys and pet were better and thus they are recommended for the detection of change point the efficiency of each method estimated in this study in table 1 can be a useful reference for the choice of a method for the detection of change points in hydroclimatic time series however the detection of change points in hydrological time series is much more complex and difficult than that in synthetic series because the influencing factors would mutually influence each other simultaneously in practice not only the efficiency of these methods but also their different performances under various practical situations should be considered thus these methods are further tested using a case study of observed dataset in the next section 4 abrupt changes in precipitation in southwest china southwest china covering the southeast tibetan plateau is one of the regions that is sensitive to global climate change yao et al 2012 sang et al 2013 feng et al 2014 especially the southeast tibetan plateau is well known as the asian water tower where many major asian rivers including the yellow river yangtze river brahmaputra river mekong river and others originate from lutz et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2013 they provide a vital water source for hundreds of millions of people in china and southeast asia immerzeel et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 over recent years global climate change has caused a change in the streamflow regimes of these major rivers zhang et al 2013 and caused frequent occurrences of drought events in southwest china knowledge about the variability of hydrological process and its response to the changing climate is thus critical for drought mitigation and sustainable water resources management in the region following the water vapor fluxes sang et al 2016 it is known that the precipitation process in southwest china is mainly controlled by the indian summer monsoon ism ism brings significant amounts of warm and wet air currents from the indian ocean and comes to southwest china through the bay of bengal recent studies have indicated the weakening of indian monsoon wu 2005 thompson et al 2006 it can directly influence the precipitation variability in southwest china and would directly cause severe drought disasters and water resources shortages feng et al 2014 ji et al 2015 tan et al 2017 however it is still not clear when the ism started its weakening pattern and what influence it has on the precipitation variability and its spatial distribution in southwest china accurate detection and attribution of abrupt changes in the precipitation in southwest china is therefore a fundamental issue to clarify it we used the twelve methods to detect abrupt changes in both the time series of ism and precipitation in southwest china and compared the results for investigating the physical causes for achieving the goal we used the annual precipitation data measured at 144 meteorological stations in southwest china fig 11 and detected their change points the ism index used here is defined based on the convection near the bay of bengal whose intensive activity is associated with two of the major precipitation maxima in the south asian region wang and fan 1999 including southwest china all the precipitation and ism data have the same observation period from 1961 to 2013 the change point detected in the ism time series is shown in table 2 among all the results the change point of 2007 was detected by seven methods mtt lhb ocm rst bft odp bys the change points obtained from mft mrt mrs and pet were 2008 or 2006 just being close to 2007 as a result it was thought that the abrupt change in the ism process occurred in 2007 since then the indian monsoon has a much smaller amplitude the mean values of the ism time series before and after 2007 were 0 160 and 0 964 respectively fig 10 visually presents that the ism time series kept stable in 1961 2007 but then obviously decreased indicating its reliability the same practice was applied to the annual precipitation series results in fig 11 indicate that among all the 144 precipitation time series the precipitation time series measured at 48 stations in the central area i e the yunnan guizhou plateau within 100 111 e and 22 30 n of southwest china showed a decreasing pattern with the abrupt decrease occurring around 2002 2008 being consistent with the abrupt decrease in 2007 in the ism the local difference of results can be due to the complex topography geography and hydroclimate conditions in the area besides the precipitation time series measured at eight stations at the boundary of southwest china did not indicate significant abrupt changes at 5 significance level it is thus thought that although the boundary of southwest china is geographically closer to the bay of bengal the weakening indian monsoon has little influence on the precipitation in the local area but the effect of weakening strengthens when moving inland however the precipitation time series measured north of 30 n on the whole showed no abrupt changes or even abrupt increase differing from the abrupt decrease of precipitation south of 30 n a previous study yao et al 2013 confirmed three distinct domains of climate condition in the tibetan plateau associated with the influence of westerlies north of 35 n indian monsoon south of 30 n and transition in between 30 n and 35 n respectively the results of spatial pattern of abrupt changes in annual precipitation were consistent with previous studies hence two important findings can be obtained here the first is that the indian monsoon directly controls the precipitation variability in the regions south of 30 n and west of 110 e in southwest china but its effect is weak in the local area of boundary the other is that the weakening pattern of the indian monsoon over the recent decade caused the decrease in precipitation on the yunnan guizhou plateau in southwest china which can be main reason for frequent occurrences of droughts 5 conclusions as an important complement for the detection and attribution of hydroclimatic variability accurate detection of abrupt changes in hydroclimatic time series is critical for understanding the effects of climate change and human activities although there have been many methods for meeting the needs they do not suffice to meet practical needs due to limited applications in this study we compared the performances of 12 methods that are used widely for the detection of change points through monte carlo experiments we found that the mft rst mkt and odp methods had inferior performance comparatively the mtt lhb ocm bft mrs mrt bys and pet methods performed better and thus they are recommended for the detection of change points we also found that for those time series which have smaller variance cv and θ 2 in figs 5 and 8 but bigger difference in mean values before and after the change point θ 1 in fig 7 the abrupt changes can be more easily and accurately detected for the time series with big skew characteristics cs and θ 3 in figs 6 and 9 the abrupt changes can also be easily and accurately detected however the mean values ex in fig 4 of time series and the location n 1 nt in fig 3 in the series have little influence on the detection of change points for the time series with shorter length n 1 in fig 2 the detection results of change points may have bigger uncertainty and thus should be carefully considered considering performances of these methods and the influences of the above factors we quantified the efficiency of each method table 1 and emphasize the accuracy and reliability of the change points from the method with high efficiency we then used these methods to detect abrupt changes in precipitation in southwest china and further investigated its physical connection to the weakening indian monsoon results indicate that the indian monsoon directly controls the precipitation variability in the regions south of 30 n and west of 110 e in southwest china but its effect is weak in the local area of boundary fig 11 since 2007 the indian monsoon has maintained its weakening pattern fig 10 and causes the decrease in precipitation on the yunnan guizhou plateau which may be the main reason for the frequent occurrence of droughts if the indian monsoon keeps the weakening effect the droughts and water resources shortages in southwest china would be inevitably aggravated causing great difficulty to the socioeconomic development in local and surrounding regions therefore more proactive and effective adaptation strategies should be implemented to handle the unfavorable situation finally it should be pointed out that characteristics of observed hydroclimatic data are complex and the detection of change points in hydroclimatic time series is challenging both the complex variability of hydroclimatic process and the efficiencies of different methods should be carefully considered together especially the physical causes of the abrupt changes in hydroclimatic process should be explored based on which the reliable results of abrupt change in time series

6227,an abrupt change is an important manifestation of hydroclimatic variability accurate detection of change points is a critical issue in hydroclimatic and climate change studies in the article we evaluated the performances of 12 methods including both parametric and non parametric for detecting change points in hydroclimatic time series by considering the influences of eight major factors different methods exhibited different efficiencies and eight of the methods performed better which are recommended for application furthermore the mean values of series and locations of change points were found to have little influence on the detection of change points however for a time series with smaller variance but bigger skewness and larger difference in the mean values before and after the change point the abrupt changes can be more easily and accurately detected detection of change points in shorter series would have larger uncertainty based on the monte carlo experiments the efficiency of each method was quantified and its capability was quantitatively clarified detection of abrupt changes in precipitation over southwest china showed that the indian monsoon had a dominant

change point in the jth j 1 2 10 000 synthetic series and evaluate the efficiency rij of the result using the following equation 3 r ij 1 n ij n 1 n t δ 1 0 n ij n 1 n t δ 1 i 1 2 12 j 1 2 10000 where n 1 is the change point preset and nij is the change point in the jth synthetic series detected by the ith method nt is the length of synthetic series and δ 1 is a threshold used to quantify the difference between n 1 and nij a method succeeds if the estimation nij is close to the true point n 1 with the criterion of nij n 1 n 1 δ 1 here δ 1 was set as 0 01 for the mc experiments 3 the efficiency of each method was described as ci i 1 2 12 4 c i 1 n j 1 n r ij 100 5 s i 2 1 n j 1 n r ij c i 2 where si 2 is the variance of the rij result and was used to describe its uncertainty 4 reset the kth group of values for eight parameters in step 1 and repeat the steps 1 3 to investigate the variation of methods efficiency with parameter values 3 3 influence of each factor on detection of change point through the mc experiments explained above the influences of eight factors nt n 1 nt ex cv cs θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 on the efficiency of the 12 methods were analyzed as discussed below 1 influence of nt here the pearson iii p iii probability distribution as applied commonly in hydrological design in china was used to generate the synthetic series the values of six parameters were set as ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the position of change point was set at the middle of synthetic series that is n 1 n t 0 5 then the data length i e parameter nt was increased from 50 to 500 with a length interval of 50 to investigate its influence on the efficiency of each method fig 2 shows performances of these methods the influence of data length nt on these methods is obviously different among them mft rst and odp performed poorly for any length with an efficiency smaller than 10 the results of mkt were also not as good as expected no matter the length with an efficiency smaller than 30 comparatively the other eight methods mtt lhb ocm bft mrs mrt bys and pet performed much better and pet performed the best with an efficiency bigger than 40 it is thus seen that the data length has a big influence on the detection of a change point the efficiency of the eight methods with satisfactory performance can be divided into three parts corresponding to the data length 200 200 400 and 400 respectively their efficiency was similar in each part but increased with the data length the efficiency was higher than 70 for the data length bigger than 400 note that the noncontinuous variation of methods efficiency is due to the threshold δ 1 0 01 preset interestingly it was found that the efficiency of each method for a smaller length had a bigger uncertainty described by the height of box in fig 2 and the change point in a time series with a longer length can be more easily detected considering that the result for a certain data length had similar uncertainty for each method it was not considered again in the following discussion the lengths of observed hydroclimatic time series are usually smaller than 100 years and the results with shorter data lengths have worse efficiencies in fig 2 thus the length of synthetic series was set as 100 to investigate the influence of other seven factors 2 influence of n 1 nt the parameters were set as nt 100 ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and parameter n 1 nt was valued as 1 5 1 4 2 5 1 2 2 3 3 5 4 5 mainly to investigate its influence fig 3 presents the results obtained from different methods which can be divided into four types based on their different efficiencies bft mrs mkt and rst were in the first type and their performances became better when the change point moved from the start point to the endpoint of the series when using pet and mrt in the second type the best results appeared when the change point was in the middle of the series i e n 1 nt 0 5 but the performance of the two methods became worse when the change point moved from the middle to the endpoint especially for mrt the mtt ocm lhb and bys methods belonged to the third type for which the results did not change with the position of change point but were stable for the mft and odp method in the fourth type the results were the worst and far away from the true results with an efficiency 10 3 influence of ex the parameters were set as nt 100 n 1 n t 0 5 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the mean value ex of the sub series before the change point was given different values mainly to investigate its influence on the detection fig 4 indicates that when the mean value increased from 0 to 5000 and other seven parameters were fixed at certain values there were no obvious changes in the results obtained from different methods it was found that the ex parameter had little influence on both the detection of change point and the efficiency of each method and it need not to be considered in practical analysis following the general understanding of hydrological variability it is known that the significance of abrupt change is mainly determined by the degree of relative difference between before and after the change point but should have little relationship with the mean value of the series explaining the reasonableness of the result in fig 4 4 influence of cv the parameters were set as nt 100 n 1 50 ex 1000 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the cv parameter increased from 0 to 1 5 to investigate its influence in fig 5 dramatic changes occur in the results of all methods except for mft rst and opd which kept their inferior performance and had an efficiency smaller than 10 the efficiency of other nine methods mtt lhb ocm bft mrs mrt mkt bys pet similarly declined quickly with the increase of cv value this can be qualitatively explained as follows if a time series shows a large variation that is large cv value the random component would occupy a large ratio in the original series and submerge the abrupt change occurring in the series causing the difficulty in detecting the change point 5 influence of cs the parameters were set as n 1 50 ex 1000 cv 0 5 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the cs parameter increased from 0 5 to 3 0 to investigate its influence in fig 6 the efficiency of the bft pet mrs and mrt methods increased with the increase of cs value comparatively the efficiency of mkt mtt bys lht and ocm kept stable but again they exhibited inferior performance for any cs value it was found that big skew characteristics i e big cs value of a time series would be favorable for the detection of change point which can be explained as follows for a hydrological time series with more skew statistical characteristics that is bigger cs value the values at most of data points are more likely concentrated to its modal value but far from its mean value causing more obvious difference between before and after the change point and the easier detection 6 influence of θ 1 the six parameters were set as n 1 50 ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 2 0 θ 3 0 and the θ 1 parameter was increased from 0 to 2 0 to investigate its influence results in fig 7 show that the efficiency of all methods became better with the increase of parameter θ 1 except for rst and odp which kept their inferior performance it is known that parameter θ 1 just reflects the difference of mean values before and after the change point in the original series thus a bigger value of θ 1 indicates a more obvious abrupt change and it would more easily be detected 7 influence of θ 2 the parameters were set as n 1 50 ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 3 0 and the θ 2 parameter was increased from 0 to 1 5 to investigate its influence in fig 8 the results obtained from the 12 methods showed different changes to be specific the result of mft increased sharply but that of mkt mrs bft ocm lhb mtt bys and pet decreased interestingly the efficiency of mrt fell first in the θ 2 range of 0 0 5 and then increased afterwards the results of rst and opd were as small as 0 and did not change for any θ 2 value the increasing efficiency of mft with θ 2 was due to its own basic idea that is mft uses the f test to evaluate the significance between two variances bigger θ 2 value means bigger difference in the variance of the two sub series between before and after the change point which would more easily be detected by mft besides the varying efficiency of mrt was mainly due to the first increase and then decrease in the number of runs when considering the p iii pdf 8 influence of θ 3 the parameters were set as n 1 50 ex 1000 cv 0 5 cs 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 0 and parameter θ 3 was increased from 0 to 2 to investigate its influence in fig 9 the efficiency of mft rst and ocm was at low level and did not change with the increase of parameter θ 3 the efficiency of mkt just increased slightly comparatively the efficiency of other eight methods increased obviously with parameter θ 3 the result here was similar to that in fig 6 and the reason was also closely related to the modal value of series as explained above 3 4 discussion of results overall the above results of mc experiments indicated that the efficiency of the twelve methods was mainly influenced by the parameters θ 1 cv and θ 2 when a time series had bigger θ 1 but smaller cv and θ 2 its change point would more easily be detected the cs and θ 3 parameters also had an influence on the results but the degree of influence was weaker than that of the former three factors the change point in a time series with bigger cs and θ 3 would more easily be detected the ex and n 1 nt parameters had little influence on the results the n 1 parameter had little influence on the efficiency of these methods but the results would have big uncertainty when parameter n 1 had smaller values as a result these factors should be carefully considered when choosing a proper method to detect change points in a hydroclimatic time series besides results also indicated different efficiencies of the 12 methods the mft rst mkt and odp methods performed poorly although the mft method can perform slightly better facing larger values of parameter θ 2 comparatively the efficiencies of mtt lhb ocm bft mrs mrt bys and pet were better and thus they are recommended for the detection of change point the efficiency of each method estimated in this study in table 1 can be a useful reference for the choice of a method for the detection of change points in hydroclimatic time series however the detection of change points in hydrological time series is much more complex and difficult than that in synthetic series because the influencing factors would mutually influence each other simultaneously in practice not only the efficiency of these methods but also their different performances under various practical situations should be considered thus these methods are further tested using a case study of observed dataset in the next section 4 abrupt changes in precipitation in southwest china southwest china covering the southeast tibetan plateau is one of the regions that is sensitive to global climate change yao et al 2012 sang et al 2013 feng et al 2014 especially the southeast tibetan plateau is well known as the asian water tower where many major asian rivers including the yellow river yangtze river brahmaputra river mekong river and others originate from lutz et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2013 they provide a vital water source for hundreds of millions of people in china and southeast asia immerzeel et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 over recent years global climate change has caused a change in the streamflow regimes of these major rivers zhang et al 2013 and caused frequent occurrences of drought events in southwest china knowledge about the variability of hydrological process and its response to the changing climate is thus critical for drought mitigation and sustainable water resources management in the region following the water vapor fluxes sang et al 2016 it is known that the precipitation process in southwest china is mainly controlled by the indian summer monsoon ism ism brings significant amounts of warm and wet air currents from the indian ocean and comes to southwest china through the bay of bengal recent studies have indicated the weakening of indian monsoon wu 2005 thompson et al 2006 it can directly influence the precipitation variability in southwest china and would directly cause severe drought disasters and water resources shortages feng et al 2014 ji et al 2015 tan et al 2017 however it is still not clear when the ism started its weakening pattern and what influence it has on the precipitation variability and its spatial distribution in southwest china accurate detection and attribution of abrupt changes in the precipitation in southwest china is therefore a fundamental issue to clarify it we used the twelve methods to detect abrupt changes in both the time series of ism and precipitation in southwest china and compared the results for investigating the physical causes for achieving the goal we used the annual precipitation data measured at 144 meteorological stations in southwest china fig 11 and detected their change points the ism index used here is defined based on the convection near the bay of bengal whose intensive activity is associated with two of the major precipitation maxima in the south asian region wang and fan 1999 including southwest china all the precipitation and ism data have the same observation period from 1961 to 2013 the change point detected in the ism time series is shown in table 2 among all the results the change point of 2007 was detected by seven methods mtt lhb ocm rst bft odp bys the change points obtained from mft mrt mrs and pet were 2008 or 2006 just being close to 2007 as a result it was thought that the abrupt change in the ism process occurred in 2007 since then the indian monsoon has a much smaller amplitude the mean values of the ism time series before and after 2007 were 0 160 and 0 964 respectively fig 10 visually presents that the ism time series kept stable in 1961 2007 but then obviously decreased indicating its reliability the same practice was applied to the annual precipitation series results in fig 11 indicate that among all the 144 precipitation time series the precipitation time series measured at 48 stations in the central area i e the yunnan guizhou plateau within 100 111 e and 22 30 n of southwest china showed a decreasing pattern with the abrupt decrease occurring around 2002 2008 being consistent with the abrupt decrease in 2007 in the ism the local difference of results can be due to the complex topography geography and hydroclimate conditions in the area besides the precipitation time series measured at eight stations at the boundary of southwest china did not indicate significant abrupt changes at 5 significance level it is thus thought that although the boundary of southwest china is geographically closer to the bay of bengal the weakening indian monsoon has little influence on the precipitation in the local area but the effect of weakening strengthens when moving inland however the precipitation time series measured north of 30 n on the whole showed no abrupt changes or even abrupt increase differing from the abrupt decrease of precipitation south of 30 n a previous study yao et al 2013 confirmed three distinct domains of climate condition in the tibetan plateau associated with the influence of westerlies north of 35 n indian monsoon south of 30 n and transition in between 30 n and 35 n respectively the results of spatial pattern of abrupt changes in annual precipitation were consistent with previous studies hence two important findings can be obtained here the first is that the indian monsoon directly controls the precipitation variability in the regions south of 30 n and west of 110 e in southwest china but its effect is weak in the local area of boundary the other is that the weakening pattern of the indian monsoon over the recent decade caused the decrease in precipitation on the yunnan guizhou plateau in southwest china which can be main reason for frequent occurrences of droughts 5 conclusions as an important complement for the detection and attribution of hydroclimatic variability accurate detection of abrupt changes in hydroclimatic time series is critical for understanding the effects of climate change and human activities although there have been many methods for meeting the needs they do not suffice to meet practical needs due to limited applications in this study we compared the performances of 12 methods that are used widely for the detection of change points through monte carlo experiments we found that the mft rst mkt and odp methods had inferior performance comparatively the mtt lhb ocm bft mrs mrt bys and pet methods performed better and thus they are recommended for the detection of change points we also found that for those time series which have smaller variance cv and θ 2 in figs 5 and 8 but bigger difference in mean values before and after the change point θ 1 in fig 7 the abrupt changes can be more easily and accurately detected for the time series with big skew characteristics cs and θ 3 in figs 6 and 9 the abrupt changes can also be easily and accurately detected however the mean values ex in fig 4 of time series and the location n 1 nt in fig 3 in the series have little influence on the detection of change points for the time series with shorter length n 1 in fig 2 the detection results of change points may have bigger uncertainty and thus should be carefully considered considering performances of these methods and the influences of the above factors we quantified the efficiency of each method table 1 and emphasize the accuracy and reliability of the change points from the method with high efficiency we then used these methods to detect abrupt changes in precipitation in southwest china and further investigated its physical connection to the weakening indian monsoon results indicate that the indian monsoon directly controls the precipitation variability in the regions south of 30 n and west of 110 e in southwest china but its effect is weak in the local area of boundary fig 11 since 2007 the indian monsoon has maintained its weakening pattern fig 10 and causes the decrease in precipitation on the yunnan guizhou plateau which may be the main reason for the frequent occurrence of droughts if the indian monsoon keeps the weakening effect the droughts and water resources shortages in southwest china would be inevitably aggravated causing great difficulty to the socioeconomic development in local and surrounding regions therefore more proactive and effective adaptation strategies should be implemented to handle the unfavorable situation finally it should be pointed out that characteristics of observed hydroclimatic data are complex and the detection of change points in hydroclimatic time series is challenging both the complex variability of hydroclimatic process and the efficiencies of different methods should be carefully considered together especially the physical causes of the abrupt changes in hydroclimatic process should be explored based on which the reliable results of abrupt change in time series

6228,agricultural conservation practices or agricultural best management practices bmps can reduce nutrient loading and help address harmful algal blooms habs habs in the western basin of lake erie which are largely caused by phosphorus losses from the maumee river watershed are critical in the recent years in this study a new bmp cost tool was developed then the soil and water assessment tool swat and the new bmp cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost effectiveness of bmps in an agricultural catchment of the maumee river watershed with various scenarios the scenarios included individual bmps applied in 100 of suitable areas individual bmps targeting dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and total phosphorus tp critical areas and bmps implemented in series in addition a cost effective approach for the selections and placements of bmps in agricultural watersheds was developed as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds the cost effective approach applied bmps based on cost effectiveness rankings starting from the most cost effective one results showed that 1 bmps implemented in series which reduced pollutant loads more than individual bmps were not as cost effective as some individual bmps 2 among all scenarios filter strips targeting drp tp critical areas were the most cost effective in reducing yearly spring drp tp losses 3 to obtain the watershed management plan goal of reducing march july drp tp losses by 40 implementing bmps one by one in critical areas based on the cost

agricultural areas scavia et al 2016b therefore strategies for implementing bmps to reduce nutrient losses from agricultural areas in the maumee river watershed need to be explored a few studies have explored the efficiencies of implementing agricultural bmps in reducing pollutant loadings in the entire area or in subbasins of the maumee river watershed kalcic et al 2016 scavia et al 2016b wallace 2016 wallace et al 2017a however the cost efficiencies of bmps were not studied due to limited budgets of implementation projects the cost effectiveness of agricultural bmps determined by the cost and effectiveness of the practice needs to be explored in the maumee river watershed considering the number type location and combination of bmps an approach to accurately calculate the cost of bmps is needed further an approach for the selection and placement of bmps in agricultural watersheds based on cost effectiveness of bmp scenarios is needed to identify cost efficient agricultural bmp strategies as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds a number of subbasins of the st joseph river a tributary of the maumee river are monitored in dekalb county indiana by the united states department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars since 2002 of these sites the axl subbasin also called matson ditch huc12 041000030603 was selected to start the work before expanding results to the entire maumee river watershed the specific objectives of this study were to 1 develop a bmp cost tool that accurately

percent changes from original values while other parameters were calibrated by assigning absolute values a web version of load estimator loadest tool https engineering purdue edu mapserve loadest was used to calculate monthly pollutant loads based on biweekly data collected coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and percent bias pbias were calculated to assess swat model performance the national agricultural statistics service nass 2010 land use data were used to set up the swat model for calibration 2006 2010 and validation 2011 2014 of monthly streamflow drp tp tkn and no2 n no3 n in the axl watershed streamflow was calibrated and validated for each month of a year pollutants were not calibrated and validated from december to march due to limited data availability five years 2001 2005 of warm up period for swat were used an optimization tool was developed and used to calibrate and validate the swat model a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam method with discrete parameter intervals vrugt and robinson 2007 was used in the optimization tool the above statistics r2 nse and pbias were set as the objective functions to calibrate streamflow and pollutants simultaneously using a multi objective approach population size of 100 and generation size of 100 were used to reach desired results to ensure that parameters take realistic values the upper and lower boundaries of parameters were set carefully based on previous literature further care was taken so calibrated parameters would fall within the boundaries and exclude the values of upper lower boundaries 3 4 excess phosphorus loading and critical areas excess phosphorus loading areas in the axl watershed were identified using swat setup with nass 2016 land use data based on the goal of 40 spring march july tp drp loading reductions compared to 2008 levels in the maumee river watershed which would obtain a target spring tp load of 860 tons and drp load of 186 tons great lakes water quality agreement 2015 national science and technology council 2017 scavia et al 2016a the target loads per area of spring tp and drp were 50 53 kg km2 and 10 93 kg km2 respectively based on the size of the entire maumee river watershed any hrus subbasins with spring tp losses 50 53 kg km2 or spring drp losses above 10 93 kg km2 meant that this hru subbasin had excess tp or drp loadings critical areas in axl were identified using nass 2016 land use data to understand where most pollutants originate these were identified as at least 25 of the watershed with the highest values of pollutant load per area per year generated from each hru or subbasin to obtain these results the hrus or subbasins were ranked based on their pollutant load per area per year values from the highest to the lowest then the hrus or subbasins with the greatest values were picked until the total areas of the selected hrus or subbasins comprised at least 25 of the axl watershed

et al 2012 higgins and kim 1981 kalcic et al 2015 since wetlands were represented as subbasin level bmps in swat the locations of the wetlands were not specified in the model and all wetlands were combined to a wetland area for each subbasin treating a fraction of surface runoff from the subbasin wetlands were assumed to be suitable in all areas of the watershed with flow directed to nearby wetlands the sizes of the wetlands were based on the swat parameter wet fr fraction of subbasin drains into wetlands wet nsa normal wetland surface area which was the sum of all the wetlands areas in the subbasin was 1 of the contribution area wet nvol normal water storage in wetlands and wet vol initial water volume in wetlands were calculated based on the 1 m depth of the wetlands and wet nsa

for estimating bmp costs are detailed in section 2 design life of structural bmps was assumed to be 20 years liu et al 2015b liu et al 2016b non structural bmps were simulated for 20 years an interest rate of 4 5 was used the baseline scenario was calibrated validated swat with nass 2016 land use data and 2001 2014 weather data 2001 2005 for model warm up 2006 2014 for model outputs to evaluate bmp impacts simulation scenarios were bmps implemented based on the baseline scenario swat hydrologic response units hrus are areas with unique combinations of land use soil type and slope classes to represent the watershed 529 hrus and 11 subbasins were delineated fig 2 and table 3 show bmp simulation scenarios including individual bmps implemented in 100 of suitable areas s1 s8 individual bmps implemented in hru level drp tp critical areas s9 s20 individual bmps implemented in subbasin level drp tp critical areas s21 s24 and bmps in series s25 s27 all types of bmps implemented in suitable areas drp critical areas or tp critical areas based on the spatial locations of bmps some of the flow treated by one bmp would be treated again by another bmp all scenarios considered suitable areas for implementing bmps grade stabilization structures and wetlands were implemented in subbasin level critical areas since they are represented as subbasin level practices in swat for s1 to s27 the following results were calculated and explored 1 yearly and spring march july bmp effectiveness and 2 yearly and spring bmp cost effectiveness in addition to develop a cost effective approach for the selections and placements of bmps additional scenarios were explored by implementing bmps one by one starting with the most cost effective practice based on spring cost effectiveness values to find cost effective scenarios that would obtain the watershed management plan goal of reducing spring drp and tp by 40 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of model calibration validation excess phosphorus loading areas and critical areas 4 1 1 model calibration validation results fig 3 shows plots of simulated and observed monthly streamflow and pollutants from 2006 to 2014 in the axl watershed results of r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 for streamflow pollutants together with pbias 25 for streamflow and pbias 70 for nitrogen phosphorus were considered good model performance engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 therefore swat had good performance in simulating streamflow r2 0 77 nse 0 77 pbias 3 6 drp r2 0 79 nse 0 64 pbias 46 7 tp r2 0 87 nse 0 69 pbias 3 6 tkn r2 0 78 nse 0 64 pbias 22 2 and nox r2 0 63 nse 0 56 pbias 30 6 the ratio of tile flow depth to precipitation depth was 14 which was similar to other studies in the same watershed boles et al 2015 wallace et al 2017b the web based hydrograph analysis tool what lim et al 2005 was applied to obtain baseflow from streamflow the observed baseflow fraction was 0 57 and the simulated result had a similar value of 0 56 the calibrated parameters took realistic values according to the characteristics of the watershed such as depth to subsurface drains of 1 m boles et al 2015 wallace et al 2017b boles et al 2015 studied tile drainage flow and water quality in the axl watershed and only did calibration for non winter months wallace et al 2018 evaluated the effects of watershed size on swat calibration including axl watershed and flow was calibrated for every month while nitrogen and phosphorus were only calibrated for non winter months in the current study flow was calibrated for each month of the study period phosphorus and nitrogen loadings are highly correlated with flow in this region park and engel 2014 therefore the calibration method suits the needs of this study and the annual simulated results will be realistic 4 1 2 identification of excess phosphorus loading areas and critical areas the spring march july tp 181 02 kg km2 and drp 13 50 kg km2 loads from the axl watershed were greater than the thresholds of 50 53 kg km2 for tp and 10 93 kg km2 for drp indicating excess tp and drp losses fig 4 a shows areas with excess drp or tp loadings in the axl watershed at the hru level 14 4 and 54 8 of the watershed had excess drp and tp loadings respectively at the subbasin level 28 7 and 71 1 of the watershed had excess drp and tp loadings respectively fig 4 b shows critical areas in the axl watershed for the hru and subbasin levels for the hru level the critical areas for drp and tp losses which were 25 3 and 26 3 of the watershed area contributed 66 3 and 82 8 of the corresponding pollutants from the watershed respectively at the subbasin level the critical areas for drp and tp losses which were 25 9 and 28 2 of the watershed area contributed 57 3 and 68 4 of the corresponding pollutants from the watershed respectively the greater pollutant loads per unit of critical areas indicate that bmps can have greater impacts by focusing on the critical areas and targeting the most vulnerable areas of the watershed liu et al 2017a critical areas were different for each pollutant indicating that critical areas need to be identified for reducing each pollutant such as drp or tp losses so that bmps can be implemented focusing on these areas and have greater impacts liu et al 2017a hru level results provided more details than subbasin level results however subbasin level results were more appropriate for regional management hru level and subbasin level areas were also important for the implementation of bmps because there are bmps implemented at either hru levels or subbasin levels 4 2 yearly and spring march july bmp effectiveness table 3 summarizes yearly spring bmp efficiencies as well as the percentage of the axl watershed treated by each scenario the percent changes of yearly and spring pollutant loadings after bmp implementation were changes from the original yearly and spring pollutant loadings respectively the calibrated baseline spring drp and tp losses which were 645 kg and 6742 kg were 59 2 and 49 1 of the calibrated baseline annual values respectively the pollutant reductions after implementing individual bmps varied greatly due to different bmp capabilities as well as differences in suitable areas for individual bmps 4 2 1 efficiencies of single bmp scenarios 4 2 1 1 blind inlets bi the efficiencies of s1 bi all suitable s9 bi drp and s10 bi tp in reducing pollutant loads at the watershed scale were low mainly due to small bi treatment areas 7 of watershed treated for s1 0 treated for s9 s10 bi efficiencies at the hru scale were much greater than the watershed scale impacts such as 37 1 59 0 yearly tp reduction this was supported by the wallace et al 2017a study table 4 4 2 1 2 wetlands wetl wetlands s2 all suitable s21 drp and s22 tp had high efficiencies partially due to their ability to treat flow from 100 of the watershed for s2 26 for s21 and 28 for s22 efficiencies of wetlands found by kalcic et al 2015 table 4 were smaller than s2 mainly due to smaller portions 58 66 of watersheds treated additional criteria were used to obtain locations of wetlands including drainage areas above 0 2 km2 not intercepting open waterways and located on cropland only kalcic et al 2015 however additional wetland location criteria did not necessarily make the simulation more accurate due to swat representing wetlands as subbasin level bmps which treated part of the flow hrus not specified from each subbasin therefore this study assumed that the whole watershed can be treated by directing flow to nearby wetlands by adjusting the suitable areas to 100 of the watershed the efficiencies of wetlands in the kalcic et al 2015 study table 4 were closer to the s2 efficiencies table 3 and remaining differences were mainly due to watershed differences 4 2 1 3 grade stabilization structures gss although areas treated by gss s3 all suitable s23 drp and s24 tp were large the reductions of tp were small this was mostly due to the suitable main channels not being very erosive before implementing gss reduction of drp was 0 because the main ability of gss was removing sediment by changing the channel slope and erodibility factor other gss studies have been conducted in parts of the maumee basin bracmort et al 2006 studied gss in two subbasins of the black creek watershed indiana and found that gss together with grassed waterways parallel terraces and field borders were effective in reducing sediment tp however impacts of only gss were not reported arabi et al 2008 only reported efficiencies of gss in reducing sediment 4 2 1 4 filter strips fs filter strips are edge of field herbaceous vegetation areas that reduce contaminants from surface runoff by slowing the velocity of runoff settling sediment infiltrating runoff and filtering or adsorbing pollutants usda nrcs 2014 fs in s4 all suitable s11 drp and s12 tp treated 46 6 and 16 of the axl watershed area respectively in the kalcic et al 2015 study table 4 suitable areas for fs were not considered by adjusting the suitable areas to 46 of the watershed the efficiencies of fs in the kalcic et al 2015 study were closer to the yearly impacts of s4 wallace et al 2017a simulated fs along main channels in axl table 4 and found similar pollutant reductions to yearly impacts of s4 table 3 kalcic et al 2016 studied fs in the maumee river watershed and also found greater reductions of annual spring tp than drp losses because drp travels with water and is less likely to be retained by fs and significant amounts of drp travel in tile drains that cannot be treated by fs 4 2 1 5 grassed waterways gw gw in s5 all suitable s13 drp and s14 tp treated 43 3 and 16 of the axl watershed area respectively kalcic et al 2015 did not consider the suitable areas of gw table 4 by adjusting suitable areas to 43 of the watershed the efficiencies of gw in the kalcic et al 2015 study table 4 were closer to the yearly impacts of s5 table 3 wallace et al 2017a table 4 applied gw in the axl watershed secondary channels the differences in gw efficiencies from s5 table 3 were primarily due to different gw representations through changing manning s roughness coefficients channel erodibility factors and channel cover factors wallace et al 2017a 4 2 1 6 cover crops cc cc in s6 all suitable s15 drp and s16 tp treated 80 15 and 25 of the axl watershed area respectively cover crops were suitable in about 90 of the two watersheds in kalcic et al 2015 study by adjusting the suitable areas to 80 of the watershed the efficiencies of cc in the kalcic et al 2015 study table 4 were closer to impacts of s6 table 3 except for drp and tp due to soluble phosphorus losses in tile drains added to the swat source code in the current study kalcic et al 2016 studied cc in the maumee river watershed and found they were effective in reducing yearly spring tp losses but less effective in reducing yearly drp losses kalcic et al 2016 found that cc did not reduce march july drp losses due to cc holding drp during winter but releasing drp after the cc were killed resulting in shifting drp losses from winter to spring summer this was different from predictions of s6 s15 s16 reducing spring drp losses because cc in the current study were harvested and killed before planting the next crops which removed most biomass and converted remaining biomass to residue kalcic et al 2016 only killed the cc which converted all live biomass to residue the swat harvest and kill operation converts partial biomass to residue instead of kill end of growing season converts all biomass to residue is recommended for cc to reduce spring drp losses 4 2 1 7 no till nt no till in s7 all suitable s17 drp and s18 tp decreased tp losses while increasing drp loading mcisaac et al 1995 studied drp in runoff from simulated rainfall experiments with various tillage systems and found that drp increased under no till systems kalcic et al 2015 also reported an increase of drp loadings from no till cropping systems increased drp loadings were due to no till increasing tile drain volume allowing additional drp to be delivered through tile drainage outflows scavia et al 2016b table 4 used five swat setups to simulate no till in the maumee river watershed which found wide ranges of efficiencies with results of some model setups close to the impacts of s7 table 3 4 2 1 8 nutrient management nm nm in s8 all suitable s19 drp and s20 tp was suitable in 80 15 and 25 of the axl watershed area respectively wallace et al 2017a table 4 studied nm in axl by changing p2o5 application rates as map dap kg ha to 0 when tp 40 mg kg in soil and p2o5 as dap kg ha to 22 and found greater nutrient loss reductions compared to s8 table 3 mainly due to greater reductions in phosphorus fertilizer applications scavia et al 2016b table 4 used five swat setups to simulate nm 50 reduction of phosphorus fertilizer rates in all suitable areas of the maumee river watershed and found wide ranges of efficiencies with results of some model setups close to the impacts of s8 table 3 4 2 2 comparing efficiencies of bmp scenarios the efficiencies of individual bmps implemented only in critical areas were less than those in 100 of suitable areas due to the smaller total areas treated scavia et al 2016b for each type of bmp tp critical area implementation was not always more effective than drp critical area implementation in reducing tp similarly drp critical area implementation was not always more effective than tp critical area implementation in reducing drp this was largely due to the restrictions of suitable areas and critical areas that varied for the scenarios spring pollutant reductions in each scenario were not always greater or smaller than those of yearly pollutant reductions indicating that spring efficiencies of bmps need to be studied for the goal of reducing spring pollutants kalcic et al 2016 scavia et al 2016b among single bmps implemented in 100 of suitable areas s2 wetlands reduced yearly spring pollutants the most due to the treatment abilities of wetlands as well as wetlands treating flow from 100 of the watershed for s2 among single bmps implemented in critical areas s21 wetl drp had the greatest reductions in yearly spring drp losses and s22 wetl tp reduced yearly spring tp losses the most s25 all bmps in 100 of suitable areas reduced pollutant losses the most among all scenarios due to the highest level of bmp implementation for the same reason bmps implemented in series reduced pollutants more than individual bmps implementing bmps in series was less effective than simply adding the pollutant reductions of individual bmps together this was expected because of the limited treatment capabilities of bmps when applying bundled bmps efficiencies downstream will be lower than when implemented individually due to the lower pollutant concentrations entering the downstream bmps liu et al 2015b liu et al 2016b s6 cc all suitable s16 cc tp s21 wetl drp and s22 wetl tp reduced spring tp losses by 40 but couldn t reduce spring drp by 40 s2 wetl all suitable s25 all bmps all suitable s26 all bmps drp and s27 all bmps tp scenarios simultaneously reduced spring tp and drp losses by 40 4 3 yearly and spring march july bmp cost effectiveness table 5 shows yearly and spring bmp cost efficiencies as well as the estimated annual cost for each scenario yearly cost efficiencies were calculated as yearly costs per yearly reductions of pollutant losses while spring cost efficiencies were yearly costs per spring reductions of pollutant losses therefore yearly cost effectiveness values were lower more cost effective than the corresponding spring cost efficiencies 4 3 1 rankings based on cost effectiveness of scenarios the rankings of the cost effectiveness scenarios were not the same for reducing yearly and spring pollutant losses making it necessary to study impacts of bmps on spring pollutant reductions to reach the watershed management spring drp tp loss reductions goal bmps implemented in series which reduced pollutant loads more than individual bmps were not as cost effective as some individual bmps this was partially due to the implementation of less cost effective bmps another reason was that implementation of upstream bmps lowered concentrations of pollutants in the flow making downstream bmps less effective liu et al 2015a liu et al 2016c among all scenarios s11 fs drp was the most cost effective in reducing yearly spring drp losses s12 fs tp was the most cost effective in reducing yearly spring tp losses among the individual bmps implemented in 100 of suitable areas the top three most cost effective scenarios were s4 fs s8 nm and s5 gw in reducing yearly spring drp and s4 fs s5 gw and s8 nm in reducing yearly spring tp losses among individual bmp scenarios implemented in critical areas the top three most cost effective scenarios were s11 fs drp s19 nm drp and s20 nm tp for reducing yearly spring drp losses and s12 fs tp s11 fs drp and s19 nm drp for reducing yearly spring tp losses other studies also found filter strips grassed waterways grade stabilization structures wetlands and nutrient management among the most cost effective bmps arabi et al 2006 cools et al 2011 deletic and fletcher 2006 gitau et al 2004b gren et al 2000 iovanna et al 2008 kaini et al 2012 liu et al 2017a lowrance et al 2002 4 3 2 cost effectiveness of critical area implementations compared to individual bmps in all suitable areas individual bmps in drp critical areas reduced drp loads less due to fewer areas treated but were more cost effective in reducing drp this was because they focused on areas where the most drp loadings occurred however compared to individual bmps in all suitable areas implementing bmps in drp critical areas was more cost effective in reducing drp loads but did not always make the scenario more cost effective in reducing tp loads similar results were also found for individual bmps implemented in tp critical areas this indicates that in order to reduce different pollutants bmps should be implemented focusing on pollutant specific critical areas liu et al 2017a for each type of bmp most scenarios of bmps implemented in drp critical areas were more cost effective in reducing yearly spring drp than the scenario of bmps applied in tp critical areas this was due to the bmps that were implemented focused on drp critical areas where most drp losses originated such an approach is commonly used by watershed groups targeting pollutant sources which implements bmps focusing on critical areas scavia et al 2016b strauss et al 2007 tim et al 1992 exceptions were found for s13 gw drp and s14 gw tp in reducing spring drp this was likely because areas treated by gw implemented in drp critical areas were small 3 of watershed and they were not the most important of all drp critical areas the approach of implementing bmps focusing on critical areas has been used by watershed groups scavia et al 2016b strauss et al 2007 tim et al 1992 the method focusing on critical areas would expect that scenarios implemented in drp critical areas be less cost effective in reducing tp loads than scenarios focusing on tp critical areas however for the same type of bmp some scenarios implemented in drp critical areas were more cost effective in reducing tp loads than scenarios of bmps applied in tp critical areas this was likely because areas treated by bmps applied in tp critical areas were larger and more areas that were less critical were treated this indicates that only implementing bmps based on drp or tp critical areas may not make the scenario the most cost effective in reducing drp or tp loads different methods for selection and placement of bmps are needed to more accurately evaluate the cost effectiveness of scenarios the costs of non structural bmps in 2017 indiana environmental quality incentives program and conservation stewardship program payment schedules available at www nrcs usda gov wps portal nrcs detail national programs financial cid nrcseprd1328236 only indicated the costs of implementing that specific bmp including no till cover crops and nutrient management however cost savings or equivalent costs under conventional practices were not accounted for the costs of applying no till included equipment power and labor costs of seeding operation no till drill and no till row planters however no till has substantial fuel and labor cost savings compared to conventional till which were not included in the paper the costs of nutrient management included costs of soil testing and nutrient management plan application the costs of soil testing should be assessed for conventional agriculture since soil testing should be done on all fields regardless if soil testing indicates that less or no fertilizer should be applied then there should also be substantial cost savings with reduced nutrient application and labor and equipment costs for applications the costs of implementing cover crops included ground application of chemical seeding operation glyphosate herbicide and seeds however the benefits of implementing cover crops were not included future work is needed to more fully capture additional components of bmp costs such as cost savings e g fertilizer fuel and labor or equivalent costs under conventional practices 4 4 a cost effective approach for the selections and placements of bmps based on the findings of optimal selection and placement of bmps in previous studies liu et al 2016b c 2017a the most cost effective scenarios can be roughly obtained by applying bmps one practice by one practice starting from the most to the least cost effective practice three scenarios were studied to determine the most cost effective scenarios to obtain 40 reductions of spring drp tp losses 1 applying bmps one by one in 100 of suitable areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of the individual bmps in 100 of suitable areas 2 applying bmps one by one in critical areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in drp tp critical areas 3 applying bmps one by one in suitable or critical areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in both 100 of suitable areas and drp tp critical areas the results of implementing bmps based on cost effectiveness rankings to obtain 40 spring drp tp loss reductions are shown in table 6 thirty two percent 32 s2 wetl represents wetlands implemented in 32 of suitable areas in each subbasin similarly 63 s21 wetl drp represents wetlands implemented in 63 of drp critical areas scenarios that can attain the watershed management plan goal were highlighted scenarios s31 s40 and s54 can simultaneously reduce spring drp and tp losses by 40 scenarios s35 s47 and s62 reduced spring tp loss by 40 but did not reduce spring drp loss by 40 this was expected as drp is delivered in water flow while most tp is sediment borne bmps were more efficient in trapping sediment than treating dissolved pollutants in flow making it more difficult to reduce spring drp than spring tp losses kalcic et al 2016 among all scenarios that can obtain 40 reductions in spring drp tp losses s40 was the most cost effective in reducing both drp and tp however when implementing bmps one by one based on rankings of individual bmp cost effectiveness s54 was expected to be the most cost effective in reducing drp while s62 was expected to be the most cost effective in reducing tp this was due to more cost effective bmps should be implemented in s54 and s62 liu et al 2016b c 2017a to explain this s40 and s54 were compared s40 implemented nm and fs in drp tp critical areas while s54 implemented nm and fs in all suitable areas s40 implemented 63 s21 wetl drp while s54 applied 45 s21 wetl drp after fs and nm were implemented in drp tp critical areas implementation of fs and nm in all suitable areas would only focus on areas that were not drp tp critical although fs nm in all suitable areas were more cost effective than wetlands implemented in drp critical areas fs nm in drp tp non critical areas were less cost effective than wetlands implemented in drp critical areas bmp implementation in series would change rankings of bmp cost effectiveness similar reasons also explain s40 and s62 cost effectiveness differences in reducing spring tp losses results indicate that implementing bmps one by one in critical areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in drp tp critical areas was the better approach to obtain more cost effective solutions this study only explored bmp implementation one by one based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps additional research should be conducted to systematically study cost effectiveness of bundled bmps and apply bmps based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual and bundled bmps this approach can be utilized by watershed management groups in different regions by updating parameter values of the bmp cost tool and calculating cost effectiveness of individual bundled bmp scenarios implemented in critical areas without running optimization algorithms to select and locate bmps that can attain maximum pollutant reductions at least cost which may be impossible in large areas due to optimization calculation complexity this approach is sufficient to help create agricultural bmp strategies to cost efficiently improve water quality 5 conclusions this study developed a new bmp cost tool that can accurately estimate expenses for implementing bmps the bmp cost tool was developed for swat and the methods used in the cost tool can be applied in other models then the swat and the new bmp cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost effectiveness of bmps in an agricultural catchment of the maumee river watershed with various scenarios in addition a cost effective approach for the selections and placements of cost efficient bmps in agricultural watersheds was developed as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds in the cost effective approach bmps were applied one by one based on cost effectiveness rankings starting from the most to the least cost effective practice this cost effective approach can be utilized by watershed management groups in different regions these results and the overall approach can help create cost effective agricultural bmp strategies based on simulated bmp efficiencies and cost effectiveness results in the axl watershed recommendations for conservation strategies are 1 identifying suitable locations table 2 provides the information of suitable areas for bmps where bmps can be implemented is needed 2 bmp representation methods need to be carefully selected based on previous literature and new bmp representation methods need to be developed 3 filter strips in drp tp critical areas were the most cost effective in reducing both yearly and spring drp tp losses 4 bmp efficiencies for seasonal periods such as spring have not been explored in detail before this paper given the importance of reducing pollutants seasonally bmp efficiencies need to be studied with the goal of reducing spring pollutant losses 5 pollutant reductions for multiple bmps in series cannot simply be individual reductions added together instead efficiencies of bmps implemented in series need to be simulated by representing bmp combinations 6 implementing bmps one by one in critical areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in drp tp critical areas was the most cost effective in reducing both drp and tp losses by updating the bmp cost tool parameter values and calculating cost effectiveness of individual and bundled bmp scenarios implemented in critical areas this approach can be utilized in other regions for future studies additional research is needed to systematically study cost effectiveness of bundled bmps and apply bmps based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual and bundled bmps to obtain the most cost effective scenarios optimization algorithms are needed to connect swat and the bmp cost tool to optimally select and place bmps which would generate scenarios based on cost effectiveness of past scenarios and eventually find optimal solutions additional bmp cost components such as cost savings or equivalent costs under conventional practices need to be captured in bmp cost estimation acknowledgements this work was supported by

6228,agricultural conservation practices or agricultural best management practices bmps can reduce nutrient loading and help address harmful algal blooms habs habs in the western basin of lake erie which are largely caused by phosphorus losses from the maumee river watershed are critical in the recent years in this study a new bmp cost tool was developed then the soil and water assessment tool swat and the new bmp cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost effectiveness of bmps in an agricultural catchment of the maumee river watershed with various scenarios the scenarios included individual bmps applied in 100 of suitable areas individual bmps targeting dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and total phosphorus tp critical areas and bmps implemented in series in addition a cost effective approach for the selections and placements of bmps in agricultural watersheds was developed as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds the cost effective approach applied bmps based on cost effectiveness rankings starting from the most cost effective one results showed that 1 bmps implemented in series which reduced pollutant loads more than individual bmps were not as cost effective as some individual bmps 2 among all scenarios filter strips targeting drp tp critical areas were the most cost effective in reducing yearly spring drp tp losses 3 to obtain the watershed management plan goal of reducing march july drp tp losses by 40 implementing bmps one by one in critical areas based on the cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in drp tp critical areas was the most cost effective and 4 the simulation results modeling tools and cost effective approach can help create agricultural bmp

lakes are increasingly being affected by excessive growth of algae eutrophication and in some cases harmful algal blooms habs in which organisms such as cyanobacteria excrete toxins hazardous to humans and animals ding et al 2018 noori et al 2018 williams et al 2018 best management practices bmps are commonly employed interventions for improving water quality chen et al 2019 li et al 2019 lim

vegetation on sites to reduce pollutants using processes of filtration infiltration and evaporation non structural bmps such as no till and nutrient management are management procedures used to improve water quality by reducing pollutants at the source habs in the western basin of lake erie which are largely caused by phosphorus losses from the maumee river watershed are critical in the recent years great lakes water quality agreement 2015 national science and technology council 2017 scavia et al 2016b the maumee river watershed management plan goal is to reduce spring march july dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and total phosphorus tp losses by 40 compared to 2008 levels which would meet the target spring tp load of 860 tons and drp load of 186 tons great lakes water quality agreement 2015 national science and technology council 2017 scavia et al 2016a spring tp drp are of particular interest because spring non point source pollutants from the maumee river watershed were the best indicators of cyanobacteria bloom severity based on modelling and monitoring data great lakes water quality agreement 2015 85 of phosphorus losses from the maumee river watershed are from agricultural areas scavia et al 2016b therefore strategies for implementing bmps to reduce nutrient losses from agricultural areas in the maumee river watershed need to be explored a few studies have explored the efficiencies of implementing agricultural bmps in reducing pollutant loadings in the entire area or in subbasins of the maumee river watershed kalcic et al 2016 scavia et al 2016b wallace 2016 wallace et al 2017a however the cost efficiencies of bmps were not studied due to limited budgets of implementation projects the cost effectiveness of agricultural bmps determined by the cost and effectiveness of the practice needs to be explored in the maumee river watershed considering the number type location and combination of bmps an approach to accurately calculate the cost of bmps is needed further an approach for the selection and placement of bmps in agricultural watersheds based on cost effectiveness of bmp scenarios is needed to identify cost efficient agricultural bmp strategies as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds a number of subbasins of the st joseph river a tributary of the maumee river are monitored in dekalb county indiana by the united states department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars since 2002 of these sites the axl subbasin also called matson ditch huc12 041000030603 was selected to start the work before expanding results to the entire maumee river watershed the specific objectives of this study were to 1 develop a bmp cost tool that accurately estimates expenses for implementing bmps 2 simulate bmp implementation scenarios in suitable areas of the axl watershed using swat to determine their effectiveness in reducing pollutant losses tp and drp 3 integrate swat and the bmp cost tool to calculate the cost effectiveness of implementing bmps and 4 develop a cost effective approach to obtain cost efficient bmp scenarios based on the economics of bmp implementation in initial applications 2 development of a bmp cost tool for swat 2 1 background of bmp simulation model swat swat is a semi distributed hydrologic water quality model that runs on a daily step with varying soils management conditions and land uses in both large complex watersheds and small simple catchments arnold et al 2012 swat has been applied in a multitude of worldwide studies abbaspour et al 2015 francesconi et al 2016 golmohammadi et al 2017 guo et al 2018a b liu et al 2017c wallace et al 2017a wang et al 2017b 2014 wang and kalin 2017 the swat model is capable of estimating daily to yearly time step water flows and sediment and chemical pollutant yields and simulation of the impacts of bmps the major components include hydrology weather sedimentation soil properties plant growth pathogens and bacteria pesticides nutrients land management and channel reservoir routing arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 two level simulation is used in swat the first level splits the watershed into subbasins according to topography the second level divides subbasins into hydrologic response units hrus which are unique combinations of land use type soil type and slope class hydrology and water quality simulations are conducted at the hru level first and then routed through the channel network to obtain watershed level results the physical processes such as water movement and nutrient cycling are simulated using specific input data such as daily precipitation daily temperatures bmps applied vegetation topography and soil properties 2 2

was the median value of home sites from the 2017 purdue agricultural economics report hurt et al 2017 the bmp cost tool was developed for swat and integrated with the swat simulations using matlab code after determining the suitable locations for implementing bmps the costs of bmps were connected to the swat model based on land use types estimating costs due to loss of land drainage areas and or configurations of bmps the configuration of blind inlets included the surface area and depth of blind inlet boxes each wetland area consists of 1 of the upstream contributing area channel width

crops no till and nutrient management were based on the sizes of soybean corn rotation or soybean corn winter wheat rotation areas with bmps implemented the methods used in the bmp cost tool can be applied in other models 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area this study was conducted in the agricultural axl watershed huc12 041000030603 in northeastern indiana fig 1 axl has a total area of 42

http dekalbswcd org the swat 2012 revision 635 source code was modified to include simulation of soluble phosphorus transport in tile drains kalcic et al 2016 eleven subbasins within axl were created using arcswat with 200 ha as the minimum stream threshold value 5 of watershed three slope classes were used for hru hydrologic response unit unique combinations of land use soil type and slope

drp tp tkn and no2 n no3 n in the axl watershed streamflow was calibrated and validated for each month of a year pollutants were not calibrated and validated from december to march due to limited data availability five years 2001 2005 of warm up period for swat were used an optimization tool was developed and used to calibrate and validate the swat model a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam method with discrete parameter intervals vrugt and robinson 2007 was used in the optimization tool the above statistics r2 nse and pbias were set as the objective functions to calibrate streamflow and pollutants simultaneously using a multi objective approach population size of 100 and generation size of 100 were used to reach desired results to ensure that parameters take realistic values the upper and lower boundaries of parameters were set carefully based on previous literature further care was taken so calibrated parameters would fall within the boundaries and exclude the values of upper lower boundaries 3 4 excess phosphorus loading and critical areas excess phosphorus loading areas in the axl watershed were identified using swat setup with nass 2016 land use data based on the goal of 40 spring march july tp drp loading reductions compared to 2008 levels in the maumee river watershed which would obtain a target spring tp load of 860 tons and drp load of 186 tons great lakes water quality agreement 2015 national science and technology council 2017 scavia et al 2016a the target loads per area of spring tp and drp were 50 53 kg km2 and 10 93 kg km2 respectively based on the size of the entire maumee river watershed any hrus subbasins with spring tp losses 50 53 kg km2 or spring drp losses above 10 93 kg km2 meant that this hru subbasin had excess tp or drp loadings critical areas in axl were identified using nass 2016 land use data to understand where most pollutants originate these were identified as at least 25 of the watershed with the highest values of pollutant load per area per year generated from each hru or subbasin to obtain these results the hrus or subbasins were ranked based on their pollutant load per area per year values from the highest to the lowest then the hrus or subbasins with the greatest values were picked until the total areas of the selected hrus or subbasins comprised at least 25 of the axl watershed

a depth of 1 m and a surrounding buffer area that is 3 of the upstream contributing area with a depth of 1 2 m kalcic et al 2015 wetlands were represented in swat with parameters in pnd files arnold et al 2012 higgins and kim 1981 kalcic et al 2015 since wetlands were represented as subbasin level bmps in swat the locations of the wetlands were not specified in the model and all wetlands were combined to a wetland area for each subbasin treating a fraction of surface runoff from the subbasin wetlands were assumed to be suitable in all areas of the watershed with flow directed to nearby wetlands the sizes of the wetlands were based on the swat parameter wet fr fraction of subbasin drains into wetlands wet nsa normal wetland surface area which was the sum of all the wetlands areas in the subbasin was 1 of the contribution area wet nvol normal water storage in wetlands and wet vol initial water volume in wetlands were calculated based on the 1 m depth of the wetlands and wet nsa

for estimating bmp costs are detailed in section 2 design life of structural bmps was assumed to be 20 years liu et al 2015b liu et al 2016b non structural bmps were simulated for 20 years an interest rate of 4 5 was used the baseline scenario was calibrated validated swat with nass 2016 land use data and 2001 2014 weather data 2001 2005 for model warm up 2006 2014 for model outputs to evaluate bmp impacts simulation scenarios were bmps implemented based on the baseline scenario swat hydrologic response units hrus are areas with unique combinations of land use soil type and slope classes to represent the watershed 529 hrus and 11 subbasins were delineated fig 2 and table 3 show bmp simulation scenarios including individual bmps implemented in 100 of suitable areas s1 s8 individual bmps implemented in hru level drp tp critical areas s9 s20 individual bmps implemented in subbasin level drp tp critical areas s21 s24 and bmps in series s25 s27 all types of bmps implemented in suitable areas drp critical areas or tp critical areas based on the spatial locations of bmps some of the flow treated by one bmp would be treated again by another bmp all scenarios considered suitable areas for implementing bmps grade stabilization structures and wetlands were implemented in subbasin level critical areas since they are represented as subbasin level practices in swat for s1 to s27 the following results were calculated and explored 1 yearly and spring march july bmp effectiveness and 2 yearly and spring bmp cost effectiveness in addition to develop a cost effective approach for the selections and placements of bmps additional scenarios were explored by implementing bmps one by one starting with the most cost effective practice based on spring cost effectiveness values to find cost effective scenarios that would obtain the watershed management plan goal of reducing spring drp and tp by 40 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of model calibration validation excess phosphorus loading areas and critical areas 4 1 1 model calibration validation results fig 3 shows plots of simulated and observed monthly streamflow and pollutants from 2006 to 2014 in the axl watershed results of r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 for streamflow pollutants together with pbias 25 for streamflow and pbias 70 for nitrogen phosphorus were considered good model performance engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 therefore swat had good performance in simulating streamflow r2 0 77 nse 0 77 pbias 3 6 drp r2 0 79 nse 0 64 pbias 46 7 tp r2 0 87 nse 0 69 pbias 3 6 tkn r2 0 78 nse 0 64 pbias 22 2 and nox r2 0 63 nse 0 56 pbias 30 6 the ratio of tile flow depth to precipitation depth was 14 which was similar to other studies in the same watershed boles et al 2015 wallace et al 2017b the web based hydrograph analysis tool what lim et al 2005 was applied to obtain baseflow from streamflow the observed baseflow fraction was 0 57 and the simulated result had a similar value of 0 56 the calibrated parameters took realistic values according to the characteristics of the watershed such as depth to subsurface drains of 1 m boles et al 2015 wallace et al 2017b boles et al 2015 studied tile drainage flow and water quality in the axl watershed and only did calibration for non winter months wallace et al 2018 evaluated the effects of watershed size on swat calibration including axl watershed and flow was calibrated for every month while nitrogen and phosphorus were only calibrated for non winter months in the current study flow was calibrated for each month of the study period phosphorus and nitrogen loadings are highly correlated with flow in this region park and engel 2014 therefore the calibration method suits the needs of this study and the annual simulated results will be realistic 4 1 2 identification of excess phosphorus loading areas and critical areas the spring march july tp 181 02 kg km2 and drp 13 50 kg km2 loads from the axl watershed were greater than the thresholds of 50 53 kg km2 for tp and 10 93 kg km2 for drp indicating excess tp and drp losses fig 4 a shows areas with excess drp or tp loadings in the axl watershed at the hru level 14 4 and 54 8 of the watershed had excess drp and tp loadings respectively at the subbasin level 28 7 and 71 1 of the watershed had excess drp and tp loadings respectively fig 4 b shows critical areas in the axl watershed for the hru and subbasin levels for the hru level the critical areas for drp and tp losses which were 25 3 and 26 3 of the watershed area contributed 66 3 and 82 8 of the corresponding pollutants from the watershed respectively at the subbasin level the critical areas for drp and tp losses which were 25 9 and 28 2 of the watershed area contributed 57 3 and 68 4 of the corresponding pollutants from the watershed respectively the greater pollutant loads per unit of critical areas indicate that bmps can have greater impacts by focusing on the critical areas and targeting the most vulnerable areas of the watershed liu et al 2017a critical areas were different for each pollutant indicating that critical areas need to be identified for reducing each pollutant such as drp or tp losses so that bmps can be implemented focusing on these areas and have greater impacts liu et al 2017a hru level results provided more details than subbasin level results however subbasin level results were more appropriate for regional management hru level and subbasin level areas were also important for the implementation of bmps because there are bmps implemented at either hru levels or subbasin levels 4 2 yearly and spring march july bmp effectiveness table 3 summarizes yearly spring bmp efficiencies as well as the percentage of the axl watershed treated by each scenario the percent changes of yearly and spring pollutant loadings after bmp implementation were changes from the original yearly and spring pollutant loadings respectively the calibrated baseline spring drp and tp losses which were 645 kg and 6742 kg were 59 2 and 49 1 of the calibrated baseline annual values respectively the pollutant reductions after implementing individual bmps varied greatly due to different bmp capabilities as well as differences in suitable areas for individual bmps 4 2 1 efficiencies of single bmp scenarios 4 2 1 1 blind inlets bi the efficiencies of s1 bi all suitable s9 bi drp and s10 bi tp in reducing pollutant loads at the watershed scale were low mainly due to small bi treatment areas 7 of watershed treated for s1 0 treated for s9 s10 bi efficiencies at the hru scale were much greater than the watershed scale impacts such as 37 1 59 0 yearly tp reduction this was supported by the wallace et al 2017a study table 4 4 2 1 2 wetlands wetl wetlands s2 all suitable s21 drp and s22 tp had high efficiencies partially due to their ability to treat flow from 100 of the watershed for s2 26 for s21 and 28 for s22 efficiencies of wetlands found by kalcic et al 2015 table 4 were smaller than s2 mainly due to smaller portions 58 66 of watersheds treated additional criteria were used to obtain locations of wetlands including drainage areas above 0 2 km2 not intercepting open waterways and located on cropland only kalcic et al 2015 however additional wetland location criteria did not necessarily make the simulation more accurate due to swat representing wetlands as subbasin level bmps which treated part of the flow hrus not specified from each subbasin therefore this study assumed that the whole watershed can be treated by directing flow to nearby wetlands by adjusting the suitable areas to 100 of the watershed the efficiencies of wetlands in the kalcic et al 2015 study table 4 were closer to the s2 efficiencies table 3 and remaining differences were mainly due to watershed differences 4 2 1 3 grade stabilization structures gss although areas treated by gss s3 all suitable s23 drp and s24 tp were large the reductions of tp were small this was mostly due to the suitable main channels not being very erosive before implementing gss reduction of drp was 0 because the main ability of gss was removing sediment by changing the channel slope and erodibility factor other gss studies have been conducted in parts of the maumee basin bracmort et al 2006 studied gss in two subbasins of the black creek watershed indiana and found that gss together with grassed waterways parallel terraces and field borders were effective in reducing sediment tp however impacts of only gss were not reported arabi et al 2008 only reported efficiencies of gss in reducing sediment 4 2 1 4 filter strips fs filter strips are edge of field herbaceous vegetation areas that reduce contaminants from surface runoff by slowing the velocity of runoff settling sediment infiltrating runoff and filtering or adsorbing pollutants usda nrcs 2014 fs in s4 all suitable s11 drp and s12 tp treated 46 6 and 16 of the axl watershed area respectively in the kalcic et al 2015 study table 4 suitable areas for fs were not considered by adjusting the suitable areas to 46 of the watershed the efficiencies of fs in the kalcic et al 2015 study were closer to the yearly impacts of s4 wallace et al 2017a simulated fs along main channels in axl table 4 and found similar pollutant reductions to yearly impacts of s4 table 3 kalcic et al 2016 studied fs in the maumee river watershed and also found greater reductions of annual spring tp than drp losses because drp travels with water and is less likely to be retained by fs and significant amounts of drp travel in tile drains that cannot be treated by fs 4 2 1 5 grassed waterways gw gw in s5 all suitable s13 drp and s14 tp treated 43 3 and 16 of the axl watershed area respectively kalcic et al 2015 did not consider the suitable areas of gw table 4 by adjusting suitable areas to 43 of the watershed the efficiencies of gw in the kalcic et al 2015 study table 4 were closer to the yearly impacts of s5 table 3 wallace et al 2017a table 4 applied gw in the axl watershed secondary channels the differences in gw efficiencies from s5 table 3 were primarily due to different gw representations through changing manning s roughness coefficients channel erodibility factors and channel cover factors wallace et al 2017a 4 2 1 6 cover crops cc cc in s6 all suitable s15 drp and s16 tp treated 80 15 and 25 of the axl watershed area respectively cover crops were suitable in about 90 of the two watersheds in kalcic et al 2015 study by adjusting the suitable areas to 80 of the watershed the efficiencies of cc in the kalcic et al 2015 study table 4 were closer to impacts of s6 table 3 except for drp and tp due to soluble phosphorus losses in tile drains added to the swat source code in the current study kalcic et al 2016 studied cc in the maumee river watershed and found they were effective in reducing yearly spring tp losses but less effective in reducing yearly drp losses kalcic et al 2016 found that cc did not reduce march july drp losses due to cc holding drp during winter but releasing drp after the cc were killed resulting in shifting drp losses from winter to spring summer this was different from predictions of s6 s15 s16 reducing spring drp losses because cc in the current study were harvested and killed before planting the next crops which removed most biomass and converted remaining biomass to residue kalcic et al 2016 only killed the cc which converted all live biomass to residue the swat harvest and kill operation converts partial biomass to residue instead of kill end of growing season converts all biomass to residue is recommended for cc to reduce spring drp losses 4 2 1 7 no till nt no till in s7 all suitable s17 drp and s18 tp decreased tp losses while increasing drp loading mcisaac et al 1995 studied drp in runoff from simulated rainfall experiments with various tillage systems and found that drp increased under no till systems kalcic et al 2015 also reported an increase of drp loadings from no till cropping systems increased drp loadings were due to no till increasing tile drain volume allowing additional drp to be delivered through tile drainage outflows scavia et al 2016b table 4 used five swat setups to simulate no till in the maumee river watershed which found wide ranges of efficiencies with results of some model setups close to the impacts of s7 table 3 4 2 1 8 nutrient management nm nm in s8 all suitable s19 drp and s20 tp was suitable in 80 15 and 25 of the axl watershed area respectively wallace et al 2017a table 4 studied nm in axl by changing p2o5 application rates as map dap kg ha to 0 when tp 40 mg kg in soil and p2o5 as dap kg ha to 22 and found greater nutrient loss reductions compared to s8 table 3 mainly due to greater reductions in phosphorus fertilizer applications scavia et al 2016b table 4 used five swat setups to simulate nm 50 reduction of phosphorus fertilizer rates in all suitable areas of the maumee river watershed and found wide ranges of efficiencies with results of some model setups close to the impacts of s8 table 3 4 2 2 comparing efficiencies of bmp scenarios the efficiencies of individual bmps implemented only in critical areas were less than those in 100 of suitable areas due to the smaller total areas treated scavia et al 2016b for each type of bmp tp critical area implementation was not always more effective than drp critical area implementation in reducing tp similarly drp critical area implementation was not always more effective than tp critical area implementation in reducing drp this was largely due to the restrictions of suitable areas and critical areas that varied for the scenarios spring pollutant reductions in each scenario were not always greater or smaller than those of yearly pollutant reductions indicating that spring efficiencies of bmps need to be studied for the goal of reducing spring pollutants kalcic et al 2016 scavia et al 2016b among single bmps implemented in 100 of suitable areas s2 wetlands reduced yearly spring pollutants the most due to the treatment abilities of wetlands as well as wetlands treating flow from 100 of the watershed for s2 among single bmps implemented in critical areas s21 wetl drp had the greatest reductions in yearly spring drp losses and s22 wetl tp reduced yearly spring tp losses the most s25 all bmps in 100 of suitable areas reduced pollutant losses the most among all scenarios due to the highest level of bmp implementation for the same reason bmps implemented in series reduced pollutants more than individual bmps implementing bmps in series was less effective than simply adding the pollutant reductions of individual bmps together this was expected because of the limited treatment capabilities of bmps when applying bundled bmps efficiencies downstream will be lower than when implemented individually due to the lower pollutant concentrations entering the downstream bmps liu et al 2015b liu et al 2016b s6 cc all suitable s16 cc tp s21 wetl drp and s22 wetl tp reduced spring tp losses by 40 but couldn t reduce spring drp by 40 s2 wetl all suitable s25 all bmps all suitable s26 all bmps drp and s27 all bmps tp scenarios simultaneously reduced spring tp and drp losses by 40 4 3 yearly and spring march july bmp cost effectiveness table 5 shows yearly and spring bmp cost efficiencies as well as the estimated annual cost for each scenario yearly cost efficiencies were calculated as yearly costs per yearly reductions of pollutant losses while spring cost efficiencies were yearly costs per spring reductions of pollutant losses therefore yearly cost effectiveness values were lower more cost effective than the corresponding spring cost efficiencies 4 3 1 rankings based on cost effectiveness of scenarios the rankings of the cost effectiveness scenarios were not the same for reducing yearly and spring pollutant losses making it necessary to study impacts of bmps on spring pollutant reductions to reach the watershed management spring drp tp loss reductions goal bmps implemented in series which reduced pollutant loads more than individual bmps were not as cost effective as some individual bmps this was partially due to the implementation of less cost effective bmps another reason was that implementation of upstream bmps lowered concentrations of pollutants in the flow making downstream bmps less effective liu et al 2015a liu et al 2016c among all scenarios s11 fs drp was the most cost effective in reducing yearly spring drp losses s12 fs tp was the most cost effective in reducing yearly spring tp losses among the individual bmps implemented in 100 of suitable areas the top three most cost effective scenarios were s4 fs s8 nm and s5 gw in reducing yearly spring drp and s4 fs s5 gw and s8 nm in reducing yearly spring tp losses among individual bmp scenarios implemented in critical areas the top three most cost effective scenarios were s11 fs drp s19 nm drp and s20 nm tp for reducing yearly spring drp losses and s12 fs tp s11 fs drp and s19 nm drp for reducing yearly spring tp losses other studies also found filter strips grassed waterways grade stabilization structures wetlands and nutrient management among the most cost effective bmps arabi et al 2006 cools et al 2011 deletic and fletcher 2006 gitau et al 2004b gren et al 2000 iovanna et al 2008 kaini et al 2012 liu et al 2017a lowrance et al 2002 4 3 2 cost effectiveness of critical area implementations compared to individual bmps in all suitable areas individual bmps in drp critical areas reduced drp loads less due to fewer areas treated but were more cost effective in reducing drp this was because they focused on areas where the most drp loadings occurred however compared to individual bmps in all suitable areas implementing bmps in drp critical areas was more cost effective in reducing drp loads but did not always make the scenario more cost effective in reducing tp loads similar results were also found for individual bmps implemented in tp critical areas this indicates that in order to reduce different pollutants bmps should be implemented focusing on pollutant specific critical areas liu et al 2017a for each type of bmp most scenarios of bmps implemented in drp critical areas were more cost effective in reducing yearly spring drp than the scenario of bmps applied in tp critical areas this was due to the bmps that were implemented focused on drp critical areas where most drp losses originated such an approach is commonly used by watershed groups targeting pollutant sources which implements bmps focusing on critical areas scavia et al 2016b strauss et al 2007 tim et al 1992 exceptions were found for s13 gw drp and s14 gw tp in reducing spring drp this was likely because areas treated by gw implemented in drp critical areas were small 3 of watershed and they were not the most important of all drp critical areas the approach of implementing bmps focusing on critical areas has been used by watershed groups scavia et al 2016b strauss et al 2007 tim et al 1992 the method focusing on critical areas would expect that scenarios implemented in drp critical areas be less cost effective in reducing tp loads than scenarios focusing on tp critical areas however for the same type of bmp some scenarios implemented in drp critical areas were more cost effective in reducing tp loads than scenarios of bmps applied in tp critical areas this was likely because areas treated by bmps applied in tp critical areas were larger and more areas that were less critical were treated this indicates that only implementing bmps based on drp or tp critical areas may not make the scenario the most cost effective in reducing drp or tp loads different methods for selection and placement of bmps are needed to more accurately evaluate the cost effectiveness of scenarios the costs of non structural bmps in 2017 indiana environmental quality incentives program and conservation stewardship program payment schedules available at www nrcs usda gov wps portal nrcs detail national programs financial cid nrcseprd1328236 only indicated the costs of implementing that specific bmp including no till cover crops and nutrient management however cost savings or equivalent costs under conventional practices were not accounted for the costs of applying no till included equipment power and labor costs of seeding operation no till drill and no till row planters however no till has substantial fuel and labor cost savings compared to conventional till which were not included in the paper the costs of nutrient management included costs of soil testing and nutrient management plan application the costs of soil testing should be assessed for conventional agriculture since soil testing should be done on all fields regardless if soil testing indicates that less or no fertilizer should be applied then there should also be substantial cost savings with reduced nutrient application and labor and equipment costs for applications the costs of implementing cover crops included ground application of chemical seeding operation glyphosate herbicide and seeds however the benefits of implementing cover crops were not included future work is needed to more fully capture additional components of bmp costs such as cost savings e g fertilizer fuel and labor or equivalent costs under conventional practices 4 4 a cost effective approach for the selections and placements of bmps based on the findings of optimal selection and placement of bmps in previous studies liu et al 2016b c 2017a the most cost effective scenarios can be roughly obtained by applying bmps one practice by one practice starting from the most to the least cost effective practice three scenarios were studied to determine the most cost effective scenarios to obtain 40 reductions of spring drp tp losses 1 applying bmps one by one in 100 of suitable areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of the individual bmps in 100 of suitable areas 2 applying bmps one by one in critical areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in drp tp critical areas 3 applying bmps one by one in suitable or critical areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in both 100 of suitable areas and drp tp critical areas the results of implementing bmps based on cost effectiveness rankings to obtain 40 spring drp tp loss reductions are shown in table 6 thirty two percent 32 s2 wetl represents wetlands implemented in 32 of suitable areas in each subbasin similarly 63 s21 wetl drp represents wetlands implemented in 63 of drp critical areas scenarios that can attain the watershed management plan goal were highlighted scenarios s31 s40 and s54 can simultaneously reduce spring drp and tp losses by 40 scenarios s35 s47 and s62 reduced spring tp loss by 40 but did not reduce spring drp loss by 40 this was expected as drp is delivered in water flow while most tp is sediment borne bmps were more efficient in trapping sediment than treating dissolved pollutants in flow making it more difficult to reduce spring drp than spring tp losses kalcic et al 2016 among all scenarios that can obtain 40 reductions in spring drp tp losses s40 was the most cost effective in reducing both drp and tp however when implementing bmps one by one based on rankings of individual bmp cost effectiveness s54 was expected to be the most cost effective in reducing drp while s62 was expected to be the most cost effective in reducing tp this was due to more cost effective bmps should be implemented in s54 and s62 liu et al 2016b c 2017a to explain this s40 and s54 were compared s40 implemented nm and fs in drp tp critical areas while s54 implemented nm and fs in all suitable areas s40 implemented 63 s21 wetl drp while s54 applied 45 s21 wetl drp after fs and nm were implemented in drp tp critical areas implementation of fs and nm in all suitable areas would only focus on areas that were not drp tp critical although fs nm in all suitable areas were more cost effective than wetlands implemented in drp critical areas fs nm in drp tp non critical areas were less cost effective than wetlands implemented in drp critical areas bmp implementation in series would change rankings of bmp cost effectiveness similar reasons also explain s40 and s62 cost effectiveness differences in reducing spring tp losses results indicate that implementing bmps one by one in critical areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in drp tp critical areas was the better approach to obtain more cost effective solutions this study only explored bmp implementation one by one based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps additional research should be conducted to systematically study cost effectiveness of bundled bmps and apply bmps based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual and bundled bmps this approach can be utilized by watershed management groups in different regions by updating parameter values of the bmp cost tool and calculating cost effectiveness of individual bundled bmp scenarios implemented in critical areas without running optimization algorithms to select and locate bmps that can attain maximum pollutant reductions at least cost which may be impossible in large areas due to optimization calculation complexity this approach is sufficient to help create agricultural bmp strategies to cost efficiently improve water quality 5 conclusions this study developed a new bmp cost tool that can accurately estimate expenses for implementing bmps the bmp cost tool was developed for swat and the methods used in the cost tool can be applied in other models then the swat and the new bmp cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost effectiveness of bmps in an agricultural catchment of the maumee river watershed with various scenarios in addition a cost effective approach for the selections and placements of cost efficient bmps in agricultural watersheds was developed as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds in the cost effective approach bmps were applied one by one based on cost effectiveness rankings starting from the most to the least cost effective practice this cost effective approach can be utilized by watershed management groups in different regions these results and the overall approach can help create cost effective agricultural bmp strategies based on simulated bmp efficiencies and cost effectiveness results in the axl watershed recommendations for conservation strategies are 1 identifying suitable locations table 2 provides the information of suitable areas for bmps where bmps can be implemented is needed 2 bmp representation methods need to be carefully selected based on previous literature and new bmp representation methods need to be developed 3 filter strips in drp tp critical areas were the most cost effective in reducing both yearly and spring drp tp losses 4 bmp efficiencies for seasonal periods such as spring have not been explored in detail before this paper given the importance of reducing pollutants seasonally bmp efficiencies need to be studied with the goal of reducing spring pollutant losses 5 pollutant reductions for multiple bmps in series cannot simply be individual reductions added together instead efficiencies of bmps implemented in series need to be simulated by representing bmp combinations 6 implementing bmps one by one in critical areas based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual bmps in drp tp critical areas was the most cost effective in reducing both drp and tp losses by updating the bmp cost tool parameter values and calculating cost effectiveness of individual and bundled bmp scenarios implemented in critical areas this approach can be utilized in other regions for future studies additional research is needed to systematically study cost effectiveness of bundled bmps and apply bmps based on cost effectiveness rankings of individual and bundled bmps to obtain the most cost effective scenarios optimization algorithms are needed to connect swat and the bmp cost tool to optimally select and place bmps which would generate scenarios based on cost effectiveness of past scenarios and eventually find optimal solutions additional bmp cost components such as cost savings or equivalent costs under conventional practices need to be captured in bmp cost estimation acknowledgements this work was supported by

6229,dewatering using a combination of waterproof curtain and pumping wells is commonly adopted to ensure the stability of foundation pits in multi aquifer strata however dewatering is likely to

approximate hydraulic gradient δσ effective stress 1 introduction with rapid urbanisation an increasing number of underground infrastructures have been extensively constructed in the coastal cities of china such as metro tunnels and foundation pits liao et al 2016 liu et al 2018 2019 lyu et al 2018 2019 tan et al 2019 zhou and liao 2016 without appropriate planning this is likely to result in certain hazards zheng et al 2016 lyu et al 2017 2018a wu et al 2018 2019 xu et al 2018a the excavated depths of foundation pits have increased and excavated areas have also grown e g the hangzhong road station in metro line no 10 of shanghai has an excavation area of over 7500 m2 and is 344 m long and 20 24 m wide zhou et al 2010 the qianjiang century city station in metro line no 2 of hangzhou is 290 m long 22 m wide and 26 m deep wang et al 2017 generally quaternary deposits in the coastal regions of china exhibit multi aquifer aquitard alternative strata xu et al 2009 2017a 2018b shen et al 2013 zeng et al 2018 2019 which are rich in groundwater groundwater control is essential for the safe construction of foundation pits generally one of the measurements conducted to prevent uprush is dewatering while excavating deep foundation pits wu et al 2015a wang et al 2016 however foundation pit dewatering is likely to result in some negative impacts such as soil deformation bawden et al 2001 calderhead et al 2011 xu et al 2012 pujades et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 damage to adjacent buildings and metro lines song et al 2014 tan and lu 2018a wu et al 2017a and sand flow or piping phenomenon zhang et al 2013 before excavation underground structures such as diaphragm walls wu et al 2017b pujades et al 2014 and mixing piles ma et al 2014 have been constructed to improve the stability of foundation pits and reduce the entrance of groundwater to the excavation as waterproof curtain waterproof curtain can reduce the seepage area extend the seepage path and change the seepage direction of groundwater in the foundation pit jiao et al 2008 vilarrasa et al 2011 pujades et al 2012a b therefore a dewatering system combined with waterproof curtain and pumping wells is generally adopted to regulate these hazardous environmental effects of foundation pit dewatering xu et al 2016 theoretically if the waterproof curtain disregarding the relatively common defects bruce et al 1989 completely cuts off the hydraulic connection of the dewatering aquifer inside and outside the pit the environmental effects of foundation pit dewatering are slight however the increasing excavation depth of the foundation pit increases the required depth of the waterproof curtain to completely cut off the dewatering aquifer which renders construction more challenging and uneconomical presently dewatering inside the pit with waterproof curtain with a partially cut off dewatering aquifer is generally adopted for deep foundation pits shen et al 2017 tan and lu 2017 2018b xu et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 an appropriate depth of the waterproof curtain penetrating the dewatering aquifer is important for effective engineering a few studies indicated that both the depth of the waterproof curtain and the filter length of the pumping well can impact the ground settlement outside the waterproof curtain ni et al 2013 wu et al 2016 foundation pit dewatering should consider the interaction between the waterproof curtain and pumping wells labelled as wall well action generally laboratory tests are adopted to analyse the wall well action on the environmental effects considering the convenient operation and short time wang et al 2018 2019 xu et al 2014 2019 however there is a certain difference between laboratory tests and real construction because of the assumptions in the laboratory tests generally numerical simulations are used to consider the wall well action in practical engineering cases larson et al 2001 chai et al 2004 zheng et al 2014 optimized method has been used in evaluating the optimized soil parameters yin et al 2017 2018 lyu et al 2019b c to evaluate the optimized depth of the waterproof curtain some optimized method can be applied by analyzing the numerical simulation results the objective of this paper is to evaluate optimized depth of the waterproof curtain penetrating the dewatering aquifer during dewatering within foundation pit to protect the environment first the project profile and pumping tests are introduced then the effect of wall well action on the environment is investigated through numerical simulation the reliability of the numerical simulations is verified by the results of pumping tests the relationship between the depth of the waterproof curtain penetrating the dewatering aquifer and the filter length of the pumping wells is discussed finally the appropriate depth of waterproof curtain depth is recommended by optimized method considering the filter length of the pumping wells 2 project description fig 1 shows the plan view of foundation pit and layout of pumping and observational wells in a certain station of metro line no 1 in ningbo which is a coastal city in eastern china sgmeic 2010 the total excavation area of the project is 3960 m2 and the total length of excavation is 172 m the project includes a standard part zone i of length 157 m and a shield end well part zone ii of length 15 m the width of zone i is 19 30 m and that of zone ii is 23 60 m the excavation depth de of zone i is 22 40 m and that of zone ii is 23 96 m a diaphragm wall with a thickness of 1 m is adopted as the foundation pit enclosure structure and waterproof curtain the buried depth of the diaphragm wall dw in zone i is 40 m and that in zone ii is 43 m the elevation of the ground surface in the project is 2 50 to 4 00 m the soil layers from top to bottom are artificial filled soil labelled as 11 silty clay with sand 12 grey mucky silt 13 clay 21 mucky clay 22 mucky soil 23 silt mealy

of the soils are shown in fig 2 soil system related to the project is a typical multi aquifer aquitard alternative strata the aquitard layer is labelled as adi to adiv the groundwater system includes a phreatic aquifer labelled as aq01 confined aquifer in the superficial layer aq02 the first confined aquifer aqi and the second confined aquifer aqii detailed information of the aquifers is described as follows 1 aq01 the buried depth of the groundwater level of aq01 is 0 3 to 1 5 m a negative value implies that it is below ground surface it lies within the layers of silty clay and sand layers 11 and 12 and is affected by rainfall spring tides and surface water the water inflow rate of a single well is 1 10 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is 0 001 1 2 m d 2 aq02 the burial depth of the groundwater level of aq02 layer is 1 0 to 2 5 m it lies within the silt mealy sand layer layer 31 the water inflow rate of a single well is 5 15 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is 0 16 0 41 m d 3 aqi the burial depth of the groundwater level of aqi is 1 7 to 4 m it lies within sandy silt layer layer 53 the water inflow rate of a single well is 15 50 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is 0 01 7 40 m d 4 aqii the burial depth of the groundwater level of aqii is 3 5 to 5 5 m it lies within the silt mealy sand layer layer 81 the water inflow rate of a single well is 200 1500 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is 2 5 45 m d 3 pumping test the acceptable groundwater level to prevent uprush by the underlying confined aquifer can be calculated by the following equation mohurd 2011 1 p s p w h i γ si h p γ w f s where p s is the overburden pressure between the bottom surface of the foundation pit and the top surface of the underlying confined aquifer kpa p w is the uplift force of artesian water in the initial state kpa h i is the thickness of each layer of soil between the bottom surface of the foundation pit and the top surface of the underlying confined aquifer m h p is the difference between the groundwater level and top surface of the confined aquifer m γsi is the unit weight of each soil layer between the bottom surface of the foundation pit and the top surface of the underlying confined aquifer kn m3 γw is the unit weight of water kn m3 and f s is the safety coefficient which is considered as 1 05 in this study mohurd 2011 in this case the bottom of the foundation pit is located on adii h is required to be less than 14 86 m which implies that the drawdown of aqi should be greater than 11 84 m therefore it is necessary to implement foundation pit dewatering to ensure the safety of the foundation pit to evaluate the influence of dewatering on the environment the pumping test should be implemented before construction the pumping tests were conducted after constructing the diaphragm wall in this case the arrangement of pumping and observation wells is shown in fig 1 j1 j6 are pumping wells inside the foundation pit at a buried depth of 40 m jg1 and jg2 are both pumping wells and observation wells inside the foundation pit at a buried depth of 40 m g1 g3 are observation wells outside the foundation at a buried depth of 36 m the structure and insertion depth of wells is shown in fig 3 the pumping tests comprise single well double well and multiple well pumping tests the conditions for each pumping test are displayed in table 1 4 numerical

according to the gearhart theory musy and drobot 2004 the influence radius of dewatering r is 491 4 m which is calculated by the following equation 5 r 10 δ h k where δh is the drawdown of the dewatering aquifer k is the hydraulic conductivity of the dewatering aquifer the plan size of the numerical model is required to be larger than the influence radius the plan size of the numerical model is 1600 m long and 1600 m wide the vertical size of the model is set as 72 m which is the buried depth of the bottom of adiv layer fig 4 shows the three dimensional model domain and the grid mesh the number of nodes and elements in each plane are 1412 and 1470 respectively the mesh size is 100 100 m at a distance outside the foundation pit local refined mesh inside the foundation pit is 4 4 m as shown in fig 5 the hydrogeologic system includes eight strata according to the actual hydrogeological condition and is further subdivided into 29 layers in vertical among which the adi adii adiii and adiv layer are equally subdivided into 3 4 2 and 2 sub layers respectively and aqi and aqii layer are equally subdivided into 12 and 4 sub layers respectively the total number of nodes and elements of the 3d numerical model are 40 948 and 41 160 the placement of diaphragm wall pumping and observation wells is shown in fig 5 according to the engineering case points g11 g12 g21 and g22 are used for the discussion of the simulation results the initial groundwater levels of aq01 aq02 aqi and aqii are set as 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 5 m respectively the groundwater level of the four lateral boundaries is set as fixed hydraulic head boundary which is equal to the initial groundwater level the bottom boundary is set as the confining boundary 4 3 soil parameters initial soil parameters shown in fig 2 are applied in the numerical model to simulate the single well pumping test then the soil parameters are inversed by fitting the results of the numerical simulation with the single well pumping test finally the inversed parameters are applied to simulate the double well and multiple well pumping tests if the simulation result cannot fit the double well and multiple well pumping tests well the soil parameters should be adjusted again according the aforementioned steps finally the soil parameters are determined until the simulation results fit all pumping tests well the final soil parameters determined by the aforementioned steps are tabulated in table 2 fig 6 presents a comparison of the measured and simulated groundwater drawdown of the observation wells in the pumping tests during the process of dewatering the computed groundwater drawdown increases synchronously with the measured data when the pumping wells are turned off the groundwater level rises back to the original level for example as shown in fig 6b the largest measured drawdowns of observation wells j3 and j1 are 5 0 m and 7 4 m respectively in the double well pumping test the largest deviation between the measured and simulated groundwater drawdowns of j3 is 1 18 and that of j1 is 2 01 the simulated result fits the measured data reasonably fig 6c shows the measured and simulated groundwater drawdowns of the observation wells in the multiple well pumping test the observation wells j1 and j6 are inside the foundation pit and g1 and g2 are outside the pit it is apparent that the groundwater drawdowns of the observation wells inside the foundation pit is larger than those outside the foundation pit the largest measured drawdown of the well j6 is 13 7 m whereas it is only 2 5 m for g1 the results demonstrate that the water retaining effect of the diaphragm walls is adequate the largest simulated drawdown of the well j6 is 13 3 m and that of g1 is 2 4 m the deviations are 2 9 and 4 0 respectively these results also demonstrate that the simulated results fit the measured data reasonably 4 4 simulated results the aforementioned numerical model and soil parameters obtained through an inverse analysis are used to analyse the multiple well pumping test to analyse the wall well action on the environmental effects the buried depth of the diaphragm wall and length of the filter of pumping well are varied the buried depth of the diaphragm wall dw ranges from 30 m to 42 m with an increment of 1 m this implies that the depth of the diaphragm wall penetrating the dewatering aquifer d ranges from 0 m to 12 m the top of the pumping well filter is located on the top of the dewatering aquifer layer the buried depth of the bottom of the pumping well filter ranges from 34 m to 42 m with an increment of 1 m this implies that the filter length l changes from 4 m to 12 m fig 7 a shows the ground settlement and groundwater drawdown with different values of d when l is 6 m ground settlement of a point outside the diaphragm wall labelled as g12 is 13 mm when d is 0 m and is approximately 5 mm when d is 11 m the groundwater drawdown of point g12 is 10 20 m when d is 0 m and is 3 43 m when d is 11 m as shown in fig 7b the ground settlement and groundwater drawdown of point g12 both decreases with the increase in d fig 8 a depicts the ground settlement and groundwater drawdown with different values of l when d is 6 m ground settlement at point g12 is 8 mm when l is 4 m and is approximately 9 mm when l is 12 m the groundwater drawdown at point g12 is 7 80 m when l is 4 m and is 8 79 m when l is 12 m both ground settlement and groundwater drawdown increases with the increase in l as shown in fig 8b moreover the degree of influence on the groundwater drawdown and ground settlement outside the foundation pit of d is larger than l 5 discussions 5 1 buried depth of diaphragm wall fig 9 shows the groundwater drawdown at two sides of the diaphragm wall when l is 6 m g11 and g12 and g21 and g22 are two groups of points at the two sides of the diaphragm wall the seepage path increases with the increase in d owing to the blocking effect of the diaphragm wall therefore the groundwater recharge volume from outside the pit to the inside decreases consequently the groundwater drawdown outside the foundation pit decreases with the increase in d whereas that inside the foundation pit increases since the length of foundation pit is much larger than the width the influence of foundation pit borders on dewatering is dissymmetry ou et al 1996 finno et al 2007 which causes the groundwater drawdown of g11 is large while g21 is small the real seepage distance between g11 and g12 is a curve bypassed the bottom of diaphragm wall which is difficult to calculate therefore the seepage distance in calculation process is approximate to the length of a polyline which is from the middle of well filter outside the pit to the diaphragm wall bottom and then to the middle of well filter inside the pit the quotient of the division of the difference in the groundwater levels by the seepage distance between two observation wells is defined to approximate hydraulic gradient δi to analyse the influence of d and l on the groundwater level δi between two points at the two sides of the diaphragm wall including g11 and g12 and g21 and g22 is calculated fig 10 presents the relationship between δi and rd which is defined as the ratio of d to the thickness of the confined aquifer ha on sections i i and ii ii l is set to 6 m and consequently rl the ratio of l to ha is 50 deeper diaphragm wall has better blocking effect on the groundwater seepage so that groundwater drawdown outside the foundation pit decreases with the increase in d so δi increases with the increase in rd the relationship between δi and rd is fitted by the boltzmann curve which can be divided into three change parts namely initial gradual middle sharp and final gentle part the x coordinate of the maximum and minimum value of second derivative of the boltzmann curve is defined as effective and control value of rd respectively initially when rd is small δi increases gradually owing to the negligible water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall then δi increases sharply with the continuous increase in rd when rd is larger than the effective value from this moment the water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall can be gradually observed the gradient of δi at the contraflexure point of the boltzmann curve a2 in fig 10 is the largest the x coordinate of the contraflexure point of boltzmann curve is set as the suggested value of rd when rd is increased to the control value the water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall is not strengthened thus δi gradually increases again to play the water retaining effect rd should vary between the effective and control value in theory the environmental effects of dewatering decrease with the increase in d however deeper diaphragm wall means more expensive and difficult to construct so comprehensive considering the economic and environmental effects the suggested value of rd is recommended in actual engineering the effective suggested and control values of rd for section i i are 45 8 53 5 and 61 3 and for section ii ii are 50 6 55 2 and 59 7 respectively if the groundwater drawdown is regarded as the control objective the effective suggested and control values of rd are approximately 51 56 and 62 respectively when rl is 50 by a comprehensive consideration of the two sections a point on section i i at a distance of 138 m from the diaphragm wall labelled as p1 and a point on section ii ii at a distance of 186 m from the diaphragm wall labelled as p2 are selected to study the relationship between ground settlement s and rd fig 11 on the whole s decreases with the increase in rd because deeper diaphragm wall has better water retaining effect the relationship between s and rd also can be fitted by the boltzmann curve which is divided into three change parts namely initial gradual middle sharp and final gentle part settlement control is critical in construction engineering which requires settlement to be minimised as shown in fig 11a the suggested value of rd is 55 4 for the point p1 and 55 5 for p2 the effective and control values of rd for the point p1 are 40 0 and 70 9 and that for p2 are 40 1 and 70 8 if ground settlement is regarded as the control objective the suggested value of rd is approximately 56 the effective and control values of rd are approximately 41 and 71 respectively when rl is 50 by a comprehensive consideration of the two sections by the comprehensive control of the groundwater drawdown and ground settlement outside the foundation pit after comparing the values decided by δi and s respectively the suggested value of rd is 56 when rl is 50 5 2 filter length the relationship between δi and rl when rd is 50 is shown in fig 12 on the whole δi decreases with an increase in rl because longer filter length makes water retaining effect of diaphragm wall smaller the relationship can also be fitted by the boltzmann curve δi first varies smoothly in initial gradual part and then quickly in middle sharp part and gradually in final gentle part with the increase in rl when rl is small the depth of the diaphragm wall penetrating the dewatering aquifer layer is relatively large this implies that the water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall is remarkable so that the change in δi is small the water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall weakened with the continuous increase in rl and δi decreased sharply when rl was increased to a certain extent δi again decreased gradually according to the aforementioned definition of the effective suggested and control value the three values of rl are 85 6 68 6 51 6 for sections i i and 82 6 67 2 51 8 for section ii ii rl should be larger than the control value but less than the effective value theoretically if rl is small the environmental effects of dewatering are slight however higher pumping rates and long dewatering times are required to ensure groundwater drawdown inside the foundation pit if the filter length is excessively small that is to say shorter well filter make the groundwater drawdown more difficult so comprehensive considering the dewatering efficiency and environmental effects the suggested value of rl is recommended in actual engineering if δi is regarded as the control objective the effective suggested and control values of rl are approximately 82 67 and 51 respectively when rd is 50 by a comprehensive consideration of the two sections fig 13 shows the relationship between s and rl on the whole s increases with an increase in rl because longer filter length makes larger drawdown of groundwater outside the pit and then ground settlement outside the pit also increases the relationship can also be fitted by the boltzmann curve the effective suggested and control values of rl are 94 6 75 7 and 57 0 for the point p1 and are 91 7 74 7 and 57 7 for p2 if ground settlement is regarded as the control objective the control suggested and effective values of rl are 57 74 and 91 respectively when rd is 50 by a comprehensive consideration of the two sections considering the comprehensive control of the groundwater drawdown and ground settlement after comparing the values decided by δi and s respectively the effective suggested and control values of rl are 82 67 and 51 when rd is 50 5 3 relationship between rl and rd to determine the common relationship between rd and rl more cases with different values of d and l were considered each effective suggested and control values of rd with different rl are conducted and the relationship between rd and rl with δi as the control objective is presented in fig 14 the relationship between the effective suggested and control values of rd with rl can be fitted by linear fitting the effective suggested and control values of rd both increase with the increase in rl it is convenient to determine the effective suggested and control values of rd according to the value of rl for example if rl is equal to 70 the effective suggested and control values of rd are 46 7 54 9 and 63 0 on section i i and are 50 9 55 8 and 60 7 on section ii ii therefore if δi is regarded as the control objective rd is recommended to be approximately 56 when rl is 70 on the whole the suggested value of rd is recommended to range from 51 to 57 when rl is larger than 10 as shown in fig 14 when rl increases 10 the effective suggested and control values of rd on section i i increase 4 3 5 9 and 7 4 respectively and are 1 4 2 9 and 4 3 on section ii ii the difference among the effective suggested and control value is about 1 5 the difference between the three values of rd for sections i i and section ii ii is approximately 3 due to the impact of rd on section i i is larger than section ii ii fig 15 presents the relationship between rd and rl when taking s as the control objective the relationship of the effective suggested and control values of rd with rl can be also fitted by linear fitting all of the three values of rd increases with the increase in rl it is convenient to determine the effective suggested and control values of rd according to the value of rl for example when rl is equal to 70 the effective suggested and control values of rd are 42 3 58 0 and 73 7 for p1 and are 42 3 57 9 and 73 5 for p2 therefore if s is regarded as the control objective rd is recommended to be 58 0 when rl is 70 on the whole the suggested value of rd ranges from 50 to 62 when rl is larger than 10 as shown in fig 15 when rl increases 10 the effective suggested and control values of rd on section i i increase 12 6 13 5 and 14 5 and are 12 3 13 5 and 14 6 on section ii ii the difference among the effective suggested and control value is about 1 1 5 4 procedure to search optimized curtain depth ratio rd fig 16 shows the conceptual diagram of the procedure to search optimized curtain depth ratio rd for a given dewatering project the procedure to search optimized rd is as follows i to establish numerical model based on the project profile engineering geology and hydrogeology condition the pumping tests are used to back calculate the hydraulic parameters and verify the reliability of the numerical model ii to analysis the environmental effects due to dewatering by the numerical model δi and s is calculated considering different value of rd and rl iii to evaluate the optimized value of rd for each rl the relationship between δi and s and rd are analyzed by curve fitting after these the effective suggested and control value of rd are obtained by mathematical analysis of the fitted curve although the three values of rd are different in different field project the curtain depth ratio rd can be obtained by following this proposed procedure 6 conclusions this paper investigated the depth of waterproof curtain and filter length of pumping wells in confined aquifer for controlling the environmental impact during dewatering in foundation pit the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 numerical simulation was employed to analyse foundation pit dewatering project the relationship between δi or s with rd or rl can be divided into three change parts namely initial gradual middle sharp and final gentle part three values of rd and rl namely effective suggested and control values are proposed rd and rl should vary between the effective and control value the suggested value of rd and rl is recommended in actual engineering by comprehensive consideration 2 δi increases while s decreases with increase of rd which is because deeper diaphragm wall has better water retaining effect the effective suggested and control values of rd are 41 56 and 71 when rl is 50 by a comprehensive considering of δi and s when rl is 50 rd is recommended to be 56 which is the suggested value of rd 3 δi decreases while s increases with increase in rl because longer filter length reduces water retaining effect of diaphragm wall the effective suggested and control values of rl are 82 67 and 51 when rd is 50 by a comprehensive considering of δi and s when rd is 50 rl is recommended to be 67 which is the suggested value of rl 4 the relationship of the effective suggested and control rd with rl can be fitted linearly so that the effective suggested and control values of rd can be calculated by a linear equation according to the value of rl by a comprehensive considering of δi and s the suggested value of rd ranges from 50 to 62 when rl is larger than 10 declaration of competing interest the authors declared that there is no

6229,dewatering using a combination of waterproof curtain and pumping wells is commonly adopted to ensure the stability of foundation pits in multi aquifer strata however dewatering is likely to result in environmental problems this paper investigates the impact on surroundings owing to the interaction between the waterproof curtain and pumping wells by numerical simulation the depth of the

china such as metro tunnels and foundation pits liao et al 2016 liu et al 2018 2019 lyu et al 2018 2019 tan et al 2019 zhou and liao 2016 without appropriate planning this is likely to result in certain hazards zheng et al 2016 lyu et al 2017 2018a wu et al 2018 2019 xu et al 2018a the excavated depths of foundation pits have increased and excavated areas have also grown e g the hangzhong road station in metro line no 10 of shanghai has an excavation area of over 7500 m2 and is 344 m long and 20 24 m wide zhou et al 2010 the qianjiang century city station in metro line no 2 of hangzhou is 290 m long 22 m wide and 26 m deep wang et al 2017 generally quaternary deposits in the coastal regions of china exhibit multi aquifer aquitard alternative strata xu et al 2009 2017a 2018b shen et al 2013 zeng et al 2018 2019 which are rich in groundwater groundwater control is essential for the safe construction of foundation pits generally one of the measurements conducted to prevent uprush is dewatering while excavating deep foundation pits wu et al 2015a wang et al 2016 however foundation pit dewatering is likely to result in some negative impacts such as soil deformation bawden et al 2001 calderhead et al 2011 xu et al 2012 pujades et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 damage to adjacent buildings and metro lines song et al 2014 tan and lu 2018a wu et al 2017a and sand flow or piping phenomenon zhang et al 2013 before excavation underground structures such as diaphragm walls wu et al 2017b pujades et al 2014 and mixing piles ma et al 2014 have been constructed to improve the stability of foundation pits and reduce the entrance of groundwater to the excavation as waterproof curtain waterproof curtain can reduce the seepage area extend the seepage path and change the seepage direction of groundwater in the foundation pit jiao et al 2008 vilarrasa et al 2011 pujades et al 2012a b therefore a dewatering system combined with waterproof curtain and pumping wells is generally adopted to regulate these hazardous environmental effects of foundation pit dewatering xu et al 2016 theoretically if the waterproof curtain disregarding the relatively common defects bruce et al 1989 completely cuts off the hydraulic connection of the dewatering aquifer inside and outside the pit the environmental effects of foundation pit dewatering are slight however the increasing excavation depth of the foundation pit increases the required depth of the waterproof curtain to completely cut off the dewatering aquifer which renders construction more challenging and uneconomical presently dewatering inside the pit with waterproof curtain with a partially cut off dewatering aquifer is generally adopted for deep foundation pits shen et al 2017 tan and lu 2017 2018b xu et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 an appropriate depth of the waterproof curtain penetrating the dewatering aquifer is important for effective engineering a few studies indicated that both the depth of the waterproof curtain and the filter length of the pumping well can impact the ground settlement outside the waterproof curtain ni et al 2013 wu et al 2016 foundation pit dewatering should consider the interaction between the waterproof curtain and pumping wells labelled as wall well action generally laboratory tests are adopted to analyse the wall well action on the environmental effects considering the convenient operation and short time wang et al 2018 2019 xu et al 2014 2019 however there is a certain difference between laboratory tests and real construction because of the assumptions in the laboratory tests generally numerical simulations are used to consider the wall well action in practical engineering cases larson et al 2001 chai et al 2004 zheng et al 2014 optimized method has been used in evaluating the optimized soil parameters yin et al 2017 2018 lyu et al 2019b c to evaluate the optimized depth of the waterproof curtain some optimized method can be applied by analyzing the numerical simulation results the objective of this paper is to evaluate optimized depth of the waterproof curtain penetrating the dewatering aquifer during dewatering within foundation pit to protect the environment first the project profile and pumping tests are introduced then the effect of wall well action on the environment is investigated through numerical simulation the reliability of the numerical simulations is verified by the results of pumping tests the relationship between the depth of the waterproof curtain penetrating the dewatering aquifer and the filter length of the pumping wells is discussed finally the appropriate depth of waterproof curtain depth is recommended by optimized method considering the filter length of the pumping wells 2 project

2010 the total excavation area of the project is 3960 m2 and the total length of excavation is 172 m the project includes a standard part zone i of length 157 m and a shield end well part zone ii of length 15 m the width of zone i is 19 30 m and that of zone ii is 23 60 m the excavation depth de of zone i is 22 40 m and that of zone ii is 23 96 m a diaphragm wall with a thickness of 1 m is adopted as the foundation pit enclosure structure and waterproof curtain the buried depth of the diaphragm wall dw in zone i is 40 m and that in zone ii is 43 m the elevation of the ground surface in the project is 2 50 to 4 00 m the soil layers from top to bottom are artificial filled soil labelled as 11 silty clay with sand 12 grey mucky silt 13 clay 21 mucky clay 22 mucky soil 23 silt mealy

of the soils are shown in fig 2 soil system related to the project is a typical multi aquifer aquitard alternative strata the aquitard layer is labelled as adi to adiv the groundwater system includes a phreatic aquifer labelled as aq01 confined aquifer in the superficial layer aq02 the first confined aquifer aqi and the second confined aquifer aqii detailed information of the aquifers is described as follows 1 aq01 the buried depth of the groundwater level of aq01 is 0 3 to 1 5 m a negative value implies that it is below ground surface it lies within the layers of silty clay and sand layers 11 and 12 and is affected by rainfall spring tides and surface water the water inflow rate of a single well is 1 10 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is 0 001 1 2 m d 2 aq02 the burial depth of the groundwater level of aq02 layer is 1 0 to 2 5 m it lies within the silt mealy sand layer layer 31 the water inflow rate of a single well is 5 15 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is 0 16 0 41 m d 3 aqi the burial depth of the groundwater level of aqi is 1 7 to 4 m it lies within sandy silt layer layer 53 the water inflow rate of a single well is 15 50 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is 0 01 7 40 m d 4 aqii the burial depth of the groundwater level of aqii is 3 5 to 5 5 m it lies within the silt mealy sand layer layer 81 the water inflow rate of a single well is 200 1500 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is 2 5 45 m d 3 pumping test the acceptable groundwater level to prevent uprush by the underlying confined aquifer can be calculated by the following equation mohurd 2011 1 p s p w h i γ si h p γ w f s where p s is the overburden pressure between the bottom surface of the foundation pit and the top surface of the underlying confined aquifer kpa p w is the uplift force of artesian water in the initial state kpa h i is the thickness of each layer of soil between the bottom surface of the foundation pit and the top surface of the underlying confined aquifer m h p is the difference between the groundwater level and top surface of the confined aquifer m γsi is the unit weight of each soil layer between the bottom surface of the foundation pit and the top surface of the underlying confined aquifer kn m3 γw is the unit weight of water kn m3 and f s is the safety coefficient which is considered as 1 05 in this study mohurd 2011 in this case the bottom of the foundation pit is located on adii h is required to be less than 14 86 m which implies that the drawdown of aqi should be greater than 11 84 m therefore it is necessary to implement foundation pit dewatering to ensure the safety of the foundation pit to evaluate the influence of dewatering on the environment the pumping test should be implemented before construction the pumping tests were conducted after constructing the diaphragm wall in this case the arrangement of pumping and observation wells is shown in fig 1 j1 j6 are pumping wells inside the foundation pit at a buried depth of 40 m jg1 and jg2 are both pumping wells and observation wells inside the foundation pit at a buried depth of 40 m g1 g3 are observation wells outside the foundation at a buried depth of 36 m the structure and insertion depth of wells is shown in fig 3 the pumping tests comprise single well double well and multiple well pumping tests the conditions for each pumping test are displayed in table 1 4 numerical analysis 4 1 numerical theory a numerical simulation method which combines three dimensional 3d groundwater seepage model and one dimensional 1d consolidation settlement model is used to analyse the environmental effects of dewatering shen and xu 2011 xu et al 2012 wu et al 2015b the basic equation of 3d groundwater seepage model is bear 1979 2 x i k ij h x j q s s h t where k ij hydraulic

according to the gearhart theory musy and drobot 2004 the influence radius of dewatering r is 491 4 m which is calculated by the following equation 5 r 10 δ h k where δh is the drawdown of the dewatering aquifer k is the hydraulic conductivity of the dewatering aquifer the plan size of the numerical model is required to be larger than the influence radius the plan size of the numerical model is 1600 m long and 1600 m wide the vertical size of the model is set as 72 m which is the buried depth of the bottom of adiv layer fig 4 shows the three dimensional model domain and the grid mesh the number of nodes and elements in each plane are 1412 and 1470 respectively the mesh size is 100 100 m at a distance outside the foundation pit local refined mesh inside the foundation pit is 4 4 m as shown in fig 5 the hydrogeologic system includes eight strata according to the actual hydrogeological condition and is further subdivided into 29 layers in vertical among which the adi adii adiii and adiv layer are equally subdivided into 3 4 2 and 2 sub layers respectively and aqi and aqii layer are equally subdivided into 12 and 4 sub layers respectively the total number of nodes and elements of the 3d numerical model are 40 948 and 41 160 the placement of diaphragm wall pumping and observation wells is shown in fig 5 according to the engineering case points g11 g12 g21 and g22 are used for the discussion of the simulation results the initial groundwater levels of aq01 aq02 aqi and aqii are set as 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 5 m respectively the groundwater level of the four lateral boundaries is set as fixed hydraulic head boundary which is equal to the initial groundwater level the bottom boundary is set as the confining boundary 4 3 soil parameters initial soil parameters shown in fig 2 are applied in the numerical model to simulate the single well pumping test then the soil parameters are inversed by fitting the results of the numerical simulation with the single well pumping test finally the inversed parameters are applied to simulate the double well and multiple well pumping tests if the simulation result cannot fit the double well and multiple well pumping tests well the soil parameters should be adjusted again according the aforementioned steps finally the soil parameters are determined until the simulation results fit all pumping tests well the final soil parameters determined by the aforementioned steps are tabulated in table 2 fig 6 presents a comparison of the measured and simulated groundwater drawdown of the observation wells in the pumping tests during the process of dewatering the computed groundwater drawdown increases synchronously with the measured data when the pumping wells are turned off the groundwater level rises back to the original level for example as shown in fig 6b the largest measured drawdowns of observation wells j3 and j1 are 5 0 m and 7 4 m respectively in the double well pumping test the largest deviation between the measured and simulated groundwater drawdowns of j3 is 1 18 and that of j1 is 2 01 the simulated result fits the measured data reasonably fig 6c shows the measured and simulated groundwater drawdowns of the observation wells in the multiple well pumping test the observation wells j1 and j6 are inside the foundation pit and g1 and g2 are outside the pit it is apparent that the groundwater drawdowns of the observation wells inside the foundation pit is larger than those outside the foundation pit the largest measured drawdown of the well j6 is 13 7 m whereas it is only 2 5 m for g1 the results demonstrate that the water retaining effect of the diaphragm walls is adequate the largest simulated drawdown of the well j6 is 13 3 m and that of g1 is 2 4 m the deviations are 2 9 and 4 0 respectively these results also demonstrate that the simulated results fit the measured data reasonably 4 4 simulated results the aforementioned numerical model and soil parameters obtained through an inverse analysis are used to analyse the multiple well pumping test to analyse the wall well action on the environmental effects the buried depth of the diaphragm wall and length of the filter of pumping well are varied the buried depth of the diaphragm wall dw ranges from 30 m to 42 m with an increment of 1 m this implies that the depth of the diaphragm wall penetrating the dewatering aquifer d ranges from 0 m to 12 m the top of the pumping well filter is located on the top of the dewatering aquifer layer the buried depth of the bottom of the pumping well filter ranges from 34 m to 42 m with an increment of 1 m this implies that the filter length l changes from 4 m to 12 m fig 7 a shows the ground settlement and groundwater drawdown with different values of d when l is 6 m ground settlement of a point outside the diaphragm wall labelled as g12 is 13 mm when d is 0 m and is approximately 5 mm when d is 11 m the groundwater drawdown of point g12 is 10 20 m when d is 0 m and is 3 43 m when d is 11 m as shown in fig 7b the ground settlement and groundwater drawdown of point g12 both decreases with the increase in d fig 8 a depicts the ground settlement and groundwater drawdown with different values of l when d is 6 m ground settlement at point g12 is 8 mm when l is 4 m and is approximately 9 mm when l is 12 m the groundwater drawdown at point g12 is 7 80 m when l is 4 m and is 8 79 m when l is 12 m both ground settlement and groundwater drawdown increases with the increase in l as shown in fig 8b moreover the degree of influence on the groundwater drawdown and ground settlement outside the foundation pit of d is larger than l 5 discussions 5 1 buried depth of diaphragm wall fig 9 shows the groundwater drawdown at two sides of the diaphragm wall when l is 6 m g11 and g12 and g21 and g22 are two groups of points at the two sides of the diaphragm wall the seepage path increases with the increase in d owing to the blocking effect of the diaphragm wall therefore the groundwater recharge volume from outside the pit to the inside decreases consequently the groundwater drawdown outside the foundation pit decreases with the increase in d whereas that inside the foundation pit increases since the length of foundation pit is much larger than the width the influence of foundation pit borders on dewatering is dissymmetry ou et al 1996 finno et al 2007 which causes the groundwater drawdown of g11 is large while g21 is small the real seepage distance between g11 and g12 is a curve bypassed the bottom of diaphragm wall which is difficult to calculate therefore the seepage distance in calculation process is approximate to the length of a polyline which is from the middle of well filter outside the pit to the diaphragm wall bottom and then to the middle of well filter inside the pit the quotient of the division of the difference in the groundwater levels by the seepage distance between two observation wells is defined to approximate hydraulic gradient δi to analyse the influence of d and l on the groundwater level δi between two points at the two sides of the diaphragm wall including g11 and g12 and g21 and g22 is calculated fig 10 presents the relationship between δi and rd which is defined as the ratio of d to the thickness of the confined aquifer ha on sections i i and ii ii l is set to 6 m and consequently rl the ratio of l to ha is 50 deeper diaphragm wall has better blocking effect on the groundwater seepage so that groundwater drawdown outside the foundation pit decreases with the increase in d so δi increases with the increase in rd the relationship between δi and rd is fitted by the boltzmann curve which can be divided into three change parts namely initial gradual middle sharp and final gentle part the x coordinate of the maximum and minimum value of second derivative of the boltzmann curve is defined as effective and control value of rd respectively initially when rd is small δi increases gradually owing to the negligible water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall then δi increases sharply with the continuous increase in rd when rd is larger than the effective value from this moment the water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall can be gradually observed the gradient of δi at the contraflexure point of the boltzmann curve a2 in fig 10 is the largest the x coordinate of the contraflexure point of boltzmann curve is set as the suggested value of rd when rd is increased to the control value the water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall is not strengthened thus δi gradually increases again to play the water retaining effect rd should vary between the effective and control value in theory the environmental effects of dewatering decrease with the increase in d however deeper diaphragm wall means more expensive and difficult to construct so comprehensive considering the economic and environmental effects the suggested value of rd is recommended in actual engineering the effective suggested and control values of rd for section i i are 45 8 53 5 and 61 3 and for section ii ii are 50 6 55 2 and 59 7 respectively if the groundwater drawdown is regarded as the control objective the effective suggested and control values of rd are approximately 51 56 and 62 respectively when rl is 50 by a comprehensive consideration of the two sections a point on section i i at a distance of 138 m from the diaphragm wall labelled as p1 and a point on section ii ii at a distance of 186 m from the diaphragm wall labelled as p2 are selected to study the relationship between ground settlement s and rd fig 11 on the whole s decreases with the increase in rd because deeper diaphragm wall has better water retaining effect the relationship between s and rd also can be fitted by the boltzmann curve which is divided into three change parts namely initial gradual middle sharp and final gentle part settlement control is critical in construction engineering which requires settlement to be minimised as shown in fig 11a the suggested value of rd is 55 4 for the point p1 and 55 5 for p2 the effective and control values of rd for the point p1 are 40 0 and 70 9 and that for p2 are 40 1 and 70 8 if ground settlement is regarded as the control objective the suggested value of rd is approximately 56 the effective and control values of rd are approximately 41 and 71 respectively when rl is 50 by a comprehensive consideration of the two sections by the comprehensive control of the groundwater drawdown and ground settlement outside the foundation pit after comparing the values decided by δi and s respectively the suggested value of rd is 56 when rl is 50 5 2 filter length the relationship between δi and rl when rd is 50 is shown in fig 12 on the whole δi decreases with an increase in rl because longer filter length makes water retaining effect of diaphragm wall smaller the relationship can also be fitted by the boltzmann curve δi first varies smoothly in initial gradual part and then quickly in middle sharp part and gradually in final gentle part with the increase in rl when rl is small the depth of the diaphragm wall penetrating the dewatering aquifer layer is relatively large this implies that the water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall is remarkable so that the change in δi is small the water retaining effect of the diaphragm wall weakened with the continuous increase in rl and δi decreased sharply when rl was increased to a certain extent δi again decreased gradually according to the aforementioned definition of the effective suggested and control value the three values of rl are 85 6 68 6 51 6 for sections i i and 82 6 67 2 51 8 for section ii ii rl should be larger than the control value but less than the effective value theoretically if rl is small the environmental effects of dewatering are slight however higher pumping rates and long dewatering times are required to ensure groundwater drawdown inside the foundation pit if the filter length is excessively small that is to say shorter well filter make the groundwater drawdown more difficult so comprehensive considering the dewatering efficiency and environmental effects the suggested value of rl is recommended in actual engineering if δi is regarded as the control objective the effective suggested and control values of rl are approximately 82 67 and 51 respectively when rd is 50 by a comprehensive consideration of the two sections fig 13 shows the relationship between s and rl on the whole s increases with an increase in rl because longer filter length makes larger drawdown of groundwater outside the pit and then ground settlement outside the pit also increases the relationship can also be fitted by the boltzmann curve the effective suggested and control values of rl are 94 6 75 7 and 57 0 for the point p1 and are 91 7 74 7 and 57 7 for p2 if ground settlement is regarded as the control objective the control suggested and effective values of rl are 57 74 and 91 respectively when rd is 50 by a comprehensive consideration of the two sections considering the comprehensive control of the groundwater drawdown and ground settlement after comparing the values decided by δi and s respectively the effective suggested and control values of rl are 82 67 and 51 when rd is 50 5 3 relationship between rl and rd to determine the common relationship between rd and rl more cases with different values of d and l were considered each effective suggested and control values of rd with different rl are conducted and the relationship between rd and rl with δi as the control objective is presented in fig 14 the relationship between the effective suggested and control values of rd with rl can be fitted by linear fitting the effective suggested and control values of rd both increase with the increase in rl it is convenient to determine the effective suggested and control values of rd according to the value of rl for example if rl is equal to 70 the effective suggested and control values of rd are 46 7 54 9 and 63 0 on section i i and are 50 9 55 8 and 60 7 on section ii ii therefore if δi is regarded as the control objective rd is recommended to be approximately 56 when rl is 70 on the whole the suggested value of rd is recommended to range from 51 to 57 when rl is larger than 10 as shown in fig 14 when rl increases 10 the effective suggested and control values of rd on section i i increase 4 3 5 9 and 7 4 respectively and are 1 4 2 9 and 4 3 on section ii ii the difference among the effective suggested and control value is about 1 5 the difference between the three values of rd for sections i i and section ii ii is approximately 3 due to the impact of rd on section i i is larger than section ii ii fig 15 presents the relationship between rd and rl when taking s as the control objective the relationship of the effective suggested and control values of rd with rl can be also fitted by linear fitting all of the three values of rd increases with the increase in rl it is convenient to determine the effective suggested and control values of rd according to the value of rl for example when rl is equal to 70 the effective suggested and control values of rd are 42 3 58 0 and 73 7 for p1 and are 42 3 57 9 and 73 5 for p2 therefore if s is regarded as the control objective rd is recommended to be 58 0 when rl is 70 on the whole the suggested value of rd ranges from 50 to 62 when rl is larger than 10 as shown in fig 15 when rl increases 10 the effective suggested and control values of rd on section i i increase 12 6 13 5 and 14 5 and are 12 3 13 5 and 14 6 on section ii ii the difference among the effective suggested and control value is about 1 1 5 4 procedure to search optimized curtain depth ratio rd fig 16 shows the conceptual diagram of the procedure to search optimized curtain depth ratio rd for a given dewatering project the procedure to search optimized rd is as follows i to establish numerical model based on the project profile engineering geology and hydrogeology condition the pumping tests are used to back calculate the hydraulic parameters and verify the reliability of the numerical model ii to analysis the environmental effects due to dewatering by the numerical model δi and s is calculated considering different value of rd and rl iii to evaluate the optimized value of rd for each rl the relationship between δi and s and rd are analyzed by curve fitting after these the effective suggested and control value of rd are obtained by mathematical analysis of the fitted curve although the three values of rd are different in different field project the curtain depth ratio rd can be obtained by following this proposed procedure 6 conclusions this paper investigated the depth of waterproof curtain and filter length of pumping wells in confined aquifer for controlling the environmental impact during dewatering in foundation pit the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 numerical simulation was employed to analyse foundation pit dewatering project the relationship between δi or s with rd or rl can be divided into three change parts namely initial gradual middle sharp and final gentle part three values of rd and rl namely effective suggested and control values are proposed rd and rl should vary between the effective and control value the suggested value of rd and rl is recommended in actual engineering by comprehensive consideration 2 δi increases while s decreases with increase of rd which is because deeper diaphragm wall has better water retaining effect the effective suggested and control values of rd are 41 56 and 71 when rl is 50 by a comprehensive considering of δi and s when rl is 50 rd is recommended to be 56 which is the suggested value of rd 3 δi decreases while s increases with increase in rl because longer filter length reduces water retaining effect of diaphragm wall the effective suggested and control values of rl are 82 67 and 51 when rd is 50 by a comprehensive considering of δi and s when rd is 50 rl is recommended to be 67 which is the suggested value of rl 4 the relationship of the effective suggested and control rd with rl can be fitted linearly so that the effective suggested and control values of rd can be calculated by a linear equation according to the value of rl by a comprehensive considering of δi and s the suggested value of rd ranges from 50 to 62 when rl is larger than 10 declaration of competing interest the authors declared that there is no
