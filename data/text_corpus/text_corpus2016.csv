10080,a large amount of the water diverted for irrigated agriculture seeps from earthen canals during its conveyance to fields besides a shortfall in water availability a variety of environmental and economic damages are caused by canal seepage polymer sealants provide an economical alternative to permanent liners for reducing seepage from earthen canals temporarily field studies of the polymer sealant linear anionic polyacrylamide lapam conducted on two canals in colorado usa and on a canal in sindh pakistan reveal the potential usefulness of lapam to substantially lower seepage losses lapam application rates for the three experiments on the canals in colorado were 14 2 18 3 and 12 1 kg per ha of canal wetted perimeter area and was 12 4 kg ha for the canal in pakistan flowing water balance tests show a decline of 69 100 in seepage rates for a period of up to three months after lapam application uncertainty analysis of the pre and post application tests on the colorado canals indicates an 85 likelihood that seepage reduction of some magnitude occurred guidelines are presented for conducting further studies of lapam and other polymer sealants to systematically determine the impact of several factors that influence seepage control effectiveness keywords seepage loss polymer sealant linear anionic polyacrylamide earthen canals water conveyance irrigation 1 introduction irrigation is by far the largest human intervention in the hydrologic cycle altering amounts timing and location of flows to provide the water needed to boost crop productivity to levels that can sustain an ever growing world population the vast social and economic benefits of irrigated agriculture are universally recognized leading to the diversion of nearly 70 80 of the world s diverted freshwater resources ayars et al 2006 hotchkiss et al 2001 kinzli et al 2010 given the current worldwide competition for limited water supplies improving irrigation water management is paramount in most irrigation schemes water is conveyed through earthen channels from the point of diversion out of the hydrologic system to the fields where the water is applied unfortunately unless preventative measures are taken earthen canals leak substantially reducing the quantity and quality of water available for agriculture seepage losses worldwide have been estimated to be 17 70 of canal flows sharma 1975 usgs 1990 lentz 2003 fipps 2005 kahlown and kemper 2005 kinzli et al 2010 kulkarni and nagarjan 2019 in 1978 the united states department of interior estimated that about 17 of the total water lost due to irrigation inefficiencies in 61 study areas throughout the western united states was potentially preventable by controlling canal seepage usdoi 1978 due to the aging of water infrastructure in the western united states and the lack of resources for expensive large scale canal lining projects over recent decades the loss prevention potential is likely even higher today fig 1 illustrates processes that generate water loss and agro environmental degradation due to canal seepage causing inefficient flow conveyance seepage directly diminishes water available for agricultural use also because seepage contributes to shallower groundwater and capillary groundwater upflux seepage results in non beneficial water consumption by evapotranspiration from fallow and naturally vegetated areas canal seepage also degrades soil groundwater and surface water quality upflux from shallow groundwater brings salts into near surface soils with resulting evaporative concentration and may also lead to waterlogging of cropped fields these factors result in long term declines in crop yields kahlown and azam 2002 z√∂rb et al 2019 additionally return flows from seepage mobilize salts nutrients and geogenic toxic trace elements to aquifers streams and eventually to environmental receptors usgs 1990 burkhalter and gates 2005 burt et al 2010 gates et al 2012 2016 bailey et al 2015 further degrading water quality and environmental health the economic losses or mitigation costs associated with this damage are substantial qadir et al 2014 sharp et al 2016 identifying and reducing canal seepage has been identified as a principal best management practice for preserving water quantity and quality in agriculture tavakoli kivi 2018 shultz et al 2018 aliyari et al 2019 numerous technologies are available including permanent liners e g concrete asphalt geomembranes and less permanent sealants e g bentonite clay water soluble polymers concrete liners have been shown to reduce seepage by 50 97 and can have a life span ranging from 20 to 60 years if constructed correctly usda 1997 swihart and haynes 2002 kahlown and kemper 2005 buried concrete covered or exposed geomembranes reduced seepage from canals in the western united states comer et al 1996 resulting in up to 95 conveyance efficiency swihart and haynes 2002 however the substantial up front capital costs associated with permanent liners along with on going maintenance costs can exceed benefits in many agricultural applications wichelns and oster 2006 besides permanent liners are difficult to remove and cannot be implemented intermittently as water availability varies e g allowing seepage for intentional groundwater recharge during periods of water surplus and preventing water loss from seepage during periods of water scarcity finally liners can act as physical barriers that permanently prevent return flows derived from seepage possibly violating the water rights of downstream users who may be entitled to upstream return flows hayes 1991 rohmat et al 2020 sealants provide a more palatable alternative for seepage mitigation in many circumstances principally due to lower up front costs and the ability to implement seepage mitigation on an as needed basis anionic polyacrylamide pam is most widely used for these reasons there are different forms of anionic pam which include low cost linear anionic polyacrylamide lapam and cross linked pam cross linked pam has a high molecular weight and includes molecular crosslinks such that the polymer does not dissolve in water but instead absorbs water to form a super absorbent hydrogel lapam in particular has shown significant promise as an effective sealant for temporary e g one water season seepage control from earthen canals and ditches in both lab and field similar water soluble polymers are used to reduce leakage from energy and mine waste evaporation ponds and environmental containment facilities scalia et al 2018 the seepage reduction mechanism of lapam involves sediment lapam floc formation as described in detail by sojka et al 2007 when lapam which is water soluble comes in contact with suspended sediments in the canal water the sediments interact with the polymer chains to form flocs that grow large enough to settle to the canal perimeter the deposition of flocs composed of fine grained minerals around the canal perimeter reduces permeability and thereby the seepage rate additionally lapam increases water viscosity which restricts the penetration of water from the canal perimeter of note for lapam to be effective the canal water should carry a sufficient load of total suspended solids tss to date only a few field studies have been reported on the use of various forms of polyacrylamide pam not all linear for mitigating seepage lentz and kincaid 2008 treated the sides of an irrigation reservoir with a 1 g l lapam solution or different combinations of cross linked pam granules and nacl to achieve an average 50 reduction in seepage compared to pre application rates however pam in emulsion form is found to have adverse impacts on the aquatic environment as compared to its granular form weston et al 2009 the field scale experimental studies reported herein used pam in the granular form uribe et al 2013 reported the application of granular lapam using a motorboat on 11 different reaches of earthen irrigation canals in chile and found some degree of seepage reduction in 80 of the cases in 16 cases where an apparent decrease in seepage was reported the average reduction was 58 for at least 27 days however uribe et al 2013 did not provide the details of their lapam application methods the field conditions at the time of application the seepage measurement techniques or an estimate of the uncertainty in their results in a technical report published by the desert research institute susfalk et al 2008 report that within 24 h of the application of lapam in granular form to earthen canals in montana and colorado seepage was reduced by 28 87 in 8 of 11 experiments critically if the correct procedure and rate of application of lapam are not followed lapam will not reduce seepage story et al 2013 susfalk et al 2007 present a set of guidelines for successful field application of lapam finally young et al 2007 describe risks associated with the use of lapam to reduce seepage including 1 the impacts on human and ecological health of residual acrylamide monomer from the lapam that is released in the environment and 2 physiological impacts of lapam when released into streams on benthic organisms young et al 2007 conclude that from an ecotoxicological perspective little effect is expected from the residual acrylamide within lapam herein we lay out the conditions methods and results of field campaigns to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of lapam tests were conducted on respective reaches of 4 8 km and 4 km length along two canals in colorado usa and on a 5 3 km reach of a canal in sindh pakistan quantification of seepage using the flowing water balance technique and lapam application methods are described moreover in the case of the two colorado canals we follow the procedures described in martin and gates 2014 specifically developed for these canals to add an estimate of the uncertainty in the calculations of seepage loss reduction finally recommended guidelines are presented for an enhanced framework to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of lapam or other linear anionic polymer sealants to control canal seepage under a variety of field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design our field studies to evaluate the effectiveness of lapam at reducing canal seepage consisted of the following components 1 site selection 2 measurement of baseline pre application of lapam seepage conditions 3 calculation of the required lapam application rate following the guidelines provided by susfalk et al 2007 4 application of lapam 4 measurement of post application seepage conditions and 5 evaluation of lapam effectiveness in canal seepage reduction materials procedures and considerations related to each of these components are described in this section 2 2 study sites reaches were selected along three mid sized earthen irrigation canals for this investigation critical criteria for site selection included 1 interest and agreement by canal managers and farmers to cooperate in a research study 2 canal reaches which a have few obstructions to hinder seepage measurements and polymer application b are sufficiently long such that seepage losses exceed measurement errors associated with the flowing water balance method c have few or ideally zero flow diversions and inflows or the ability to close off these diversions and inflows during seepage measurements and d have pathways along canal banks that facilitate equipment material and personnel access the catlin and rocky ford highline rfh canals in colorado were measured and treated with lapam during 2006 and 2007 a similar study was conducted on the tarah canal in sindh in 2018 2 2 1 catlin and rocky ford highline canals the catlin and rfh canals divert flow from the arkansas river in the irrigated lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado fig 2 the maximum flow capacities of the catlin and rfh canals are 9 7 m3 s and 13 3 m3 s respectively the catlin canal services about 7550 ha and the rfh services about 21 000 ha of irrigated farmland for both canals input from canal managers and farmers regarding the presence of substantial seepage losses along the study reaches helped us select sites where seepage rates would suitably exceed measurement errors the canals cross section geometry along the study reaches was relatively uniform with no substantial obstacles martin 2015 a 4 8 km reach of the catlin canal near rocky ford co was studied in 2006 but this study reach was shortened to 3 8 km in 2007 to avoid flow diversions along a portion of the reach the reach cut through gravelly loam silty loam and clay loam soils the main drawback of the catlin canal reach was its location 42 km downstream from the canal head gate on the arkansas river potentially making the reach susceptible to unsteady flow rates and storage changes due to fluctuating flow from 176 diversions along the upstream portion of the canal a 4 km reach of the rfh canal traversing through gravelly sandy loam silty clay and clay loam soils near fowler co also was studied in 2006 it was located only about 7 4 km downstream of the canal head gate presenting less concern about unsteady flow 2 2 2 tarah canal the tarah canal is located about 25 km southeast of sakrand in the hala subdivision sindh pakistan and offtakes from the hala branch canal supplied from the rohri canal which in turn diverts from the indus river fig 3 the design capacity of the tarah canal is about 9 0 m3 s and the canal delivers water to approximately 13 600 ha of irrigated land a 5 3 km reach of the tarah canal with anecdotal reports of high seepage loss was selected for investigation the reach is located about 3 5 km downstream of the headgate on the hala branch canal runs through predominantly sandy loam soil and has a relatively uniform cross section geometry with no significant obstacles however typical of distributary canals in this region there are 18 outlets to farm channels along the reach the need to ensure that these outlets remained closed during seepage studies posed a significant challenge requiring close cooperation with the sindh irrigation department and local farmers 2 3 measurement of pre treatment and post treatment canal seepage the flowing water balance method of seepage estimation was used in this study the method requires measurement of discharge at the upstream end q us m3 s and downstream end q ds m3 s of a control volume defined along a canal reach during a test period Œ¥t s estimation or measurement of any inflows q i m3 s or flow diversions q d m3 s along the reach quantification of any storage change s m3 s that may occur within the canal control volume over the duration of the seepage test and estimation of outflow by water surface evaporation q e m3 s and inflow from precipitation q p m3 s fig 4 canal seepage along the measurement reach q s m3 s is calculated from the water balance equation 1 q s q u s q d s q i q d q e q p s t ideally seepage tests are conducted during periods when q i q d and q p are zero or negligible seepage tests on all canal study reaches were conducted both before and after treatment with lapam martin and gates 2014 and martin 2015 report the results of multiple tests conducted on the catlin and rfh canals within a period of up to 3 5 months before the lapam application however here only pre application tests conducted within five days of application are reported describing conditions in the canal just before the lapam application after treatment ten post application tests over about five months were then performed on the catlin canal reach in 2006 and twelve post application tests over about three months in 2007 on the rfh canal six post application tests were conducted within 3 5 months of treatment finally two post application tests were performed on the tarah canal after polymer treatment martin and gates 2014 and martin 2015 provide detailed accounts of the tools and methods to measure or estimate each of the terms in eq 1 the canal flow rates q us and q ds were measured using either acoustic doppler velocimeters advs or acoustic doppler current profilers adcps on the catlin and rfh canals a sontek flowtracker adv and a teledyne streampro adcp were used for flow measurement on the tarah canal a sontek riversurveyor m9 adcp was used in a small number of tests flows were measured simultaneously at both ends of the canal reach but in most cases downstream measurements were lagged as the project team measured q us upstream at the beginning of the test and then moved immediately downstream to measure q ds the advantages and disadvantages of the simultaneous versus lagged measurement approaches are discussed in martin and gates 2014 in 2006 staff gauges were installed at the upstream and downstream ends of the test reaches in both the catlin and rfh canals these staff gages were used in conjunction with the doppler flow measurement devices to measure water surface fluctuations for use in calculating s t staff gauge readings were recorded every 5 15 min while measuring q us and q ds in 2007 calibrated onset hobo and in situ leveltroll 300 water level data loggers were installed for this purpose at three locations along the catlin canal study reach and recorded water level data at 15 minute intervals in the tarah canal three global water instruments wl16u water level loggers were installed along the study reach and recorded water level data at 15 minute intervals a total of 17 20 and 19 cross sections were surveyed to describe the hydraulic geometry along the reaches of the catlin rfh and tarah canals respectively finally in nine out of 37 seepage tests conducted on the three canals small amounts of q d occurred along the canal reach and were manually measured on a volumetric basis values of q e were calculated by multiplying estimates of the rate of free surface water evaporation during each test by the water surface area within the canal study reach for the catlin and rfh canals the penman combination method jensen and allen 2016 was used to estimate free surface water evaporation using climatic data gathered from nearby colorado state university coagmet weather stations during the seepage tests martin 2015 the coagmet station used for computing q e for the catlin canal was located about 8 5 km from the canal study reach and that used for the rfh canal was located approximately 22 1 km from the site for the tarah canal free surface water evaporation values reported by the central cotton research institute in sakrand about 27 km from the canal study reach were used to calculate q e we intentionally avoided testing during periods of precipitation i e q p was zero for all tests 2 4 treatment of canals with lapam 2 4 1 chemical characteristics of the lapam used the typical molecular weight for anionic pam is between 10 and 20 mg mol green and stott 1999 lu et al 2002 sojka et al 2007 young et al 2007 this polymer uses cation bridging to bond to negatively charged soil particles suspended in water seybold 1994 sojka et al 2007 theng 1982 cations form the bridge between the negatively charged polymer and negatively charged particulate that would otherwise repel each other divalent cations commonly found in surface water such as mg2 and ca2 are highly effective in forming the cation bridges required to develop these bonds more so than monovalent cations such as na and k gregory 1996 lu et al 2002 susfalk et al 2008 lapam is a synthetic polymer principally used to treat drinking water for conditioning potable water sludges and for sugar processing resulting in high quality sugar and greater yield however inherent environmental and human health risks are still present when applying lapam due to unpolymerized acrylamide monomer a neurotoxin suspected to be a human carcinogen seybold 1994 who 1985 young et al 2007 as such the united states environmental protection agency epa and the food and drug administration fda have set the allowable concentrations for residual acrylamide in lapam young et al 2007 anionic pam used for most applications contains less than 0 05 acrylamide by weight of the total mixture sojka et al 2007 guidelines for the safe use of lapam at a field scale are presented by susfalk et al 2007 and nrcs 2005 the granular sodium lapam used on the catlin and rfh canals was stokopam manufactured by evonik industries in essen germany and obtained from jt water management llc of parker colorado this lapam has a minimum molecular weight of 12 mg mol an anionic charge density of 30 5 and an assumed 92 active ingredient with a moisture content of 4 on the tarah canal granular magnafloc lt27 ag manufactured by basf corporation and obtained from basf pakistan in karachi was used this polymer has an average molecular weight of 12 mg mol and is approximately 30 by weight sodium acrylate acrylamide polymer with an active content greater than 90 by weight and moisture content targeting around 5 7 the methods and tools used to treat the canals with these lapam compounds are discussed in the following sub sections 2 4 2 lapam application using a motorboat to apply lapam in granular form over the water surface in each canal fertilizer spreaders loaded with lapam and small jon boats with outboard motor were employed fig 5 the application was started from the downstream end of the treatment reach and proceeded to the upstream end with the turbulence created by the motor enhancing the mixing of the polymer in the canal water the vigorous and relatively uniform dispersion of polymer granules over the water surface by broadcasting enhances robust sediment lapam floc formation an automatic fertilizer spreader mounted on the boat or a hand held spreader either hand operated or automatic was used to spread the polymer over the canal water surface before the polymer application a pre application trial was conducted in the field to synchronize the speed of the boat with the required speed and throw of the spreaders a total of 3 5 personnel were engaged on the boat to apply the polymer drive the boat deflect floating debris and refill the spreaders personnel operating the spreaders took safety measures to prevent direct exposure to the lapam by wearing protective coveralls respiratory masks and transparent goggles during the application process a vehicle traveled along the canal bank carrying pre weighed bags of granular lapam for transfer to personnel on the boat when the supplies on the boat were consumed care was taken in the boat during treatment to avoid slipping on polymer coated surfaces product safety guidelines were followed for the clean up of any lapam in the boat after application another possible way of using lapam for seepage and erosion control in agricultural applications is to inject lapam stock solutions into the canal water weston et al 2009 however lapam concentrations in stock solutions are limited by high viscosity which increases the volumes required and makes it challenging to transport and distribute lapam additionally because stock solutions are extremely sticky and gluey a significant amount of polymer will adhere to the transport tanks and will ultimately clog the injectors 2 4 3 field conditions for lapam application susfalk et al 2008 report that canal water ideally should contain turbidity levels of more than 80 100 nephelometric turbidity units ntu or tss levels of 150 200 mg l before being treated with lapam suspended sediment in the canal water was measured before each lapam application for the catlin and rfh canals water samples were collected from the study reaches and a turbidity meter was used to measure the turbidity in ntu turbidity levels of about 270 ntu and 400 ntu were measured just before the lapam application in 2006 to the rfh canal and in 2007 to the catlin canal respectively exceeding the recommended minimum ntu for the tarah canal water samples were collected from four locations spread along the study reach just before the lapam application using a us dh 48 depth integrating suspended sediment sampler and were analyzed in the laboratory for tss values range from 289 to 397 mg l exceeding the recommended minimum tss level 2 4 4 lapam applications to the canals in colorado and sindh the conditions of the lapam application in kg per ha of wetted perimeter for the treatment reach of each canal are summarized in table 1 the application varied with the wetted perimeter and ranged between 12 1 and 18 3 kg ha for the four sets of experiments except for the lapam application on the rfh canal where an automatic fertilizer spreader mounted at the front of a boat in 2006 fig 5a was used hand held fertilizer spreaders were used to spread lapam over the canal water surface 2 5 evaluation of lapam effectiveness 2 5 1 calculation and comparison of pre and post application seepage using measured or estimated flow variables from flowing water balance seepage tests conducted before and after the lapam application deterministic estimates of q s were computed using eq 1 for all three canals to facilitate a comparison of results for canal reaches of different sizes q s values were divided by the canal wetted perimeter area at the time of each test to obtain the seepage rate per unit area q ÀÜ s m3 s ha the wetted perimeter area a p was calculated using the surveyed cross sections along each canal test reach and the flow depth at each surveyed cross section during each seepage test regardless of the method of seepage measurement i e adcp or adv lagged or simultaneous all of the pre treatment q ÀÜ s measurements were averaged the post treatment q ÀÜ s values were individually compared to this pre treatment average value of q ÀÜ s additionally results were summarized for post treatment seepage tests performed after approximate intervals of 1 day 1 week 1 month and 2 months post treatment q ÀÜ s values measured at times close to these specified intervals or calculated as an average of two values measured near these intervals were used to calculate corresponding percent reductions in seepage 2 5 2 estimation of uncertainty in seepage estimates each of the components involved in solving the flowing water balance model in eq 1 to estimate q s i e discharge measurement surface water evaporation estimation stage data and the measurement of canal geometry introduce a degree of uncertainty in the estimate due to random or systematic errors and spatial variability martin and gates 2014 presented a method to account for these sources of uncertainty in estimating q s and q ÀÜ s in application to the catlin and rfh canals they considered a form of type b uncertainty iso 2008 that assigns probability distributions and associated statistics which are derived from available data and scientific judgment to describe probable errors over interpercentile ranges ir around measured or estimated quantities cox et al 2003 herschy 2004 in this approach the true value of a variable is assumed to be equal to the measured or estimated value plus an error which could be positive or negative in other words the value lies within what harmel and smith 2007 describe as a probable error range for example if we expect to measure a flow rate in the canal within a probable error range of 10 of the true value with a 90 probability we would take the values at the upper and lower ends of the 90th ir range i e at the 5th and 95th percentiles for a given probability distribution function pdf to be equal to 90 and 110 of the measured flow rate respectively martin and gates 2014 used monte carlo simulation to analyze the uncertainty in estimating canal seepage using measurements made in conjunction with the flowing water balance method uncertainty in each component of eq 1 was addressed by modeling the component as a random variable with an associated probable error range over an ir governed by a pdf each variable in eq 1 is a function of one or more variables or parameters directly measured or estimated from available data table 2 summarizes the probable error range ir and associated pdf assigned to variables or parameters used by martin and gates 2014 and subsequently applied in this study using eq 1 to compute q s for each pre application and post application test in each case the equation was solved using 5000 joint monte carlo realizations of the random variables to obtain a distribution of possible values of q s and associated values of q ÀÜ s for which related pdfs and statistics could be estimated the rationale and methods used are presented in detail in martin and gates 2014 and are not repeated here in the present study the work of martin and gates 2014 was extended by computing probability distributions and statistics of the difference between pre application and post application values of q ÀÜ s for the catlin and rfh canals to approximate the uncertainty in estimations of lapam effectiveness an uncertainty analysis was not performed for the tarah canal because of the comparatively limited field data also given the similar seepage data collection and polymer application methodology followed in both locations we assumed the uncertainty calculated for the colorado tests provides an initial estimate of the general uncertainty associated with tests performed by similar methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 calculated seepage from measurements pre and post application with lapam measured and estimated components of the flowing water balance along with calculated values of q s and q ÀÜ s are summarized in tables 3 6 for tests conducted pre and post application with lapam on the catlin canal in 2006 and 2007 the rfh canal in 2006 and the tarah canal in 2018 respectively seepage reductions in percentages for catlin canal in 2006 and 2007 rfh canal in 2006 and tarah canal in 2018 respectively are summarized in table 7 the results of the seepage tests show 69 100 reductions in seepage because of polymer application for all cases flow conditions at the upstream end of the canal reach for pre and post application tests were similar stable geometry and fairly steady flow rates of similar magnitude with differences between pre and post application average measured q us values ranging between only 1 and 15 the q ÀÜ s estimated from post application tests were in all cases lower than those estimated from pre application tests similar to the findings by uribe et al 2013 negative values of q ÀÜ s were calculated in the present study for 10 out of the 30 reported post application flowing water balance tests we hypothesize that these negative values are the result of return flow from canal bank storage causing net flow accumulation to the canal reach for the test however for simplicity we assigned negative values of q ÀÜ s to be zero for use in calculating the seepage reduction between pre and post application conditions 3 2 uncertainty in the estimation of seepage reduction relative frequency histograms and box and whisker plots of the distributions of the estimates of q ÀÜ s generated via monte carlo simulation are presented side by side in fig 6 for tests conducted pre and post application of lapam on the catlin canal in 2006 and 2007 and in the rfh canal in 2006 while the generated frequency histograms of pre and post lapam estimates of q s ÀÜ overlap indicative of the test uncertainty the means of the post lapam q s ÀÜ values are always less than those of the pre lapam values moreover taking into account all significant sources of error computed differences in the realizations of q ÀÜ s estimates from tests conducted just before and just after lapam treatment reveals that 85 86 and 88 of these differences were positive for the catlin canal in 2006 the catlin canal in 2007 and the rfh canal in 2006 respectively in other words there are likelihoods of about 85 86 and 88 that some magnitude of seepage reduction due to lapam application did occur along these canal reaches 4 future investigation of polymers for canal seepage control the results reported in this study illustrate the potential effectiveness of canal sealing via lapam to reduce seepage we hope that this study can stimulate future research on linear anionic polymers to reduce canal seepage however our study did not systematically address the relative influence of numerous factors associated with the effectiveness of lapam these factors are outlined in the following section finally based on lessons learned from the studies outlined herein recommended guidelines for improving future systematic field investigation of polymers for canal seepage reduction are presented 4 1 influencing factors for future study numerous factors are known or anticipated to influence the effectiveness of lapam at reducing canal seepage to optimize the use of lapam further investigation of the following parameters is recommended parameters are grouped based on hypothesized influence on seepage reduction within a range of reasonable natural conditions for water conveyance canals parameters of major hypothesized significance include polymer dosage rate a dosage rate of approximately 11 kg ha of the wetted perimeter is recommended by susfalk et al 2008 however specific guidance is needed to better determine how polymer dosage rate affects the magnitude of seepage reduction and should be modified based on other factors listed subsequently tss a tss of 150 mg l is recommended by susfalk et al 2008 however the interplay between polymer dosage and tss is poorly understood tss can be readily controlled in the field by timing e g the early season during spring runoff sediments or by bed raking etc canal bed soil texture our studies evaluated a limited set of canal bed soil textures additional work is needed to understand the effectiveness and limitations of lapam based seepage reduction in canals with banks and bed composed of a range of sediment textures polymer type although two specific commercially available lapams are demonstrated to be viable canal sealants additional work is needed to identify the particular attributes of lapam that maximize seepage reduction also the synthetic nature of lapam and the possible presence of residual acrylamide monomer may limit the social acceptance of this technology additional research is needed to identify alternative greener polymers that are effective and economically viable for use in canal sealing factors of moderate hypothesized significance include tds 200 mg l is recommended by susfalk et al 2008 the ratio of monovalent to divalent cations sediment mineralogy flow velocity and bed shear stress and gradient to groundwater factors of minor hypothesized significance include water temperature although small variability in temperature is commonly expected during irrigation seasons canal geometry bank vegetation and polymer application method 4 2 recommendations for improved field studies accurate seepage calculations using eq 1 depends on accurate data the best use of the mass balance equation to solve for the seepage rates is only possible for a time period where all water level loggers collect data and all outlets from and inlets to the canal have been shut off all outlets and inlets should be closed at least one hour before each test to allow flow stabilization in addition outlets and inlets along the watercourse should be monitored during the test to ensure that closure is maintained for the duration of treatment or seepage measurements often as was the case in the present study a single team and single flow measurement device e g adcp adv is used to measure both q us and q ds in such cases it is desirable in the weeks preceding the test to make several flow measurements at each of the upstream and downstream ends of the canal study reach to develop rating equations for describing the flow rate as a function of the water level stage stage discharge rating equations may then be developed to estimate the flow rate at a cross section if the water level changes during the portion of the test when flow measurements are not being made at that cross section water level loggers or staff gauge readings every 15 min can be used to create a large dataset for analysis 5 summary and conclusions as an alternative to costly conventional lining the polymer sealant lapam was investigated to assess its effectiveness for reducing seepage losses from earthen canals results from 37 flowing water balance tests conducted in the field on three different mid sized canals reveal the potential for lapam to substantially lower seepage losses over an extended portion of the irrigation season tests on two canals in colorado usa showed estimated seepage reduction ranging from about 69 100 sustained for up to three months after lapam application tests on a canal in sindh pakistan showed a drop in seepage rate of about 81 100 for up to one month following the lapam application consideration of measurement and estimation error in the tests conducted on the colorado canals reveals significant uncertainty in test results nevertheless accounting for this uncertainty in results the likelihood that seepage losses from these canals in fact were reduced by lapam was estimated to exceed about 85 although the study presented here shows the potential of lapam to control seepage losses on typical irrigation canals it does not systematically assess the relative influence of the several factors that influence the degree of lapam efficacy these factors include type and application rate of polymer tss canal bed texture and multiple other factors and they require further study to optimize the safe use of lapam for canal seepage mitigation also alternative polymer sealants that are more environmentally acceptable need to be similarly investigated guidelines for conducting more refined research efforts including addressing a

lapam application rates for the three experiments on the canals in colorado were 14 2 18 3 and 12 1 kg per ha of canal wetted perimeter area and was 12 4 kg ha for the canal in pakistan flowing water balance tests show a decline of 69 100 in seepage rates for a period of up to three months after lapam application uncertainty analysis of the pre and post application tests on the colorado canals indicates an 85 likelihood that seepage reduction of some magnitude occurred guidelines are presented for conducting further studies of lapam and other polymer sealants to systematically determine the impact of several factors that influence seepage control effectiveness keywords seepage loss polymer sealant linear anionic polyacrylamide earthen canals water conveyance irrigation 1 introduction irrigation is by far the largest human intervention in the hydrologic cycle altering amounts timing and location of flows to provide the water needed to boost crop productivity to levels that can sustain an ever growing world population the vast social and economic benefits of irrigated agriculture are universally recognized leading to the diversion of nearly 70 80 of the world s diverted freshwater resources ayars et al 2006 hotchkiss et al 2001 kinzli et al 2010 given the current worldwide competition for limited water supplies improving irrigation water management is paramount in most irrigation schemes water is conveyed through earthen channels from the point of diversion out of the hydrologic system to the fields where the water is applied unfortunately unless preventative measures are taken earthen canals leak substantially reducing the quantity and quality of water available for agriculture seepage losses worldwide have been estimated to be 17 70 of canal flows sharma 1975 usgs 1990 lentz 2003 fipps 2005 kahlown and kemper 2005 kinzli et al 2010 kulkarni and nagarjan 2019 in 1978 the united states department of interior estimated that about 17 of the total water lost due to irrigation inefficiencies in 61 study areas throughout the western united states was potentially preventable by controlling canal seepage usdoi 1978 due to the aging of water infrastructure in the western united states and the lack of resources for expensive large scale canal lining projects over recent decades the loss prevention potential is likely even higher today fig 1 illustrates processes that generate water loss and agro environmental degradation due to canal seepage causing inefficient flow conveyance seepage directly diminishes water available for agricultural use also because seepage contributes to shallower groundwater and capillary groundwater upflux seepage results in non beneficial water consumption by evapotranspiration from fallow and naturally vegetated areas canal seepage also degrades soil groundwater and surface water quality upflux from shallow groundwater brings salts into near surface soils with resulting evaporative concentration and may also lead to waterlogging of cropped fields these factors result in long term declines in crop yields kahlown and azam 2002 z√∂rb et al 2019 additionally return flows from seepage mobilize salts nutrients and geogenic toxic trace elements to aquifers streams and eventually to environmental receptors usgs 1990 burkhalter and gates 2005 burt et al 2010 gates et al 2012 2016 bailey et al 2015 further degrading water quality and environmental health the economic losses or mitigation costs associated with this damage are substantial qadir et al 2014 sharp et al 2016 identifying and reducing canal seepage has been identified as a principal best management practice for preserving water quantity and quality in agriculture tavakoli kivi 2018 shultz et al 2018 aliyari et al 2019 numerous technologies are available including permanent liners e g concrete asphalt geomembranes and less permanent sealants e g bentonite clay water soluble polymers concrete liners have been shown to reduce seepage by 50 97 and can have a life span ranging from 20 to 60 years if constructed correctly usda 1997 swihart and haynes 2002 kahlown and kemper 2005 buried concrete covered or exposed geomembranes reduced seepage from canals in the western united states comer et al 1996 resulting in up to 95 conveyance efficiency swihart and haynes 2002 however the substantial up front capital costs associated with permanent liners along with on going maintenance costs can exceed benefits in many agricultural applications wichelns and oster 2006 besides permanent liners are difficult to remove and cannot be implemented intermittently as water availability varies e g allowing seepage for intentional groundwater recharge during periods of water surplus and preventing water loss from seepage during periods of water scarcity finally liners can act as physical barriers that permanently prevent return flows derived from seepage possibly violating the water rights of downstream users who may be entitled to upstream return flows hayes 1991 rohmat et al 2020 sealants provide a more palatable alternative for seepage mitigation in many circumstances principally due to lower up front costs and the ability to implement seepage mitigation on an as needed basis anionic polyacrylamide pam is most widely used for these reasons there are different forms of anionic pam which include low cost linear anionic polyacrylamide lapam and cross linked pam cross linked pam has a high molecular weight and includes molecular crosslinks such that the polymer does not dissolve in water but instead absorbs water to form a super absorbent hydrogel lapam in particular has shown significant promise as an effective sealant for temporary e g one water season seepage control from earthen canals and ditches in both lab and field similar water soluble polymers are used to reduce leakage from energy and mine waste evaporation ponds and environmental containment facilities scalia et al 2018 the seepage reduction mechanism of lapam involves sediment lapam floc formation as described in detail by sojka et al 2007 when lapam which is water soluble comes in contact with suspended sediments in the canal water the sediments interact with the polymer chains to form flocs that grow large enough to settle to the canal perimeter the deposition of flocs composed of fine grained minerals around the canal perimeter reduces permeability and thereby the seepage rate additionally lapam increases water viscosity which restricts the penetration of water from the canal perimeter of note for lapam to be effective the canal water should carry a sufficient load of total suspended solids tss to date only a few field studies have been reported on the use of various forms of polyacrylamide pam not all linear for mitigating seepage lentz and kincaid 2008 treated the sides of an irrigation reservoir with a 1 g l lapam solution or different combinations of cross linked pam granules and nacl to achieve an average 50 reduction in seepage compared to pre application rates however pam in emulsion form is found to have adverse impacts on the aquatic environment as compared to its granular form weston et al 2009 the field scale experimental studies reported herein used pam in the granular form uribe et al 2013 reported the application of granular lapam using a motorboat on 11 different reaches of earthen irrigation canals in chile and found some degree of seepage reduction in 80 of the cases in 16 cases where an apparent decrease in seepage was reported the average reduction was 58 for at least 27 days however uribe et al 2013 did not provide the details of their lapam application methods the field conditions at the time of application the seepage measurement techniques or an estimate of the uncertainty in their results in a technical report published by the desert research institute susfalk et al 2008 report that within 24 h of the application of lapam in granular form to earthen canals in montana and colorado seepage was reduced by 28 87 in 8 of 11 experiments critically if the correct procedure and rate of application of lapam are not followed lapam will not reduce seepage story et al 2013 susfalk et al 2007 present a set of guidelines for successful field application of lapam finally young et al 2007 describe risks associated with the use of lapam to reduce seepage including 1 the impacts on human and ecological health of residual acrylamide monomer from the lapam that is released in the environment and 2 physiological impacts of lapam when released into streams on benthic organisms young et al 2007 conclude that from an ecotoxicological perspective little effect is expected from the residual acrylamide within lapam herein we lay out the conditions methods and results of field campaigns to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of lapam tests were conducted on respective reaches of 4 8 km and 4 km length along two canals in colorado usa and on a 5 3 km reach of a canal in sindh pakistan quantification of seepage using the flowing water balance technique and lapam application methods are described moreover in the case of the two colorado canals we follow the procedures described in martin and gates 2014 specifically developed for these canals to add an estimate of the uncertainty in the calculations of seepage loss reduction finally recommended guidelines are presented for an enhanced framework to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of lapam or other linear anionic polymer sealants to control canal seepage under a variety of field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design our field studies to evaluate the effectiveness of lapam at reducing canal seepage consisted of the following components 1 site selection 2 measurement of baseline pre application of lapam seepage conditions 3 calculation of the required lapam application rate following the guidelines provided by susfalk et al 2007 4 application of lapam 4 measurement of post application seepage conditions and 5 evaluation of lapam effectiveness in canal seepage reduction materials procedures and considerations related to each of these components are described in this section 2 2 study sites reaches were selected along three mid sized earthen irrigation canals for this investigation critical criteria for site selection included 1 interest and agreement by canal managers and farmers to cooperate in a research study 2 canal reaches which a have few obstructions to hinder seepage measurements and polymer application b are sufficiently long such that seepage losses exceed measurement errors associated with the flowing water balance method c have few or ideally zero flow diversions and inflows or the ability to close off these diversions and inflows during seepage measurements and d have pathways along canal banks that facilitate equipment material and personnel access the catlin and rocky ford highline rfh canals in colorado were measured and treated with lapam during 2006 and 2007 a similar study was conducted on the tarah canal in sindh in 2018 2 2 1 catlin and rocky ford highline canals the catlin and rfh canals divert flow from the arkansas river in the irrigated lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado fig 2 the maximum flow capacities of the catlin and rfh canals are 9 7 m3 s and 13 3 m3 s respectively the catlin canal services about 7550 ha and the rfh services about 21 000 ha of irrigated farmland for both canals input from canal managers and farmers regarding the presence of substantial seepage losses along the study reaches helped us select sites where seepage rates would suitably exceed measurement errors the canals cross section geometry along the study reaches was relatively uniform with no substantial obstacles martin 2015 a 4 8 km reach of the catlin canal near rocky ford co was studied in 2006 but this study reach was shortened to 3 8 km in 2007 to avoid flow diversions along a portion of the reach the reach cut through gravelly loam silty loam and clay loam soils the main drawback of the catlin canal reach was its location 42 km downstream from the canal head gate on the arkansas river potentially making the reach susceptible to unsteady flow rates and storage changes due to fluctuating flow from 176 diversions along the upstream portion of the canal a 4 km reach of the rfh canal traversing through gravelly sandy loam silty clay and clay loam soils near fowler co also was studied in 2006 it was located only about 7 4 km downstream of the canal head gate presenting less concern about unsteady flow 2 2 2 tarah canal the tarah canal is located about 25 km southeast of sakrand in the hala subdivision sindh pakistan and offtakes from the hala branch canal supplied from the rohri canal which in turn diverts from the indus river fig 3 the design capacity of the tarah canal is about 9 0 m3 s and the canal delivers water to approximately 13 600 ha of irrigated land a 5 3 km reach of the tarah canal with anecdotal reports of high seepage loss was selected for investigation the reach is located about 3 5 km downstream of the headgate on the hala branch canal runs through predominantly sandy loam soil and has a relatively uniform cross section geometry with no significant obstacles however typical of distributary canals in this region there are 18 outlets to farm channels along the reach the need to ensure that these outlets remained closed during seepage studies posed a significant challenge requiring close cooperation with the sindh irrigation department and local farmers 2 3 measurement of pre treatment and post treatment canal seepage the flowing water balance method of seepage estimation was used in this study the method requires measurement of discharge at the upstream end q us m3 s and downstream end q ds m3 s of a control volume defined along a canal reach during a test period Œ¥t s estimation or measurement of any inflows q i m3 s or flow diversions q d m3 s along the reach quantification of any storage change s m3 s that may occur within the canal control volume over the duration of the seepage test and estimation of outflow by water surface evaporation q e m3 s and inflow from precipitation q p m3 s fig 4 canal seepage along the measurement reach q s m3 s is calculated from the water balance equation 1 q s q u s q d s q i q d q e q p s t ideally seepage tests are conducted during periods when q i q d and q p are zero or negligible seepage tests on all canal study reaches were conducted both before and after treatment with lapam martin and gates 2014 and martin 2015 report the results of multiple tests conducted on the catlin and rfh canals within a period of up to 3 5 months before the lapam application however here only pre application tests conducted within five days of application are reported describing conditions in the canal just before the lapam application after treatment ten post application tests over about five months were then performed on the catlin canal reach in 2006 and twelve post application tests over about three months in 2007 on the rfh canal six post application tests were conducted within 3 5 months of treatment finally two post application tests were performed on the tarah canal after polymer treatment martin and gates 2014 and martin 2015 provide detailed accounts of the tools and methods to measure or estimate each of the terms in eq 1 the canal flow rates q us and q ds were measured using either acoustic doppler velocimeters advs or acoustic doppler current profilers adcps on the catlin and rfh canals a sontek flowtracker adv and a teledyne streampro adcp were used for flow measurement on the tarah canal a sontek riversurveyor m9 adcp was used in a small number of tests flows were measured simultaneously at both ends of the canal reach but in most cases downstream measurements were lagged as the project team measured q us upstream at the beginning of the test and then moved immediately downstream to measure q ds the advantages and disadvantages of the simultaneous versus lagged measurement approaches are discussed in martin and gates 2014 in 2006 staff gauges were installed at the upstream and downstream ends of the test reaches in both the catlin and rfh canals these staff gages were used in conjunction with the doppler flow measurement devices to measure water surface fluctuations for use in calculating s t staff gauge readings were recorded every 5 15 min while measuring q us and q ds in 2007 calibrated onset hobo and in situ leveltroll 300 water level data loggers were installed for this purpose at three locations along the catlin canal study reach and recorded water level data at 15 minute intervals in the tarah canal three global water instruments wl16u water level loggers were installed along the study reach and recorded water level data at 15 minute intervals a total of 17 20 and 19 cross sections were surveyed to describe the hydraulic geometry along the reaches of the catlin rfh and tarah canals respectively finally in nine out of 37 seepage tests conducted on the three canals small amounts of q d occurred along the canal reach and were manually measured on a volumetric basis values of q e were calculated by multiplying estimates of the rate of free surface water evaporation during each test by the water surface area within the canal study reach for the catlin and rfh canals the penman combination method jensen and allen 2016 was used to estimate free surface water evaporation using climatic data gathered from nearby colorado state university coagmet weather stations during the seepage tests martin 2015 the coagmet station used for computing q e for the catlin canal was located about 8 5 km from the canal study reach and that used for the rfh canal was located approximately 22 1 km from the site for the tarah canal free surface water evaporation values reported by the central cotton research institute in sakrand about 27 km from the canal study reach were used to calculate q e we intentionally avoided testing during periods of precipitation i e q p was zero for all tests 2 4 treatment of canals with lapam 2 4 1 chemical characteristics of the lapam used the typical molecular weight for anionic pam is between 10 and 20 mg mol green and stott 1999 lu et al 2002 sojka et al 2007 young et al 2007 this polymer uses cation bridging to bond to negatively charged soil particles suspended in water seybold 1994 sojka et al 2007 theng 1982 cations form the bridge between the negatively charged polymer and negatively charged particulate that would otherwise repel each other divalent cations commonly found in surface water such as mg2 and ca2 are highly effective in forming the cation bridges required to develop these bonds more so than monovalent cations such as na and k gregory 1996 lu et al 2002 susfalk et al 2008 lapam is a synthetic polymer principally used to treat drinking water for conditioning potable water sludges and for sugar processing resulting in high quality sugar and greater yield however inherent environmental and human health risks are still present when applying lapam due to unpolymerized acrylamide monomer a neurotoxin suspected to be a human carcinogen seybold 1994 who 1985 young et al 2007 as such the united states environmental protection agency epa and the food and drug administration fda have set the allowable concentrations for residual acrylamide in lapam young et al 2007 anionic pam used for most applications contains less than 0 05 acrylamide by weight of the total mixture sojka et al 2007 guidelines for the safe use of lapam at a field scale are presented by susfalk et al 2007 and nrcs 2005 the granular sodium lapam used on the catlin and rfh canals was stokopam manufactured by evonik industries in essen germany and obtained from jt water management llc of parker colorado this lapam has a minimum molecular weight of 12 mg mol an anionic charge density of 30 5 and an assumed 92 active ingredient with a moisture content of 4 on the tarah canal granular magnafloc lt27 ag manufactured by basf corporation and obtained from basf pakistan in karachi was used this polymer has an average molecular weight of 12 mg mol and is approximately 30 by weight sodium acrylate acrylamide polymer with an active content greater than 90 by weight and moisture content targeting around 5 7 the methods and tools used to treat the canals with these lapam compounds are discussed in the following sub sections 2 4 2 lapam application using a motorboat to apply lapam in granular form over the water surface in each canal fertilizer spreaders loaded with lapam and small jon boats with outboard motor were employed fig 5 the application was started from the downstream end of the treatment reach and proceeded to the upstream end with the turbulence created by the motor enhancing the mixing of the polymer in the canal water the vigorous and relatively uniform dispersion of polymer granules over the water surface by broadcasting enhances robust sediment lapam floc formation an automatic fertilizer spreader mounted on the boat or a hand held spreader either hand operated or automatic was used to spread the polymer over the canal water surface before the polymer application a pre application trial was conducted in the field to synchronize the speed of the boat with the required speed and throw of the spreaders a total of 3 5 personnel were engaged on the boat to apply the polymer drive the boat deflect floating debris and refill the spreaders personnel operating the spreaders took safety measures to prevent direct exposure to the lapam by wearing protective coveralls respiratory masks and transparent goggles during the application process a vehicle traveled along the canal bank carrying pre weighed bags of granular lapam for transfer to personnel on the boat when the supplies on the boat were consumed care was taken in the boat during treatment to avoid slipping on polymer coated surfaces product safety guidelines were followed for the clean up of any lapam in the boat after application another possible way of using lapam for seepage and erosion control in agricultural applications is to inject lapam stock solutions into the canal water weston et al 2009 however lapam concentrations in stock solutions are limited by high viscosity which increases the volumes required and makes it challenging to transport and distribute lapam additionally because stock solutions are extremely sticky and gluey a significant amount of polymer will adhere to the transport tanks and will ultimately clog the injectors 2 4 3 field conditions for lapam application susfalk et al 2008 report that canal water ideally should contain turbidity levels of more than 80 100 nephelometric turbidity units ntu or tss levels of 150 200 mg l before being treated with lapam suspended sediment in the canal water was measured before each lapam application for the catlin and rfh canals water samples were collected from the study reaches and a turbidity meter was used to measure the turbidity in ntu turbidity levels of about 270 ntu and 400 ntu were measured just before the lapam application in 2006 to the rfh canal and in 2007 to the catlin canal respectively exceeding the recommended minimum ntu for the tarah canal water samples were collected from four locations spread along the study reach just before the lapam application using a us dh 48 depth integrating suspended sediment sampler and were analyzed in the laboratory for tss values range from 289 to 397 mg l exceeding the recommended minimum tss level 2 4 4 lapam applications to the canals in colorado and sindh the conditions of the lapam application in kg per ha of wetted perimeter for the treatment reach of each canal are summarized in table 1 the application varied with the wetted perimeter and ranged between 12 1 and 18 3 kg ha for the four sets of experiments except for the lapam application on the rfh canal where an automatic fertilizer spreader mounted at the front of a boat in 2006 fig 5a was used hand held fertilizer spreaders were used to spread lapam over the canal water surface 2 5 evaluation of lapam effectiveness 2 5 1 calculation and comparison of pre and post application seepage using measured or estimated flow variables from flowing water balance seepage tests conducted before and after the lapam application deterministic estimates of q s were computed using eq 1 for all three canals to facilitate a comparison of results for canal reaches of different sizes q s values were divided by the canal wetted perimeter area at the time of each test to obtain the seepage rate per unit area q ÀÜ s m3 s ha the wetted perimeter area a p was calculated using the surveyed cross sections along each canal test reach and the flow depth at each surveyed cross section during each seepage test regardless of the method of seepage measurement i e adcp or adv lagged or simultaneous all of the pre treatment q ÀÜ s measurements were averaged the post treatment q ÀÜ s values were individually compared to this pre treatment average value of q ÀÜ s additionally results were summarized for post treatment seepage tests performed after approximate intervals of 1 day 1 week 1 month and 2 months post treatment q ÀÜ s values measured at times close to these specified intervals or calculated as an average of two values measured near these intervals were used to calculate corresponding percent reductions in seepage 2 5 2 estimation of uncertainty in seepage estimates each of the components involved in solving the flowing water balance model in eq 1 to estimate q s i e discharge measurement surface water evaporation estimation stage data and the measurement of canal geometry introduce a degree of uncertainty in the estimate due to random or systematic errors and spatial variability martin and gates 2014 presented a method to account for these sources of uncertainty in estimating q s and q ÀÜ s in application to the catlin and rfh canals they considered a form of type b uncertainty iso 2008 that assigns probability distributions and associated statistics which are derived from available data and scientific judgment to describe probable errors over interpercentile ranges ir around measured or estimated quantities cox et al 2003 herschy 2004 in this approach the true value of a variable is assumed to be equal to the measured or estimated value plus an error which could be positive or negative in other words the value lies within what harmel and smith 2007 describe as a probable error range for example if we expect to measure a flow rate in the canal within a probable error range of 10 of the true value with a 90 probability we would take the values at the upper and lower ends of the 90th ir range i e at the 5th and 95th percentiles for a given probability distribution function pdf to be equal to 90 and 110 of the measured flow rate respectively martin and gates 2014 used monte carlo simulation to analyze the uncertainty in estimating canal seepage using measurements made in conjunction with the flowing water balance method uncertainty in each component of eq 1 was addressed by modeling the component as a random variable with an associated probable error range over an ir governed by a pdf each variable in eq 1 is a function of one or more variables or parameters directly measured or estimated from available data table 2 summarizes the probable error range ir and associated pdf assigned to variables or parameters used by martin and gates 2014 and subsequently applied in this study using eq 1 to compute q s for each pre application and post application test in each case the equation was solved using 5000 joint monte carlo realizations of the random variables to obtain a distribution of possible values of q s and associated values of q ÀÜ s for which related pdfs and statistics could be estimated the rationale and methods used are presented in detail in martin and gates 2014 and are not repeated here in the present study the work of martin and gates 2014 was extended by computing probability distributions and statistics of the difference between pre application and post application values of q ÀÜ s for the catlin and rfh canals to approximate the uncertainty in estimations of lapam effectiveness an uncertainty analysis was not performed for the tarah canal because of the comparatively limited field data also given the similar seepage data collection and polymer application methodology followed in both locations we assumed the uncertainty calculated for the colorado tests provides an initial estimate of the general uncertainty associated with tests performed by similar methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 calculated seepage from measurements pre and post application with lapam measured and estimated components of the flowing water balance along with calculated values of q s and q ÀÜ s are summarized in tables 3 6 for tests conducted pre and post application with lapam on the catlin canal in 2006 and 2007 the rfh canal in 2006 and the tarah canal in 2018 respectively seepage reductions in percentages for catlin canal in 2006 and 2007 rfh canal in 2006 and tarah canal in 2018 respectively are summarized in table 7 the results of the seepage tests show 69 100 reductions in seepage because of polymer application for all cases flow conditions at the upstream end of the canal reach for pre and post application tests were similar stable geometry and fairly steady flow rates of similar magnitude with differences between pre and post application average measured q us values ranging between only 1 and 15 the q ÀÜ s estimated from post application tests were in all cases lower than those estimated from pre application tests similar to the findings by uribe et al 2013 negative values of q ÀÜ s were calculated in the present study for 10 out of the 30 reported post application flowing water balance tests we hypothesize that these negative values are the result of return flow from canal bank storage causing net flow accumulation to the canal reach for the test however for simplicity we assigned negative values of q ÀÜ s to be zero for use in calculating the seepage reduction between pre and post application conditions 3 2 uncertainty in the estimation of seepage reduction relative frequency histograms and box and whisker plots of the distributions of the estimates of q ÀÜ s generated via monte carlo simulation are presented side by side in fig 6 for tests conducted pre and post application of lapam on the catlin canal in 2006 and 2007 and in the rfh canal in 2006 while the generated frequency histograms of pre and post lapam estimates of q s ÀÜ overlap indicative of the test uncertainty the means of the post lapam q s ÀÜ values are always less than those of the pre lapam values moreover taking into account all significant sources of error computed differences in the realizations of q ÀÜ s estimates from tests conducted just before and just after lapam treatment reveals that 85 86 and 88 of these differences were positive for the catlin canal in 2006 the catlin canal in 2007 and the rfh canal in 2006 respectively in other words there are likelihoods of about 85 86 and 88 that some magnitude of seepage reduction due to lapam application did occur along these canal reaches 4 future investigation of polymers for canal seepage control the results reported in this study illustrate the potential effectiveness of canal sealing via lapam to reduce seepage we hope that this study can stimulate future research on linear anionic polymers to reduce canal seepage however our study did not systematically address the relative influence of numerous factors associated with the effectiveness of lapam these factors are outlined in the following section finally based on lessons learned from the studies outlined herein recommended guidelines for improving future systematic field investigation of polymers for canal seepage reduction are presented 4 1 influencing factors for future study numerous factors are known or anticipated to influence the effectiveness of lapam at reducing canal seepage to optimize the use of lapam further investigation of the following parameters is recommended parameters are grouped based on hypothesized influence on seepage reduction within a range of reasonable natural conditions for water conveyance canals parameters of major hypothesized significance include polymer dosage rate a dosage rate of approximately 11 kg ha of the wetted perimeter is recommended by susfalk et al 2008 however specific guidance is needed to better determine how polymer dosage rate affects the magnitude of seepage reduction and should be modified based on other factors listed subsequently tss a tss of 150 mg l is recommended by susfalk et al 2008 however the interplay between polymer dosage and tss is poorly understood tss can be readily controlled in the field by timing e g the early season during spring runoff sediments or by bed raking etc canal bed soil texture our studies evaluated a limited set of canal bed soil textures additional work is needed to understand the effectiveness and limitations of lapam based seepage reduction in canals with banks and bed composed of a range of sediment textures polymer type although two specific commercially available lapams are demonstrated to be viable canal sealants additional work is needed to identify the particular attributes of lapam that maximize seepage reduction also the synthetic nature of lapam and the possible presence of residual acrylamide monomer may limit the social acceptance of this technology additional research is needed to identify alternative greener polymers that are effective and economically viable for use in canal sealing factors of moderate hypothesized significance include tds 200 mg l is recommended by susfalk et al 2008 the ratio of monovalent to divalent cations sediment mineralogy flow velocity and bed shear stress and gradient to groundwater factors of minor hypothesized significance include water temperature although small variability in temperature is commonly expected during irrigation seasons canal geometry bank vegetation and polymer application method 4 2 recommendations for improved field studies accurate seepage calculations using eq 1 depends on accurate data the best use of the mass balance equation to solve for the seepage rates is only possible for a time period where all water level loggers collect data and all outlets from and inlets to the canal have been shut off all outlets and inlets should be closed at least one hour before each test to allow flow stabilization in addition outlets and inlets along the watercourse should be monitored during the test to ensure that closure is maintained for the duration of treatment or seepage measurements often as was the case in the present study a single team and single flow measurement device e g adcp adv is used to measure both q us and q ds in such cases it is desirable in the weeks preceding the test to make several flow measurements at each of the upstream and downstream ends of the canal study reach to develop rating equations for describing the flow rate as a function of the water level stage stage discharge rating equations may then be developed to estimate the flow rate at a cross section if the water level changes during the portion of the test when flow measurements are not being made at that cross section water level loggers or staff gauge readings every 15 min can be used to create a large dataset for analysis 5 summary and conclusions as an alternative to costly conventional lining the polymer sealant lapam was investigated to assess its effectiveness for reducing seepage losses from earthen canals results from 37 flowing water balance tests conducted in the field on three different mid sized canals reveal the potential for lapam to substantially lower seepage losses over an extended portion of the irrigation season tests on two canals in colorado usa showed estimated seepage reduction ranging from about 69 100 sustained for up to three months after lapam application tests on a canal in sindh pakistan showed a drop in seepage rate of about 81 100 for up to one month following the lapam application consideration of measurement and estimation error in the tests conducted on the colorado canals reveals significant uncertainty in test results nevertheless accounting for this uncertainty in results the likelihood that seepage losses from these canals in fact were reduced by lapam was estimated to exceed about 85 although the study presented here shows the potential of lapam to control seepage losses on typical irrigation canals it does not systematically assess the relative influence of the several factors that influence the degree of lapam efficacy these factors include type and application rate of polymer tss canal bed texture and multiple other factors and they require further study to optimize the safe use of lapam for canal seepage mitigation also alternative polymer sealants that are more environmentally acceptable need to be similarly investigated guidelines for conducting more refined research efforts including addressing a

and soil erosion from the first year and there was no significant difference between different grass mulching patterns in each growth period of fruit trees in the dry season from august to september

regional economy and maintenance of the ecological environment the red soil regions of south china represent the largest citrus cultivation area with many low mountain areas experiencing transformation to high yield and high quality citrus orchards for economic benefits chen et al 2019 xu et al 2012 according to the 2019 government statistics the citrus cultivation area in south china covers approximately 2 73 106 ha with annual output exceeding 43 106 tons the citrus orchards in the red soil regions of south china are mostly on hills and slopes varying between 5 and 20 xu et al 2018 and predominantly involve clean tillage soil management the annual rainfall in the region varies between 800 and 2500 mm with greater than 70 between april and september owing to the high rainfall erosivity high soil erodibility and inadequate land management citrus orchards in south china are exposed to severe soil and water loss risks in the rainy season duan et al 2020 wu et al 2018 meanwhile hillside citrus orchards are affected by seasonal drought linked to high evapotranspiration and limited rainfall during the dry season lu et al 2017 tu et al 2021 living grass mulching lgm is an important global practice for controlling soil water and nutrient loss in orchards atucha et al 2013 liu et al 2012 taguas et al 2017 in addition it can increase soil organic matter content ramos et al 2011 wei et al 2018 and improve soil structure cao et al 2016 chen et al 2020 however the competition for soil water and fertilizers between fruit trees and the mulching grass linares et

reducing the overland flow and improving the infiltration capacity palese et al 2014 other studies suggest that lgm in an orchard reduces the soil water available for fruit trees hernandez et al 2005 liu et al 2013 in fact the results of a study in a semi arid area in northwest china revealed considerable soil moisture reduction of a grass covered vineyard relative to that obtained by the ct treatment averaging 2 3 15 9 at depths of 0 80 cm xi et al 2011 ramos et al 2010 also reported that interplanting oats in an almond orchard significantly reduced the soil moisture throughout the growing season further according to xu et al 2001 intercropping eragrostis pilosa in a nectarine orchard effectively trapped rainwater and increased the soil moisture content at depths of 0 80 cm and reduced the soil moisture content during high temperature and drought periods in addition the effect of lgm on the orchard yield was uncertain generally mulching grass is considered to augment the fruit yield by improving the soil structure microbial biomass and organic matter content qian et al 2015 suo et al 2019 but some studies suggest otherwise for example grass mulching in steep vineyards is reported to lower fruit yield by 29 54 ruiz colmenero et al 2011 however the fruit tree yield was not consistently reduced for all years long term studies on rain fed peach production demonstrated that sod competition accounted for yield reduction for five of the 18 years of the study with the yield of large fruits lowered in just one of these years glenn and welker 1996 according to the long term field experiments of glenn and newell 2008 lgm effect on peach trees revealed reduction of the number of fruits per tree for all years lowering the total yield for six of the seven years of the study therefore the long term effects of lgm on soil hydrology and fruit yield are necessary to assess gradual changes over time as well as year to year variability the principal patterns of lgm in orchards include full mulching and strip mulching patterns wei et al 2017 owing to the grass coverage differences the two mulching patterns may impact soil hydrology and fruit yield in orchards differently it is necessary to choose the appropriate pattern of lgm in orchard so as to reduce water competition and yield reduction however no detailed information is available on the effects of different grass mulching patterns on either water and soil conservation or fruit yield of citrus especially it has been insufficient number of long term studies this study involves 15 year field experiments to evaluate eroded sediment surface runoff soil moisture and fruit yield differences for citrus orchards involving ct full grass mulching and strip grass mulching the specific objectives of this study are to investigate and compare the long term effects of full mulching and strip mulching patterns on 1 runoff and soil erosion 2 the potential for competition for soil water between citrus trees and mulching grass and 3 the yield of citrus orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field experiments were conducted in a citrus orchard of a slope land in the red soil hilly region of de an county jiangxi province south china 115 42 56 e 29 17 10 n altitude 51 m the local climate is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon the average annual temperature is 16 7 2001 2015 with average annual sunshine duration of 1522 h and more than 245 frost free days the annual precipitation in the study area from 2001 to 2015 ranged from 898 5 to 1889 7 mm with the period from march to august accounting for 53 29 85 08 with extremely uneven annual and interannual distribution detailed information on monthly precipitation during the period of the experiments is shown in fig 1 the soil texture is dominantly silty clay loam and the thickness of the active soil layer ranges between 50 and 150 cm the bulk density total porosity capillary porosity field capacity and organic matter of the initial topsoil is 1 31 g cm3 49 02 41 05 22 3 and 1 35 respectively 2 2 experimental design at the end of 2000 runoff observation plots measuring 20 m 5 m were created on wasteland slopes of approximately 12 to prevent peripheral surface runoff from entering and leaving the test area a cofferdam was built around each plot a rectangular runoff collecting pool was set at the bottom of each experimental plot to collect the surface runoff and eroded sediments in each experiment area 12 two year old citrus trees citrus reticulata blanco cv ponkan of the fructus aurantii rootstock were planted in six rows along the slope amounting to two plants per row in the year 2000 five grass mulching treatments in surface soil were studied clean tillage ct strip mulch with paspalum notatum flugge smp full mulch with paspalum notatum flugge fmp strip mulch with cynodon dactylon l pers smc full mulch with cynodon dactylon l pers fmc fig 2 the smp and smc involved contour planted living grass between the two lines of trees covering an area of 1 0 m 5 m thereby producing six grass strips per area the weeds outside the grass strip were manually removed regularly conversely the fmp and fmc involved covering the entire area with grass castration was not conducted after living grass mulching and the fertilization and management of fruit trees in each experiment areas were identical the citrus orchard was unirrigated 2 3 field observations 2 3 1 soil properties in the year of 2000 mixed soil sample was taken to test soil physical and chemical properties for the initial soil in the year of 2006 primary fruit period and 2015 full fruit period samples from the top 20 cm of the soils were collected from the top middle and foot of each plot and then soil samples from three slope positions were mixed for testing in every plot the soil bulk density capillary porosity total porosity and field capacity were measured by ring sampler method and the soil organic matter content were measured by potassium dichromate method 2 3 2 runoff and sediment collection long term continuous monitoring of the runoff and sediment yield on the orchard slope during rainfall events was performed according to soil and water conservation test specifications from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china sl419 2007 the observation period lasted from 2001 to 2015 with the surface runoff calculated according to the water level of the runoff pool the sediment quantity was obtained from the product of the runoff and its sediment concentration rainfall was also monitored continuously and recorded every 5 min using an sl3 1 tipping bucket rain gauge 2 3 3 soil water content the volumetric soil moisture content at six depths 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm in each area was measured using a soil profile probe pr2 6 delta t device ltd cambridge uk along the slope this was monitored at the top middle and foot positions located approximately around 5 10 and 15 m from the topmost part of each plot the average soil moisture content of the three slope positions served as the final soil moisture content at each depth the soil moisture content was measured at least twice a month from march 2014 to december 2015 2 3 4 yield of fruit trees the citrus trees in the experiment plots began bearing fruits in 2003 in mid october each year the mature fruits from all treatments were harvested manually on the same day and the total fruit associated with each treatment was weighed in 2008 due to improper management of orchards the distorted citrus yield in that year was not considered 2 4 data analysis the data from the experiments were analyzed using the spss 16 0 system one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine the runoff sediment soil moisture content and fruit yield differences among various treatments the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 was determined for the mean separation and all images were generated using the origin 2015 graphing software 3 results 3 1 grass mulching effects on physical and chemical properties of topsoil the physical and chemical property changes of the topsoil 0 20 cm under different lgm treatments are presented in table 1 the long term observations data for the study areas indicate that in the first five years after planting the ct treatment increased the topsoil bulk density by 0 03 g cm3 while the total soil porosity decreased by 0 56 and the field capacity decreased by 1 71 however by 2015 the soil structure linked to the ct treatment significantly improved compared with the structure of the initial soil conversely the soil structures for the four living grass mulching areas improved gradually from the initial period and by 2015 the soil bulk density for the smp fmp smc and fmc treatment decreased by 0 08 0 10 0 09 and 0 13 g cm3 respectively while the soil organic matter content increased by 1 01 1 45 1 18 and 1 71 respectively compared with the ct treatment the total porosity field capacity and organic matter significantly increased under long term grass mulching management and the soil bulk density decreased the soil structures linked to full mulching are better than those to strip mulching however there was no significant difference between paspalum notatum flugge mulching and cynodon dactylon l pers mulching 3 2 grass mulching effects on sediment and runoff the change curves for 2001 2015 show that eroded sediment and surface runoff can be effectively reduced in the citrus orchard on the slope land either through ct treatment or lgm treatment fig 3 as time increased the soil erosion intensity for the ct treatment decreased rapidly and then became relatively stabilized whereas for four lgm treatment plots were continuously low and stable with the annual soil erosion intensity less than 100 t km2 compared with ct treatment lgm treatments can significantly p 0 05 reduce soil erosion in all growth stages of citrus trees especially during the sapling stage of the citrus tree growth with the maximum eroded sediments accounting for approximately 0 57 that for the ct treatment the one way anova results reveals similar effects on soil erosion for the strip mulching and full mulching and there was no significant difference p 0 05 in all growth stages of citrus moreover the annual average surface runoff in the areas subjected to the smp fmp smc and smp treatments is lower by 191 01 191 32 183 53 and 179 20 mm respectively compared to that in the ct treatment in fact the full mulching treatments reduced the surface runoff by 22 72 649 90 mm yr with an annual average of 185 26 mm these correspond to runoff interception rates of 57 35 99 08 with an annual average of 82 54 similarly the strip mulching treatment reduced the surface runoff by 19 81 646 90 mm yr with an annual average of 187 27 mm the corresponding surface runoff interception rates vary from 57 31 to 97 42 averaging 84 61 annually evidently lgm treatment in citrus orchards especially during the sapling stage of the trees effectively reduces surface runoff and increases infiltration similarly the one way anova results show no significant difference p 0 05 in surface runoff reduction between the full mulching and strip mulching treatments in different growth stages of citrus trees surface runoff interception reveals that lgm delays the flood peak and effectively reduces the peak discharge the surface runoff generation process for different rainfall patterns such as an abrupt rainfall event no 20130429 or peak rainfall event no 20130514 shows that different forms of grass mulching in the citrus orchard effectively reduce the peak flow fig 4 for example for the abrupt rainfall event no 20130429 the peak flow for the orchard involving ct treatment is 5 88 mm h whereas those involving the full and strip mulching treatments are 3 19 and 2 35 mm h respectively with corresponding peak reduction rates of 45 75 and 60 03 in addition for the peak rainfall event no 20130514 the peak flow for the orchard involving ct is 9 75 mm h while those for full and strip mulching treatments are 3 19 and 3 53 mm h respectively with peak reduction rates of 45 75 and 39 97 respectively evidently no significant difference p 0 05 exists in the surface flood peak reduction between the strip and full mulching treatments under different rainfall conditions in addition no significant difference in runoff reduction between the paspalum notatum flugge and cynodon dactylon treatments was observed 3 3 grass mulching effects on soil moisture the main source of water for the orchards in the red soil hilly areas is rainfall the surface runoff intercepted by the lgm treatment infiltrated the soil effectively improving the average soil water content compared with ct treatment the smp and smc treatments increased the average soil water content by 0 02 0 04 and 0 02 0 05 cm3 cm3 respectively table 2 similarly the fmp and fmc treatments augmented the soil water content by 0 01 0 04 and 0 01 0 04 cm3 cm3 respectively at depths of 0 40 cm the soil water contents for the area associated with strip mulching surpassed those with full mulching whereas the soil water contents for the area associated with full mulching are higher at depths of 60 100 cm therefore compared with strip mulching full mulching reduces the surface soil water content and increases the deep soil water content no significant difference exists between the soil water contents of areas subjected to the smp and smc treatments and between those associated with the fmp and fmc treatments the monthly soil moisture change processes are similar for all treatments fig 5 indicating that the basic soil water change pattern in the citrus orchard was unchanged by lgm treatment compared with the ct treatment the soil water content at depths of 0 40 cm of the smp and smc treatments decreased by 0 0029 0 037 cm3 cm3 and 0 0059 0 035 cm3 cm3 respectively whereas those of the fmp and fmc treatments reduced correspondingly by 0 018 0 056 cm3 cm3 and 0 021 0 074 cm3 cm3 from august to september involving low rainfall obviously the soil water content reduced more for the full mulching treatment than that for the strip mulching treatment 3 4 grass mulching effects on fruit yield citrus yield reflects the combined impacts of soil treatments and meteorological effects according to the data in fig 6 the citrus yield had been fluctuating from 2003 to 2015 highlighting biennial bearing the citrus yield changes with time of the five treatments were quite similar the fruit yields were generally high in 2004 2009 and 2013 averaging 21 590 kg hm2 for ct treatment and 14 665 kg hm2 for lgm treatments and relatively low in 2005 and 2007 with an average of 3135 kg hm2 for ct treatment and 1717 kg hm2 for lgm treatments compared with ct treatment the yield of lgm treatments was lower but there was no significant difference at the primary fruit period p 0 05 while the yield of fmp smc and fmc decreased significantly at the full fruit period p 0 05 among the whole period of citrus cultivation experiment the ct treatment exhibits the highest yield followed by the smp treatment with the ct treatment accounting for 71 27 of the average yield the fmp treatment exhibited the lowest yield which is approximately 44 11 lower than that of the ct treatment however no significant difference emerged in citrus yield for the four mulching treatments in primary fruit period and full fruit period of citrus 4 discussion 4 1 effects of long term living mulching the development of a citrus orchard is a common land use pattern in the hilly region of south china however due to lack of surface coverage and inadequate soil management activities water soil and nutrient loss are common in the early growth stage of fruit trees in the area the first 4 years was the key period to prevent soil erosion for the study orchard and then the intensity of soil erosion decreased below 500 t km 2 a 1 fig 3 lgm treatments in orchard can make the intensity of soil erosion less than 200 t km 2 a 1 in the first year which is an effective soil and water conservation measure the reduction of soil erosion by living mulching can be explained to combined effects of physical protection by the mulching grass and its residues against raindrop impacts and shearing stresses of the surface runoff flow and the control of water infiltration into soil prosdocimi et al 2016 in addition the lgm treatments on orchard surface significantly improved the physical properties and organic matter content of the soil table 1 more importantly the soil structure becomes better as the mulching duration increased similar results were found in other orchards such as pear orchards peach orchards and apple orchards where living grass was mulched kader et al 2017 the soil bulk density reduction and the porosity increase effectively improve infiltration and the soil water holding capacity the improved soil hydraulic characteristics and the increased soil organic matter content also effectively enhance the soil anti erosion ability kadlec et al 2012 wang et al 2015 although lgm treatment generally increases the soil moisture contents of citrus orchards the competition for water between mulch grass and fruit trees exhibits obvious seasonal characteristics for certain soil layers there was no significant competition for water between citrus and grass during the spring and winter water competition is evident at soil depths of 0 40 cm from august to september fig 5 involving high temperature and low rainfall this period corresponds to that for citrus fruit growth characterized by high water demand and sensitivity garcia tejero et al 2010 this means that the lgm treatment aggravates the impact of drought on the fruit trees in the dry season the experiment by zou et al 2013 also showed that interplanting white clover in a cherry garden reduced the soil water content by 25 27 at soil depths of 20 40 cm lgm treatments promotes surface runoff infiltration thereby increasing the soil moisture content in contrast the evapotranspiration of mulching grass reduces soil moisture in the dry season the overall effect of lgm on soil moisture is closely related to the grass type regional rainfall and other factors bai et al 2018 monteiro and lopes 2007 water consumption can therefore be controlled by selecting a suitable grass species controlling the coverage and aggressiveness and intensive mowing alc√°ntara et al 2011 guerra and steenwerth 2012 clean ploughing zones are necessary in the main fruit root system distribution areas and the width of these zones should expand with the fruit tree crown in the dry seasons the grass requires timely cutting and coverage to minimize living grass water consumption grass species with low height high biomass long covering time and short vigorous growth period are recommended to reduce the time of water and nutrients between the mulching grass and fruit trees the lgm treatments involved lower yield of varying degrees with the average decrease for the strip and full mulching ranging from 28 72 to 35 59 and 39 33 44 11 respectively atucha et al 2011 reported 26 cumulated yield loss of apples after twelve year festuca rubra sod presence and hogue et al 2010 recorded between 11 and 24 decline in five years although according to atucha et al 2011 fruit trees growing in living mulches perform poorly only in the initial growth period after which they adapt to the understory competition we found the opposite effect fig 6 yield declines can be linked to insufficient water uptake by fruit trees grown in the presence of living mulches zelazny and licznar malanczuk 2018 july to september represents the citrus fruit expansion period and likely the key period of water demand in the study area during this time sufficient water supply is required in the rhizosphere however rainfall is often little at this time with evapotranspiration associated with the high amount of water consumed because of the high temperature of the fruit trees and grass the competition for water between the mulching grass and fruit trees in this critical water demand period aggravates the drought what s worse competition for nitrogen uptake did occur during the summer months between citrus and mulching grass linares et al 2010 the competition for water and fertilizer resources for shallow soil roots was intensified by shallow root grass planting therefore inferring that grass mulching positive affects fruit trees only because of soil structure improvement can be misleading high soil quality does not guarantee improved growth conditions for cultivated fruit tree when restrictive factors are present for example in the full fruit stage the soil quality of the full mulching treatment was better than that of the strip mulching but the citrus yield was lower than that of the strip mulching this is mainly due to the fact that the citrus trees are relatively poor competitors with mulching vegetation which leads to the reduction of citrus yield by the effect of lgm treatments 4 2 living mulching patterns comparison competition between fruit trees and understory vegetation has seriously hindered living mulch adoption as a floor management system in commercial orchards granatstein and s√°nchez 2009 it must ensure balance between soil conservation and control of competition pressure from the cover crop itself zelazny and licznar malanczuk 2018 so appropriate living grass mulching management is crucial for satisfactory results with this system the improvement of soil structure by the full mulching is better than that of strip mulching especially the organic matter content the grass coverage and biomass of the full mulching were about 2 times of that of strip mulching in the study orchard more grass biomass means more root penetration and residual organic matter into the soil there was no significant difference p 0 05 in soil and water conservation efficiency between strip mulching and full mulching with living grass although runoff and sediment reduction both increased as the vegetation coverage increased tended to be stable when vegetation coverage exceeded 60 wu et al 2020 the vegetation coverage of strip mulching orchard in the study area has been stable at about 75 which exceeds the critical threshold of vegetation coverage for soil erosion the difference of soil water storage effect between strip mulching and full mulching is closely related to rainfall in the rainy season the soil moisture of the full mulching is usually higher than the strip mulching but in the dry season with less rain the soil moisture of the full mulching is generally lower than the strip mulching more mulching grass will need to absorb more water from the orchard soil thus it can be inferred that the water competition between grass and fruit trees with full mulching is more intense than that with strip mulching although no statistically significant difference was detected the citrus yield with strip grass mulching was higher than that with full grass mulching therefore combined the effects of soil and water conservation and fruit tree yield the strip mulching pattern should be recommended in the orchard in the red soil hilly area in particular there was no significant difference in soil improvement soil and water conservation and citrus yield between living mulching with paspalum notatum flugge and living mulching with cynodon dactylon l pers but these results were not universal because the effects of living mulching on the soil hydrology soil and water conservation and citrus yield are closely dependent on living mulch species hogue et al 2010 the results of this study may be related to the similar biological characteristics of paspalum notatum flugge and cynodon dactylon l pers the observation results have no difference between the two similar grass species which makes the results of strip grass mulching and full grass mulching more reliable 5 conclusion the long term presence of lgm treatments in a citrus orchard can significantly improve the topsoil soil structure and the effects are more obvious with full mulching than strip mulching both the strip mulching and the full mulching could effectively reduce the surface runoff and soil erosion especially in the sapling stage of the fruit trees and no differences were detected between the two patterns in different growth stages of fruit trees the water competition between mulching grass and citrus trees was monitored in the critical period of water requirement from august to september in the depth of 0 40 cm which reduced the average fruit yield of strip mulch and full mulch by 32 15 and 41 72 respectively considering the runoff soil erosion water competition and fruit yield the strip mulching is recommended as the ground management practice for citrus orchards in south china declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

slopes of approximately 12 to prevent peripheral surface runoff from entering and leaving the test area a cofferdam was built around each plot a rectangular runoff collecting pool was set at the bottom of each experimental plot to collect the surface runoff and eroded sediments in each experiment area 12 two year old citrus trees citrus reticulata blanco cv ponkan of the fructus aurantii rootstock were planted in six rows along the slope amounting to two plants per row in the year 2000 five grass mulching treatments in surface soil were studied clean tillage ct strip mulch with paspalum notatum flugge smp full mulch with paspalum notatum flugge fmp strip mulch with cynodon dactylon l pers smc full mulch with cynodon dactylon l pers fmc fig 2 the smp and smc involved contour planted living grass between the two lines of trees covering an area of 1 0 m 5 m thereby producing six grass strips per area the weeds outside the grass strip were manually removed regularly conversely the fmp and fmc involved covering the entire area with grass castration was not conducted after living grass mulching and the fertilization and management of fruit trees in each experiment areas were identical the citrus orchard was unirrigated 2 3 field observations 2 3 1 soil properties in the year of 2000 mixed soil sample was taken to test soil physical and chemical properties for the initial soil in the year of 2006 primary fruit period and 2015 full fruit period samples from the top 20 cm of the soils were collected from the top middle and foot of each plot and then soil samples from three slope positions were mixed for testing in every plot the soil bulk density capillary porosity total porosity and field capacity were measured by ring sampler method and the soil organic matter content were measured by potassium dichromate method 2 3 2 runoff and sediment collection long term continuous monitoring of the runoff and sediment yield on the orchard slope during rainfall events was performed according to soil and water conservation test specifications from the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china sl419 2007 the observation period lasted from 2001 to 2015 with the surface runoff calculated according to the water level of the runoff pool the sediment quantity was obtained from the product of the runoff and its sediment concentration rainfall was also monitored continuously and recorded every 5 min using an sl3 1 tipping bucket rain gauge 2 3 3 soil water content the volumetric soil moisture content at six depths 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm in each area was measured using a soil profile probe pr2 6 delta t device ltd cambridge uk along the slope this was monitored at the top middle and foot positions located approximately around 5 10 and 15 m from the topmost part of each plot the average soil moisture content of the three slope positions served as the final soil moisture content at each depth the soil moisture content was measured at least twice a month from march 2014 to december 2015 2 3 4 yield of fruit trees the citrus trees in the experiment plots began bearing fruits in 2003 in mid october each year the mature fruits from all treatments were harvested manually on the same day and the total fruit associated with each treatment was weighed in 2008 due to improper management of orchards the distorted citrus yield in that year was not considered 2 4 data analysis the data from the experiments were analyzed using the spss 16 0 system one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine the runoff sediment soil moisture content and fruit yield differences among various treatments the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 was determined for the mean separation and all images were generated using the origin 2015 graphing software 3 results 3 1 grass mulching effects on physical and chemical properties of topsoil the physical and chemical property changes of the topsoil 0 20 cm under different lgm treatments are presented in table 1 the long term observations data for the study areas indicate that in the first five years after planting the ct treatment increased the topsoil bulk density by 0 03 g cm3 while the total soil porosity decreased by 0 56 and the field capacity decreased by 1 71 however by 2015 the soil structure linked to the ct treatment significantly improved compared with the structure of the initial soil conversely the soil structures for the four living grass mulching areas improved gradually from the initial period and by 2015 the soil bulk density for the smp fmp smc and fmc treatment decreased by 0 08 0 10 0 09 and 0 13 g cm3 respectively while the soil organic matter content increased by 1 01 1 45 1 18 and 1 71 respectively compared with the ct treatment the total porosity field capacity and organic matter significantly increased under long term grass mulching management and the soil bulk density decreased the soil structures linked to full mulching are better than those to strip mulching however there was no significant difference between paspalum notatum flugge mulching and cynodon dactylon l pers mulching 3 2 grass mulching effects on sediment and runoff the change curves for 2001 2015 show that eroded sediment and surface runoff can be effectively reduced in the citrus orchard on the slope land either through ct treatment or lgm treatment fig 3 as time increased the soil erosion intensity for the ct treatment decreased rapidly and then became relatively stabilized whereas for four lgm treatment plots were continuously low and stable with the annual soil erosion intensity less than 100 t km2 compared with ct treatment lgm treatments can significantly p 0 05 reduce soil erosion in all growth stages of citrus trees especially during the sapling stage of the citrus tree growth with the maximum eroded sediments accounting for approximately 0 57 that for the ct treatment the one way anova results reveals similar effects on soil erosion for the strip mulching and full mulching and there was no significant difference p 0 05 in all growth stages of citrus moreover the annual average surface runoff in the areas subjected to the smp fmp smc and smp treatments is lower by 191 01 191 32 183 53 and 179 20 mm respectively compared to that in the ct treatment in fact the full mulching treatments reduced the surface runoff by 22 72 649 90 mm yr with an annual average of 185 26 mm these correspond to runoff interception rates of 57 35 99 08 with an annual average of 82 54 similarly the strip mulching treatment reduced the surface runoff by 19 81 646 90 mm yr with an annual average of 187 27 mm the corresponding surface runoff interception rates vary from 57 31 to 97 42 averaging 84 61 annually evidently lgm treatment in citrus orchards especially during the sapling stage of the trees effectively reduces surface runoff and increases infiltration similarly the one way anova results show no significant difference p 0 05 in surface runoff reduction between the full mulching and strip mulching treatments in different growth stages of citrus trees surface runoff interception reveals that lgm delays the flood peak and effectively reduces the peak discharge the surface runoff generation process for different rainfall patterns such as an abrupt rainfall event no 20130429 or peak rainfall event no 20130514 shows that different forms of grass mulching in the citrus orchard effectively reduce the peak flow fig 4 for example for the abrupt rainfall event no 20130429 the peak flow for the orchard involving ct treatment is 5 88 mm h whereas those involving the full and strip mulching treatments are 3 19 and 2 35 mm h respectively with corresponding peak reduction rates of 45 75 and 60 03 in addition for the peak rainfall event no 20130514 the peak flow for the orchard involving ct is 9 75 mm h while those for full and strip mulching treatments are 3 19 and 3 53 mm h respectively with peak reduction rates of 45 75 and 39 97 respectively evidently no significant difference p 0 05 exists in the surface flood peak reduction between the strip and full mulching treatments under different rainfall conditions in addition no significant difference in runoff reduction between the paspalum notatum flugge and cynodon dactylon treatments was observed 3 3 grass mulching effects on soil moisture the main source of water for the orchards in the red soil hilly areas is rainfall the surface runoff intercepted by the lgm treatment infiltrated the soil effectively improving the average soil water content compared with ct treatment the smp and smc treatments increased the average soil water content by 0 02 0 04 and 0 02 0 05 cm3 cm3 respectively table 2 similarly the fmp and fmc treatments augmented the soil water content by 0 01 0 04 and 0 01 0 04 cm3 cm3 respectively at depths of 0 40 cm the soil water contents for the area associated with strip mulching surpassed those with full mulching whereas the soil water contents for the area associated with full mulching are higher at depths of 60 100 cm therefore compared with strip mulching full mulching reduces the surface soil water content and increases the deep soil water content no significant difference exists between the soil water contents of areas subjected to the smp and smc treatments and between those associated with the fmp and fmc treatments the monthly soil moisture change processes are similar for all treatments fig 5 indicating that the basic soil water change pattern in the citrus orchard was unchanged by lgm treatment compared with the ct treatment the soil water content at depths of 0 40 cm of the smp and smc treatments decreased by 0 0029 0 037 cm3 cm3 and 0 0059 0 035 cm3 cm3 respectively whereas those of the fmp and fmc treatments reduced correspondingly by 0 018 0 056 cm3 cm3 and 0 021 0 074 cm3 cm3 from august to september involving low rainfall obviously the soil water content reduced more for the full mulching treatment than that for the strip mulching treatment 3 4 grass mulching effects on fruit yield citrus yield reflects the combined impacts of soil treatments and meteorological effects according to the data in fig 6 the citrus yield had been fluctuating from 2003 to 2015 highlighting biennial bearing the citrus yield changes with time of the five treatments were quite similar the fruit yields were generally high in 2004 2009 and 2013 averaging 21 590 kg hm2 for ct treatment and 14 665 kg hm2 for lgm treatments and relatively low in 2005 and 2007 with an average of 3135 kg hm2 for ct treatment and 1717 kg hm2 for lgm treatments compared with ct treatment the yield of lgm treatments was lower but there was no significant difference at the primary fruit period p 0 05 while the yield of fmp smc and fmc decreased significantly at the full fruit period p 0 05 among the whole period of citrus cultivation experiment the ct treatment exhibits the highest yield followed by the smp treatment with the ct treatment accounting for 71 27 of the average yield the fmp treatment exhibited the lowest yield which is approximately 44 11 lower than that of the ct treatment however no significant difference emerged in citrus yield for the four mulching treatments in primary fruit period and full fruit period of citrus 4 discussion 4 1 effects of long term living mulching the development of a citrus orchard is a common land use pattern in the hilly region of south china however due to lack of surface coverage and inadequate soil management activities water soil and nutrient loss are common in the early growth stage of fruit trees in the area the first 4 years was the key period to prevent soil erosion for the study orchard and then the intensity of soil erosion decreased below 500 t km 2 a 1 fig 3 lgm treatments in orchard can make the intensity of soil erosion less than 200 t km 2 a 1 in the first year which is an effective soil and water conservation measure the reduction of soil erosion by living mulching can be explained to combined effects of physical protection by the mulching grass and its residues against raindrop impacts and shearing stresses of the surface runoff flow and the control of water infiltration into soil prosdocimi et al 2016 in addition the lgm treatments on orchard surface significantly improved the physical properties and organic matter content of the soil table 1 more importantly the soil structure becomes better as the mulching duration increased similar results were found in other orchards such as pear orchards peach orchards and apple orchards where living grass was mulched kader et al 2017 the soil bulk density reduction and the porosity increase effectively improve infiltration and the soil water holding capacity the improved soil hydraulic characteristics and the increased soil organic matter content also effectively enhance the soil anti erosion ability kadlec et al 2012 wang et al 2015 although lgm treatment generally increases the soil moisture contents of citrus orchards the competition for water between mulch grass and fruit trees exhibits obvious seasonal characteristics for certain soil layers there was no significant competition for water between citrus and grass during the spring and winter water competition is evident at soil depths of 0 40 cm from august to september fig 5 involving high temperature and low rainfall this period corresponds to that for citrus fruit growth characterized by high water demand and sensitivity garcia tejero et al 2010 this means that the lgm treatment aggravates the impact of drought on the fruit trees in the dry season the experiment by zou et al 2013 also showed that interplanting white clover in a cherry garden reduced the soil water content by 25 27 at soil depths of 20 40 cm lgm treatments promotes surface runoff infiltration thereby increasing the soil moisture content in contrast the evapotranspiration of mulching grass reduces soil moisture in the dry season the overall effect of lgm on soil moisture is closely related to the grass type regional rainfall and other factors bai et al 2018 monteiro and lopes 2007 water consumption can therefore be controlled by selecting a suitable grass species controlling the coverage and aggressiveness and intensive mowing alc√°ntara et al 2011 guerra and steenwerth 2012 clean ploughing zones are necessary in the main fruit root system distribution areas and the width of these zones should expand with the fruit tree crown in the dry seasons the grass requires timely cutting and coverage to minimize living grass water consumption grass species with low height high biomass long covering time and short vigorous growth period are recommended to reduce the time of water and nutrients between the mulching grass and fruit trees the lgm treatments involved lower yield of varying degrees with the average decrease for the strip and full mulching ranging from 28 72 to 35 59 and 39 33 44 11 respectively atucha et al 2011 reported 26 cumulated yield loss of apples after twelve year festuca rubra sod presence and hogue et al 2010 recorded between 11 and 24 decline in five years although according to atucha et al 2011 fruit trees growing in living mulches perform poorly only in the initial growth period after which they adapt to the understory competition we found the opposite effect fig 6 yield declines can be linked to insufficient water uptake by fruit trees grown in the presence of living mulches zelazny and licznar malanczuk 2018 july to september represents the citrus fruit expansion period and likely the key period of water demand in the study area during this time sufficient water supply is required in the rhizosphere however rainfall is often little at this time with evapotranspiration associated with the high amount of water consumed because of the high temperature of the fruit trees and grass the competition for water between the mulching grass and fruit trees in this critical water demand period aggravates the drought what s worse competition for nitrogen uptake did occur during the summer months between citrus and mulching grass linares et al 2010 the competition for water and fertilizer resources for shallow soil roots was intensified by shallow root grass planting therefore inferring that grass mulching positive affects fruit trees only because of soil structure improvement can be misleading high soil quality does not guarantee improved growth conditions for cultivated fruit tree when restrictive factors are present for example in the full fruit stage the soil quality of the full mulching treatment was better than that of the strip mulching but the citrus yield was lower than that of the strip mulching this is mainly due to the fact that the citrus trees are relatively poor competitors with mulching vegetation which leads to the reduction of citrus yield by the effect of lgm treatments 4 2 living mulching patterns comparison competition between fruit trees and understory vegetation has seriously hindered living mulch adoption as a floor management system in commercial orchards granatstein and s√°nchez 2009 it must ensure balance between soil conservation and control of competition pressure from the cover crop itself zelazny and licznar malanczuk 2018 so appropriate living grass mulching management is crucial for satisfactory results with this system the improvement of soil structure by the full mulching is better than that of strip mulching especially the organic matter content the grass coverage and biomass of the full mulching were about 2 times of that of strip mulching in the study orchard more grass biomass means more root penetration and residual organic matter into the soil there was no significant difference p 0 05 in soil and water conservation efficiency between strip mulching and full mulching with living grass although runoff and sediment reduction both increased as the vegetation coverage increased tended to be stable when vegetation coverage exceeded 60 wu et al 2020 the vegetation coverage of strip mulching orchard in the study area has been stable at about 75 which exceeds the critical threshold of vegetation coverage for soil erosion the difference of soil water storage effect between strip mulching and full mulching is closely related to rainfall in the rainy season the soil moisture of the full mulching is usually higher than the strip mulching but in the dry season with less rain the soil moisture of the full mulching is generally lower than the strip mulching more mulching grass will need to absorb more water from the orchard soil thus it can be inferred that the water competition between grass and fruit trees with full mulching is more intense than that with strip mulching although no statistically significant difference was detected the citrus yield with strip grass mulching was higher than that with full grass mulching therefore combined the effects of soil and water conservation and fruit tree yield the strip mulching pattern should be recommended in the orchard in the red soil hilly area in particular there was no significant difference in soil improvement soil and water conservation and citrus yield between living mulching with paspalum notatum flugge and living mulching with cynodon dactylon l pers but these results were not universal because the effects of living mulching on the soil hydrology soil and water conservation and citrus yield are closely dependent on living mulch species hogue et al 2010 the results of this study may be related to the similar biological characteristics of paspalum notatum flugge and cynodon dactylon l pers the observation results have no difference between the two similar grass species which makes the results of strip grass mulching and full grass mulching more reliable 5 conclusion the long term presence of lgm treatments in a citrus orchard can significantly improve the topsoil soil structure and the effects are more obvious with full mulching than strip mulching both the strip mulching and the full mulching could effectively reduce the surface runoff and soil erosion especially in the sapling stage of the fruit trees and no differences were detected between the two patterns in different growth stages of fruit trees the water competition between mulching grass and citrus trees was monitored in the critical period of water requirement from august to september in the depth of 0 40 cm which reduced the average fruit yield of strip mulch and full mulch by 32 15 and 41 72 respectively considering the runoff soil erosion water competition and fruit yield the strip mulching is recommended as the ground management practice for citrus orchards in south china declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10082,having salt tolerant potatoes is of paramount interest to farmers in salt affected areas but reliable cultivar specific parameters on salt tolerance are lacking to address this issue existing field data on tuber yield on sandy soil at six levels of saline irrigation 0 5 4 8 12 16 20 ds m 1 of 13 varieties for which data in two or more consecutive years were available were analysed year by year with the method developed earlier the method provides estimates of the zero observed effect yield y0 and two typical salt tolerance parameters i e a characteristic salinity level and a decline parameter as well as information about the uncertainties and correlations between these estimates the results indicate that all varieties have a similar lethal soil salinity 20 24 ds m 1 however both yield y0 as well as salt tolerance parameters differ among cultivars but for a single variety the estimates vary year by year and have large uncertainties underlining the difficulty to obtain robust parameters from single year experiments the annual variety also hampers the discrimination between varieties to remedy this the data from multiple years were united in a single analysis by introducing another unknown annually varying factor that is limiting the yield in the trials two ways to describe co current limitations often used in models were tested in contrast to the minimum rule the multiplicative rule is found to provide an acceptable description of the observed yields over all years this results in a single set of salt tolerance parameters with a narrower uncertainty bound than from single year estimation it shows that with due account of uncertainties field tests can be used to identify relatively salt tolerant cultivars while accounting for between year yield differences most potato cultivars have an ece 90 of about 4 5 ds m 1 but for some it is roughly double while maintaining good yield suggesting that these varieties are good candidates for salt adapted agriculture graphical abstract ga1 keywords salinity tolerance potato parameter uncertainty stress factor interaction multi annual field tests 1 introduction salinization of soils is a significant threat to crop production in many parts of the world it is aggravated by climate change induced effects such as increased sea water intrusion in coastal areas and the need for more irrigation due to droughts one possibility to abate the negative effects on agriculture is to search for crops and crop varieties that are salt tolerant the target crop in the current study is potato which is a globally important cash crop despite some scepticism about the potential of breeding programs to counteract salinization plaut et al 2013 there is wide consensus that commercially interesting potato varieties can be found or created that are more salt tolerant than others jaarsma et al 2013 levy and veilleux 2007 vel√°squez et al 2005 and should in fact be adopted in daily practice pradel et al 2019 a common avenue to arrive at promising varieties for crops in general is by fast screening tests focussing on quantitative traits that can be measured in vitro within a limited period of time munns et al 2002 a screening test on a large number of north american and european potato cultivars is presented in khrais et al 1998 other studies for potato are khenifi et al 2011 morpurgo 1991 naik and widholm 1993 however the artificial root zone environment of fast screening tests the limited number of tested salinity levels and the short duration in in vitro screening make it hard to link observed growth rates to final yields in the field hence several of these authors stress the need for additional full field tests in addition screening tests do not provide the parameters of salt tolerance functions which would be of paramount interest in crop yield production models tests to evaluate salinity effects on tuber yield under field conditions are scarce table 1 summarizes studies from which salinity tolerance parameters can be deduced because field tests are scarce also some open air lysimeter and pot plant tests that can serve this purpose have been included table 1 reveals several common problems in field experimentation the number of saline irrigation levels is limited and researchers do not always report on the resulting soil salinities without careful design soil salinities may vary over the season due to changes in evapotranspiration the maximum soil salinity measured in the reported field tests is not higher than about 6 or 7 ds m 1 since the 50 yield salinity ece 50 has about the same value such experiments provide no information on the entire yield reduction function which is required in dynamic crop growth models decline rates also have a wide range and interaction with water limitation was not always excluded in view of this limited scientific evidence on salt tolerance of potato crops under field conditions and the lack of reliable model parameters salt farm texel executed extensive field trials with several potato varieties over several years 2012 2018 under well irrigated conditions thus avoiding both waterlogging and drought stress with these extensive data at our disposal and in combination with the evaluation method we developed earlier van straten et al 2019 we set out to answer the following question which of the tested potato varieties differ significantly in salt tolerance our specific objectives are to report on annually observed salinity effects on tuber yield under field conditions for a large number of potato varieties with particular emphasis on variability and uncertainty in salt tolerance model parameter estimates to present a model oriented method to unite multiple year results into a single set of cultivar specific salt tolerance parameters to apply this new method to identify relatively salt tolerant varieties 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of the data the data in this study were acquired from salt farm texel texel the netherlands and originate from field trials with several potato varieties over the years 2012 2018 on sandy soils organic fraction 2 soil particle density 2 5 mg m 3 bulk soil density at saturation 1 5 mg m 3 groups of fields consisting of 4 or 8 replicates depending on the year were irrigated after emergence of the first leaves from the tubers with saline water with salinities of 0 5 1 7 fresh water 4 8 12 16 and 20 ds m 1 salinity treatments were built up gradually with the highest salinity reached within 3 days to avoid osmotic shocks at the higher salinity levels the irrigation frequency and quantity were chosen such that there was never shortage of water which was verified by soil water sensors and regular soil sampling the seasonal mean soil salinity was determined by taking the average of 8 10 soil and soil moisture samples during the growing season de vos et al 2016 in general after a period of 7 10 days after the start of the irrigation the soil salinity was roughly constant within 25 of the mean the areal yield was determined from tuber weights of 8 plants per plot in view of the variation in soil salinities we chose to consider each data point separately since in our previous work van straten et al 2019 it was established that the benefits of prior averaging the soil salinities per treatment group were not decisive in this study all results pertain to the sub set of cultivars with a minimum of two years of testing three or more years of data were available for achilles 2012 2016 miss mignonne 2012 2017 focus 2015 2017 and metro 2015 2018 cultivars with two years of testing were 927 2015 2016 actrice caruso connect elgar magistral nicola rivola and ultra 2017 2018 the tubers of these varieties were acquired from commercial breeders and suppliers in the netherlands 2 2 yield reduction functions two alternative functions were considered to describe the relationship between soil water salinity and observed yield the first is the common threshold function according to maas and hoffman 1977 described by 1 y y 0 1 if 0 ece ec e thr 1 s ece ec e thr if ec e thr ece ec e lethal 0 if ece ec e lethal where ece is the seasonal average soil water ec expressed as saturated paste extract equivalence ds m 1 y is the yield at salinity ece tons ha 1 y 0 the zero observed effect yield tons ha 1 ec e thr the threshold soil water salinity ds m 1 below which the yield is y 0 and s is the decline slope a negative number for salinities beyond the threshold expressed as the fraction of the yield lost per unit ds m 1 note that s s y 0 is the absolute slope in tons ha 1 per ds m 1 ec e lethal is the salinity beyond which no yield occurs it is derived from the other quantities by 2 ec e lethal ec e thr y 0 s the salt tolerance parameters of the maas hoffman mh model are ec e thr and s in addition the zero observed effect yield must be considered as a parameter to be estimated from the data hence the parameter vector of this model is Œ≤ m h e c e t h r s y 0 the second is the s shaped function according to van genuchten and hoffman 1984 given by 3 y y 0 1 1 ece ec e 50 p the salt tolerance parameters in this model are ec e 50 ds m 1 i e the equivalent soil water salinity at which the yield has dropped to 50 of y 0 and a dimensionless slope parameter p the parameter vector of the vangenuchten hoffman vgh model therefore is Œ≤ v g h e c e 50 p y 0 2 3 parameter estimation and uncertainty assessment for individual years the three parameters for each variety and each model were estimated by ordinary least squares ols for each year separately according to the method described by van straten et al 2019 it was shown there that ols gives satisfactory results for the typical conditions of the field trials despite the fact that there are unavoidable errors in the independent variable the method does not only provide the least squares parameter estimates but also their ellipsoid uncertainty regions and mutual correlations correlation implies that changing one parameter value requires a shift in one or both of the other parameters too in order to maintain a credible fit within the yield data uncertainty bounds the uncertainty ellipsoids are in fact approximations resulting from linearization of the response surface about the estimates the true uncertainty region is given by the surface in 3 d parameter space with equal sum of squares defined by draper and smith 1966 4 v Œ≤ 1 n p n n p f n p n n p 1 Œ± v Œ≤ ÀÜ where v Œ≤ is the sum of squares at parameter vector Œ≤ defined before section 2 1 and v Œ≤ ÀÜ is the minimum sum of squares obtained at the best fit parameter vector Œ≤ ÀÜ the factor f is the f distribution available in tables as function of n the number of data points n p the number of parameters n n p the number of degrees of freedom and Œ± the probability level that the actual parameter is outside the region our choice for Œ± is 5 if the model is linear in the parameters the 2 d projections of the surface are ellipsoidal and the confidence level is 95 but in our case the model is non linear in the salt tolerance parameters and hence the contours are no longer ellipsoidal and the label 95 is only approximate in contrast to the ellipsoids which can be obtained easily from the estimation procedure see appendix a2 in van straten et al 2019 the determination of the equal sum of squares surface in the 3 d parameter space is computationally intensive for this reason equal sum of squares contours called uncertainty contours hereafter have been evaluated for the salt tolerance parameters only and only in the 2 d cross section at the estimated yield 2 4 ece 90 as alternative as an alternative to the standard parameterization with ece thr or ece 50 we proposed ece 90 as an agronomically more meaningful alternative van straten et al 2019 in the maas hoffman model the determination of ece 90 is more robust than that of ece thr the conversion from the standard parameterization to the alternative parameterization is straight forward by some simple manipulation of eq 1 or for vangenuchten hoffman eq 3 repeating the estimation in alternative parameter space provides the uncertainty ellipsoids in alternative space however the uncertainty is better represented by the true uncertainty contour according to eq 4 the true uncertainty contour in alternative parameter space can be obtained without repeating the estimation in alternative space by conversion of the points of the uncertainty contour found in standard parameter space 2 5 evaluating salinity tolerance from individual year estimations if salinity would be the only limiting factor affecting potato tuber growth a single set of salt tolerance parameters would exist of which the uncertainty contours of the individual years would overlap to form a cluster presenting the clusters of all varieties in one plot would make the tolerant varieties stand out as detached from the others however if the zero observed effect yield would be influenced by other limiting factors the overlap may get lost since the estimates are correlated with each other another way to obtain an overview over the multiple year data is to simply ignore the correlations between estimates and only take into account the uncertainties to this end the centre of the cluster of ellipsoids for each multiple year cultivar is computed as the weighted mean of the parameters by taking the reciprocal of the estimation variance as the weight 5 Œ≤ i 1 ny 1 œÉ i 2 Œ≤ i ÀÜ i 1 ny 1 œÉ i 2 2 6 hypotheses on simultaneous yield limiting factors it appears that there are large yield variations between the years hence we hypothesize that there is another factor during the experiments unknown and annually different that limits the yield let g k between 0 and 1 represent the unknown reduction factor in year k where the notation serves as a reminder that this is a function of stress factors other than salt suppose furthermore that there exists a potential maximum yield for each cultivar y pot i e a yield that would be observed when no limitations would be active while potential yield is unknown it can be approximated by the ever observed maximum yield when g k 1 and in the absence of salt limitation the observed yield will be equal to the potential yield because the yield in the absence of salt limitation in any year is estimated as y 0 ÀÜ k it follows that an estimate of the unknown annual reduction factor other than soil salinity is given by 6 g k ÀÜ y 0 k ÀÜ y pot let the function that describes the reduction of the yield at a specific salinity with respect to the zero observed effect yield in the absence of other limitations formally be denoted as f e Œ≤ s t where e stands for the seasonal mean soil water salinity of the field ece and Œ≤ st is shorthand for the salt tolerance parameters it has a value between 0 and 1 and a shape given by the right hand side of the functions in section 2 2 a central element in the current hypothesis is that the salt reduction function and its parameters do not depend on the year of testing for if it does it would mean that the whole idea that a cultivar is characterized by a cultivar specific salt tolerance would be void we examine two popular hypotheses for the occurrence of multiple limiting factors namely the multiplicative rule and the minimum rule of liebig sprengel see van der ploeg et al 1999 for an argument to use this denomination so we have hypothesis 1 multiplicative rule 7 h multi y k e f e Œ≤ st g k y pot hypothesis 2 minimum rule 8 h minim y k e min f e Œ≤ st g k y pot fig 1 illustrates the difference between the two hypotheses for the vangenuchten hoffman model under the multiplicative rule the shape is maintained note that the minimum rule gives rise to data patterns that in the presence of observation noise could just as well be described by the maas hoffman model with a threshold that varies with the actual zero observed effect yield 2 7 joint multiple year parameter estimation with data pairs of yield and salinities e i k y obs k e i k for each available year k 1 n y each with i k 1 n k data points the ols multiple year parameter estimation is formulated as 9 Œ≤ ÀÜ st g ÀÜ 1 g ÀÜ ny argmin k 1 n y i k 1 n k y obs k e i k y k e i k Œ≤ 2 here y k e i k Œ≤ is the yield predicted by either eqs 7 or 8 as function of the entire parameter vector Œ≤ Œ≤ st g 1 g ny the number of to be estimated parameters is 2 n y given that the zero observed effect yield in any year is the yield observed without salinity limitation we have 10 y 0 k g k y pot hence from the estimates of the additional limitation factor g k in a specific year the zero observed effect yield for that year can be easily determined from eq 10 given the pre defined y pot in the case of the multiplicative limitation it is easy to see that the estimated annual y 0 k does not depend upon the particular choice of y pot because in the calculation of the predicted yield in eq 7 it is actually the product of g k and y pot that is estimated and another choice of y pot will simply lead to proportionally adjusted g k estimates such that y 0 k eq 10 remains the same with the minimum model the result may depend upon the actual y pot this will be investigated by evaluating the sensitivity of the solution the performance of each hypothesis is evaluated by comparing the root mean square error by visually judging the predicted fits to see whether the fits are within the data uncertainties for each year separately and by examining the residual histogram for absence of systematic bias and skewness 3 results 3 1 parameter estimates for individual years fig 2 shows a typical example of the parameter estimation for an individual year here miss mignonne in 2014 the uncertainty in the curve as a whole is represented by the area within the simultaneous prediction error bounds whereas no more than 5 of the observations are expected to be outside the non simultaneous prediction error bounds the parameter values in this year for the maas hoffman model are ece thr 4 4 ds m 1 s 6 8 ds m 1 y0 42 6 tons ha 1 and for the description according to vangenuchten hoffman we have ece 50 11 4 ds m 1 p 3 3 y0 43 2 tons ha 1 from the figures the unavoidable noise in the yield data is immediately clear variation in yields at the lower ece have the largest effect on the predicted zero observed effect yield both descriptions result in a similar zero observed effect yield of roughly 43 tons ha 1 in some cases the data did not have enough structure to get useful estimates by the current models especially when in the low range of ece there is not enough data or too much noise in such cases the maas hoffman estimation problem becomes ill conditioned and the uncertainty in the parameters becomes extremely large in the vangenuchten hoffman model it may result in unrealistic high y 0 and extremely low p 1 in the analysis a warning is issued when this happens some statistics of the valid single year estimates over all cultivars and all years are provided in table 2 on average over all potato cultivars the threshold ece is about 3 ds m 1 and the ece 50 about 11 ds m 1 both the threshold and the ece 50 are higher than the 1 7 and 5 9 respectively mentioned in tables of the fao based on tanji and kielen 2002 on the other hand the slope we find is with 6 considerably lower than reported there 12 the ece 90 is between 4 5 and 5 5 ds m 1 the slope parameter in the vangenuchten hoffman model is about 3 which is in accordance with the findings in van genuchten and gupta 1993 the differences in fit quality root mean square error rmse between vangenuchten hoffman and maas hoffman are marginal for brevity in the remainder of the paper we will favour the vangenuchten hoffman model as it is probably closer to the real salt tolerance behaviour than the discontinuity in slope inherent to the maas hoffman model the estimation results for all years cultivars and both models are provided in the supplementary material in general a larger ece 90 is accompanied by a larger slope parameter fig 3 the same effect is observed with the maas hoffman model not shown for which s 4 0 6 ec e thr this implies that the lethal ec is about 20 24 ds m 1 and is about the same for all cultivars and all years the estimated individual year zero observed effect yield y 0 differs between years and over cultivars not shown but appears uncorrelated with the salt tolerance parameters this is an indication that the estimation of y 0 is unbiased by the salinity conditions which is what one expects since the true y 0 pertains to a non saline soil 3 2 confidence ellipses the uncertainty region is an ellipsoid in the 3 d parameters space it can be characterized by three 2 d projections one for each combination of two out of three parameters taking the other one at its estimated value fig 4 diagrams such as fig 4 have been produced for each cultivar and each year supplementary material the presentation of the conditional confidence bounds of the individual parameters arrows must be considered with care as the rectangular box does not coincide with the actual uncertainty region defined by the ellipses the correlations between the estimates define the orientation of the ellipses unlikely combinations of parameters are more easily reached in the direction of the short axis than along the long axis of particular interest are the uncertainty regions of the two salt tolerance parameters upper left panel in fig 4 because these are the parameters by which the salt tolerance of cultivars is evaluated 3 3 combining single year estimates the uncertainty ellipses of the salt tolerance parameters for one cultivar over several years can be combined into one single plot an example is given in fig 5 for miss mignonne for completeness years where excessive data scatter precluded reliable estimation as discussed in sections 2 3 and 3 1 have been included as dashed lines a salt tolerant cultivar would have a high ec e 50 and a low decline rate i e a low p but it is equally important that there is a good yield therefore the estimated yields are indicated in the figure as well years with larger data noise appear as wider ellipses fig 5 illustrates that in contrast to the ideal situation the ellipses do not fully overlap indicating differences between years that cannot be described with the current models more importantly both variability as well as uncertainty hamper the classification of salt tolerance it is worth to mention that in the maas hoffman model not shown there was even less overlap the four years with reliable estimates agree well about the parameter ec e 50 but there is no agreement on the slope p this means that the more relevant ec e 90 will differ quite a lot between years cf section 3 4 again making it hard to judge the suitability of the cultivar for salt affected agriculture nevertheless in an attempt to obtain a quick screening of cultivar tolerances the annual results were amalgamated to cultivar specific parameters with the weighted mean method eq 5 of section 2 5 table 3 a similar table for the maas hoffman model is provided in the supplementary material the lower and upper bounds define the outer rectangular box around the cluster of ellipses which is quite conservative the large uncertainties make it hard to find significant differences between the varieties yet by searching for the highest ece 90 we see that the cultivars elgar and rivola might be good candidates for relatively saline soils of these two rivola has the highest yields both cultivars however also have the highest slope parameter indicating that they are more sensitive to increases in salinity beyond ece 90 than others 3 4 true uncertainty regions as a test of the method fig 6 shows the extent to which the ellipsoids dashed lines directly generated by the estimation method are close to the true uncertainty regions according to eq 4 solid lines in general the true confidence region i e the line of equal sum of squares is wider than given by the ellipsoid approximation this is to be expected as the ellipsoids are linear approximations overall based on the true regions there is somewhat more overlap between the parameter regions of multiple years than suggested by the ellipsoid approximations the correlation between ec e 90 and the slope parameter between years is due to a different mechanism than the estimation correlation for an individual year the between year correlation should be absent in the ideal case that there exists a universal ec e 90 and p per cultivar a comparison between figs 5 and 6 also illustrates that the variation in ec e 90 between years is larger than the variation in ec e 50 this implies that screening on the basis of a single salinity in the neighbourhood of the half yield value cf table 1 might be inadequate 3 5 which potato cultivars are significantly more salt tolerant if the combined annual uncertainty regions of one cultivar do not overlap with those of another cultivar this would be a sign of significant differences in salt tolerance a complete diagram of all cultivars and all years would be cluttered but an indication can be obtained by pairwise comparison of cultivars fig 7 comparing nicola with rivola shows that the estimates for rivola in both years are outside the combined uncertainty region for nicola and vice versa meaning that the two cultivars on the basis of these two year measurements are significantly different in salt tolerance graphs like this allow for more accurate statements than by the method of table 3 nevertheless deceiving results might be obtained if a cultivar were tested for one year only consider for instance miss mignonne in 2012 fig 6 that seems significantly different from nicola when just that year is considered but this conclusion does not hold when looking at the centre of the uncertainty cluster over multiple years 3 6 simultaneous estimation of salt tolerance over multiple years although single year estimation already provides some insight the annual variability and the large uncertainty constitutes a problem and from a modelling point of view the annual variability would be devastating estimating the salt tolerance parameters for each year separately discards the knowledge gained from previous year estimations in fact the estimate of one year can serve as a prior to the estimate of a next year thus possibly allowing to narrow down the region of uncertainty to investigate this the expanded method explained in section 2 6 was used to obtain a simultaneous estimate of a unique set of salt tolerance parameters for each cultivar together with year by year varying yield estimates under the two alternative model hypotheses 3 6 1 discriminating between yield limiting hypotheses fig 8 shows the model predictions for all years of miss mignonne obtained with a single set of jointly estimated salt tolerance parameters under the two hypotheses based on the vangenuchten hoffman model fig 9 presents the associated histograms of the residuals i e the differences between the model predictions according to eqs 7 or 8 and the observed yield visual inspection of the model fits fig 8 shows that unlike the minimum rule the multiplicative model is able to provide fits that are within the data uncertainty range for all years even for years where the individual estimations failed such as miss mignonne in 2013 and 2016 also the rmse is lower this result is confirmed by the histograms of the residual error which under the multiplicative hypothesis is close to a gaussian distribution fig 9 left whereas under the minimum rule the histograms are clearly skewed fig 9 right in principle under the minimum rule the result may depend on the choice of the potential yield y pot here formally set to 70 tons ha 1 the choice is immaterial under the multiplicative rule see section 2 7 but a test in the plausible range from 50 to 90 tons ha revealed that the rmse remains around 5 8 so that the comparison is allowed similar plots with other cultivars all show the same tendencies supplementary material including the maas hoffman model as well hence the multiplicative hypothesis gives a better representation of the data than the minimum rule as it produces plausible fits irrespective of annual differences in yield this method enables the estimation of a universal set of salt tolerance parameters associated to a specific cultivar 3 6 2 yield differences while the method disentangles cultivar specific yields from cultivar specific salt tolerance parameters which is a significant asset the annual yield differences remain this is inherent to field experimentation and in addition it is a reality to the farmers too fig 10 shows the annually varying estimates of the zero observed effect yields y0 simultaneous estimation leads to slightly different values in each year as compared to separate estimation this slight shift makes the sum of squares for that particular year worse but it creates room for adjustment of the other parameters such that an acceptable fit is obtained for all years together the choice of the model vangenuchten hoffman or maas hoffman or the hypothesis multiplicative or minimum has little effect on the tuber yield estimates tuber yields can be up to 60 tons ha 1 not much different from what is obtained in commercial production in the netherlands 3 6 3 joint uncertainty region as expected the uncertainty range of the simultaneous estimation is narrower than the uncertainty range of the estimates for individual years as shown in fig 11 for miss mignonne the individual uncertainty contours for the years 2013 and 2016 are unreliable but they are shown here because these data are nevertheless incorporated in the joint estimation as they are real data cf fig 8 it may seem strange that some individual year contours are outside the joint contour e g 2012 but it should be kept in mind that the individual year contours shown are cross sections at the actual estimated yield in that single year the estimated y 0 in 2012 is 18 3 tons ha 1 whereas the fit in the joint estimate for that year is 21 3 tons ha 1 and hence in view of the correlation shown in fig 4 the salt tolerance cross section of the 3 d uncertainty space at these new values shifts to the left 3 6 4 which cultivars are significantly more salt tolerant revisited applying the models under the multiplicative rule finally gives rise to the united salt tolerance parameters and their uncertainty for the various cultivars the estimates for the vangenuchten hoffman model and the associated true uncertainty regions enclosed by the contours of equal sum of squares for all thirteen cultivars with multiple year data are shown in fig 12 for the standard parameterization ece 50 and for the alternate parameter ece 90 in fig 13 the characteristic salinities with the vangenuchten hoffman model vary from ece 50 9 5 13 ece90 4 8 ds m 1 and for the maas hoffman model not shown from ece thr 1 5 6 ds m 1 ece 90 3 8 ds m 1 the slope parameter is quite similar across cultivars except for rivola and to a lesser extent elgar rivola is clearly distinct from the other varieties it has a high characteristic salinity about twice as high as for instance achilles but also a steeper slope it has also a good yield 50 60 tons ha 1 other good candidates for salt affected soils are elgar and 927 although the observed yields are somewhat lower 40 45 tons ha 1 and 45 50 tons ha 1 respectively the lower sensitivity to high salinities by virtue of less steep slope can be an advantage in terms of ece 90 the ranking of the tested cultivars is achilles miss mignonne nicola magistral metro with an ece 90 between 4 and 4 5 ds m 1 followed by focus caruso connect ultra actrice 927 with an ece 90 between 5 and 6 ds m 1 and finally elgar rivola with an ece 90 above 7 5 ds m 1 4 discussion 4 1 estimation procedure and data each parameter estimation endeavor hinges on the quality of the data field data are notoriously subject to variability in the field trials underlying our data elaborate control on salinity and water dynamics during the growing season favored the analysis which otherwise would have been extremely difficult or impossible this is because without such control the seasonal mean salinity would not be representative for the entire root zone at all times even with these precautions tuber yield showed wide variability between replicates with seemingly equal salinity treatment we coped with this by taking all data into account in a formal parameter estimation procedure our procedure provides cultivar specific estimates of crop salt tolerance and their associated uncertainties we found that the vangenuchten hoffman model generally provides an adequate description although the difference with the maas hoffman model is not decisive and other descriptions might also be possible differences between models in yield prediction at salinities where yield reduction is already considerable are less important for agricultural practice but lack of yield data or very noisy data reduces the robustness of the predictions at low salinities in any model experiments with a restricted number of salinities that focus on traits as a proxy of the yield as advocated for fast in vitro screening e g morpurgo 1991 naik and widholm 1993 ekanayake and dodds 1993 zhang and donnelly 1997 while perhaps adequate to isolate promising accessions do not provide sufficient information for the prediction of yield reduction by salinity in the field in assessing salt tolerance models single year experiments are insufficient in view of the unavoidable variability between years a major contribution to reducing uncertainties is our approach to evaluate the salt tolerance jointly over multiple years while evaluation over individual years separately already narrows down the set of possible salt tolerance estimates it is the subsequent joint estimation of salt tolerance that substantially reduces the uncertainties further reduction of uncertainties might be achieved if unequivocal and independent information on the zero observed effect yield would be available note that the supremum of y0 over all years is the lower bound of the potential yield the potential yield itself cannot be estimated from these kind of field trials in view of the unavoidable environmental variability in the field an exact value of y0 in any particular year would require experimentation in the complete absence of soils salinity which is virtually impossible in the field it must be noted that even if y 0 would be known exactly estimation of salt tolerance parameters directly from the relative yield as is common practice is allowed under the multiplicative rule only in this respect our findings that this rule gives much better results than the minimum rule is reassuring 4 2 joint multiple year estimation if salt tolerance is a cultivar specific property one single parameter set per cultivar set should characterize it it could be that there are cultivars with time varying salt tolerance but current methods including ours cannot detect it and such cultivars will not be suitable for cropping on salt affected land anyway we tested several approaches of joining the estimation results over multiple years to obtain a single parameter set the simplest approach involved calculating a weighted mean from the individual year estimates inversely proportional to the estimated uncertainty ranges thus giving more weight to years with less data variability even though the correlation between estimates is ignored a preliminary ranking of cultivars is obtained but the procedure remains somewhat arbitrary a better approach is to consider the joint estimation for all years together this however requires a suitable model formulation on how yield reduction by salinity and yield reduction by other factors interact our findings are that in contrast to the minimum rule the multiplicative rule is able to produce quite acceptable fits across all years the unification of seemingly different year is possible due to the fact that the knowledge on each individual year serves as a prior for the estimation of the other years said differently the possibility that the true parameter for a particular year is anywhere within the individual year uncertainty contour is restricted by the measurements of the other years thus narrowing down the parameters to the most likely ones we acknowledge that the multiplicative rule may not apply to all types of simultaneous limitations in particular the interaction between salinity and water availability may be more complex see for instance homaee et al 2002a 2002b the continuous irrigation at the texel experiments was designed to avoid simultaneous water limitations thus giving confidence in our results but the downside is that with the current data water interaction cannot be studied 4 3 yield variation and yield limiting factors the necessity to introduce another yield limiting factor g k in our study is brought about by the year to year yield variations not only does yield vary in practice but unsuccessful attempts to provide explanations with the current state of knowledge as expressed in models underline that more work is needed in this area fleisher et al 2017 kadaja and tooming 2004 yin and struik 2010 what can be the possible sources of the unknown factor that is limiting yield one possibility is that crops grown on the plots in previous years being different among the plots within a treatment group of the current year influenced the soil microbiology and phytopathology geels and schippers 1983 larkin and honeycutt 2006 in addition the weather may vary from year to year but in that case yields of cultivars tested in the same year would likely be correlated which appears not to be the case in our study cf fig 10 the same holds for differences in nutrient availability between years water limitation possibly in interaction with air humidity backhausen et al 2005 may be possible but only gives yield differences between cultivars if each cultivar responds to these factors in a cultivar specific way there are reasons to assume that indeed tuber formation depends in cultivar specific ways on the actual dynamics of soil and weather conditions the sequence of events such as rainfall day time and night time temperatures although the same for all cultivars may have a different effect on the tuber formation per accession there are various accounts on the interrelationship between genetics and emergent properties one of the first being the work of ewing about the interaction with heat stress ewing 1981 it is known that there are early and late potatoes also showing the interaction between genetics and environmental conditions the need for greater understanding of the response to a changing environment is even larger in the light of global warming dahal et al 2019 george et al 2017 levy and veilleux 2007 while these studies are phenomenological the ultimate dream is to be able to provide a molecular genetic basis khan et al 2019 yin and struik 2010 however none of these publications explicitly addresses the effect on final yield of environmental dynamics during growth except to some extent levy 1992 who studied the effect of the start of the saline treatment the final tuber yield is the result of the integration of growth rate and root shoot partitioning over time in principle dynamic models describing these processes have the potential to cope with dynamic variations we believe that our results are valuable in the further development of dynamic crop models genetic differences between varieties may be expressed as differences in process parameters spitters and schapendonk 1990 yin and van laar 2005 and the actual variation in environmental and soil conditions will then be responsible for differences in final yield it is however almost impossible to calibrate such models from final yields alone the minimum that should be done is to follow some easily detectable traits such as above ground biomass leaf area index plant height and possibly others during the growing season in combination with the final tuber yield it goes without saying that such experimentation would require extensive resources in the light of all this our approach of an empirical additional limiting factor is perhaps a gross simplification of reality but it does provide a significant and practical means of uniting the results of several years of experimentation as testified by our results our results highlight that differences in salt tolerance exist among potato cultivars some of the differences we observed would not have been picked up when testing at just a single salinity level as is sometimes done in fast screening while estimation of the entire salt tolerance curve is more labor intensive and time consuming we are convinced that the entire curve is essential in dynamic crop models the characteristic salinity parameter serves as an indication of the effect of the average salinity over the season while the slope is relevant to cope with the seasonal dynamics the salt tolerance of certain potato cultivars as found in our field trials is substantially higher than reported by fao thus potatoes may be grown at more brackish salt affected conditions than believed previously which may have important implications for global food production a final word of caution is however in place regarding such extrapolation of our results to other situations the results in this study were obtained in sandy soil and for crops that till emergence did not receive saline water as pointed out by levy and veilleux 2007 high yield cultivars may have adapted to the conditions of moderate climate zones reversing the argument it remains to be seen how well cultivars that are relatively salt tolerant in our experiment perform under other climate and soil conditions 5 conclusions to incorporate salt limitation functions in crop yield models it is essential to have cultivar specific parameters the proposed method alleviates the difficulty of seemingly annually varying parameters our study shows that the characterization of crop salt tolerance by characteristic parameters cannot be done by determining the response at one or two salinities only but requires the acquisition of the entire salt tolerance curve moreover single year experimentation is not enough to obtain a reliable picture of salt tolerance of a particular cultivar thanks to assessing the uncertainties of parameter estimates and the joint estimation over multiple years we could prove that there are significant differences in salt tolerance among potato cultivars these differences do exist and can be considerable in this study the cultivars rivola elgar and 927 were found to be more tolerant than other cultivars on sandy soils analysis of two possible models for describing the interaction of another unknown limiting factor with salt limitation revealed that the multiplicative rule performs better than the minimum rule and can provide acceptable fits for all tested years in combination our work positively identifies high yielding potato cultivars that have potential for salt affected

10082,having salt tolerant potatoes is of paramount interest to farmers in salt affected areas but reliable cultivar specific parameters on salt tolerance are lacking to address this issue existing field data on tuber yield on sandy soil at six levels of saline irrigation 0 5 4 8 12 16 20 ds m 1 of 13 varieties for which data in two or more consecutive years were available were analysed year by year with the method developed earlier the method provides estimates of the zero observed effect yield y0 and two typical salt tolerance parameters i e a characteristic salinity level and a decline parameter as well as information about the uncertainties and correlations between these estimates the results indicate that all varieties have a similar lethal soil salinity 20 24 ds m 1 however both yield y0 as well as salt tolerance parameters differ among cultivars but for a single variety the estimates vary year by year and have large uncertainties underlining the difficulty to obtain robust parameters from single year experiments the annual variety also hampers the discrimination between varieties to remedy this the data from multiple years were united in a single analysis by introducing another unknown annually varying factor that is limiting the yield in the trials two ways to describe co current limitations often used in models were tested in contrast to the minimum rule the multiplicative rule is found to provide an acceptable description of the observed yields over all years this results in a single set of salt tolerance parameters with a narrower uncertainty bound than from single year estimation it shows that with due account of uncertainties field tests can be used to identify relatively salt tolerant cultivars while accounting for between year yield differences most potato cultivars have an ece 90 of about 4 5 ds m 1 but for some it is roughly double while maintaining good yield suggesting that these varieties are good candidates for salt adapted agriculture graphical abstract ga1 keywords salinity tolerance potato parameter uncertainty stress factor interaction multi annual field tests 1 introduction salinization of soils is a significant threat to crop production in many parts of the world it is aggravated by climate change induced effects such as increased sea water intrusion in coastal areas and the need for more irrigation due to droughts one possibility to abate the negative effects on agriculture is to search for crops and crop varieties that are salt tolerant the target crop in the current study is potato which is a globally important cash crop despite some scepticism about the potential of breeding programs to counteract salinization plaut et al 2013 there is wide consensus that commercially interesting potato varieties can be found or created that are more salt tolerant than others jaarsma et al 2013 levy and veilleux 2007 vel√°squez et al 2005 and should in fact be adopted in daily practice pradel et al 2019 a common avenue to arrive at promising varieties for crops in general is by fast screening tests focussing on quantitative traits that can be measured in vitro within a limited period of time munns et al 2002 a screening test on a large number of north american and european potato cultivars is presented in khrais et al 1998 other studies for potato are khenifi et al 2011 morpurgo 1991 naik and widholm 1993 however the artificial root zone environment of fast screening tests the limited number of tested salinity levels and the short duration in in vitro screening make it hard to link observed growth rates to final yields in the field hence several of these authors stress the need for additional full field tests in addition screening tests do not provide the parameters of salt tolerance functions which would be of paramount interest in crop yield production models tests to evaluate salinity effects on tuber yield under field conditions are scarce table 1 summarizes studies from which salinity tolerance parameters can be deduced because field tests are scarce also some open air lysimeter and pot plant tests that can serve this purpose have been included table 1 reveals several common problems in field experimentation the number of saline irrigation levels is limited and researchers do not always report on the resulting soil salinities without careful design soil salinities may vary over the season due to changes in evapotranspiration the maximum soil salinity measured in the reported field tests is not higher than about 6 or 7 ds m 1 since the 50 yield salinity ece 50 has about the same value such experiments provide no information on the entire yield reduction function which is required in dynamic crop growth models decline rates also have a wide range and interaction with water limitation was not always excluded in view of this limited scientific evidence on salt tolerance of potato crops under field conditions and the lack of reliable model parameters salt farm texel executed extensive field trials with several potato varieties over several years 2012 2018 under well irrigated conditions thus avoiding both waterlogging and drought stress with these extensive data at our disposal and in combination with the evaluation method we developed earlier van straten et al 2019 we set out to answer the following question which of the tested potato varieties differ significantly in salt tolerance our specific objectives are to report on annually observed salinity effects on tuber yield under field conditions for a large number of potato varieties with particular emphasis on variability and uncertainty in salt tolerance model parameter estimates to present a model oriented method to unite multiple year results into a single set of cultivar specific salt tolerance parameters to apply this new method to identify relatively salt tolerant varieties 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of the data the data in this study were acquired from salt farm texel texel the netherlands and originate from field trials with several potato varieties over the years 2012 2018 on sandy soils organic fraction 2 soil particle density 2 5 mg m 3 bulk soil density at saturation 1 5 mg m 3 groups of fields consisting of 4 or 8 replicates depending on the year were irrigated after emergence of the first leaves from the tubers with saline water with salinities of 0 5 1 7 fresh water 4 8 12 16 and 20 ds m 1 salinity treatments were built up gradually with the highest salinity reached within 3 days to avoid osmotic shocks at the higher salinity levels the irrigation frequency and quantity were chosen such that there was never shortage of water which was verified by soil water sensors and regular soil sampling the seasonal mean soil salinity was determined by taking the average of 8 10 soil and soil moisture samples during the growing season de vos et al 2016 in general after a period of 7 10 days after the start of the irrigation the soil salinity was roughly constant within 25 of the mean the areal yield was determined from tuber weights of 8 plants per plot in view of the variation in soil salinities we chose to consider each data point separately since in our previous work van straten et al 2019 it was established that the benefits of prior averaging the soil salinities per treatment group were not decisive in this study all results pertain to the sub set of cultivars with a minimum of two years of testing three or more years of data were available for achilles 2012 2016 miss mignonne 2012 2017 focus 2015 2017 and metro 2015 2018 cultivars with two years of testing were 927 2015 2016 actrice caruso connect elgar magistral nicola rivola and ultra 2017 2018 the tubers of these varieties were acquired from commercial breeders and suppliers in the netherlands 2 2 yield reduction functions two alternative functions were considered to describe the relationship between soil water salinity and observed yield the first is the common threshold function according to maas and hoffman 1977 described by 1 y y 0 1 if 0 ece ec e thr 1 s ece ec e thr if ec e thr ece ec e lethal 0 if ece ec e lethal where ece is the seasonal average soil water ec expressed as saturated paste extract equivalence ds m 1 y is the yield at salinity ece tons ha 1 y 0 the zero observed effect yield tons ha 1 ec e thr the threshold soil water salinity ds m 1 below which the yield is y 0 and s is the decline slope a negative number for salinities beyond the threshold expressed as the fraction of the yield lost per unit ds m 1 note that s s y 0 is the absolute slope in tons ha 1 per ds m 1 ec e lethal is the salinity beyond which no yield occurs it is derived from the other quantities by 2 ec e lethal ec e thr y 0 s the salt tolerance parameters of the maas hoffman mh model are ec e thr and s in addition the zero observed effect yield must be considered as a parameter to be estimated from the data hence the parameter vector of this model is Œ≤ m h e c e t h r s y 0 the second is the s shaped function according to van genuchten and hoffman 1984 given by 3 y y 0 1 1 ece ec e 50 p the salt tolerance parameters in this model are ec e 50 ds m 1 i e the equivalent soil water salinity at which the yield has dropped to 50 of y 0 and a dimensionless slope parameter p the parameter vector of the vangenuchten hoffman vgh model therefore is Œ≤ v g h e c e 50 p y 0 2 3 parameter estimation and uncertainty assessment for individual years the three parameters for each variety and each model were estimated by ordinary least squares ols for each year separately according to the method described by van straten et al 2019 it was shown there that ols gives satisfactory results for the typical conditions of the field trials despite the fact that there are unavoidable errors in the independent variable the method does not only provide the least squares parameter estimates but also their ellipsoid uncertainty regions and mutual correlations correlation implies that changing one parameter value requires a shift in one or both of the other parameters too in order to maintain a credible fit within the yield data uncertainty bounds the uncertainty ellipsoids are in fact approximations resulting from linearization of the response surface about the estimates the true uncertainty region is given by the surface in 3 d parameter space

parameters n n p the number of degrees of freedom and Œ± the probability level that the actual parameter is outside the region our choice for Œ± is 5 if the model is linear in the parameters the 2 d projections of the surface are ellipsoidal and the confidence level is 95 but in our case the model is non linear in the salt tolerance parameters and hence the contours are no longer ellipsoidal and the label 95 is only approximate in contrast to the ellipsoids which can be obtained easily from the estimation procedure see appendix a2 in van straten et al 2019 the determination of the equal sum of squares surface in the 3 d parameter space is computationally intensive for this reason equal sum of squares contours called uncertainty contours hereafter have been evaluated for the salt tolerance parameters only and only in the 2 d cross section at the estimated yield 2 4 ece 90 as alternative as an alternative to the standard parameterization with ece thr or ece 50 we proposed ece 90 as an agronomically more meaningful alternative van straten et al 2019 in the maas hoffman model the determination of ece 90 is more robust than that of ece thr the conversion from the standard parameterization to the alternative parameterization is straight forward by some simple manipulation of eq 1 or for vangenuchten hoffman eq 3 repeating the estimation in alternative parameter space provides the uncertainty ellipsoids in alternative space however the uncertainty is better represented by the true uncertainty contour according to eq 4 the true uncertainty contour in alternative parameter space can be obtained without repeating the estimation in alternative space by conversion of the points of the uncertainty contour found in standard parameter space 2 5 evaluating salinity tolerance from individual year estimations if salinity would be the only limiting factor affecting potato tuber growth a single set of salt tolerance parameters would exist of which the uncertainty contours of the individual years would overlap to form a cluster presenting the clusters of all varieties in one plot would make the tolerant varieties stand out as detached from the others however if the zero observed effect yield would be influenced by other limiting factors the overlap may get lost since the estimates are correlated with each other another way to obtain an overview over the multiple year data is to simply ignore the correlations between estimates and only take into account the uncertainties to this end the centre of the cluster of ellipsoids for each multiple year cultivar is computed as the weighted mean of the parameters by taking the reciprocal of the estimation variance as the weight 5 Œ≤ i 1 ny 1 œÉ i 2 Œ≤ i ÀÜ i 1 ny 1 œÉ i 2 2 6 hypotheses on simultaneous yield limiting factors it appears that there are large yield variations between the years hence we hypothesize that there is another factor during the experiments unknown and annually different that limits the yield let g k between 0 and 1 represent the unknown reduction factor in year k where the notation serves as a reminder that this is a function of stress factors other than salt suppose furthermore that there exists a potential maximum yield for each cultivar y pot i e a yield that would be observed when no limitations would be active while potential yield is unknown it can be approximated by the ever observed maximum yield when g k 1 and in the absence of salt limitation the observed yield will be equal to the potential yield because the yield in the absence of salt limitation in any year is estimated as y 0 ÀÜ k it follows that an estimate of the unknown annual reduction factor other than soil salinity is given by 6 g k ÀÜ y 0 k ÀÜ y pot let the function that describes the reduction of the yield at a specific salinity with respect to the zero observed effect yield in the absence of other limitations formally be denoted as f e Œ≤ s t where e stands for the seasonal mean soil water salinity of the field ece and Œ≤ st is shorthand for the salt tolerance parameters it has a value between 0 and 1 and a shape given by the right hand side of the functions in section 2 2 a central element in the current hypothesis is that the salt reduction function and its parameters do not depend on the year of testing for if it does it would mean that the whole idea that a cultivar is characterized by a cultivar specific salt tolerance would be void we examine two popular hypotheses for the occurrence of multiple limiting factors namely the multiplicative rule and the minimum rule of liebig sprengel see van der ploeg et al 1999 for an argument to use this denomination so we have hypothesis 1 multiplicative rule 7 h multi y k e f e Œ≤ st g k y pot hypothesis 2 minimum rule 8 h minim y k e min f e Œ≤ st g k y pot fig 1 illustrates the difference between the two hypotheses for the vangenuchten hoffman model under the multiplicative rule the shape is maintained note that the minimum rule gives rise to data patterns that in the presence of observation noise could just as well be described by the maas hoffman model with a threshold that varies with the actual zero observed effect yield 2 7 joint multiple year parameter estimation with data pairs of yield and salinities e i k y obs k e i k for each available year k 1 n y each with i k 1 n k data points the ols multiple year parameter estimation is formulated as 9 Œ≤ ÀÜ st g ÀÜ 1 g ÀÜ ny argmin k 1 n y i k 1 n k y obs k e i k y k e i k Œ≤ 2 here y k e i k Œ≤ is the yield predicted by either eqs 7 or 8 as function of the entire parameter vector Œ≤ Œ≤ st g 1 g ny the number of to be estimated parameters is 2 n y given that the zero observed effect yield in any year is the yield observed without salinity limitation we have 10 y 0 k g k y pot hence from the estimates of the additional limitation factor g k in a specific year the zero observed effect yield for that year can be easily determined from eq 10 given the pre defined y pot in the case of the multiplicative limitation it is easy to see that the estimated annual y 0 k does not depend upon the particular choice of y pot because in the calculation of the predicted yield in eq 7 it is actually the product of g k and y pot that is estimated and another choice of y pot will simply lead to proportionally adjusted g k estimates such that y 0 k eq 10 remains the same with the minimum model the result may depend upon the actual y pot this will be investigated by evaluating the sensitivity of the solution the performance of each hypothesis is evaluated by comparing the root mean square error by visually judging the predicted fits to see whether the fits are within the data uncertainties for each year separately and by examining the residual histogram for absence of systematic bias and skewness 3 results 3 1 parameter estimates for individual years fig 2 shows a typical example of the parameter estimation for an individual year here miss mignonne in 2014 the uncertainty in the curve as a whole is represented by the area within the simultaneous prediction error bounds whereas no more than 5 of the observations are expected to be outside the non simultaneous prediction error bounds the parameter values in this year for the maas hoffman model are ece thr 4 4 ds m 1 s 6 8 ds m 1 y0 42 6 tons ha 1 and for the description according to vangenuchten hoffman we have ece 50 11 4 ds m 1 p 3 3 y0 43 2 tons ha 1 from the figures the unavoidable noise in the yield data is immediately clear variation in yields at the lower ece have the largest effect on the predicted zero observed effect yield both descriptions result in a similar zero observed effect yield of roughly 43 tons ha 1 in some cases the data did not have enough structure to get useful estimates by the current models especially when in the low range of ece there is not enough data or too much noise in such cases the maas hoffman estimation problem becomes ill conditioned and the uncertainty in the parameters becomes extremely large in the vangenuchten hoffman model it may result in unrealistic high y 0 and extremely low p 1 in the analysis a warning is issued when this happens some statistics of the valid single year estimates over all cultivars and all years are provided in table 2 on average over all potato cultivars the threshold ece is about 3 ds m 1 and the ece 50 about 11 ds m 1 both the threshold and the ece 50 are higher than the 1 7 and 5 9 respectively mentioned in tables of the fao based on tanji and kielen 2002 on the other hand the slope we find is with 6 considerably lower than reported there 12 the ece 90 is between 4 5 and 5 5 ds m 1 the slope parameter in the vangenuchten hoffman model is about 3 which is in accordance with the findings in van genuchten and gupta 1993 the differences in fit quality root mean square error rmse between vangenuchten hoffman and maas hoffman are marginal for brevity in the remainder of the paper we will favour the vangenuchten hoffman model as it is probably closer to the real salt tolerance behaviour than the discontinuity in slope inherent to the maas hoffman model the estimation results for all years cultivars and both models are provided in the supplementary material in general a larger ece 90 is accompanied by a larger slope parameter fig 3 the same effect is observed with the maas hoffman model not shown for which s 4 0 6 ec e thr this implies that the lethal ec is about 20 24 ds m 1 and is about the same for all cultivars and all years the estimated individual year zero observed effect yield y 0 differs between years and over cultivars not shown but appears uncorrelated with the salt tolerance parameters this is an indication that the estimation of y 0 is unbiased by the salinity conditions which is what one expects since the true y 0 pertains to a non saline soil 3 2 confidence ellipses the uncertainty region is an ellipsoid in the 3 d parameters space it can be characterized by three 2 d projections one for each combination of two out of three parameters taking the other one at its estimated value fig 4 diagrams such as fig 4 have been produced for each cultivar and each year supplementary material the presentation of the conditional confidence bounds of the individual parameters arrows must be considered with care as the rectangular box does not coincide with the actual uncertainty region defined by the ellipses the correlations between the estimates define the orientation of the ellipses unlikely combinations of parameters are more easily reached in the direction of the short axis than along the long axis of particular interest are the uncertainty regions of the two salt tolerance parameters upper left panel in fig 4 because these are the parameters by which the salt tolerance of cultivars is evaluated 3 3 combining single year estimates the uncertainty ellipses of the salt tolerance parameters for one cultivar over several years can be combined into one single plot an example is given in fig 5 for miss mignonne for completeness years where excessive data scatter precluded reliable estimation as discussed in sections 2 3 and 3 1 have been included as dashed lines a salt tolerant cultivar would have a high ec e 50 and a low decline rate i e a low p but it is equally important that there is a good yield therefore the estimated yields are indicated in the figure as well years with larger data noise appear as wider ellipses fig 5 illustrates that in contrast to the ideal situation the ellipses do not fully overlap indicating differences between years that cannot be described with the current models more importantly both variability as well as uncertainty hamper the classification of salt tolerance it is worth to mention that in the maas hoffman model not shown there was even less overlap the four years with reliable estimates agree well about the parameter ec e 50 but there is no agreement on the slope p this means that the more relevant ec e 90 will differ quite a lot between years cf section 3 4 again making it hard to judge the suitability of the cultivar for salt affected agriculture nevertheless in an attempt to obtain a quick screening of cultivar tolerances the annual results were amalgamated to cultivar specific parameters with the weighted mean method eq 5 of section 2 5 table 3 a similar table for the maas hoffman model is provided in the supplementary material the lower and upper bounds define the outer rectangular box around the cluster of ellipses which is quite conservative the large uncertainties make it hard to find significant differences between the varieties yet by searching for the highest ece 90 we see that the cultivars elgar and rivola might be good candidates for relatively saline soils of these two rivola has the highest yields both cultivars however also have the highest slope parameter indicating that they are more sensitive to increases in salinity beyond ece 90 than others 3 4 true uncertainty regions as a test of the method fig 6 shows the extent to which the ellipsoids dashed lines directly generated by the estimation method are close to the true uncertainty regions according to eq 4 solid lines in general the true confidence region i e the line of equal sum of squares is wider than given by the ellipsoid approximation this is to be expected as the ellipsoids are linear approximations overall based on the true regions there is somewhat more overlap between the parameter regions of multiple years than suggested by the ellipsoid approximations the correlation between ec e 90 and the slope parameter between years is due to a different mechanism than the estimation correlation for an individual year the between year correlation should be absent in the ideal case that there exists a universal ec e 90 and p per cultivar a comparison between figs 5 and 6 also illustrates that the variation in ec e 90 between years is larger than the variation in ec e 50 this implies that screening on the basis of a single salinity in the neighbourhood of the half yield value cf table 1 might be inadequate 3 5 which potato cultivars are significantly more salt tolerant if the combined annual uncertainty regions of one cultivar do not overlap with those of another cultivar this would be a sign of significant differences in salt tolerance a complete diagram of all cultivars and all years would be cluttered but an indication can be obtained by pairwise comparison of cultivars fig 7 comparing nicola with rivola shows that the estimates for rivola in both years are outside the combined uncertainty region for nicola and vice versa meaning that the two cultivars on the basis of these two year measurements are significantly different in salt tolerance graphs like this allow for more accurate statements than by the method of table 3 nevertheless deceiving results might be obtained if a cultivar were tested for one year only consider for instance miss mignonne in 2012 fig 6 that seems significantly different from nicola when just that year is considered but this conclusion does not hold when looking at the centre of the uncertainty cluster over multiple years 3 6 simultaneous estimation of salt tolerance over multiple years although single year estimation already provides some insight the annual variability and the large uncertainty constitutes a problem and from a modelling point of view the annual variability would be devastating estimating the salt tolerance parameters for each year separately discards the knowledge gained from previous year estimations in fact the estimate of one year can serve as a prior to the estimate of a next year thus possibly allowing to narrow down the region of uncertainty to investigate this the expanded method explained in section 2 6 was used to obtain a simultaneous estimate of a unique set of salt tolerance parameters for each cultivar together with year by year varying yield estimates under the two alternative model hypotheses 3 6 1 discriminating between yield limiting hypotheses fig 8 shows the model predictions for all years of miss mignonne obtained with a single set of jointly estimated salt tolerance parameters under the two hypotheses based on the vangenuchten hoffman model fig 9 presents the associated histograms of the residuals i e the differences between the model predictions according to eqs 7 or 8 and the observed yield visual inspection of the model fits fig 8 shows that unlike the minimum rule the multiplicative model is able to provide fits that are within the data uncertainty range for all years even for years where the individual estimations failed such as miss mignonne in 2013 and 2016 also the rmse is lower this result is confirmed by the histograms of the residual error which under the multiplicative hypothesis is close to a gaussian distribution fig 9 left whereas under the minimum rule the histograms are clearly skewed fig 9 right in principle under the minimum rule the result may depend on the choice of the potential yield y pot here formally set to 70 tons ha 1 the choice is immaterial under the multiplicative rule see section 2 7 but a test in the plausible range from 50 to 90 tons ha revealed that the rmse remains around 5 8 so that the comparison is allowed similar plots with other cultivars all show the same tendencies supplementary material including the maas hoffman model as well hence the multiplicative hypothesis gives a better representation of the data than the minimum rule as it produces plausible fits irrespective of annual differences in yield this method enables the estimation of a universal set of salt tolerance parameters associated to a specific cultivar 3 6 2 yield differences while the method disentangles cultivar specific yields from cultivar specific salt tolerance parameters which is a significant asset the annual yield differences remain this is inherent to field experimentation and in addition it is a reality to the farmers too fig 10 shows the annually varying estimates of the zero observed effect yields y0 simultaneous estimation leads to slightly different values in each year as compared to separate estimation this slight shift makes the sum of squares for that particular year worse but it creates room for adjustment of the other parameters such that an acceptable fit is obtained for all years together the choice of the model vangenuchten hoffman or maas hoffman or the hypothesis multiplicative or minimum has little effect on the tuber yield estimates tuber yields can be up to 60 tons ha 1 not much different from what is obtained in commercial production in the netherlands 3 6 3 joint uncertainty region as expected the uncertainty range of the simultaneous estimation is narrower than the uncertainty range of the estimates for individual years as shown in fig 11 for miss mignonne the individual uncertainty contours for the years 2013 and 2016 are unreliable but they are shown here because these data are nevertheless incorporated in the joint estimation as they are real data cf fig 8 it may seem strange that some individual year contours are outside the joint contour e g 2012 but it should be kept in mind that the individual year contours shown are cross sections at the actual estimated yield in that single year the estimated y 0 in 2012 is 18 3 tons ha 1 whereas the fit in the joint estimate for that year is 21 3 tons ha 1 and hence in view of the correlation shown in fig 4 the salt tolerance cross section of the 3 d uncertainty space at these new values shifts to the left 3 6 4 which cultivars are significantly more salt tolerant revisited applying the models under the multiplicative rule finally gives rise to the united salt tolerance parameters and their uncertainty for the various cultivars the estimates for the vangenuchten hoffman model and the associated true uncertainty regions enclosed by the contours of equal sum of squares for all thirteen cultivars with multiple year data are shown in fig 12 for the standard parameterization ece 50 and for the alternate parameter ece 90 in fig 13 the characteristic salinities with the vangenuchten hoffman model vary from ece 50 9 5 13 ece90 4 8 ds m 1 and for the maas hoffman model not shown from ece thr 1 5 6 ds m 1 ece 90 3 8 ds m 1 the slope parameter is quite similar across cultivars except for rivola and to a lesser extent elgar rivola is clearly distinct from the other varieties it has a high characteristic salinity about twice as high as for instance achilles but also a steeper slope it has also a good yield 50 60 tons ha 1 other good candidates for salt affected soils are elgar and 927 although the observed yields are somewhat lower 40 45 tons ha 1 and 45 50 tons ha 1 respectively the lower sensitivity to high salinities by virtue of less steep slope can be an advantage in terms of ece 90 the ranking of the tested cultivars is achilles miss mignonne nicola magistral metro with an ece 90 between 4 and 4 5 ds m 1 followed by focus caruso connect ultra actrice 927 with an ece 90 between 5 and 6 ds m 1 and finally elgar rivola with an ece 90 above 7 5 ds m 1 4 discussion 4 1 estimation procedure and data each parameter estimation endeavor hinges on the quality of the data field data are notoriously subject to variability in the field trials underlying our data elaborate control on salinity and water dynamics during the growing season favored the analysis which otherwise would have been extremely difficult or impossible this is because without such control the seasonal mean salinity would not be representative for the entire root zone at all times even with these precautions tuber yield showed wide variability between replicates with seemingly equal salinity treatment we coped with this by taking all data into account in a formal parameter estimation procedure our procedure provides cultivar specific estimates of crop salt tolerance and their associated uncertainties we found that the vangenuchten hoffman model generally provides an adequate description although the difference with the maas hoffman model is not decisive and other descriptions might also be possible differences between models in yield prediction at salinities where yield reduction is already considerable are less important for agricultural practice but lack of yield data or very noisy data reduces the robustness of the predictions at low salinities in any model experiments with a restricted number of salinities that focus on traits as a proxy of the yield as advocated for fast in vitro screening e g morpurgo 1991 naik and widholm 1993 ekanayake and dodds 1993 zhang and donnelly 1997 while perhaps adequate to isolate promising accessions do not provide sufficient information for the prediction of yield reduction by salinity in the field in assessing salt tolerance models single year experiments are insufficient in view of the unavoidable variability between years a major contribution to reducing uncertainties is our approach to evaluate the salt tolerance jointly over multiple years while evaluation over individual years separately already narrows down the set of possible salt tolerance estimates it is the subsequent joint estimation of salt tolerance that substantially reduces the uncertainties further reduction of uncertainties might be achieved if unequivocal and independent information on the zero observed effect yield would be available note that the supremum of y0 over all years is the lower bound of the potential yield the potential yield itself cannot be estimated from these kind of field trials in view of the unavoidable environmental variability in the field an exact value of y0 in any particular year would require experimentation in the complete absence of soils salinity which is virtually impossible in the field it must be noted that even if y 0 would be known exactly estimation of salt tolerance parameters directly from the relative yield as is common practice is allowed under the multiplicative rule only in this respect our findings that this rule gives much better results than the minimum rule is reassuring 4 2 joint multiple year estimation if salt tolerance is a cultivar specific property one single parameter set per cultivar set should characterize it it could be that there are cultivars with time varying salt tolerance but current methods including ours cannot detect it and such cultivars will not be suitable for cropping on salt affected land anyway we tested several approaches of joining the estimation results over multiple years to obtain a single parameter set the simplest approach involved calculating a weighted mean from the individual year estimates inversely proportional to the estimated uncertainty ranges thus giving more weight to years with less data variability even though the correlation between estimates is ignored a preliminary ranking of cultivars is obtained but the procedure remains somewhat arbitrary a better approach is to consider the joint estimation for all years together this however requires a suitable model formulation on how yield reduction by salinity and yield reduction by other factors interact our findings are that in contrast to the minimum rule the multiplicative rule is able to produce quite acceptable fits across all years the unification of seemingly different year is possible due to the fact that the knowledge on each individual year serves as a prior for the estimation of the other years said differently the possibility that the true parameter for a particular year is anywhere within the individual year uncertainty contour is restricted by the measurements of the other years thus narrowing down the parameters to the most likely ones we acknowledge that the multiplicative rule may not apply to all types of simultaneous limitations in particular the interaction between salinity and water availability may be more complex see for instance homaee et al 2002a 2002b the continuous irrigation at the texel experiments was designed to avoid simultaneous water limitations thus giving confidence in our results but the downside is that with the current data water interaction cannot be studied 4 3 yield variation and yield limiting factors the necessity to introduce another yield limiting factor g k in our study is brought about by the year to year yield variations not only does yield vary in practice but unsuccessful attempts to provide explanations with the current state of knowledge as expressed in models underline that more work is needed in this area fleisher et al 2017 kadaja and tooming 2004 yin and struik 2010 what can be the possible sources of the unknown factor that is limiting yield one possibility is that crops grown on the plots in previous years being different among the plots within a treatment group of the current year influenced the soil microbiology and phytopathology geels and schippers 1983 larkin and honeycutt 2006 in addition the weather may vary from year to year but in that case yields of cultivars tested in the same year would likely be correlated which appears not to be the case in our study cf fig 10 the same holds for differences in nutrient availability between years water limitation possibly in interaction with air humidity backhausen et al 2005 may be possible but only gives yield differences between cultivars if each cultivar responds to these factors in a cultivar specific way there are reasons to assume that indeed tuber formation depends in cultivar specific ways on the actual dynamics of soil and weather conditions the sequence of events such as rainfall day time and night time temperatures although the same for all cultivars may have a different effect on the tuber formation per accession there are various accounts on the interrelationship between genetics and emergent properties one of the first being the work of ewing about the interaction with heat stress ewing 1981 it is known that there are early and late potatoes also showing the interaction between genetics and environmental conditions the need for greater understanding of the response to a changing environment is even larger in the light of global warming dahal et al 2019 george et al 2017 levy and veilleux 2007 while these studies are phenomenological the ultimate dream is to be able to provide a molecular genetic basis khan et al 2019 yin and struik 2010 however none of these publications explicitly addresses the effect on final yield of environmental dynamics during growth except to some extent levy 1992 who studied the effect of the start of the saline treatment the final tuber yield is the result of the integration of growth rate and root shoot partitioning over time in principle dynamic models describing these processes have the potential to cope with dynamic variations we believe that our results are valuable in the further development of dynamic crop models genetic differences between varieties may be expressed as differences in process parameters spitters and schapendonk 1990 yin and van laar 2005 and the actual variation in environmental and soil conditions will then be responsible for differences in final yield it is however almost impossible to calibrate such models from final yields alone the minimum that should be done is to follow some easily detectable traits such as above ground biomass leaf area index plant height and possibly others during the growing season in combination with the final tuber yield it goes without saying that such experimentation would require extensive resources in the light of all this our approach of an empirical additional limiting factor is perhaps a gross simplification of reality but it does provide a significant and practical means of uniting the results of several years of experimentation as testified by our results our results highlight that differences in salt tolerance exist among potato cultivars some of the differences we observed would not have been picked up when testing at just a single salinity level as is sometimes done in fast screening while estimation of the entire salt tolerance curve is more labor intensive and time consuming we are convinced that the entire curve is essential in dynamic crop models the characteristic salinity parameter serves as an indication of the effect of the average salinity over the season while the slope is relevant to cope with the seasonal dynamics the salt tolerance of certain potato cultivars as found in our field trials is substantially higher than reported by fao thus potatoes may be grown at more brackish salt affected conditions than believed previously which may have important implications for global food production a final word of caution is however in place regarding such extrapolation of our results to other situations the results in this study were obtained in sandy soil and for crops that till emergence did not receive saline water as pointed out by levy and veilleux 2007 high yield cultivars may have adapted to the conditions of moderate climate zones reversing the argument it remains to be seen how well cultivars that are relatively salt tolerant in our experiment perform under other climate and soil conditions 5 conclusions to incorporate salt limitation functions in crop yield models it is essential to have cultivar specific parameters the proposed method alleviates the difficulty of seemingly annually varying parameters our study shows that the characterization of crop salt tolerance by characteristic parameters cannot be done by determining the response at one or two salinities only but requires the acquisition of the entire salt tolerance curve moreover single year experimentation is not enough to obtain a reliable picture of salt tolerance of a particular cultivar thanks to assessing the uncertainties of parameter estimates and the joint estimation over multiple years we could prove that there are significant differences in salt tolerance among potato cultivars these differences do exist and can be considerable in this study the cultivars rivola elgar and 927 were found to be more tolerant than other cultivars on sandy soils analysis of two possible models for describing the interaction of another unknown limiting factor with salt limitation revealed that the multiplicative rule performs better than the minimum rule and can provide acceptable fits for all tested years in combination our work positively identifies high yielding potato cultivars that have potential for salt affected

model for the canadian prairies in the context of agricultural input systems and diversified rotations the alternative cropping systems acs study presents an opportunity for researchers to evaluate changes in no3 n and soil p as a function of field practices such as tillage and crop diversity of various intensities in the context of simulated climate change scenarios the acs field experiment was conducted from 1994 to 2013 at the agriculture and agri food canada research farm near scott saskatchewan the acs study is one of a few long term field experiments in the canadian prairies conducted to assess the effects of inputs and crop diversity on crop production and soil quality the acs study stands out of other similar long term rotation studies in that it combined rotations and inputs typical of the canadian prairies this 19 year study combined rotations and agricultural input systems which included summer fallow and cereal monoculture a diversity of cereal and broadleaf crops with minimal use of summer fallow and a combination of annual and perennial crops the goal of the study was to evaluate the effects of inputs and diversity on crop productivity and environmental footprint including accumulation and distribution of soil no3 n and p lychuk et al 2017a concluded that april precipitation was the primary factor affecting yield in this long term rotation study environmental factors such as monthly growing season precipitation gsp and growing degree days gdd combined with terrain attributes slope and micro topography accounted for a significant proportion of yield variation agricultural input and cropping diversity also affected yield but to a lesser extent than environmental factors simulation models based on ensemble analysis of historical and future climate scenarios are essential tools for testing hypotheses concerning the impacts of climate change on agricultural production and water resources researchers have used global and national contexts to evaluate the effects of climate change on agriculture utilizing global climate models gcms parry et al 1999 reilly et al 2003 reilly and schimmelpfennig 1999 according to thomson et al 2005 climate change will have an influence on regional agriculture with consequences spanning from regional to global food production the utilization of regional climate model rcm based simulations on regional levels are more relevant to gcm based simulations because rcms simulate temperature and precipitation at finer scales 50 km compared to most gcms e g 100 400 kilometers alley 2007 the multi rcm gcm ensembles available now for north america through north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2012 mearns et al 2009 are successfully used to assess uncertainty and bias for various rcm projections khaliq et al 2014 to our knowledge the impact of simulated temperature and precipitation on no3 n leaching and soil labile p has not been previously studied in the context of crop inputs tillage fertilizer pesticides and rotations management of no3 n and soil labile p are of particular interest to producers since n and p are the most common fertilizer inputs for cereal and oilseed crops in western canada the first objective of this study was to validate the epic model with experimental no3 n and labile soil p data from the acs study the second objective was to evaluate trends in no3 n leaching 0 90 cm and labile soil p 0 15 cm due to climate change the third objective was to identify one or more management systems which reduce the environmental impact of climate change on no3 n leaching and labile soil p 2 materials and methods the flow diagram fig 1 of this modeling study similar to the approach by lychuk et al 2019 represents information with

chernozem coarse loamy textured mesic typic haploboroll us soil classification table 1 soils were developed from modified glacial till clayton and ellis 1952 slopes ranged from 1 to 3 in 1995 nine 6 year cropping systems were initiated the nine cropping systems were combinations of three input management strategies applied to three levels of cropping diversity table 2 the input levels were 1 organic org based on weed control with tillage and non chemical pest management and nutrients to reflect practices used by organic growers 2 reduced red employed no till practices and integrated long

recommendations with tillage the diversity levels were 1 low crop diversity system low wheat oilseed and fallow or green manure based rotations 2 diversified annual grains system dag diverse cereal oilseed and pulse crops and 3 diversified annuals and perennials systems dap mix of grain and forage crops the experimental design was a split plot with four replications the input levels crop diversity and crop phases were the main sub and sub sub plots respectively the experimental site was 16 ha and the dimensions of each subplot were 40 m x 12 8 m fertilizer and nutrient management practices data collection and soil sampling procedures were described in a companion paper by lychuk et al 2017b and by brandt et al 2010 the summary is also provided in the appendix supplementary material section of this paper 2 2 epic model the epic model v 1102 was validated with experimental crop yield lychuk et al 2017c soc lychuk et al 2019 and no3 n and labile soil p below using 19 years of yield field management and meteorological data from the acs study daily weather data were input to the model from historical records or climate change scenarios for precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation wind and relative humidity stockle et al 1992 adapted epic parameters to simulate the effect of co2 fertilization on radiation use efficiency and evapotranspiration for elevated co2 concentrations in c3 and c4 plants the epic model calculates soil c and n based on substrate specific rate constants temperature and water content in a daily time step carbon and n fluxes are calculated based on the n supply for each soil process izaurralde et al 2006 leachate no3 n kg ha 1 is a dynamic stock calculated on a daily basis over the growing season from the concentration of no3 n solution density and net balance in the soil water surface runoff and leaching based on the cumulative amount for 15 cm increments 0 90 cm labile soil p kg ha 1 williams et al 2015 represents a stock of p available for plant use in a plow layer 0 15 cm on a daily basis over the growing season this stock is in dynamic equilibrium with fertilizer p fresh organic p stable organic p active and stable inorganic p pools jones et al 1984 and sharpley et al 1984 the epic model is based on the first generation of p models jones et al 1984 and may not reflect the most recent science and analyses of p speciation and dynamics but it includes modifications related to improved c and n cycling williams et al 2015 the epic model is a significant component of swat and apex which are commonly used in watershed research to assess n and p in water quality gassman et al 2005 and izaurralde et al 2006 provided detailed description on epic model algorithms this modeling study discusses no3 n and labile soil p under canola wheat and barley phases of input and diversity combinations in each year over 30 year simulations n 779 precipitation temperature solar radiation wind and relative humidity data were obtained from either historic weather records or historic and future climate change scenarios from the narccap dataset table 3 mearns et al 2012 mearns et al 2009 refer to lychuk et al 2019 for more details with regards to climatic input data and simulations terrain attributes at the scott research site and recursive partition analysis a summary is also provided in appendix supplementary materials section 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted with jmp version 12 0 0 sas institute inc 2015 soil no3 n leaching 0 90 cm and labile soil p 0 15 cm output from the epic model were compared between observed historic and rcm gcm based historic and future scenarios multiple mean comparisons were performed with the tukey hsd test effects were declared significant at p 0 05 refer to the appendix supplementary materials section for details involving analysis of covariance partition analysis and model validation with experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation experimental and simulated data 1994 2013 infiltration did not vary significantly between treatments with forages data not shown in contrast smith et al 2020 and woodley et al 2018 reported greater infiltration due to higher surface hydraulic conductivity for rotational corn for a research site in woodslee ontario in the acs study hydraulic conductivity did not vary between treatments with perennial forages presumably due to the presence of small grains and oilseeds in the rotations and considerable statistical variability of this soil property within treatments the epic model accurately simulated trends in long term no3 n 1995 2013 table 4 when compared with experimental data the simulation was accurate for all treatment combinations with the exception of red dap where experimental and simulated data were significantly different the model did not accurately simulate n processes at depth for rotations with deep rooted perennials overall the model predicted long term no3 n with an overall error of 6 rmse 8 kg ha 1 r 2 0 81 and d index 0 77 table 4 similar to experimental no3 n the epic model accurately simulated long term 1995 2013 labile soil p for all combinations of input and diversity table 5 with the exception of red dap overall the model successfully predicted long term p dynamics with r 2 0 92 d 0 82 rmse 1 kg ha 1 and an overall error of 19 in summary the epic model predicted changes in experimental no3 n and labile soil p relatively accurately as affected by inputs and crop diversity in this long term field experiment this demonstrates that the model may be used to predict changes in no3 n and labile soil p for this case study the epic model has also been validated in other experimental research on no3 n in leachate and soil p in temperate soils for example chung et al 2002 concluded that epic model successfully reproduced the effects of various tillage and crop rotation systems on no3 n losses in 11 out of 14 comparisons at the research site near nashua iowa furthermore the relative impact of the three different cropping systems on no3 n loss chung et al 2001 was accurately simulated with the epic model for a 4 year experiment at a site near lamberton mn wang et al 2018 reported that epic model adequately simulated losses of dissolved reactive phosphorus at an experimental site in harrow ontario canada 3 2 effects of climate change on no3 n leaching and labile soil p across all levels of input diversity and terrain attributes 3 2 1 epic model analyses experimental 1971 2000 and future ensemble 2041 2070 climate scenarios model analyses with historical climate data were significantly different from those with the ensemble of future climate data long term 30 year annual average no3 n in leachate cumulative 0 90 cm kg ha 1 y 1 predicted by the epic model across all input and diversity levels for 2041 2070 with the ensemble of rcm gcm model scenario 5 was 10 3 kg ha 1 y 1 42 higher table 6 compared to no3 n losses under the observed historical baseline weather 1971 2000 scenario 1 long term 30 year annual average labile soil p 0 15 cm predicted by the model did not significantly increase under climate change p 0 05 relative to soil p under observed historical baseline table 6 overall no3 n leaching increased significantly under climate change in ensemble analyses though individual models contributed to bias in these analyses due to variability in gsp and gdd the impact of climate change on nitrate n leaching cannot be understated and represents a key environmental consequence of variability in precipitation and temperature for the majority of the climate change models and the ensemble average april to september monthly average gsp and gdd was significantly higher compared to the historical observed baseline average table a2 in addition for the majority of the climate scenarios and the ensemble average the monthly average gdd was significantly higher than the observed historical baseline average with the exception for may august and september the differences in no3 n leaching were attributed to the effects of climate change on precipitation and temperature this finding was in agreement with relevant research on the effects of climate change effects on nutrient transport in canada for example golmohammadi et al 2016 indicated that changes in climate will significantly increase no3 n losses at a research site in south eastern ontario 3 2 2 epic model analyses historical ensemble 1971 2000 and future ensemble 2041 2070 climate scenarios model simulations of no3 n and labile soil p were significantly different for ensemble data in the historical 1971 2000 and future 2041 2070 periods long term 30 year annual average no3 n in leachate cumulative 0 90 cm simulated with the epic model under ensemble analysis with the 7 models scenarios 4 and 5 increased by 7 7 kg ha 1 y 1 28 from original stocks due to climate change long term 30 year annual average labile soil p decreased by 3 1 kg ha 1 y 1 12 fig 2 in comparison with simulated historical values long term 30 year annual average no3 n losses cumulative 0 90 cm were smaller 28 vs 42 while the decrease in average labile soil p was greater 12 in simulations of future climate compared to those under observed historical 1971 2000 baseline section 3 2 1 uncertainty of simulated precipitation and temperature was reduced with the reliability of ensemble average rea method refer to reliability of ensemble average method in appendix supplementary material section in ensemble simulations of no3 n and labile p for future and historic climate projections increases in no3 n losses and decreases in labile soil p were ascribed to an increases in average gsp of 11 minimum 2 03¬∫c and maximum 1 06 ¬∫c temperatures and resulting extended growing seasons table a3 similar results were reported by other researchers who investigated effects of climate change on nutrient transport in agricultural runoff elsewhere in canada for example paradis et al 2016 simulated an increase in no3 n leaching rates between 14 and 21 due to the effects of climate change on land use fertilization and crop yield in prince edward island canada mehdi et al 2015 simulated with the swat model effects of three climate change scenarios on streamflow nutrient loads for a 629 km2 pike river watershed in the province of quebec and state of vermont they concluded that higher annual precipitation amounts in all climate simulations increased the mean annual total phosphorus loads by 0 2 mg y 1 while mean annual no3 n loads increased substantially by 152 227 mg y 1 these and other studies demonstrate that climate change will increase no3 n leaching in canada though these may be mitigated with the appropriate crop management of inputs and diversity 3 3 epic model analyses crop management with historical ensemble and future ensemble climate scenarios 3 3 1 no3 n leaching model simulations clearly differed due to crop management with simulated climate data from the historical 1971 2000 and future 2041 2070 periods effect of agricultural inputs was significant on no3 n over 30 years of past and future climate scenarios future no3 n 30 year annual average leaching losses cumulative 0 90 cm predicted by the epic under climate change were significantly higher in simulations of org and red systems relative to hi 35 9 kg ha 1 y 1 and 35 8 kg ha 1 y 1 vs 32 2 kg ha 1 y 1 differences in no3 n leaching losses between org and red were not significant golmohammadi et al 2016 also concluded that future no3 n losses were significantly higher in no till compared to conventional tillage based on simulations with the drainmod model for a research site in ottawa ontario we attributed increased no3 n leaching losses in the simulations to 1 higher initial n in red dap and org dap systems as a function of compost applied to replace n and p removed as forage and barley and 2 the presence of alfalfa in three consecutive years in dap which resulted in high quantities of fixed nitrogen long term 30 year annual average no3 n leaching losses cumulative 0 90 cm predicted by epic for the rcm gcm ensemble 2041 2070 scenario 5 were highest in red x dap and hi x low fig 3 nitrate losses were high in combinations with dap and low relative to other treatments similar to experimental results previously reported for the acs study malhi et al 2002 2009 arcand et al 2017 reported that no3 n content in red input was 5 higher compared to org reflecting different nutrient input regimes and crop residue return between the two systems over the course of the acs study experimental soil no3 n in red x dap was highest in four of the six years of the second cycle 2001 2006 and second largest in five of the six years of the first cycle 1995 2000 of the acs study malhi et al 2002 2009 average experimental soil no3 n was highest under hi low during the first and second cycles of the acs study grant and lafond 1994 also reported higher no3 n under a crop crop crop fallow system compared to systems with four years of cropping on a black chernozemic soil they concluded that nitrification and moisture conserved in the fallow period led to increased no3 n leaching below the root zone long term 30 year annual average no3 n leaching losses cumulative 0 90 cm were lowest in simulations with the red x dag and hi x dag combinations of input and diversity fig 3 under climate change scenario 5 we attributed the lowest no3 n losses in these combinations to greater n uptake by grain crops cereal oilseed and pulses in dag consequently inclusion of grain crops in the rotations may decrease no3 n leaching in addition lychuk et al 2019 reported that the epic model simulated the second highest soc and second lowest rates of respired soil c in the red x dag system relative to all other combinations of input and diversity for future climate predicted by the ensemble model average furthermore simulated wheat yield from 2041 to 2070 by epic was highest in red compared to the other input systems adoption of red x dag may reduce the impact of climate change by lowering no3 n leaching maintaining crop yield and soc levels and reducing losses of respired soil c through microbial respiration trends increase vs decrease in simulated no3 n losses for future climate scenario 5 and observed historical weather scenario 1 were similar they were highest in red x dap 41 1 kg ha 1 y 1 hi x low 32 1 kg ha 1 y 1 and lowest in red x dag 15 6 kg ha 1 y 1 hi x dag 17 6 kg ha 1 y 1 in simulations with observed historical baseline 1971 2000 scenario 1 thus combinations of hi and red inputs with cropping diversity were similar with respect to highest and lowest no3 n leaching losses for future and past climate simulations we concluded that cropping diversity not input primarily affected future no3 n losses in analyses with pa 28 of variation pa for all variables table 7 and anova 22 of total variation for a subset of variables table 8 followed by precipitation in summer months 12 as well as effects of surface convexity and relative slope position table 7 increases in future annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures explained 13 7 and 6 of variation in no3 n leaching losses in analyses of covariance for each variable table 9 agricultural inputs accounted for 1 of the total variation table 8 the red x dag system resulted in the lowest no3 n leaching losses fig 3 and third highest labile soil p fig 4 compared to other input and diversity combinations producers may adopt red x dag systems to reduce n fertilizer inputs and decrease losses of n through leaching due to increased precipitation related to climate change 3 3 2 labile soil p predicted 30 year annual average fall available labile soil p 0 15 cm for the climate change scenario 2041 2070 characterized by the rcm gcm ensemble scenario 5 and for the historical baseline 1971 2000 scenario 1 was highest in red 28 03 kg ha 1 y 1 and 31 84 kg ha 1 y 1 intermediate in hi 23 29 kg ha 1 y 1 and 27 24 kg ha 1 y 1 and lowest in org 13 46 kg ha 1 y 1 and 14 83 kg ha 1 y 1 input total labile p simulated in the soil profile 0 90 cm was also highest in red 254 kg ha 1 y 1 and 262 kg ha 1 y 1 followed by hi 242 kg ha 1 y 1 and 249 kg ha 1 y 1 and lowest in org 211 kg ha 1 y 1 and 215 kg ha 1 y 1 input fertilizer p increased the labile pool for hi and red systems relative to org where no p fertilizer was applied higher levels of labile soil p in red inputs were also attributed to minimal soil disturbance and stratification arcand et al 2016 also reported 3 5 times greater available p in red compared to org system where fungi and actinobacteria were more dominant wilson et al 2016 observed elevated levels of labile soil p in fields that historically received application of fertilizer or manure in combination with tillage compared to lower soil p for low input organic and no till fields in southwestern manitoba malhi et al 2002 2009 reported no significant differences in experimental labile soil p between hi red and org inputs in the first 1995 2000 and second 2001 2006 cycles of the acs study however lychuk unpublished data and lemke unpublished data found that 18 year average labile soil p for the acs study was highest under red intermediate in hi and lowest in org input in addition initial 1995 and final 2012 measurements of labile soil p showed a gradual increase in all input and diversity levels with the exception of org where soil p content declined with time simulated 30 year annual average labile p 0 15 cm by epic in climate change scenarios 2041 2070 such as the rcm gcm ensemble scenario 5 was highest in red x dap intermediate in all combinations with hi red x dag followed by red x low and org x dap and lowest in org x dag and org x low fig 4 malhi et al 2002 also observed that p in the hi x low treatment was higher compared to other treatments in the field in the first cycle of the acs study in our modeling study labile p in hi x low was second highest relative to other treatment combinations fig 4 in partition analysis simulated long term 2041 2070 30 year average labile soil p 0 15 cm scenario 5 was mostly affected by terrain attributes in the field such as catchment slope and relative slope position maximum height and by agricultural inputs to a lesser extent table 7 in anova when variability due to terrain attributes was accounted for subset of variables selected with pa table 8 cropping diversity was correlated with 13 of variation in labile soil p followed by input 7 for climate change scenarios 2041 2070 such as the rcm gcm ensemble scenario 5 table 8 while terrain attributes accounted for about 1 of total variation increases in annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures for climate change scenarios did not significantly influence labile soil p in analysis of covariance while cropping diversity and input were significant and were correlated with 44 of the total variation table 9 4 conclusions this research identifies crop management which is best suited to adapt to climate change with respect to no3 n leaching and soil labile p for a case study in the canadian prairies this is the first analysis with epic model in the canadian prairies of the effects of climate change on no3 n losses in the agricultural runoff and soil p content in the context of different agricultural input systems in combination with diversified rotations this research provides a quantitative analysis of the effects of climate change on no3 n leaching and labile soil p and the environment under climate change no3 n leaching simulated by the epic model increased by 28 while labile soil p decreased by 12 relative to historical values input and diversity combination explained 23 and 20 of variation in future no3 n losses and labile soil p respectively the impact of cropping diversity was most significant with reduced no3 n leaching and labile p under climate change accounting for 22 and 13 of total variation respectively summer precipitation explained 12 of total variation in future no3 n leaching losses the remaining variation in these variables was attributed to gsp and gdd in other months as well as effects of terrain attributes at the research site the combination of cropping diversity and input accounted for 44 of the variation in future labile soil p farming practices under red x dag system will decrease no3 n leaching and maintain optimal labile soil p soc and crop yield relative to other management diverse rotations with reduced inputs are a promising adaptive management option in the context of climate change as shown in this case study additional research is necessary to assess these relationships for other sites and research studies the scientific community decision and policy makers will use this

10083,the relative impact of climate change agricultural inputs crop diversity and environment on soil nitrate n no3 n and labile soil phosphorus p has seldom been assessed in the scientific literature furthermore crop management of plant nutrients based on a combination of agricultural inputs and crop diversity has not been assessed with respect to adaptation to climate change this modeling study assessed soil no3 n leaching and labile p simulated with the environmental policy integrated climate epic model for historical and future climate scenarios for the alternative cropping

three levels of agricultural inputs organic org reduced red and high hi and three levels of cropping diversity low low diversified annual grains dag and diversified annual perennial dap recursive partitioning with multivariate analyses of agricultural inputs cropping diversity precipitation growing degree days and terrain were used to assess changes in no3 n and p for each climate change scenario this is the first analysis with the epic model in the canadian prairies of the effects of climate change on no3 n losses in agricultural runoff and soil p content in the context of different agricultural input systems in combinations with diversified rotations no3 n losses increased by 28 from 27 1 to 34 7 kg ha 1 y 1 while labile soil p decreased by 12 from 24 7 to 21 6 kg ha 1 y 1 under climate change compared to historical weather summer precipitation explained 12 of total variation in future no3 n losses combined input and diversity explained 23 and 20 of variation in no3 n losses and labile p respectively cropping diversity was most significant with reduced no3 n leaching and labile p under climate change accounting for 22 and 13 of total variation respectively combined red inputs and dag diversity reduced the impact of climate change on no3 n losses and soil p and may provide a sustainable adaptive solution for farming with regards to upcoming seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation the scientific community decision and policy makers will use this information to develop conceptual and practical farm and field scale technologies for producers in order

precipitation patterns and rising concentrations of atmospheric co2 canadian producers can adapt to environmental change by changing rotation varying fertilizer tillage and other crop inputs however there are few publications which identify combinations of input and crop diversity which mitigate the effects of projected climate change grains and oilseeds in canada are primarily produced in the canadian prairies martz et al 2007 according to sauchyn and kulshreshtha 2008 agriculture in the prairie provinces will face major climate change challenges related to water availability in the summer season greater frequencies of droughts and in developing crop adaptation strategies due to expected variability in future growing season precipitation and temperatures in the prairies kulshreshtha and wheaton 2013 climate change will significantly affect environmental quality with respect to losses of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from agricultural runoff nitrogen and p fertilizer applications have been related to increased stream nutrient loads hatfield et al 2013 that increase algal biomass which decompose and deplete oxygen from surface water transport of nitrate no3 n from fields is dominated by leaching and tile drainage of water jaynes et al 2001 singer et al 2011 particulate and dissolved p p in soil solution are the major forms of p transferred from land to surface waters in the canadian prairies field management practices and fertilizer applications affect soil n and p for example malhi et al 2008 reported that no till soil had a greater mass of light fraction organic c and n compared to conventionally tilled soil in other research cropping intensity and diversity amount of applied fertilizer and soil type also affected the magnitude of p accumulation in the soil profile benbi and biswas 1999 malhi et al 2002 in the past researchers successfully used process based models such as the environmental policy integrated climate epic model to analyse and predict the effects of crop management on crop yield and nutrient dynamics users successfully validated the model under different management environments climates and soils with regards to no3 n chung et al 2002

model for the canadian prairies in the context of agricultural input systems and diversified rotations the alternative cropping systems acs study presents an opportunity for researchers to evaluate changes in no3 n and soil p as a function of field practices such as tillage and crop diversity of various intensities in the context of simulated climate change scenarios the acs field experiment was conducted from 1994 to 2013 at the agriculture and agri food canada research farm near scott saskatchewan the acs study is one of a few long term field experiments in the canadian prairies conducted to assess the effects of inputs and crop diversity on crop production and soil quality the acs study stands out of other similar long term rotation studies in that it combined rotations and inputs typical of the canadian prairies this 19 year study combined rotations and agricultural input systems which included summer fallow and cereal monoculture a diversity of cereal and broadleaf crops with minimal use of summer fallow and a combination of annual and perennial crops the goal of the study was to evaluate the effects of inputs and diversity on crop productivity and environmental footprint including accumulation and distribution of soil no3 n and p lychuk et al 2017a concluded that april precipitation was the primary factor affecting yield in this long term rotation study environmental factors such as monthly growing season precipitation gsp and growing degree days gdd combined with terrain attributes slope and micro topography accounted for a significant proportion of yield variation agricultural input and cropping diversity also affected yield but to a lesser extent than environmental factors simulation models based on ensemble analysis of historical and future climate scenarios are essential tools for testing hypotheses concerning the impacts of climate change on agricultural production and water resources researchers have used global and national contexts to evaluate the effects of climate change on agriculture utilizing global climate models gcms parry et al 1999 reilly et al 2003 reilly and schimmelpfennig 1999 according to thomson et al 2005 climate change will have an influence on regional agriculture with consequences spanning from regional to global food production the utilization of regional climate model rcm based simulations on regional levels are more relevant to gcm based simulations because rcms simulate temperature and precipitation at finer scales 50 km compared to most gcms e g 100 400 kilometers alley 2007 the multi rcm gcm ensembles available now for north america through north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2012 mearns et al 2009 are successfully used to assess uncertainty and bias for various rcm projections khaliq et al 2014 to our knowledge the impact of simulated temperature and precipitation on no3 n leaching and soil labile p has not been previously studied in the context of crop inputs tillage fertilizer pesticides and rotations management of no3 n and soil labile p are of particular interest to producers since n and p are the most common fertilizer inputs for cereal and oilseed crops in western canada the first objective of this study was to validate the epic model with experimental no3 n and labile soil p data from the acs study the second objective was to evaluate trends in no3 n leaching 0 90 cm and labile soil p 0 15 cm due to climate change the third objective was to identify one or more management systems which reduce the environmental impact of climate change on no3 n leaching and labile soil p 2 materials and methods the flow diagram fig 1 of this modeling study similar to the approach by lychuk et al 2019 represents information with

rotation study the acs experiment was implemented from 1994 until 2013 at the aafc s scott research farm saskatchewan 52 22 n 108 50 w elevation 713 m soils in the study were classified as dark brown chernozem coarse loamy textured mesic typic haploboroll us soil classification table 1 soils were developed from modified glacial till clayton and ellis 1952 slopes ranged from 1 to 3 in 1995 nine 6 year cropping systems were initiated the nine cropping systems were combinations of three input management strategies applied to three levels of cropping diversity table 2 the input levels were 1 organic org based on weed control with tillage and non chemical pest management and nutrients to reflect practices used by organic growers 2 reduced red employed no till practices and integrated long term nutrient management based on soil test recommendations and pests based on pests thresholds and pressure and 3 high hi used pesticides as required and fertilizers based on soil test recommendations with tillage the diversity levels were 1 low crop diversity system low wheat oilseed and fallow or green manure based rotations 2 diversified annual grains system dag diverse cereal oilseed and pulse crops and 3 diversified annuals and perennials systems dap mix of grain and forage crops the experimental design was a split plot with four replications the input levels crop diversity and crop phases were the main sub and sub sub plots respectively the experimental site was 16 ha and the dimensions of each subplot were 40 m x 12 8 m fertilizer and nutrient management practices data collection and soil sampling procedures were described in a companion paper by lychuk et al 2017b and by brandt et al 2010 the summary is also provided in the appendix supplementary material section of this paper 2 2 epic model the epic model v 1102 was validated with experimental crop yield lychuk et al 2017c soc lychuk et al 2019 and no3 n and labile soil p below using 19 years of yield field management and meteorological data from the acs study daily weather data were input to the model from historical records or climate change scenarios for precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation wind and relative humidity stockle et al 1992 adapted epic parameters to simulate the effect of co2 fertilization on radiation use efficiency and evapotranspiration for elevated co2 concentrations in c3 and c4 plants the epic model calculates soil c and n based on substrate specific rate constants temperature and water content in a daily time step carbon and n fluxes are calculated based on the n supply for each soil process izaurralde et al 2006 leachate no3 n kg ha 1 is a dynamic stock calculated on a daily basis over the growing season from the concentration of no3 n solution density and net balance in the soil water surface runoff and leaching based on the cumulative amount for 15 cm increments 0 90 cm labile soil p kg ha 1 williams et al 2015 represents a stock of p available for plant use in a plow layer 0 15 cm on a daily basis over the growing season this stock is in dynamic equilibrium with fertilizer p fresh organic p stable organic p active and stable inorganic p pools jones et al 1984 and sharpley et al 1984 the epic model is based on the first generation of p models jones et al 1984 and may not reflect the most recent science and analyses of p speciation and dynamics but it includes modifications related to improved c and n cycling williams et al 2015 the epic model is a significant component of swat and apex which are commonly used in watershed research to assess n and p in water quality gassman et al 2005 and izaurralde et al 2006 provided detailed description on epic model algorithms this modeling study discusses no3 n and labile soil p under canola wheat and barley phases of input and diversity combinations in each year over 30 year simulations n 779 precipitation temperature solar radiation wind and relative humidity data were obtained from either historic weather records or historic and future climate change scenarios from the narccap dataset table 3 mearns et al 2012 mearns et al 2009 refer to lychuk et al 2019 for more details with regards to climatic input data and simulations terrain attributes at the scott research site and recursive partition analysis a summary is also provided in appendix supplementary materials section 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted with jmp version 12 0 0 sas institute inc 2015 soil no3 n leaching 0 90 cm and labile soil p 0 15 cm output from the epic model were compared between observed historic and rcm gcm based historic and future scenarios multiple mean comparisons were performed with the tukey hsd test effects were declared significant at p 0 05 refer to the appendix supplementary materials section for details involving analysis of covariance partition analysis and model validation with experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation experimental and simulated data 1994 2013 infiltration did not vary significantly between treatments with forages data not shown in contrast smith et al 2020 and woodley et al 2018 reported greater infiltration due to higher surface hydraulic conductivity for rotational corn for a research site in woodslee ontario in the acs study hydraulic conductivity did not vary between treatments with perennial forages presumably due to the presence of small grains and oilseeds in the rotations and considerable statistical variability of this soil property within treatments the epic model accurately simulated trends in long term no3 n 1995 2013 table 4 when compared with experimental data the simulation was accurate for all treatment combinations with the exception of red dap where experimental and simulated data were significantly different the model did not accurately simulate n processes at depth for rotations with deep rooted perennials overall the model predicted long term no3 n with an overall error of 6 rmse 8 kg ha 1 r 2 0 81 and d index 0 77 table 4 similar to experimental no3 n the epic model accurately simulated long term 1995 2013 labile soil p for all combinations of input and diversity table 5 with the exception of red dap overall the model successfully predicted long term p dynamics with r 2 0 92 d 0 82 rmse 1 kg ha 1 and an overall error of 19 in summary the epic model predicted changes in experimental no3 n and labile soil p relatively accurately as affected by inputs and crop diversity in this long term field experiment this demonstrates that the model may be used to predict changes in no3 n and labile soil p for this case study the epic model has also been validated in other experimental research on no3 n in leachate and soil p in temperate soils for example chung et al 2002 concluded that epic model successfully reproduced the effects of various tillage and crop rotation systems on no3 n losses in 11 out of 14 comparisons at the research site near nashua iowa furthermore the relative impact of the three different cropping systems on no3 n loss chung et al 2001 was accurately simulated with the epic model for a 4 year experiment at a site near lamberton mn wang et al 2018 reported that epic model adequately simulated losses of dissolved reactive phosphorus at an experimental site in harrow ontario canada 3 2 effects of climate change on no3 n leaching and labile soil p across all levels of input diversity and terrain attributes 3 2 1 epic model analyses experimental 1971 2000 and future ensemble 2041 2070 climate scenarios model analyses with historical climate data were significantly different from those with the ensemble of future climate data long term 30 year annual average no3 n in leachate cumulative 0 90 cm kg ha 1 y 1 predicted by the epic model across all input and diversity levels for 2041 2070 with the ensemble of rcm gcm model scenario 5 was 10 3 kg ha 1 y 1 42 higher table 6 compared to no3 n losses under the observed historical baseline weather 1971 2000 scenario 1 long term 30 year annual average labile soil p 0 15 cm predicted by the model did not significantly increase under climate change p 0 05 relative to soil p under observed historical baseline table 6 overall no3 n leaching increased significantly under climate change in ensemble analyses though individual models contributed to bias in these analyses due to variability in gsp and gdd the impact of climate change on nitrate n leaching cannot be understated and represents a key environmental consequence of variability in precipitation and temperature for the majority of the climate change models and the ensemble average april to september monthly average gsp and gdd was significantly higher compared to the historical observed baseline average table a2 in addition for the majority of the climate scenarios and the ensemble average the monthly average gdd was significantly higher than the observed historical baseline average with the exception for may august and september the differences in no3 n leaching were attributed to the effects of climate change on precipitation and temperature this finding was in agreement with relevant research on the effects of climate change effects on nutrient transport in canada for example golmohammadi et al 2016 indicated that changes in climate will significantly increase no3 n losses at a research site in south eastern ontario 3 2 2 epic model analyses historical ensemble 1971 2000 and future ensemble 2041 2070 climate scenarios model simulations of no3 n and labile soil p were significantly different for ensemble data in the historical 1971 2000 and future 2041 2070 periods long term 30 year annual average no3 n in leachate cumulative 0 90 cm simulated with the epic model under ensemble analysis with the 7 models scenarios 4 and 5 increased by 7 7 kg ha 1 y 1 28 from original stocks due to climate change long term 30 year annual average labile soil p decreased by 3 1 kg ha 1 y 1 12 fig 2 in comparison with simulated historical values long term 30 year annual average no3 n losses cumulative 0 90 cm were smaller 28 vs 42 while the decrease in average labile soil p was greater 12 in simulations of future climate compared to those under observed historical 1971 2000 baseline section 3 2 1 uncertainty of simulated precipitation and temperature was reduced with the reliability of ensemble average rea method refer to reliability of ensemble average method in appendix supplementary material section in ensemble simulations of no3 n and labile p for future and historic climate projections increases in no3 n losses and decreases in labile soil p were ascribed to an increases in average gsp of 11 minimum 2 03¬∫c and maximum 1 06 ¬∫c temperatures and resulting extended growing seasons table a3 similar results were reported by other researchers who investigated effects of climate change on nutrient transport in agricultural runoff elsewhere in canada for example paradis et al 2016 simulated an increase in no3 n leaching rates between 14 and 21 due to the effects of climate change on land use fertilization and crop yield in prince edward island canada mehdi et al 2015 simulated with the swat model effects of three climate change scenarios on streamflow nutrient loads for a 629 km2 pike river watershed in the province of quebec and state of vermont they concluded that higher annual precipitation amounts in all climate simulations increased the mean annual total phosphorus loads by 0 2 mg y 1 while mean annual no3 n loads increased substantially by 152 227 mg y 1 these and other studies demonstrate that climate change will increase no3 n leaching in canada though these may be mitigated with the appropriate crop management of inputs and diversity 3 3 epic model analyses crop management with historical ensemble and future ensemble climate scenarios 3 3 1 no3 n leaching model simulations clearly differed due to crop management with simulated climate data from the historical 1971 2000 and future 2041 2070 periods effect of agricultural inputs was significant on no3 n over 30 years of past and future climate scenarios future no3 n 30 year annual average leaching losses cumulative 0 90 cm predicted by the epic under climate change were significantly higher in simulations of org and red systems relative to hi 35 9 kg ha 1 y 1 and 35 8 kg ha 1 y 1 vs 32 2 kg ha 1 y 1 differences in no3 n leaching losses between org and red were not significant golmohammadi et al 2016 also concluded that future no3 n losses were significantly higher in no till compared to conventional tillage based on simulations with the drainmod model for a research site in ottawa ontario we attributed increased no3 n leaching losses in the simulations to 1 higher initial n in red dap and org dap systems as a function of compost applied to replace n and p removed as forage and barley and 2 the presence of alfalfa in three consecutive years in dap which resulted in high quantities of fixed nitrogen long term 30 year annual average no3 n leaching losses cumulative 0 90 cm predicted by epic for the rcm gcm ensemble 2041 2070 scenario 5 were highest in red x dap and hi x low fig 3 nitrate losses were high in combinations with dap and low relative to other treatments similar to experimental results previously reported for the acs study malhi et al 2002 2009 arcand et al 2017 reported that no3 n content in red input was 5 higher compared to org reflecting different nutrient input regimes and crop residue return between the two systems over the course of the acs study experimental soil no3 n in red x dap was highest in four of the six years of the second cycle 2001 2006 and second largest in five of the six years of the first cycle 1995 2000 of the acs study malhi et al 2002 2009 average experimental soil no3 n was highest under hi low during the first and second cycles of the acs study grant and lafond 1994 also reported higher no3 n under a crop crop crop fallow system compared to systems with four years of cropping on a black chernozemic soil they concluded that nitrification and moisture conserved in the fallow period led to increased no3 n leaching below the root zone long term 30 year annual average no3 n leaching losses cumulative 0 90 cm were lowest in simulations with the red x dag and hi x dag combinations of input and diversity fig 3 under climate change scenario 5 we attributed the lowest no3 n losses in these combinations to greater n uptake by grain crops cereal oilseed and pulses in dag consequently inclusion of grain crops in the rotations may decrease no3 n leaching in addition lychuk et al 2019 reported that the epic model simulated the second highest soc and second lowest rates of respired soil c in the red x dag system relative to all other combinations of input and diversity for future climate predicted by the ensemble model average furthermore simulated wheat yield from 2041 to 2070 by epic was highest in red compared to the other input systems adoption of red x dag may reduce the impact of climate change by lowering no3 n leaching maintaining crop yield and soc levels and reducing losses of respired soil c through microbial respiration trends increase vs decrease in simulated no3 n losses for future climate scenario 5 and observed historical weather scenario 1 were similar they were highest in red x dap 41 1 kg ha 1 y 1 hi x low 32 1 kg ha 1 y 1 and lowest in red x dag 15 6 kg ha 1 y 1 hi x dag 17 6 kg ha 1 y 1 in simulations with observed historical baseline 1971 2000 scenario 1 thus combinations of hi and red inputs with cropping diversity were similar with respect to highest and lowest no3 n leaching losses for future and past climate simulations we concluded that cropping diversity not input primarily affected future no3 n losses in analyses with pa 28 of variation pa for all variables table 7 and anova 22 of total variation for a subset of variables table 8 followed by precipitation in summer months 12 as well as effects of surface convexity and relative slope position table 7 increases in future annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures explained 13 7 and 6 of variation in no3 n leaching losses in analyses of covariance for each variable table 9 agricultural inputs accounted for 1 of the total variation table 8 the red x dag system resulted in the lowest no3 n leaching losses fig 3 and third highest labile soil p fig 4 compared to other input and diversity combinations producers may adopt red x dag systems to reduce n fertilizer inputs and decrease losses of n through leaching due to increased precipitation related to climate change 3 3 2 labile soil p predicted 30 year annual average fall available labile soil p 0 15 cm for the climate change scenario 2041 2070 characterized by the rcm gcm ensemble scenario 5 and for the historical baseline 1971 2000 scenario 1 was highest in red 28 03 kg ha 1 y 1 and 31 84 kg ha 1 y 1 intermediate in hi 23 29 kg ha 1 y 1 and 27 24 kg ha 1 y 1 and lowest in org 13 46 kg ha 1 y 1 and 14 83 kg ha 1 y 1 input total labile p simulated in the soil profile 0 90 cm was also highest in red 254 kg ha 1 y 1 and 262 kg ha 1 y 1 followed by hi 242 kg ha 1 y 1 and 249 kg ha 1 y 1 and lowest in org 211 kg ha 1 y 1 and 215 kg ha 1 y 1 input fertilizer p increased the labile pool for hi and red systems relative to org where no p fertilizer was applied higher levels of labile soil p in red inputs were also attributed to minimal soil disturbance and stratification arcand et al 2016 also reported 3 5 times greater available p in red compared to org system where fungi and actinobacteria were more dominant wilson et al 2016 observed elevated levels of labile soil p in fields that historically received application of fertilizer or manure in combination with tillage compared to lower soil p for low input organic and no till fields in southwestern manitoba malhi et al 2002 2009 reported no significant differences in experimental labile soil p between hi red and org inputs in the first 1995 2000 and second 2001 2006 cycles of the acs study however lychuk unpublished data and lemke unpublished data found that 18 year average labile soil p for the acs study was highest under red intermediate in hi and lowest in org input in addition initial 1995 and final 2012 measurements of labile soil p showed a gradual increase in all input and diversity levels with the exception of org where soil p content declined with time simulated 30 year annual average labile p 0 15 cm by epic in climate change scenarios 2041 2070 such as the rcm gcm ensemble scenario 5 was highest in red x dap intermediate in all combinations with hi red x dag followed by red x low and org x dap and lowest in org x dag and org x low fig 4 malhi et al 2002 also observed that p in the hi x low treatment was higher compared to other treatments in the field in the first cycle of the acs study in our modeling study labile p in hi x low was second highest relative to other treatment combinations fig 4 in partition analysis simulated long term 2041 2070 30 year average labile soil p 0 15 cm scenario 5 was mostly affected by terrain attributes in the field such as catchment slope and relative slope position maximum height and by agricultural inputs to a lesser extent table 7 in anova when variability due to terrain attributes was accounted for subset of variables selected with pa table 8 cropping diversity was correlated with 13 of variation in labile soil p followed by input 7 for climate change scenarios 2041 2070 such as the rcm gcm ensemble scenario 5 table 8 while terrain attributes accounted for about 1 of total variation increases in annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures for climate change scenarios did not significantly influence labile soil p in analysis of covariance while cropping diversity and input were significant and were correlated with 44 of the total variation table 9 4 conclusions this research identifies crop management which is best suited to adapt to climate change with respect to no3 n leaching and soil labile p for a case study in the canadian prairies this is the first analysis with epic model in the canadian prairies of the effects of climate change on no3 n losses in the agricultural runoff and soil p content in the context of different agricultural input systems in combination with diversified rotations this research provides a quantitative analysis of the effects of climate change on no3 n leaching and labile soil p and the environment under climate change no3 n leaching simulated by the epic model increased by 28 while labile soil p decreased by 12 relative to historical values input and diversity combination explained 23 and 20 of variation in future no3 n losses and labile soil p respectively the impact of cropping diversity was most significant with reduced no3 n leaching and labile p under climate change accounting for 22 and 13 of total variation respectively summer precipitation explained 12 of total variation in future no3 n leaching losses the remaining variation in these variables was attributed to gsp and gdd in other months as well as effects of terrain attributes at the research site the combination of cropping diversity and input accounted for 44 of the variation in future labile soil p farming practices under red x dag system will decrease no3 n leaching and maintain optimal labile soil p soc and crop yield relative to other management diverse rotations with reduced inputs are a promising adaptive management option in the context of climate change as shown in this case study additional research is necessary to assess these relationships for other sites and research studies the scientific community decision and policy makers will use this

10084,agricultural non point source pollution anpsp is a critical cause of global environmental problems however the estimation of anpsp in typical orchard dominated areas is lacking in this study the site conditions and fertilizer application patterns of apple orchard dominated landscapes in qixia north china were investigated along with the spatial distribution of land use types which were obtained through field survey and remote sensing interpretation combined with rainfall runoff experiments and an analysis of soil samples and statistical yearbook data the results revealed that the total n p export coefficients of apple orchards cropland and built up land were 68 90 2 79 41 58 1 87 and 4 19 0 47 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively moreover the areas of extremely low low medium high and extremely high risks for anpsp in qixia were 35 232 56 514 62 106 29 331 and 18 450 ha respectively under the current fertilizer application rates of n 545 kg ha 1 a 1 and p2o5 569 kg ha 1 a 1 in apple orchard areas two fertilization scenarios were simulated according to local standards the reduction of the extremely high risk anpsp area reached 73 39 in scenario i and 100 in scenario ii in contrast extremely low risk areas increased by 14 88 scenario i and 218 15 scenario ii eventually a correlation analysis between the source sink and current status of anpsp risks and various environmental factors was conducted the results showed that anpsp was significantly positively correlated with the drainage density water erosion intensity clay content and soc while it was significantly negatively correlated with the slope altitude and the sand content which indicates the good performance of the source sink landscape method therefore this method at a source sink landscape scale may facilitate the evaluation of anpsp in areas both regionally and worldwide abbreviations anpsp agricultural non point source pollution ec export coefficient lci landscape composite

keywords agricultural non point source pollution apple orchard source sink landscape nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction agricultural non point source pollution anpsp is one of the most important environmental problems that the world is currently facing villamizar and brown 2016 zou et al 2020 therefore the prevention and control of anpsp is a substantial challenge as compared with general point source pollution owing to its dispersibility crypticity and uncertainty as well as the difficulties associated with monitoring and quantification carpenter et al 1998 furthermore the application of chemical fertilizer is thought to be the main cause of non point source pollution in agricultural production sun et al 2012 nitrogen n and phosphorus p nutrients are known to enter surface water bodies through soil erosion runoff and leaching leading to eutrophication and other environmental problems carpenter et al 1998 dupas et al 2015 ma et al 2020 previous investigations into anpsp have mainly focused on two geographic scales the field scale and watershed scale at the field scale pollution loads of total n and total p tn and tp respectively from croplands have previously been determined through field measurements and observations of cultivated crops such as rice maize and wheat huang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 these studies obtained relatively accurate estimations of pollutant out flows whereas such pollution load parameters are difficult to apply at the regional and or watershed scale owing to their limited spatial representation at the watershed scale the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely used to evaluate anpsp cheng et al 2021 volk et al 2017 however the difficulty associated with the swat method is the verification of a large number of parameters risal et al 2020 samimi et al 2020 if the model is used blindly it will directly affect the accuracy of the numerical simulation in contrast the migration and transformation processes and environmental impacts of soil nutrient surpluses in the soil crop environment system have been extensively investigated when evaluating anpsp at the watershed scale lu and xie 2018 wang et al 2020a wu and lu 2019 zhang et al 2020 however the pollutant emission absorption capacity of certain landscapes and regional spatial heterogeneity are often ignored thereby limiting the accuracy of the research in fact some landscapes act as a source i e pollutant export while others act as a sink i e pollutant absorption and digestion zhao et al 2019 in the formation process of anpsp for example if the intensity of the source is greater than that of the sink a higher amount of pollutants is exported to the external environment in light of this the source sink landscape method is a useful approach to evaluate anpsp at a regional or watershed scale wu et al 2016 this method can be used to investigate the migration and transformation of pollutants based on different land use types and landscape metrics and is appropriate for regional anpsp assessment considering both the systematic nature and spatial heterogeneity of target research areas in other words the source sink landscape method can solve the problem where pollutant parameters at the field scale have limited applicability to other areas furthermore this method does not require complicated parameter adjustments and verifications which is the case in the swat model based on the premise of a fine accuracy level previous investigations into anpsp have mainly focused on field crops ladha et al 2005 but have rarely assessed anpsp in orchard dominated landscapes orchards are known to be important sources of anpsp particularly in the case of excessive fertilizer application which is prevalent in the fruit tree planting areas of china bai et al 2019 in addition the economic benefits of fruit are correspondingly higher than those of grain xian et al 2020 thus many fruit farmers have generally applied excessive n and p fertilizers to obtain higher yields which likely results in more serious environmental pollution ongley et al 2010 wu et al 2019 china is the world s largest apple production and consumption country ma and abdulai 2016 ma et al 2018 in 2017 the apple planting area and yield in china accounted for 45 and 50 of the global totals respectively fao 2017 at present the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china is carrying out actions to reduce fertilizer application rates for cash crops and the fruit tree industry in this context the anpsp evaluation method with scientific guidance and feasible characteristics at the regional scale has to be employed qixia located in the circum bohai bay area of shandong province is one of the largest apple production areas in china the apple planting patterns and fertilizer application in qixia are highly representative yu et al 2016 however the spatial patterns and risk intensity of anpsp in orchard dominated areas e g qixia remain unclear in this study the total n and p export coefficients ec of apple orchards croplands and built up land were estimated and the spatial patterns of anpsp based on the source sink landscapes in qixia were investigated furthermore the anpsp evaluation was simulated under different scenarios an optimum ratio of n and p fertilizer application with only reduced p scenario ‚Ö∞ and an optimum ratio of n and p fertilizer application with a reduction in both n and p scenario ‚Ö± moreover the relationships between environmental factors i e topography hydrology soil climate and vegetation fraction and anpsp were analyzed therefore this study clarifies the spatial pattern and risk intensity of anpsp in qixia and provides a scientific reference for the prevention and control of anpsp in orchard dominated areas both regionally and broadly outside of china where similar source sink landscape scenarios are employed for orchard production and regional environmental protection 2 materials and methods qixia within an apple orchard dominated area in china was taken as the study region for anpsp assessment fig 1 fig 2 illustrates the overall research methodology of this study which includes four parts land use classification subwatershed division source and sink intensity parameter calculation and anpsp evaluation the first two steps are the foundation for the last two steps the fourth step is the core of this study which demonstrates the advantage of the proposed method at a source sink landscape scale which does not require complicated parameter adjustments and verifications and maintaining a higher research accuracy 2 1 study region qixia 37 05 37 32 n 120 33 121 15 e is located in the circum bohai bay of northeast shandong province china fig 1a mountains and hills are the main geomorphic features in this region fig 1b the total area of qixia is 2 015 91 km2 and the proportions of mountains hills and plains account for 72 1 21 8 and 6 1 respectively this region is characterized by a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 11 4 mean annual precipitation of 640 846 mm and a frost free period of 209 days qixia is one of the most important apple production areas in china and even the world owing to its suitable natural conditions for apple tree growth in 2018 the apple yield of qixia reached 1 9 109 kg qixia statistical bureau 2019 however the high intensity of apple tree planting is generally accompanied by excessive chemical fertilizer input leading to severe anpsp problems specifically the average amount of fertilizer applied per apple orchard reached 4 31 t ha 1 in 2018 qixia statistical bureau 2019 moreover qixia is adjacent to the bohai sea in china thus surplus nutrients can easily flow into the bohai sea along the river fig 1c and consequently contaminate offshore waters 2 2 land use and subwatershed extraction 2 2 1 land use classification before categorizing the land use of the study region a total of 681 field survey points fig 3 were investigated in the summers of 2018 and 2019 to obtain the land use types including woodland apple orchard grassland water area cropland and built up land in addition we downloaded sentinel 2a remote sensing images covering qixia i e image orbit numbers no208 r132 t51stb and no208 r132 t51sub from the european space agency https scihub copernicus eu dhus home the transit time of the imagery is september 9 2019 and the spatial resolution is 10 m first the remote sensing images were preprocessed by radiometric calibration atmospheric correction by the fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes flaash image mosaicking and clipping fig 1b wan et al 2021 next the land use types of qixia were categorized using the random forest classification chen et al 2020 taking portions of land use data 227 points from field surveys as regions of interest finally the remaining land use data 454 points obtained from field surveys were used to evaluate the accuracy of the land use classification using the confusion matrix foody 2002 risal et al 2020 all processes were performed using the envi ver 5 5 software 2 2 2 subwatershed division the soil vegetation hydrology temperature and other land surface environmental factors in qixia exhibit notable spatial heterogeneity owing to the complexity of the topography thus we divided qixia into a series of subwatersheds in which we individually investigated anpsp which should improve the accuracy of the study li et al 2020b rong et al 2017 the aster gdemv2 digital elevation model dem data with a spatial resolution of 30 m in qixia were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud website http www gscloud cn the subwatershed division data processing mainly included filling sinks and removing peaks identifying the flow direction calculating the flow accumulation extracting the river network and final determination of the subwatershed boundaries all processes were performed using the arcgis ver 10 5 software 2 3 calculation of source intensity of anpsp in this study the ec model in eq 1 was used to calculate the source intensity of anpsp johnes 1996 1 e t i 1 n

pollutant from precipitation kg ha 1 a 1 the amount of pollutants deposited from precipitation was significantly smaller than that from other sources cheng et al 2018 and was therefore not considered in this study apple orchards built up land and cropland were the main land use types causing anpsp based on the analyses in this study furthermore n and p emissions were dominant factors resulting in anpsp conley et al 2009 to account for these specific factors eq 1 was transformed into eq 2 as follows 2 e t e o e b e c e o c o n c o p a o e b c b n c b p a b e c c c n c c p a c where e t is the

plot red square image 4 in fig 3 based on field surveys fig 4 shows a schematic of the field experimental plot the area of the experimental plot was 0 164 ha 40 5 40 5 m and the slope was consistent with the average slope of apple orchards in qixia 6 data obtained from the field surveys moreover the fertilizer application rate and patterns were similar to the prevalent local fertilization practices based on surveys a runoff collection ditch was installed at the bottom of the slope when rainfall occurred the runoff amount was measured by a velocimeter in the ditch and the loss of tn and tp with the runoff was calculated using eq 3 in addition a rain gauge was installed in the experimental plot to monitor rainfall a moderate rainfall runoff monitoring experiment was conducted in the rainy season august 20 2018 in qixia the export amounts of tn and tp to the external environment following this rainfall event were calculated as follows 3 e en i 2 n v i v i 1 2 t i t i 1 s n i 10 3

l 1 and 10 3 is the unit conversion coefficient the values of e en and e ep calculated by eq 3 were 0 420 and 0 017 kg respectively accordingly the ecs of tn and tp from the apple orchard were calculated as follows eq 4 4 c on e en a e p a p e c op e ep a e p a p e where c on and c op are the ecs of tn and tp from the apple orchard respectively kg ha 1 a 1 e en and e ep represent the export

apple orchard 19 sampling points and cropland 18 sampling points in qixia were uniformly distributed throughout the study region fig 3 these samples were collected to analyze the tn and tp content through laboratory analyses the average values of tn and tp for the apple orchard were 0 845 and 0 752 g kg 1 whereas they were 0 510 and 0 503 g kg 1 for cropland respectively as apple orchards and croplands are mainly distributed in plains or gently sloping areas their soil and topographic conditions were assumed to be relatively consistent however the cultivation and vegetational cover conditions were not entirely consistent therefore we determined the ecs of tn and tp for cropland in qixia using rainfall runoff experimental data from the apple orchard combined with the measured soil nutrients and soil erosion parameters of the apple orchard and cropland the ecs of tn and tp for cropland were calculated as follows 5 c cn c on 0 510 0 845 Œ≥ c cp c op 0 503 0 752 Œ≥ Œ≥ r c r o where c on and c op are the ecs of tn and tp in the apple orchard respectively kg ha 1 a 1 c cn and c cp are the ecs of tn and tp in the cropland respectively kg ha 1 a 1 Œ≥ is the soil erosion coefficient between cropland and apple orchard and r c and r o are the soil erosion modules for cropland and apple orchard respectively t km 2 a 1 we acquired r c and r o using the land use i e cropland and apple orchard raster data masked by the soil erosion data product which was derived from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn finally the value of Œ≥ calculated via eq 5 was 1 20 2 3 3 built up land ecs the ecs of tn and tp for built up land were calculated according to eq 6 6 c bn w c n k a b 10 3 c bp w c p k a b 10 3 where c bn and c bp are the ecs of tn and tp in built up land kg ha 1 a 1 respectively w is the total annual water consumption of qixia city 2 63 106 m3 which was derived from the statistical yearbook of qixia and cn and cp are the concentrations of tn and tp per unit domestic sewage 37 20 and 4 14 mg l 1 respectively which were obtained from the handbook of emission coefficient of domestic pollution sources ministry of

of the total pollution load source intensity for each subwatershed not only accounted for the land use types but also for the spatial distribution relative distance and slope of land use patches in the subwatershed jiang et al 2013 as in eq 7 7 s o u r c e i c i 1 s l o p j s l o p max 1 d i s t a n c e j d i s t a n c e max s o u r c e i 1 n s o u r c e i a i i 1 n a i where source i is the

course respectively slop j and distance j respectively are the slope and distance from the river course of land use patch j in the subwatershed source is the pollution load per unit area of the subwatershed kg and a i is the area of land use type i ha 2 4 calculation of anpsp sink intensity 2 4 1 calculation of landscape metrics landscape metrics were extracted from land use patches using the fragstats ver 4 2 software mcgarigal and marks 1995 mcgarigal et al 2002 we referred to liu et al 2020 for the indices which included those reflecting the i landscape fragmentation patch density pd edge density ed and total edge contrast index teci ii landscape shape mean shape index msi contiguity index contig and perimeter area fractal dimension pafrac and iii landscape heterogeneity interspersion juxtaposition index iji and aggregation index ai 2 4 2 calculation of the weight of each landscape metric the data featured eight landscape metrics i 8 divided into six categories of land use types j 6 thus the matrix m of the original data was as follows eq 8 8 m m 11 m 12 m 16 m 21 m 22 m 26 m 81 m 82 m 86 first we standardized the original data using eq 9 9 m i j m i j min j m i j max j m i j min j m i j where m ij is the value of landscape metric i of land use type j before standardization m ij is the result after standardization and max j m ij and min j m ij are the corresponding maximum and minimum values respectively we then used the entropy method qian et al 2020 to objectively assess the impact of the landscape metrics the steps of the method are described herein first the calculation of the information entropy e i of landscape metric i was derived as follows eq 10 10 p i m i j j 1 6 m i j e i 1 ln 8 j 1 6 p i j ln p i j then the calculation of the weight w i of landscape metric i was derived as follows eq 11 11 w i 1 e i i 1 8 1 e i as a result the weighted landscape composite index was calculated via eq 12 12 l c i i 1 8 w i c i where lci is the landscape composite index hereinafter lci and c i and w i are the values of landscape metric i and the corresponding weight respectively 2 4 3 calculation of landscape sink intensity values of lci in this study were used to characterize the fragility and vulnerability of landscape units with respect to an external interference which was considered from three aspects landscape fragmentation shape and heterogeneity the larger the lci the more fragile the landscape unit and the poorer the sink intensity or environmental recovery capacity of the region wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 therefore the formula for calculating the sink intensity of pollutants in the subwatershed was as follows 13 s ink j 1 l c i j s i n k j 1 n s ink j a j j 1 n a j where sink j and lci j are the sink intensity and lci of land use type j respectively sink is the unit area sink intensity of the subwatershed and a j is the area of land use type j 2 5 landscape source sink comparison index first the source intensity source eq 7 and sink intensity sink eq 13 of each subwatershed were normalized the results yielded the source and sink respectively then the constructed landscape source sink comparison index was calculated as per eq 14 14 s o u r c e s o u r c e s o u r c e min s o u r c e max s o u r c e min s i n k s i n k s i n k min s i n k max s i n k min l s s c i s ource s ource s i n k where source and sink are the normalized source and sink intensities of the subwatershed respectively each with a range of values of 0 l and lssci is the landscape source sink comparison index noting that the smaller the value of lssci the lower the risk of anpsp 2 6 fertilizer application scenarios the statistical data for qixia city showed that the application rate of chemical fertilizer in qixia had a downward trend from 2 04 105 t in 2017 1 96 105 t in 2018 however the apple yield continued to increase from 1 87 106 t in 2017 1 91 106 t in 2018 qixia statistical bureau 2019 the chemical fertilizer input in qixia dominated in apple orchards followed by cultivated land in addition through a large number of questionnaires we found that compared with a few years ago the amount of chemical fertilizer application in apple orchards in qixia was slightly reduced wan et al 2020 we infer that this reduction was related to the improvement in apple orchard management and fertilizer manufacturing as well as the popularization of advanced technology therefore maintaining a high apple yield on the premise that the amount of chemical fertilizer application would be appropriately reduced was feasible based on the current situation of anpsp in qixia we further simulated two fertilizer application scenarios i the optimum ratio of n and p fertilizer application with only reduced p scenario ‚Ö∞ and ii the optimum ratio of n and p fertilizer application with reductions in both n and p scenario ‚Ö± the specific division basis for n and p fertilizer application under the two scenarios were as follows at present the application amount of n and p2o5 fertilizer in china s apple orchards as represented by qixia are 545 and 569 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively which are significantly higher than the conventional level in developed countries 150 200 and 100 150 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively wan et al 2020 furthermore the best ratio for n and p2o5 is 1 0 4 according to the local standard shandong provincial bureau of quality and technical supervision 2018 the proportion of p fertilizer application in qixia is notably higher than this standard therefore scenario i was based on the optimal ratio 1 0 4 of n p in apple orchards and the amount of n remained unchanged whereas the amount of p2o5 was reduced achieving the target balance of n and p the amount of n and p2o5 fertilizer application in scenario i was calculated as 545 and 218 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively scenario ‚Ö± was subsequently modified according to the assumption that n and p2o5 were applied at 1 0 and 0 4 kg for each 100 kg of apple production respectively therefore based on the apple yield and apple orchard areas of qixia the amount of n and p2o5 fertilizer application in scenario ‚Ö± was calculated as 420 and 168 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively finally we analyzed the relationship between the current spatial distribution of anpsp and various local environmental factors to evaluate the performance of the source sink landscape method in regional anpsp 3 results 3 1 land use classification and subwatershed extraction fig 5 shows the spatial pattern of land use in qixia apple orchards were widely distributed and found to be the main land use type 61 542 ha followed by cropland 52 564 ha which was mainly distributed on the alluvial plain woodland 44 126 ha was mainly located in the mid eastern mountainous area which is known to be unsuitable for the growth of apple trees and crops owing to high elevations steep slopes and limiting irrigation conditions the areas of built up land 18 652 ha grassland 17 014 ha and water area 7 735 ha were relatively small table 1 the interpretation accuracy of the land use classification showed that the producer and user accuracy of each land use type were each more than 80 and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 90 36 and 0 88 respectively table 1 indicating that our results are reliable and suitable for use in further research in addition qixia was divided into 54 subwatersheds using the dem data fig 5 3 2 ec and landscape composite index lci of different land use types fig 6 shows the cumulative ecs of tn and tp in the apple orchard during the rainfall runoff experiment the effective runoff collection time for the rainfall process was 257 min and the tn and tp were 0 420 and 0 017 kg respectively the ecs of tn and tp in the apple orchard were the largest of all the land use types reaching up to 68 90 and 2 79 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively the ecs of tn and tp in the cropland were slightly lower than those of the apple orchard which were 49 90 and 2 24 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively as built up land is not the main pollution source the ecs of tn and tp were the smallest compared with the apple orchard and cropland which were 4 19 and 0 47 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively table 2 in summary the high intensity chemical fertilizer input to the apple orchard caused a substantial surplus of nutrients the planting area and ecs of n and p in the apple orchard were greater than those of cropland indicating that apple tree planting is the most important factor causing anpsp in qixia the mean lci values of apple orchards croplands and built up land 0 86 0 71 and 0 62 respectively were significantly higher than those of woodlands grasslands and water bodies 0 41 0 37 and 0 23 respectively fig 7 the mean lci values of apple orchards croplands and built up land were at notably high levels which is consistent with the fact that these land use types are the main pollution source of n and p therefore these results further confirm that the lci is negatively positively correlated with the sink source intensity of the landscape furthermore the differences in the lci for different land use types were highly significant p 0 001 fig 7 which indicates that the source and or sink effects of the landscape types were quite different 3 3 assessment of anpsp the source and sink intensity in qixia can be divided into five categories fig 8 according to the natural breakpoint method zou et al 2020 the source intensity was roughly negatively correlated with the sink intensity in space areas of high source intensity were mainly located in the western and southern parts of qixia fig 8a where the density of apple orchards and cropland distribution were high fig 5 zhu et al 2020 reported similar conclusions as a result the amount of chemical fertilizer input in southwestern qixia was at a higher level indicating a strong potential for anpsp with runoff and leaching areas of high sink intensity were mainly located in the east and north fig 8b where abundant woodlands and grasslands are present fig 5 the state of the ecological environmental health here is relatively stable the risk pattern of anpsp in qixia was obtained according to the calculation of the source and sink results of a previous study have shown that the fertilizer use efficiency of apple trees in the circum bohai bay area of china was 55 5 bai et al 2019 other studies have measured the total uptake of n and p2o5 by branches and fruits in qixia apple orchard land to be 168 and 85 kg ha 1 a 1 wan et al 2020 respectively based on these findings we assumed a scenario in which a positive linear correlation exists between the amount of fertilizer application in the apple orchard and ec if the effective amount of fertilizer application is equal to the amount absorbed by apple trees then the value for the ecs of tn and tp would be 0 according to this scenario the application amount of n and p2o5 should be 302 70 and 153 15 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively we conducted a large scale survey of apple orchards in qixia fig 3 collecting a total of 588 500 valid questionnaires according to the statistics qixia statistical bureau 2019 the application amounts of n and p2o5 in qixia apple orchards were 545 and 569 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively and the ecs of tn and tp under this scenario were 68 90 and 2 79 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively therefore based on the above mentioned two datasets the relationship between the amount of n and p fertilizers xn and xp and their ecs yn and yp in apple orchards could be established as follows 15 y n 0 28436x n 86 07524 y p 0 00671x p 1 02751 according to the fertilization requirements of scenarios ‚Ö∞ and ‚Ö± combined with eq 15 the fertilizer application amounts and ecs of tn and tp in apple orchards under the simulated scenarios were obtained table 3 moreover the spatial distribution of the anpsp risk intensity fig 9 and corresponding area table 3 under the different scenarios were also determined the combined results showed that the risk intensity of anpsp caused by apple orchard planting could be further controlled after fertilization according to local standards in the simulation the area of extremely high risk was reduced from its present day value of 18 450 ha to 4909 ha for scenario i and 0 ha for scenario ii reductions of 73 39 and 100 respectively likewise the extremely low risk area increased from 35 232 ha present to 40 473 ha for scenario i and 112 092 ha for scenario ii increases of 14 88 and 218 15 respectively the source sink and risk intensities of anpsp for each subwatershed in qixia were correlated with 11 natural environmental factors such as topography fig 10a b climate fig 10c d hydrology fig 10e vegetation fig 10f and soil fig 10g k the results table 4 showed that the source intensity had highly significant positive correlations with the temperature water erosion intensity and clay content p 0 01 a significant positive correlation with the drainage density p 0 05 and highly significant negative correlations with the slope altitude and sand content p 0 01 the sink intensity had highly significant positive correlations with the slope and sand content p 0 01 a significant positive correlation with the drainage density p 0 05 highly significant negative correlations with the altitude soil organic carbon soc and clay content p 0 01 and a significant negative correlation with the water erosion intensity p 0 05 the risk intensity had highly significant positive correlations with the drainage density water erosion intensity and clay content p 0 01 a significant positive correlation with the soc p 0 05 highly significant negative correlations with the slope and altitude p 0 01 and a significant negative correlation with the sand content p 0 05 in summary the source sink and current status of anpsp have good correlations with many key natural environmental factors 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the lci in different land use types the mean lci values of grassland woodland and water areas were at low levels compared with apple orchards cropland and build up land fig 7 which was consistent with previous studies cai et al 2018 uwimana et al 2018 the lci of woodlands was slightly higher than that of grasslands possibly owing to the higher elevation of woodland in qixia anpsp is known to be mainly caused by runoff and leaching therefore limiting the absorption of pollutants by woodlands at higher elevations in addition the lci dispersion of grasslands in each subwatershed was relatively large which may be ascribed to the low interpretation accuracy for grassland table 1 resulting in significant variations in lci values lu et al 2020 moreover grassland patches were mostly distributed in the transitional areas between other land use types leading to higher heterogeneity esch et al 2014 4 2 applicability of the landscape scale in anpsp research the spatial accuracy of the previous results may be partially affected if soil sampling is carried out without consideration of the spatial heterogeneity of landscape patches within the study area li et al 2020c in addition multiple previous studies have used a physical model e g swat chen et al 2010 volk et al 2017 wang et al 2020b whose spatial resolution can be refined to the grid scale however the content of that model setting is extensive its results are easily disturbed by many index parameters and model verification is relatively complex grunwald and norton 2000 as a result the physical model is more extensively used in scientific research on anpsp but it is not suitable for operational assessments whereas the source sink landscape method is more suitable the source intensity sink intensity and the risk intensity of anpsp all had strong correlations with the topography i e slope and altitude drainage density water erosion intensity soc and soil texture i e sand silt and clay table 4 therefore we conclude that our evaluation results are relatively reliable one possible explanation for the correlations may be that the spatial distribution of the landscape units i e apple orchard cropland woodland and other patches is the combined result of natural factors i e topography hydrology and soil among others and human intervention suggesting that the spatial distribution of source sink landscape units tend to integrate natural factors affecting the enrichment migration and absorption of pollutants with the human factors of planning and layout therefore a source sink model based on landscape scale effectively balances the relationship between research complexity and result accuracy thereby simplifying the research method and maintaining a higher research accuracy in conclusion the landscape scale is a suitable spatial scale for anpsp research 4 3 analysis of natural factors influencing anpsp among the various natural factors slope and altitude are known to directly affect the planting of apple trees which can in turn influence anpsp this is because greater amounts of water and soil nutrients are lost with an increasing steepness of the slope our study showed that the average slope of apple orchards in qixia is relatively low at 6 in general the soil is relatively barren and irrigation becomes increasingly inconvenient at higher altitudes therefore the source intensity and risk intensity of anpsp were both negatively correlated with slope and altitude p 0 01 table 4 in addition the steeper the slope the stronger the migration ability of pollutants with runoff however it is more difficult for pollutants to become enriched with an increasing altitude therefore the sink intensity had a positive correlation with slope p 0 01 and a negative correlation with the altitude p 0 01 which is consistent with the results of li et al 2020c furthermore air temperature is known to decrease with an increasing altitude thus the temperature of plains and river valleys is generally higher than that of mountainous and hilly areas low lying areas are the main distribution areas of apple orchards and croplands in qixia therefore the source intensity of anpsp was significantly negatively correlated with air temperature which is consistent with the results of li et al 2020c no correlation was observed between precipitation and source intensity because the spatial variability in precipitation at the county scale is minimal i e the precipitation in qixia generally decreases from southeast to northwest fig 10d however the apple orchards and croplands are mainly distributed in the western region fig 5 thus the spatial distribution of precipitation was not consistent with that of pollution sources wu et al 2016 also found that there was no significant correlation between the dissolved organic carbon loss and annual precipitation at the smaller watershed scale areas of high drainage density were relatively low and flat these areas corresponded to the main distribution of apple orchards and croplands as well as serving as the main enrichment areas of pollutants therefore the source and sink intensities obtained in this study showed notable positive correlations with the drainage density and highly significant positive correlations with anpsp there was no correlation between the ndvi and anpsp in this study likely owing to the fact that the main topographic types in qixia are mountainous and hilly for which the vegetation coverage is generally high thus areas of high ndvi corresponded either to apple orchards as source landscapes or woodlands as sink landscapes the water erosion intensity had highly significant positive correlations with the source intensity and risk intensity of anpsp this may be attributed to the phenomenon in which soil nutrients in the water erosion area are transported with runoff and leaching leading to anpsp however the sink landscapes had a higher forest and grass coverage which yielded a significant negative correlation between the sink intensity and water erosion areas of high soc were mainly distributed in fertile farming areas thus the soc had a significant positive correlation with the risk intensity of anpsp the main soil type in the mountainous and hilly areas in qixia is skeletal soil which has thin soil layers poor fertility and a generally low soc content however these areas were mainly covered by sink landscapes such as woodlands and grasslands such that there was a highly significant negative correlation between the sink intensity and soc the relation between the sand content and clay content in one area is usually opposite fig 10i and k owing to the influence of pedogenic factors vasu et al 2020 fluvisols are widely developed in the low and flat areas resulting in high clay contents in the sediments of these lands fig 10k moreover the low and flat areas were mainly covered by apple orchards and croplands fig 5 on the other hand lithosols and skeletal soil with high sand contents are main distributed in the hilly and mountainous areas fig 10i which was consistent with the spatial distribution of woodlands grasslands and other sink landscapes fig 5 therefore the clay sand content showed highly significant positive negative and negative positive correlations with the source intensity and sink intensity of anpsp respectively table 4 4 4 uncertainty in n and p loadings the most direct cause of anpsp is the excessive application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides shen et al 2012 in addition n and p loss from livestock and poultry farming are also causes li et al 2020a considering that qixia is a representative orchard dominated area the proportion of livestock and poultry farming is substantially smaller than that of other agricultural counties such that the n and p loss from livestock and poultry were not taken into account in this study for this study apple orchards croplands and built up land were considered the export sources of pollutants while woodlands and grasslands were not taken into account this is because we considered the n and p export from woodlands and grasslands to reflect natural background levels rendering them irrelevant to anpsp caused by human activities moreover the ecs of tn and tp for woodlands and grasslands are generally small such that their contribution to regional anpsp can be ignored for example rong et al 2017 calculated the tn and tp for woodlands to be 0 21 0 27 and 0 015 0 018 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively and 1 32 1 82 and 0 11 0 15 kg ha 1 a 1 for grasslands respectively for differential nutrient migration the migration and transformation processes of n in the ecological environment is more complex and diverse compared to those of p sun et al 2020 we also note that atmospheric n deposition is a contributing source of n in this region liu et al 2013 while not substantial for example atmospheric n deposition in qixia city in 2018 was estimated to be 33 96 kg ha 1 a 1 wan et al 2020 which was substantially less than the amount of tn 545 kg ha 1 a 1 from fertilizer application in qixia thus atmospheric n deposition was not considered in this study previous studies have shown that differences exist in terms of nutrient loss in croplands under different precipitation intensities liu et al 2014 the ecs of tn and tp for apple orchards calculated in our rainfall runoff experiment only account for annual precipitation without considering possible changes in the precipitation intensity however most ecs of tn and tp from macroscale studies have been derived from relevant references cheng et al 2018 hua et al 2019 yan et al 2019 such that the universality of the data and portability of their application to different regions may be limited therefore we considered that the accuracy of the ecs of tn and tp obtained from the field experiment were more acceptable the ec of tn in cropland was calculated to be 49 90 kg ha 1 a 1 in this study which was similar to the value reported by wang et al 2019 55 89 kg ha 1 a 1 furthermore wang et al 2019 reported that the ecs of tp after organic and chemical fertilizer applications in cropland were 3 74 and 1 11 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively a range that is similar to our result 2 24 kg ha 1 a 1 in summary we used a large amount of first hand measured data to calculate the ecs of the two main land use types i e apple orchards and croplands that cause anpsp therefore we speculate that our evaluation results are reliable 5 conclusions the source sink landscape method was first applied via a combination of a rainfall runoff experiment field sampling and survey and remote sensing data to evaluate the anpsp in an orchard dominated area of china the tn tp ecs for apple orchards croplands and built up land were 68 90 2 79 49 90 2 24 and 4 19 0 47 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively therefore the excessive input of fertilizer has caused a large surplus of n and p nutrients in apple orchards in qixia the problem of anpsp caused by apple tree planting should not be underestimated apple orchards and cropland are mainly distributed in western and southern qixia which are the main source areas of tn and tp export with the source intensity significantly greater than the sink intensity and the anpsp intensity for these areas is serious under circumstances where apple yield and quality can be guaranteed to effectively reduce the potential for local anpsp we propose that agricultural entities should use the scientifically designed optimum ratio of the n and p fertilizer application scheme which features reduced p or a combination of reduced n and p according to local standards moreover the source sink and current status of anpsp had strong correlations with many key natural environmental factors i e slope altitude drainage density water erosion intensity soil texture and soc which demonstrated that the evaluation results derived from the source sink landscape method are reliable in summary the source sink model based on the landscape scale effectively balances the relationship between research complexity and result accuracy thereby simplifying the research method and maintaining a higher research accuracy therefore this method at the source sink landscape scale may facilitate the evaluation of anpsp the representativeness of qixia allows the results to serve as a baseline scientific reference for the prevention and control of anpsp in orchard dominated areas worldwide our study confirmed the advantage of the source sink landscape method in evaluating anpsp but some landscape units could have been further subdivided or merged at different spatial scales which depends on the size of the study area however the uncertainty of the evaluation results caused by the scale effect remain unclear therefore we believe that the extraction of landscape units at different scales based on remote sensing methods has great potential which needs to be further explored in the future credit

10084,agricultural non point source pollution anpsp is a critical cause of global environmental problems however the estimation of anpsp in typical orchard dominated areas is lacking in this study the site conditions and fertilizer application patterns of apple orchard dominated landscapes in qixia north china were investigated along with the spatial distribution of land use types which were obtained through field survey and remote sensing interpretation combined with rainfall runoff experiments and an analysis of soil samples and statistical yearbook data the results revealed that the total n p export coefficients of apple orchards cropland and built up land were 68 90 2 79 41 58 1 87 and 4 19 0 47 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively moreover the areas of extremely low low medium high and extremely high risks for anpsp in qixia were 35 232 56 514 62 106 29 331 and 18 450 ha respectively under the current fertilizer application rates of n 545 kg ha 1 a 1 and p2o5 569 kg ha 1 a 1 in apple orchard areas two fertilization scenarios were simulated according to local standards the reduction of the extremely high risk anpsp area reached 73 39 in scenario i and 100 in scenario ii in contrast extremely low risk areas increased by 14 88 scenario i and 218 15 scenario ii eventually a correlation analysis between the source sink and current status of anpsp risks and various environmental factors was conducted the results showed that anpsp was significantly positively correlated with the drainage density water erosion intensity clay content and soc while it was significantly negatively correlated with the slope altitude and the sand content which indicates the good performance of the source sink landscape method therefore this method at a source sink landscape scale may facilitate the evaluation of anpsp in areas both regionally and worldwide abbreviations anpsp agricultural non point source pollution ec export coefficient lci landscape composite

keywords agricultural non point source pollution apple orchard source sink landscape nitrogen phosphorus 1 introduction agricultural non point source pollution anpsp is one of the most important environmental problems that the world is currently facing villamizar and brown 2016 zou et al 2020 therefore the prevention and control of anpsp is a substantial challenge as compared with general point source pollution owing to its dispersibility crypticity and uncertainty as well as the difficulties associated with monitoring and quantification carpenter et al 1998 furthermore the application of chemical fertilizer is thought to be the main cause of non point source pollution in agricultural production sun et al 2012 nitrogen n and phosphorus p nutrients are known to enter surface water bodies through soil erosion runoff and leaching leading to eutrophication and other environmental problems carpenter et al 1998 dupas et al 2015 ma et al 2020 previous investigations into anpsp have mainly focused on two geographic scales the field scale and watershed scale at the field scale pollution loads of total n and total p tn and tp respectively from croplands have previously been determined through field measurements and observations of cultivated crops such as rice maize and wheat huang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 these studies obtained relatively accurate estimations of pollutant out flows whereas such pollution load parameters are difficult to apply at the regional and or watershed scale owing to their limited spatial representation at the watershed scale the soil and water assessment tool swat has been widely used to evaluate anpsp cheng et al 2021 volk et al 2017 however the difficulty associated with the swat method is the verification of a large number of parameters risal et al 2020 samimi et al 2020 if the model is used blindly it will directly affect the accuracy of the numerical simulation in contrast the migration and transformation processes and environmental impacts of soil nutrient surpluses in the soil crop environment system have been extensively investigated when evaluating anpsp at the watershed scale lu and xie 2018 wang et al 2020a wu and lu 2019 zhang et al 2020 however the pollutant emission absorption capacity of certain landscapes and regional spatial heterogeneity are often ignored thereby limiting the accuracy of the research in fact some landscapes act as a source i e pollutant export while others act as a sink i e pollutant absorption and digestion zhao et al 2019 in the formation process of anpsp for example if the intensity of the source is greater than that of the sink a higher amount of pollutants is exported to the external environment in light of this the source sink landscape method is a useful approach to evaluate anpsp at a regional or watershed scale wu et al 2016 this method can be used to investigate the migration and transformation of pollutants based on different land use types and landscape metrics and is appropriate for regional anpsp assessment considering both the systematic nature and spatial heterogeneity of target research areas in other words the source sink landscape method can solve the problem where pollutant parameters at the field scale have limited applicability to other areas furthermore this method does not require complicated parameter adjustments and verifications which is the case in the swat model based on the premise of a fine accuracy level previous investigations into anpsp have mainly focused on field crops ladha et al 2005 but have rarely assessed anpsp in orchard dominated landscapes orchards are known to be important sources of anpsp particularly in the case of excessive fertilizer application which is prevalent in the fruit tree planting areas of china bai et al 2019 in addition the economic benefits of fruit are correspondingly higher than those of grain xian et al 2020 thus many fruit farmers have generally applied excessive n and p fertilizers to obtain higher yields which likely results in more serious environmental pollution ongley et al 2010 wu et al 2019 china is the world s largest apple production and consumption country ma and abdulai 2016 ma et al 2018 in 2017 the apple planting area and yield in china accounted for 45 and 50 of the global totals respectively fao 2017 at present the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china is carrying out actions to reduce fertilizer application rates for cash crops and the fruit tree industry in this context the anpsp evaluation method with scientific guidance and feasible characteristics at the regional scale has to be employed qixia located in the circum bohai bay area of shandong province is one of the largest apple production areas in china the apple planting patterns and fertilizer application in qixia are highly representative yu et al 2016 however the spatial patterns and risk intensity of anpsp in orchard dominated areas e g qixia remain unclear in this study the total n and p export coefficients ec of apple orchards croplands and built up land were estimated and the spatial patterns of anpsp based on the source sink landscapes in qixia were investigated furthermore the anpsp evaluation was simulated under different scenarios an optimum ratio of n and p fertilizer application with only reduced p scenario ‚Ö∞ and an optimum ratio of n and p fertilizer application with a reduction in both n and p scenario ‚Ö± moreover the relationships between environmental factors i e topography hydrology soil climate and vegetation fraction and anpsp were analyzed therefore this study clarifies the spatial pattern and risk intensity of anpsp in qixia and provides a scientific reference for the prevention and control of anpsp in orchard dominated areas both regionally and broadly outside of china where similar source sink landscape scenarios are employed for orchard production and regional environmental protection 2 materials and methods qixia within an apple orchard dominated area in china was taken as the study region for anpsp assessment fig 1 fig 2 illustrates the overall research methodology of this study which includes four parts land use classification subwatershed division source and sink intensity parameter calculation and anpsp evaluation the first two steps are the foundation for the last two steps the fourth step is the core of this study which demonstrates the advantage of the proposed method at a source sink landscape scale which does not require complicated parameter adjustments and verifications and maintaining a higher research accuracy 2 1 study region qixia 37 05 37 32 n 120 33 121 15 e is located in the circum bohai bay of northeast shandong province china fig 1a mountains and hills are the main geomorphic features in this region fig 1b the total area of qixia is 2 015 91 km2 and the proportions of mountains hills and plains account for 72 1 21 8 and 6 1 respectively this region is characterized by a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 11 4 mean annual precipitation of 640 846 mm and a frost free period of 209 days qixia is one of the most important apple production areas in china and even the world owing to its suitable natural conditions for apple tree growth in 2018 the apple yield of qixia reached 1 9 109 kg qixia statistical bureau 2019 however the high intensity of apple tree planting is generally accompanied by excessive chemical fertilizer input leading to severe anpsp problems specifically the average amount of fertilizer applied per apple orchard reached 4 31 t ha 1 in 2018 qixia statistical bureau 2019 moreover qixia is adjacent to the bohai sea in china thus surplus nutrients can easily flow into the bohai sea along the river fig 1c and consequently contaminate offshore waters 2 2 land use and subwatershed extraction 2 2 1 land use classification before categorizing the land use of the study region a total of 681 field survey points fig 3 were investigated in the summers of 2018 and 2019 to obtain the land use types including woodland apple orchard grassland water area cropland and built up land in addition we downloaded sentinel 2a remote sensing images covering qixia i e image orbit numbers no208 r132 t51stb and no208 r132 t51sub from the european space agency https scihub copernicus eu dhus home the transit time of the imagery is september 9 2019 and the spatial resolution is 10 m first the remote sensing images were preprocessed by radiometric calibration atmospheric correction by the fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes flaash image mosaicking and clipping fig 1b wan et al 2021 next the land use types of qixia were categorized using the random forest classification chen et al 2020 taking portions of land use data 227 points from field surveys as regions of interest finally the remaining land use data 454 points obtained from field surveys were used to evaluate the accuracy of the land use classification using the confusion matrix foody 2002 risal et al 2020 all processes were performed using the envi ver 5 5 software 2 2 2 subwatershed division the soil vegetation hydrology temperature and other land surface environmental factors in qixia exhibit notable spatial heterogeneity owing to the complexity of the topography thus we divided qixia into a series of subwatersheds in which we individually investigated anpsp which should improve the accuracy of the study li et al 2020b rong et al 2017 the aster gdemv2 digital elevation model dem data with a spatial resolution of 30 m in qixia were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud website http www gscloud cn the subwatershed division data processing mainly included filling sinks and removing peaks identifying the flow direction calculating the flow accumulation extracting the river network and final determination of the subwatershed boundaries all processes were performed using the arcgis ver 10 5 software 2 3 calculation of source intensity of anpsp in this study the ec model in eq 1 was used to calculate the source intensity of anpsp johnes 1996 1 e t i 1 n c i a i p where e t is the total pollution emissions kg c i is the ec for land use type i kg ha 1 a 1 a i is the area of the watershed occupied by land use type i ha and p is the input of the pollutant from precipitation kg ha 1 a 1 the amount of pollutants deposited from precipitation was significantly smaller than that from other sources cheng et al 2018 and was therefore not considered in this study apple orchards built up land and cropland were the main land use types causing anpsp based on the analyses in this study furthermore n and p emissions were dominant factors resulting in anpsp conley et al 2009 to account for these specific factors eq 1 was transformed into eq 2 as follows 2 e t e o e b e c e o c o n c o p a o e b c b n c b p a b e c c c n c c p a c where e t is the total pollution emissions kg e o e b and e c are the total export amounts of tn and tp from apple orchards built up land and croplands respectively kg c on and c op are the ecs of tn and tp in apple orchards respectively kg ha 1 a 1 c bn and c bp are the ecs of tn and tp in built up land respectively kg ha 1 a 1 c cn and c cp are the ecs of tn and tp in croplands respectively kg ha 1 a 1 and a o a b and a c are the corresponding areas of apple orchards built up land and croplands in qixia respectively ha 2 3 1 apple orchard ecs a representative apple orchard was selected as the experimental plot red square image 4 in fig 3 based on field surveys fig 4 shows a schematic of the field experimental plot the area of the experimental plot was 0 164 ha 40 5 40 5 m and the slope was consistent with the average slope of apple orchards in qixia 6 data obtained from the field surveys moreover the fertilizer application rate and patterns were similar to the prevalent local fertilization practices based on surveys a runoff collection ditch was installed at the bottom of the slope when rainfall occurred the runoff amount was measured by a velocimeter in the ditch and the loss of tn and tp with the runoff was calculated using eq 3 in addition a rain gauge was installed in the experimental plot to monitor rainfall a moderate rainfall runoff monitoring experiment was conducted in the rainy season august 20 2018 in qixia the export amounts of tn and tp to the external environment following this rainfall event were calculated as follows 3 e en i 2 n v i v i 1 2 t i t i 1 s n i 10 3 e ep i 2 n v i v i 1 2 t i t i 1 s p i 10 3 where e en and e ep represent the export amounts of tn and tp from the apple orchard experimental plot to the external environment kg v i represents the flow velocity at time t i m min 1 s represents the sectional area of flow m2 n i and p i respectively represent the contents of tn and tp in the runoff sample from the runoff collector at time t i mg l 1 and 10 3 is the unit conversion coefficient the values of e en and e ep calculated by eq 3 were 0 420 and 0 017 kg respectively accordingly the ecs of tn and tp from the apple orchard were calculated as follows eq 4 4 c on e en a e p a p e c op e ep a e p a p e where c on and c op are the ecs of tn and tp from the apple orchard respectively kg ha 1 a 1 e en and e ep represent the export amounts of tn and tp from the apple orchard experimental plot to the external environment kg a e indicates the area of the experimental plot 0 164 ha p a is the annual precipitation of qixia 774 8 mm which was obtained from the statistical yearbook of qixia qixia statistical bureau 2019 and p e is the precipitation recorded during the experiment 28 8 mm 2 3 2 cropland ecs soil samples from the apple orchard 19 sampling points and cropland 18 sampling points in qixia were uniformly distributed throughout the study region fig 3 these samples were collected to analyze the tn and tp content through laboratory analyses the average values of tn and tp for the apple orchard were 0 845 and 0 752 g kg 1 whereas they were 0 510 and 0 503 g kg 1 for cropland respectively as apple orchards and croplands are mainly distributed in plains or gently sloping areas their soil and topographic conditions were assumed to be relatively consistent however the cultivation and vegetational cover conditions were not entirely consistent therefore we determined the ecs of tn and tp for cropland in qixia using rainfall runoff experimental data from the apple orchard combined with the measured soil nutrients and soil erosion parameters of the apple orchard and cropland the ecs of tn and tp for cropland were calculated as follows 5 c cn c on 0 510 0 845 Œ≥ c cp c op 0 503 0 752 Œ≥ Œ≥ r c r o where c on and c op are the ecs of tn and tp in the apple orchard respectively kg ha 1 a 1 c cn and c cp are the ecs of tn and tp in the cropland respectively kg ha 1 a 1 Œ≥ is the soil erosion coefficient between cropland and apple orchard and r c and r o are the soil erosion modules for cropland and apple orchard respectively t km 2 a 1 we acquired r c and r o using the land use i e cropland and apple orchard raster data masked by the soil erosion data product which was derived from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn finally the value of Œ≥ calculated via eq 5 was 1 20 2 3 3 built up land ecs the ecs of tn and tp for built up land were calculated according to eq 6 6 c bn w c n k a b 10 3 c bp w c p k a b 10 3 where c bn and c bp are the ecs of tn and tp in built up land kg ha 1 a 1 respectively w is the total annual water consumption of qixia city 2 63 106 m3 which was derived from the statistical yearbook of qixia and cn and cp are the concentrations of tn and tp per unit domestic sewage 37 20 and 4 14 mg l 1 respectively which were obtained from the handbook of emission coefficient of domestic pollution sources ministry of ecology and environment 2019 the variable k is the deflation coefficient 0 8 which was also obtained from the handbook of emission coefficient of domestic pollution sources ministry of ecology and environment 2019 a b is the area of built up land in qixia ha and 10 3 in eq 6 is the unit conversion coefficient 2 3 4 calculation of the source intensity of the total pollution load the calculation of the total pollution load source intensity for each subwatershed not only accounted for the land use types but also for the spatial distribution relative distance and slope of land use patches in the subwatershed jiang et al 2013 as in eq 7 7 s o u r c e i c i 1 s l o p j s l o p max 1 d i s t a n c e j d i s t a n c e max s o u r c e i 1 n s o u r c e i a i i 1 n a i where source i is the source intensity of land use type i kg ha 1 a 1 c i is the ec of tn or tp of land use type i kg ha 1 a 1 slop max and distance max are the maximum values of the slope and distance from the river course respectively slop j and distance j respectively are the slope and distance from the river course of land use patch j in the subwatershed source is the pollution load per unit area of the subwatershed kg and a i is the area of land use type i ha 2 4 calculation of anpsp sink intensity 2 4 1 calculation of landscape metrics landscape metrics were extracted from land use patches using the fragstats ver 4 2 software mcgarigal and marks 1995 mcgarigal et al 2002 we referred to liu et al 2020 for the indices which included those reflecting the i landscape fragmentation patch density pd edge density ed and total edge contrast index teci ii landscape shape mean shape index msi contiguity index contig and perimeter area fractal dimension pafrac and iii landscape heterogeneity interspersion juxtaposition index iji and aggregation index ai 2 4 2 calculation of the weight of each landscape metric the data featured eight landscape metrics i 8 divided into six categories of land use types j 6 thus the matrix m of the original data was as follows eq 8 8 m m 11 m 12 m 16 m 21 m 22 m 26 m 81 m 82 m 86 first we standardized the original data using eq 9 9 m i j m i j min j m i j max j m i j min j m i j where m ij is the value of landscape metric i of land use type j before standardization m ij is the result after standardization and max j m ij and min j m ij are the corresponding maximum and minimum values respectively we then used the entropy method qian et al 2020 to objectively assess the impact of the landscape metrics the steps of the method are described herein first the calculation of the information entropy e i of landscape metric i was derived as follows eq 10 10 p i m i j j 1 6 m i j e i 1 ln 8 j 1 6 p i j ln p i j then the calculation of the weight w i of landscape metric i was derived as follows eq 11 11 w i 1 e i i 1 8 1 e i as a result the weighted landscape composite index was calculated via eq 12 12 l c i i 1 8 w i c i where lci is the landscape composite index hereinafter lci and c i and w i are the values of landscape metric i and the corresponding weight respectively 2 4 3 calculation of landscape sink intensity values of lci in this study were used to characterize the fragility and vulnerability of landscape units with respect to an external interference which was considered from three aspects landscape fragmentation shape and heterogeneity the larger the lci the more fragile the landscape unit and the poorer the sink intensity or environmental recovery capacity of the region wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 therefore the formula for calculating the sink intensity of pollutants in the subwatershed was as follows 13 s ink j 1 l c i j s i n k j 1 n s ink j a j j 1 n a j where sink j and lci j are the sink intensity and lci of land use type j respectively sink is the unit area sink intensity of the subwatershed and a j is the area of land use type j 2 5 landscape source sink comparison index first the source intensity source eq 7 and sink intensity sink eq 13 of each subwatershed were normalized the results yielded the source and sink respectively then the constructed landscape source sink comparison index was calculated as per eq 14 14 s o u r c e s o u r c e s o u r c e min s o u r c e max s o u r c e min s i n k s i n k s i n k min s i n k max s i n k min l s s c i s ource s ource s i n k where source and sink are the normalized source and sink intensities of the subwatershed respectively each with a range of values of 0 l and lssci is the landscape source sink comparison index noting that the smaller the value of lssci the lower the risk of anpsp 2 6 fertilizer application scenarios the statistical data for qixia city showed that the application rate of chemical fertilizer in qixia had a downward trend from 2 04 105 t in 2017 1 96 105 t in 2018 however the apple yield continued to increase from 1 87 106 t in 2017 1 91 106 t in 2018 qixia statistical bureau 2019 the chemical fertilizer input in qixia dominated in apple orchards followed by cultivated land in addition through a large number of questionnaires we found that compared with a few years ago the amount of chemical fertilizer application in apple orchards in qixia was slightly reduced wan et al 2020 we infer that this reduction was related to the improvement in apple orchard management and fertilizer manufacturing as well as the popularization of advanced technology therefore maintaining a high apple yield on the premise that the amount of chemical fertilizer application would be appropriately reduced was feasible based on the current situation of anpsp in qixia we further simulated two fertilizer application scenarios i the optimum ratio of n and p fertilizer application with only reduced p scenario ‚Ö∞ and ii the optimum ratio of n and p fertilizer application with reductions in both n and p scenario ‚Ö± the specific division basis for n and p fertilizer application under the two scenarios were as follows at present the application amount of n and p2o5 fertilizer in china s apple orchards as represented by qixia are 545 and 569 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively which are significantly higher than the conventional level in developed countries 150 200 and 100 150 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively wan et al 2020 furthermore the best ratio for n and p2o5 is 1 0 4 according to the local standard shandong provincial bureau of quality and technical supervision 2018 the proportion of p fertilizer application in qixia is notably higher than this standard therefore scenario i was based on the optimal ratio 1 0 4 of n p in apple orchards and the amount of n remained unchanged whereas the amount of p2o5 was reduced achieving the target balance of n and p the amount of n and p2o5 fertilizer application in scenario i was calculated as 545 and 218 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively scenario ‚Ö± was subsequently modified according to the assumption that n and p2o5 were applied at 1 0 and 0 4 kg for each 100 kg of apple production respectively therefore based on the apple yield and apple orchard areas of qixia the amount of n and p2o5 fertilizer application in scenario ‚Ö± was calculated as 420 and 168 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively finally we analyzed the relationship between the current spatial distribution of anpsp and various local environmental factors to evaluate the performance of the source sink landscape method in regional anpsp 3 results 3 1 land use classification and subwatershed extraction fig 5 shows the spatial pattern of land use in qixia apple orchards were widely distributed and found to be the main land use type 61 542 ha followed by cropland 52 564 ha which was mainly distributed on the alluvial plain woodland 44 126 ha was mainly located in the mid eastern mountainous area which is known to be unsuitable for the growth of apple trees and crops owing to high elevations steep slopes and limiting irrigation conditions the areas of built up land 18 652 ha grassland 17 014 ha and water area 7 735 ha were relatively small table 1 the interpretation accuracy of the land use classification showed that the producer and user accuracy of each land use type were each more than 80 and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 90 36 and 0 88 respectively table 1 indicating that our results are reliable and suitable for use in further research in addition qixia was divided into 54 subwatersheds using the dem data fig 5 3 2 ec and landscape composite index lci of different land use types fig 6 shows the cumulative ecs of tn and tp in the apple orchard during the rainfall runoff experiment the effective runoff collection time for the rainfall process was 257 min and the tn and tp were 0 420 and 0 017 kg respectively the ecs of tn and tp in the apple orchard were the largest of all the land use types reaching up to 68 90 and 2 79 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively the ecs of tn and tp in the cropland were slightly lower than those of the apple orchard which were 49 90 and 2 24 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively as built up land is not the main pollution source the ecs of tn and tp were the smallest compared with the apple orchard and cropland which were 4 19 and 0 47 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively table 2 in summary the high intensity chemical fertilizer input to the apple orchard caused a substantial surplus of nutrients the planting area and ecs of n and p in the apple orchard were greater than those of cropland indicating that apple tree planting is the most important factor causing anpsp in qixia the mean lci values of apple orchards croplands and built up land 0 86 0 71 and 0 62 respectively were significantly higher than those of woodlands grasslands and water bodies 0 41 0 37 and 0 23 respectively fig 7 the mean lci values of apple orchards croplands and built up land were at notably high levels which is consistent with the fact that these land use types are the main pollution source of n and p therefore these results further confirm that the lci is negatively positively correlated with the sink source intensity of the landscape furthermore the differences in the lci for different land use types were highly significant p 0 001 fig 7 which indicates that the source and or sink effects of the landscape types were quite different 3 3 assessment of anpsp the source and sink intensity in qixia can be divided into five categories fig 8 according to the natural breakpoint method zou et al 2020 the source intensity was roughly negatively correlated with the sink intensity in space areas of high source intensity were mainly located in the western and southern parts of qixia fig 8a where the density of apple orchards and cropland distribution were high fig 5 zhu et al 2020 reported similar conclusions as a result the amount of chemical fertilizer input in southwestern qixia was at a higher level indicating a strong potential for anpsp with runoff and leaching areas of high sink intensity were mainly located in the east and north fig 8b where abundant woodlands and grasslands are present fig 5 the state of the ecological environmental health here is relatively stable the risk pattern of anpsp in qixia was obtained according to the calculation of the source and sink results of a previous study have shown that the fertilizer use efficiency of apple trees in the circum bohai bay area of china was 55 5 bai et al 2019 other studies have measured the total uptake of n and p2o5 by branches and fruits in qixia apple orchard land to be 168 and 85 kg ha 1 a 1 wan et al 2020 respectively based on these findings we assumed a scenario in which a positive linear correlation exists between the amount of fertilizer application in the apple orchard and ec if the effective amount of fertilizer application is equal to the amount absorbed by apple trees then the value for the ecs of tn and tp would be 0 according to this scenario the application amount of n and p2o5 should be 302 70 and 153 15 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively we conducted a large scale survey of apple orchards in qixia fig 3 collecting a total of 588 500 valid questionnaires according to the statistics qixia statistical bureau 2019 the application amounts of n and p2o5 in qixia apple orchards were 545 and 569 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively and the ecs of tn and tp under this scenario were 68 90 and 2 79 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively therefore based on the above mentioned two datasets the relationship between the amount of n and p fertilizers xn and xp and their ecs yn and yp in apple orchards could be established as follows 15 y n 0 28436x n 86 07524 y p 0 00671x p 1 02751 according to the fertilization requirements of scenarios ‚Ö∞ and ‚Ö± combined with eq 15 the fertilizer application amounts and ecs of tn and tp in apple orchards under the simulated scenarios were obtained table 3 moreover the spatial distribution of the anpsp risk intensity fig 9 and corresponding area table 3 under the different scenarios were also determined the combined results showed that the risk intensity of anpsp caused by apple orchard planting could be further controlled after fertilization according to local standards in the simulation the area of extremely high risk was reduced from its present day value of 18 450 ha to 4909 ha for scenario i and 0 ha for scenario ii reductions of 73 39 and 100 respectively likewise the extremely low risk area increased from 35 232 ha present to 40 473 ha for scenario i and 112 092 ha for scenario ii increases of 14 88 and 218 15 respectively the source sink and risk intensities of anpsp for each subwatershed in qixia were correlated with 11 natural environmental factors such as topography fig 10a b climate fig 10c d hydrology fig 10e vegetation fig 10f and soil fig 10g k the results table 4 showed that the source intensity had highly significant positive correlations with the temperature water erosion intensity and clay content p 0 01 a significant positive correlation with the drainage density p 0 05 and highly significant negative correlations with the slope altitude and sand content p 0 01 the sink intensity had highly significant positive correlations with the slope and sand content p 0 01 a significant positive correlation with the drainage density p 0 05 highly significant negative correlations with the altitude soil organic carbon soc and clay content p 0 01 and a significant negative correlation with the water erosion intensity p 0 05 the risk intensity had highly significant positive correlations with the drainage density water erosion intensity and clay content p 0 01 a significant positive correlation with the soc p 0 05 highly significant negative correlations with the slope and altitude p 0 01 and a significant negative correlation with the sand content p 0 05 in summary the source sink and current status of anpsp have good correlations with many key natural environmental factors 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the lci in different land use types the mean lci values of grassland woodland and water areas were at low levels compared with apple orchards cropland and build up land fig 7 which was consistent with previous studies cai et al 2018 uwimana et al 2018 the lci of woodlands was slightly higher than that of grasslands possibly owing to the higher elevation of woodland in qixia anpsp is known to be mainly caused by runoff and leaching therefore limiting the absorption of pollutants by woodlands at higher elevations in addition the lci dispersion of grasslands in each subwatershed was relatively large which may be ascribed to the low interpretation accuracy for grassland table 1 resulting in significant variations in lci values lu et al 2020 moreover grassland patches were mostly distributed in the transitional areas between other land use types leading to higher heterogeneity esch et al 2014 4 2 applicability of the landscape scale in anpsp research the spatial accuracy of the previous results may be partially affected if soil sampling is carried out without consideration of the spatial heterogeneity of landscape patches within the study area li et al 2020c in addition multiple previous studies have used a physical model e g swat chen et al 2010 volk et al 2017 wang et al 2020b whose spatial resolution can be refined to the grid scale however the content of that model setting is extensive its results are easily disturbed by many index parameters and model verification is relatively complex grunwald and norton 2000 as a result the physical model is more extensively used in scientific research on anpsp but it is not suitable for operational assessments whereas the source sink landscape method is more suitable the source intensity sink intensity and the risk intensity of anpsp all had strong correlations with the topography i e slope and altitude drainage density water erosion intensity soc and soil texture i e sand silt and clay table 4 therefore we conclude that our evaluation results are relatively reliable one possible explanation for the correlations may be that the spatial distribution of the landscape units i e apple orchard cropland woodland and other patches is the combined result of natural factors i e topography hydrology and soil among others and human intervention suggesting that the spatial distribution of source sink landscape units tend to integrate natural factors affecting the enrichment migration and absorption of pollutants with the human factors of planning and layout therefore a source sink model based on landscape scale effectively balances the relationship between research complexity and result accuracy thereby simplifying the research method and maintaining a higher research accuracy in conclusion the landscape scale is a suitable spatial scale for anpsp research 4 3 analysis of natural factors influencing anpsp among the various natural factors slope and altitude are known to directly affect the planting of apple trees which can in turn influence anpsp this is because greater amounts of water and soil nutrients are lost with an increasing steepness of the slope our study showed that the average slope of apple orchards in qixia is relatively low at 6 in general the soil is relatively barren and irrigation becomes increasingly inconvenient at higher altitudes therefore the source intensity and risk intensity of anpsp were both negatively correlated with slope and altitude p 0 01 table 4 in addition the steeper the slope the stronger the migration ability of pollutants with runoff however it is more difficult for pollutants to become enriched with an increasing altitude therefore the sink intensity had a positive correlation with slope p 0 01 and a negative correlation with the altitude p 0 01 which is consistent with the results of li et al 2020c furthermore air temperature is known to decrease with an increasing altitude thus the temperature of plains and river valleys is generally higher than that of mountainous and hilly areas low lying areas are the main distribution areas of apple orchards and croplands in qixia therefore the source intensity of anpsp was significantly negatively correlated with air temperature which is consistent with the results of li et al 2020c no correlation was observed between precipitation and source intensity because the spatial variability in precipitation at the county scale is minimal i e the precipitation in qixia generally decreases from southeast to northwest fig 10d however the apple orchards and croplands are mainly distributed in the western region fig 5 thus the spatial distribution of precipitation was not consistent with that of pollution sources wu et al 2016 also found that there was no significant correlation between the dissolved organic carbon loss and annual precipitation at the smaller watershed scale areas of high drainage density were relatively low and flat these areas corresponded to the main distribution of apple orchards and croplands as well as serving as the main enrichment areas of pollutants therefore the source and sink intensities obtained in this study showed notable positive correlations with the drainage density and highly significant positive correlations with anpsp there was no correlation between the ndvi and anpsp in this study likely owing to the fact that the main topographic types in qixia are mountainous and hilly for which the vegetation coverage is generally high thus areas of high ndvi corresponded either to apple orchards as source landscapes or woodlands as sink landscapes the water erosion intensity had highly significant positive correlations with the source intensity and risk intensity of anpsp this may be attributed to the phenomenon in which soil nutrients in the water erosion area are transported with runoff and leaching leading to anpsp however the sink landscapes had a higher forest and grass coverage which yielded a significant negative correlation between the sink intensity and water erosion areas of high soc were mainly distributed in fertile farming areas thus the soc had a significant positive correlation with the risk intensity of anpsp the main soil type in the mountainous and hilly areas in qixia is skeletal soil which has thin soil layers poor fertility and a generally low soc content however these areas were mainly covered by sink landscapes such as woodlands and grasslands such that there was a highly significant negative correlation between the sink intensity and soc the relation between the sand content and clay content in one area is usually opposite fig 10i and k owing to the influence of pedogenic factors vasu et al 2020 fluvisols are widely developed in the low and flat areas resulting in high clay contents in the sediments of these lands fig 10k moreover the low and flat areas were mainly covered by apple orchards and croplands fig 5 on the other hand lithosols and skeletal soil with high sand contents are main distributed in the hilly and mountainous areas fig 10i which was consistent with the spatial distribution of woodlands grasslands and other sink landscapes fig 5 therefore the clay sand content showed highly significant positive negative and negative positive correlations with the source intensity and sink intensity of anpsp respectively table 4 4 4 uncertainty in n and p loadings the most direct cause of anpsp is the excessive application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides shen et al 2012 in addition n and p loss from livestock and poultry farming are also causes li et al 2020a considering that qixia is a representative orchard dominated area the proportion of livestock and poultry farming is substantially smaller than that of other agricultural counties such that the n and p loss from livestock and poultry were not taken into account in this study for this study apple orchards croplands and built up land were considered the export sources of pollutants while woodlands and grasslands were not taken into account this is because we considered the n and p export from woodlands and grasslands to reflect natural background levels rendering them irrelevant to anpsp caused by human activities moreover the ecs of tn and tp for woodlands and grasslands are generally small such that their contribution to regional anpsp can be ignored for example rong et al 2017 calculated the tn and tp for woodlands to be 0 21 0 27 and 0 015 0 018 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively and 1 32 1 82 and 0 11 0 15 kg ha 1 a 1 for grasslands respectively for differential nutrient migration the migration and transformation processes of n in the ecological environment is more complex and diverse compared to those of p sun et al 2020 we also note that atmospheric n deposition is a contributing source of n in this region liu et al 2013 while not substantial for example atmospheric n deposition in qixia city in 2018 was estimated to be 33 96 kg ha 1 a 1 wan et al 2020 which was substantially less than the amount of tn 545 kg ha 1 a 1 from fertilizer application in qixia thus atmospheric n deposition was not considered in this study previous studies have shown that differences exist in terms of nutrient loss in croplands under different precipitation intensities liu et al 2014 the ecs of tn and tp for apple orchards calculated in our rainfall runoff experiment only account for annual precipitation without considering possible changes in the precipitation intensity however most ecs of tn and tp from macroscale studies have been derived from relevant references cheng et al 2018 hua et al 2019 yan et al 2019 such that the universality of the data and portability of their application to different regions may be limited therefore we considered that the accuracy of the ecs of tn and tp obtained from the field experiment were more acceptable the ec of tn in cropland was calculated to be 49 90 kg ha 1 a 1 in this study which was similar to the value reported by wang et al 2019 55 89 kg ha 1 a 1 furthermore wang et al 2019 reported that the ecs of tp after organic and chemical fertilizer applications in cropland were 3 74 and 1 11 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively a range that is similar to our result 2 24 kg ha 1 a 1 in summary we used a large amount of first hand measured data to calculate the ecs of the two main land use types i e apple orchards and croplands that cause anpsp therefore we speculate that our evaluation results are reliable 5 conclusions the source sink landscape method was first applied via a combination of a rainfall runoff experiment field sampling and survey and remote sensing data to evaluate the anpsp in an orchard dominated area of china the tn tp ecs for apple orchards croplands and built up land were 68 90 2 79 49 90 2 24 and 4 19 0 47 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively therefore the excessive input of fertilizer has caused a large surplus of n and p nutrients in apple orchards in qixia the problem of anpsp caused by apple tree planting should not be underestimated apple orchards and cropland are mainly distributed in western and southern qixia which are the main source areas of tn and tp export with the source intensity significantly greater than the sink intensity and the anpsp intensity for these areas is serious under circumstances where apple yield and quality can be guaranteed to effectively reduce the potential for local anpsp we propose that agricultural entities should use the scientifically designed optimum ratio of the n and p fertilizer application scheme which features reduced p or a combination of reduced n and p according to local standards moreover the source sink and current status of anpsp had strong correlations with many key natural environmental factors i e slope altitude drainage density water erosion intensity soil texture and soc which demonstrated that the evaluation results derived from the source sink landscape method are reliable in summary the source sink model based on the landscape scale effectively balances the relationship between research complexity and result accuracy thereby simplifying the research method and maintaining a higher research accuracy therefore this method at the source sink landscape scale may facilitate the evaluation of anpsp the representativeness of qixia allows the results to serve as a baseline scientific reference for the prevention and control of anpsp in orchard dominated areas worldwide our study confirmed the advantage of the source sink landscape method in evaluating anpsp but some landscape units could have been further subdivided or merged at different spatial scales which depends on the size of the study area however the uncertainty of the evaluation results caused by the scale effect remain unclear therefore we believe that the extraction of landscape units at different scales based on remote sensing methods has great potential which needs to be further explored in the future credit
