19290,coupling in situ thermal treatment istt with microbial reductive dechlorination mrd has the potential to enhance contaminant degradation and reduce cleanup costs compared to conventional standalone remediation technologies impacts of low temperature istt on dehalococcoides mccartyi dhc a relevant species in the anaerobic degradation of cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce and vinyl chloride vc to nontoxic ethene were assessed in sand packed columns under dynamic flow conditions dissolved tetrachloroethene pce 258 46 μm was introduced to identical columns bioaugmented with the pce to ethene dechlorinating consortium kb 1 initial column temperatures represented a typical aquifer 15 c or a site undergoing low temperature istt 35 c and were subsequently increased to 35 and 74 c respectively to assess temperature impacts on reductive dechlorination activity in the 15 c column pce was transformed primarily to cis dce 159 2 μm which was further degraded to vc 164 3 μm and ethene 30 0 μm within 17 pore volumes pvs after the temperature was increased to 35 c regardless of the initial column temperature ethene constituted 50 mol of effluent degradation products in both columns after 73 74 pvs at 35 c indicating that mrd performance was greatly improved under low temperature istt conditions increasing the temperature of the column initially at 35 c resulted in continued vc and ethene production until a temperature of approximately 43 c was reached at which point dhc activity substantially decreased the abundance of the vcra reductive dehalogenase gene exceeded that of the bvca gene by 1 2 5 orders of magnitude at 15 c but this relationship inversed at temperatures 35 c suggesting dhc strain specific responses to temperature these findings

treatment istt and microbial reductive dechlorination mrd has been proposed to improve remediation performance at sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents beyke and fleming 2005 christ et al 2005 stroo et al 2012 the average groundwater temperature in the united states ranges from 3 c in parts of maine and minnesota to 25 c in southern florida and texas usepa 2016 but the key dechlorinating bacteria involved in reductive dechlorination of chlorinated solvents are mesophilic with optimal growth temperatures ranging from 22 to 38 c fletcher et al 2011 friis et al 2007 gerritse et al 1996 holliger et al 1993 löffler et al 2013 a narrower optimal range of 25 30 c has been identified for neutrophilic strictly hydrogenotrophic dehalococcoides mccartyi dhc strains which are essential bacteria for the reduction of cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce and vinyl chloride vc to nontoxic ethene löffler et al 2013 use of istt to achieve the optimal temperature for mrd could substantially impact in situ dechlorination rates a batch culture study using the tetrachloroethene pce to ethene dechlorinating consortium bio dechlor inoculum bdi demonstrated dhc activity at 40 c but sustained biotransformation of vc to ethene required temperatures not exceeding 35 c fletcher et al 2011 emphasizing the potential negative impacts of heating on the mrd process mrd has been studied extensively in static batch incubations but system scale and conditions i e presence of porous medium and dynamic flow conditions have been shown to strongly influence microbial activity in some cases impacting microbial tolerance to environmental stressors in a study designed to compare mrd in continuous flow versus batch reactor systems dhc dechlorination rates in columns exceeded those in batch reactors by more than 200 fold schaefer et al 2009 highlighting the potential for system conditions e g hydraulic parameters to substantially affect microbial activity similarly the pce and tce dechlorinating bacterium dehalobacter restrictus strain per k23 did not grow in batch reactors maintained at 10 c holliger et al 1993 despite transforming pce at a high rate of 3 7 μm h in a continuous flow column operated at the same temperature de bruin et al 1992 contaminant toxicity has also been shown to vary with system scale and microbial diversity for example despite batch study results demonstrating that four pure cultures i e sulfurospirillum multivorans desulfuromonas michiganensis strain bb1 geobacter lovleyi strain sz and desulfitobacterium sp strain viet1 were unable to dechlorinate pce when concentrations exceeded 540 μm amos et al 2007 2008 mrd of pce near the aqueous solubility csat pce 1200 μm has been reported in column isalou et al 1998 aquifer cell cápiro et al 2015 and pilot adamson et al 2003 studies the underlying reasons for these discrepancies are unclear but geochemical conditions such as dissolved oxygen amos et al 2008 heavner et al 2018 temperature bradley et al 2005 fletcher et al 2011 macbeth et al 2012 truex et al 2007 ph yang et al 2017a 2017b contaminant concentration gradients amos et al 2008 behrens et al 2008 cope and hughes 2001 sleep et al 2006 or biofilms microenvironments costerton et al 1995 lens et al 1993 can have strain specific impacts leading to variability in microbial growth and dechlorination activity several well studied dhc strains involved in the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes each possess a single copy of the dhc 16s rrna gene and a single copy of one of the reductive dehalogenase rdase genes implicated in cis dce or vc reduction strains 195 and fl2 possess the tcea gene tce dces vc strains vs and gt possess the vcra gene cis dce vc ethene and strain bav1 possesses the bvca gene dces vc ethene löffler et al 2013 the vcra and bvca genes are often monitored in groundwater via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr analysis because of their association with ethene formation holmes et al 2006 lee et al 2008 müller et al 2004 scheutz et al 2008 several studies have demonstrated that dhc strains harboring the vcra and bvca genes appear to have different responses to geochemical conditions behrens et al 2008 heavner et al 2018 van der zaan et al 2010 yan et al 2015 yang et al 2017a 2017b for example shifts in the relative abundance of dhc strains occurred during istt at a site in fort lewis wa wherein heating from ambient temperature 12 c to 33 c caused a relative increase of the bvca gene versus the vcra gene macbeth et al 2012 during field application of electrical resistance heating erh a widely used istt technology treatment zone temperatures of 80 110 c are commonly targeted to achieve desorption and volatilization of organic contaminants allowing for gas phase recovery and subsequent above ground treatment triplett kingston et al 2010 laboratory scale microcosm studies showed that these conditions lead to viability loss of bacteria capable of mrd fletcher et al 2011 friis et al 2007 however mrd activity could be retained or even increased in peripheral and down gradient zones where temperatures were lower but still elevated relative to ambient groundwater alternatively istt could be specifically designed to moderately increase groundwater temperatures with the goal of stimulating mrd this strategy has substantially lower energy requirements than conventional istt and eliminates the need for costly gas phase extraction and above ground treatment systems beyke and fleming 2005 macbeth et al 2012 despite being a promising remedial strategy the potential benefits of coupling low temperature istt e g up to 50 c with mrd have received little quantitative attention particularly with respect to the simultaneous effects of variable temperature and flow through porous media macbeth et al 2012 truex et al 2007 given the potential impacts of system scale and flow conditions on microbial activity the results of batch studies are not immediately transferrable to in situ conditions thus the objectives of this study were to a assess the impacts of simultaneous low temperature thermal treatment and 1 d flow through a porous medium on the extent of mrd of pce and its chlorinated transformation products and b determine the impacts of increasing temperature on strain specific growth and activity of dhc in continuous flow 1 d column systems dissolved pce was continuously introduced to columns bioaugmented with a pce to ethene dechlorinating consortium and the columns were cooled or heated to represent groundwater temperatures at an unheated site or a site undergoing low temperature istt respectively chlorinated ethenes and ethene concentrations as well as the abundance and distribution of dhc 16s rrna and rdase genes were monitored to evaluate the potential benefits and impacts of low temperature istt on mrd 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pce 99 and sodium lactate 60 w w syrup used in the column experiments were

dissolved pce and lactate flow was then paused and 6 ml of the kb 1 consortium was injected via each column influent sampling ports 1 3 and effluent for a total of 30 ml per column kb 1 is a widely used methanogenic pce to ethene dechlorinating consortium predominantly comprised of acetobacterium sp geobacter sp and multiple dhc strains harboring the vcra bvca and tcea rdase genes duhamel and edwards 2006 liang et al 2015 roberts 2017 column flow was resumed after a 48 h flow interruption that was designed to facilitate cellular attachment for simplicity in all subsequent text and figures this resumption of flow was considered pv 0 the experiment was completed in four phases each involving one or both columns inoculated with the kb 1 consortium in phase i columns ai15 and bi35 were

aqueous effluent samples 5 ml were collected from a stainless steel sampling reservoir every 2 3 pvs using a 5 ml gas tight syringe agilent santa clara ca triplicate 1 ml aqueous samples were immediately added to 20 ml headspace vials agilent containing ambient air thus preventing further microbial reductive dechlorination prior to the analysis of chlorinated ethenes and ethene effluent ph

dechlorination occurred within the columns rather than in the effluent sampling reservoirs columns were destructively sampled fig s1 after the experiment to determine solid phase abundances of the dhc

calibration standards were prepared by injecting a known volume of each gas into a sealed 160 ml culture bottle containing 100 ml of 18 2 mω water and allowing them to equilibrate overnight details of the gc fid analytical method are provided in the supplementary material the method detection limits for each chlorinated ethene and ethene were 1 μm or lower and were determined following the method

l 4 mm id analyte separation was achieved using a variable concentration potassium hydroxide eluent generator and constant flow rate of 1 5 ml min the method detection limit for each organic acid was

bioaugmentation the kb 1 consortium used to bioaugment columns ai15 and bi35 contained 1 4 0 2 107 dhc 16s rrna gene copies ml 1 4 0 0 107 vcra gene copies ml and 4 5 1 1 104 bvca gene copies ml the culture also contained 77 1 μm ethene but no chlorinated ethenes accounting for cells immediately washed out during bioaugmentation the initial aqueous dhc 16s rrna gene abundance was 9 7 2 2 106 gene copies ml in column ai15 and 1 2 0 2 107 gene copies ml in column bi35 more than 99 of dhc cells retained in each column immediately following bioaugmentation possessed the vcra gene while only 0 3 possessed the bvca gene the tcea gene was not detected in the inoculum nor in any of the samples collected throughout the experiment consistent with previous studies demonstrating low relative abundance of tcea compared to the vcra and bvca genes in the kb 1 consortium liang et al 2015 influent and effluent ph values fell within the range of 7 0 7 2 for the experiment duration and measured orp values were consistently less than 100 mv regardless of changes in dhc abundance or system temperature within 17 pvs post bioaugmentation effluent lactate concentrations decreased from 5 2 to 1 8 mm and 5 3 to 0 2 mm in columns ai15 and bi35 respectively however lactate fermentation products acetate 0 2 3 8 mm and propionate 2 7 4 9 mm were consistently detected indicating that availability of carbon and fermentable organic substrates were not limiting mrd during the experiment table s1 3 2 effects of heating on dechlorination phase i of the experiment assessed dechlorination activity pcein 258 46 μm at a typical ambient groundwater temperature 15 c column ai15 versus a moderately elevated temperature 35 c column bi35 within the first 20 pvs following bioaugmentation pce and tce in the effluent of column ai15 was transformed primarily to cis dce 127 0 μm with lower levels of vc 41 1 μm and ethene 14 0 μm fig 1 a 0 20 pvs in contrast pce and tce were not detected in the effluent of column bi35 post bioaugmentation and cis dce 132 13 μm initially detected in the column bi35 effluent was rapidly degraded to vc 163 3 μm and ethene 63 0 μm within the same period fig 2 a 0 20 pvs these results indicate that a 20 c temperature difference substantially impacts the extent of dechlorination between otherwise equivalent continuous flow systems with comparable initial abundances of dhc cells during phase ii the cis dce concentration in the column ai15 effluent decreased from 142 2 to 86 1 μm as the system was heated from 15 to 35 c fig 1a 52 61 pvs then fell below the 1 μm detection limit over the next 17 pvs at 35 c fig 1a 61 78 pvs effluent vc concentration rose from 31 0 to 74 1 μm over the duration of the temperature increase fig 1a 52 61 pvs the observed shift in dechlorination products was likely due to the increased activity of existing dhc in response to the temperature increase as evidenced by the rapid decline in cis dce despite consistent aqueous dhc 16s rrna gene abundances prior to 2 4 0 4 105 1 0 0 1 106 gene copies ml fig 1c and immediately following 1 3 0 0 105 9 6 0 4 105 gene copies ml fig 1d the temperature increase however the elevated temperature also prompted the growth of new dhc cells fig 1b e contributing to the continued decrease in cis dce concentrations after the 35 c target was reached the same 15 to 35 c temperature increase that prompted rapid cis dce degradation had no immediately apparent impact on vc to ethene dechlorination potentially due to inhibition of dhc by the cis dce itself despite being reported in the literature amos et al 2009 azizian et al 2008 sabalowsky and semprini 2010 yu et al 2005 yu and semprini 2004 the mechanisms governing the inhibitory effects of cis dce on dhc dechlorination activity are poorly understood however laboratory and modeling based kinetic studies indicate that major factors may include acute toxic effects i e increased cellular decay decreased growth rates and preferential reduction of more highly chlorinated compounds i e competitive inhibition adamson et al 2004 chu 2004 cupples et al 2004 lee et al 2004 sabalowsky and semprini 2010 yu et al 2005 yu and semprini 2004 after column ai15 had been maintained at 35 c for approximately 60 pvs the effluent ethene concentration began to rise fig 1a 121 pvs and surpassed vc as the primary 50 mol dechlorination product after 74 pvs at 35 c fig 1a 135 pvs this phenomenon of rapid cis dce degradation with delayed ethene formation also occurred in column bi35 with effluent ethene concentration surpassing vc concentration only after column bi35 had been at 35 c for 73 pvs fig 2a 73 pvs the consistent duration of the lag period between complete cis dce reduction and rapid ethene formation suggests that high cis dce concentrations limited dhc activity as observed previously or that the abundance of the dhc strain s primarily responsible for vc reduction at 35 c was initially low in the kb 1 consortium used for bioaugmentation this latter point is discussed in more detail in section 3 4 furthermore the similar duration of the lag period 74 and 73 pvs in column ai15 and column bi35 respectively demonstrates that the order of remedy application i e heating following bioaugmentation versus bioaugmentation following heating did not substantially impact the ultimate extent of dechlorination concentrations of vc in both columns continued to decline during the periods of rapid ethene formation but these reductions in vc mass accounted for only 18 2 and 18 4 of the increased ethene mass in column ai15 fig 1a 121 165 pvs and column bi35 fig 2a 50 94 pvs respectively these mass balance discrepancies were attributed to equilibration between the aqueous phase and a visible gas phase that slowly developed in each column during their respective 35 c phases the discontinuity of each gas phase precluded direct sampling but analyses of aqueous port samples collected from column ai15 revealed that ethene accumulated in the column at 35 c fig 3 b temporarily delaying ethene elution and inflating subsequent effluent concentrations this hypothesis was supported by results of post experiment tracer tests which revealed markedly lower mobile porosities na final 0 33 cm3 cm3 nb final 0 30 cm3 cm3 compared to initial column conditions na initial 0 40 cm3 cm3 nb initial 0 40 cm3 cm3 consistent with formation of the visible gas phases within each column during prolonged heating at 35 c 3 3 maximum temperatures permissive of dechlorination activity in order to assess whether the optimal 25 30 c löffler et al 2013 and maximum temperature 35 40 c fletcher et al 2011 ranges determined for dhc in batch reactors are applicable to a continuous flow system column bi35 was gradually heated phase iii during this period of gradual heating starting at 35 c the effluent concentration of vc continued to decrease from 115 3 to 61 1 μm fig 2a 95 114 pvs ethene concentration remained high 250 μm and cis dce remained below detection indicating continued dhc activity heating was paused at 40 c when low concentrations 2 3 μm of cis dce were again detected in effluent samples fig 2a 103 108 pvs but resumed upon confirmation that vc 68 2 μm and ethene 285 5 μm concentrations remained steady however once the temperature of column bi35 reached 43 c effluent vc and ethene concentrations declined sharply and cis dce concentrations rebounded to 100 1 μm within 14 pvs fig 2a 113 127 pvs suggesting that a maximum temperature permissive of dhc activity had been reached phase iv like phase iii was intended to determine a maximum temperature permissive of dechlorination activity in a continuous flow system but with focus on pce and tce dechlorination i e dechlorination by non dhc bacteria in kb 1 heating of column bi35 was continued from 43 c until reaching a final temperature of 74 c fig 2a 134 169 pvs these high temperatures led to increased gas formation and loss of contaminant mass that did not occur at lower temperatures 15 43 c limiting further quantitative assessment of pce and its dechlorination transformation products losses were confirmed by results of aqueous port sample analyses of column bi35 fig s2b and column ccontrol fig s3 which demonstrated a decline in total concentrations of chlorinated ethenes and ethene in the direction of flow consistent with volatile losses through the pierced septa the result was an overall mass balance of 81 for column bi35 compared to 95 for column ai15 despite these losses due to volatilization low concentrations of cis dce persisted in the column bi35 effluent indicating that pce to cis dce dechlorinating microbes remained active at temperatures exceeding 43 c however lack of vc in effluent samples suggested that continued low concentrations of ethene were likely not indicative of continued dhc activity but instead resulted from the aqueous gas equilibration discussed in section 3 2 these observations are consistent with the results of qpcr analysis of aqueous port samples which demonstrated a steep decline of dhc 16s rrna gene and rdase gene abundances in column bi35 following heating from 43 c figure 2f to 74 c fig 2g this decline is illustrated in port 3 samples wherein the dhc 16s rrna gene abundance decreased from 5 5 2 1 107 to 3 7 0 3 105 gene copies ml between 126 and 176 pvs fig 2f and g these results demonstrate that dhc retains metabolic activity at higher temperatures 35 43 c in continuous flow systems than previously reported for batch systems fletcher et al 2011 löffler et al 2013 caution is warranted however as even slight i e 1 3 c exceedance of the operational temperature range may cause rapid cessation of dhc activity 3 4 impacts of temperature on dehalococcoides strains results of the qpcr analyses performed on aqueous port samples fig 1b g 2b g were consistent with dechlorination activity observed in columns ai15 and bi35 for example aqueous samples collected from port 3 nearest to effluent of the cooled column ai15 at 18 pvs post bioaugmentation contained 2 5 0 3 105 dhc 16s rrna gene copies ml fig 1b compared to 7 1 0 9 106 gene copies ml fig 2b in corresponding samples collected from the heated column bi35 furthermore although dhc 16s rrna gene abundance continued to increase in both columns from 18 to 47 pvs the average abundance over ports 1 3 increased only 3 fold in column ai15 fig 1b and c compared to a 12 fold increase in column bi35 fig 2b and c following heating of column ai15 from 15 to 35 c fig 1a 52 61 pvs dhc 16s rrna gene abundance increased further reaching a maximum of 5 0 0 2 107 gene copies ml by the end of the experiment this dhc growth represents a 230 fold overall increase fig 1b g and demonstrates the relationship between dhc 16s rrna gene abundance and system temperature the column data also indicate that individual dhc strains within the same culture i e consortium kb 1 respond differently to temperature changes as noted previously dhc strains possessing the vcra gene accounted for more than 99 of dhc in the inoculum this predominance of vcra over bvca was maintained throughout the entire 15 c phase of column ai15 and the beginning of the 35 c phase fig 1b d however vcra gene abundance remained static or declined during heating from 15 c 9 2 3 1 104 1 1 0 5 106 copies ml to 35 c 1 1 0 0 105 4 2 0 2 105 copies ml despite increases in dhc 16s rrna gene abundance at every sampling port between 47 and 92 pvs fig 1c e abundance of the bvca gene increased from 2 8 0 9 103 1 3 0 2 104 copies ml to 2 6 0 4 105 4 2 0 9 105 copies ml during this period indicating that growth of a dhc strain carrying bvca was positively impacted by the same temperature increase that limited growth of dhc strains harboring the vcra gene interestingly effluent ethene concentration in column ai15 exceeded vc concentration fig 1a 121 pvs only after bvca gene abundance surpassed that of the vcra gene fig 1f over the remainder of the experiment vcra gene abundance in column ai15 slowly began to increase but still lagged behind bvca gene abundance by an order of magnitude or greater fig 1f and g these strain specific responses were also observed in column bi35 ethene became the primary 50 mol degradation product fig 2b 73 pvs after bvca gene abundance exceeded vcra gene abundance fig 2c and d and bvca gene abundance averaged over ports 1 3 increased 3 fold during the 35 to 43 c temperature increase fig 2a 95 113 pvs while average vcra abundance remained unchanged fig 2e and f this apparent correlation between increased bvca gene abundance and ethene production at elevated temperatures is consistent with data obtained at the field scale macbeth et al 2012 these findings support the mounting volume of evidence demonstrating that despite coding for enzymes with seemingly identical function i e cis dce and vc reduction dhc strains carrying vcra versus bvca genes are not equivalent in terms of in situ dechlorination performance under different environmental conditions behrens et al 2008 heavner et al 2018 van der zaan et al 2010 yan et al 2015 yang et al 2017a 2017b the recognition that functionally equivalent i e cis dce to ethene dechlorinating dhc strains respond differently to environmental parameters is relevant and suggests that further optimization of bioaugmentation consortia for site specific treatment is possible destructive sampling and subsequent qpcr analysis revealed that 95 98 of dhc 16s rrna gene copies in column ai15 35 c at experiment conclusion were associated with the solid phase fig 4 a this finding is generally consistent with results of a previous study quantifying solid phase attachment rates in a room temperature 21 c federal fine ottawa sand column wherein 73 89 of dhc cells were attached to the solid phase at the conclusion of the experiment cápiro et al 2014 in the same study a positive relationship was identified between extent of cellular attachment and dechlorination activity greater extents of cellular attachment 95 98 and dechlorination in column ai15 compared to the room temperature study support this relationship and allude to a potentially complex link between system temperature cellular attachment and dechlorination activity furthermore results of the column ai15 qpcr analysis suggest that extent of dhc attachment at 35 c may be strain specific dhc strains possessing the bvca gene averaged over ports 1 3 were less likely to attach to the solid phase 87 18 attachment than strains possessing the vcra gene 94 9 attachment given the importance of dhc 16s rrna and rdase genes in assessing likely indicators of ethene formation e g aqueous dhc 16s rrna abundance 0 05 of total bacteria 103 gene copies ml vcra bvca abundance further study is warranted to ensure the continued accurate interpretation of these biomarkers if elevated temperatures result in greater dhc attachment and activity for instance then ethene formation may remain likely despite a lower abundance of dhc cells in the aqueous phase dhc 16s rrna and rdase gene abundances were low in solid phase samples collected 3 15 cm from the influent of column bi35 fig 4b which was held at 74 c during the final stage of the experiment the maximum total dhc abundance was only 1 1 0 2 106 gene copies g and

these remaining cells were inactive and likely trapped within immobile pore spaces that developed during formation of the gas phase 4 conclusions for more than a decade the coupling of istt with mrd has been proposed as an attractive remedial alternative that retains beneficial aspects of each standalone technology while minimizing disadvantageous aspects such as high energy demand and prolonged cleanup time however progression to rigorous field scale application has been hindered by scarce and sometimes conflicting reports particularly with respect to the optimal and maximum temperatures at which dhc transforms cis dce to vc and ethene native microbes will respond to physical chemical in situ remediation approaches and the responses of resident microbiology must be understood to take full advantage of potential synergistic effects the findings presented here provide valuable insight to assist researchers and practitioners in the successful integration of in situ thermal and microbial treatments under continuous flow conditions most notably the demonstration of sustained dhc dechlorination activity at temperatures previously considered to be inhibitory 35 c emphasizes the critical importance of physical scale and complexity resembling that of the field with groundwater flow and porous medium of experimental systems i e batch reactors versus continuous flow columns when assessing microbial tolerance thresholds and potential the demonstration of rapid and substantial impact of increasing system temperature on the extent of cis dce to vc dechlorination will provide remediation professionals an additional tool to combat the cis dce stall that frequently occurs at contaminated sites undergoing mrd the results demonstrating that dechlorination extent was independent of the order of remedial application may provide practitioners flexibility to modify existing or underperforming standalone thermal or biological treatment systems the evidence that bvca harboring dhc strains may supersede vcra harboring strains as the key contributors to ethene production at elevated temperatures will allow for more effective monitoring of mrd performance in systems operating at elevated temperatures the identification of system temperature control as a means to induce dhc strain specific responses provides opportunities to improve bioaugmentation cultures for

19290,coupling in situ thermal treatment istt with microbial reductive dechlorination mrd has the potential to enhance contaminant degradation and reduce cleanup costs compared to conventional standalone remediation technologies impacts of low temperature istt on dehalococcoides mccartyi dhc a relevant species in the anaerobic degradation of cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce and vinyl chloride vc to nontoxic ethene were assessed in sand packed columns under dynamic flow conditions dissolved tetrachloroethene pce 258 46 μm was introduced to identical columns bioaugmented with the pce to ethene dechlorinating consortium kb 1 initial column temperatures represented a typical aquifer 15 c or a site undergoing low temperature istt 35 c and were subsequently increased to 35 and 74 c respectively to assess temperature impacts on reductive dechlorination activity in the 15 c column pce was transformed primarily to cis dce 159 2 μm which was further degraded to vc 164 3 μm and ethene 30 0 μm within 17 pore volumes pvs after the temperature was increased to 35 c regardless of the initial column temperature ethene constituted 50 mol of effluent degradation products in both columns after 73 74 pvs at 35 c indicating that mrd performance was greatly improved under low temperature istt conditions increasing the temperature of the column initially at 35 c resulted in continued vc and ethene production until a temperature of approximately 43 c was reached at which point dhc activity substantially decreased the abundance of the vcra reductive dehalogenase gene exceeded that of the bvca gene by 1 2 5 orders of magnitude at 15 c but this relationship inversed at temperatures 35 c suggesting dhc strain specific responses to temperature these findings

treatment istt and microbial reductive dechlorination mrd has been proposed to improve remediation performance at sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents beyke and fleming 2005 christ et al 2005 stroo et al 2012 the average groundwater temperature in the united states ranges from 3 c in parts of maine and minnesota to 25 c in southern florida and texas usepa 2016 but the key dechlorinating bacteria involved in reductive dechlorination of chlorinated solvents are mesophilic with optimal growth temperatures ranging from 22 to 38 c fletcher et al 2011 friis et al 2007 gerritse et al 1996 holliger et al 1993 löffler et al 2013 a narrower optimal range of 25 30 c has been identified for neutrophilic strictly hydrogenotrophic dehalococcoides mccartyi dhc strains which are essential bacteria for the reduction of cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce and vinyl chloride vc to nontoxic ethene löffler et al 2013 use of istt to achieve the optimal temperature for mrd could substantially impact in situ dechlorination rates a batch culture study using the tetrachloroethene pce to ethene dechlorinating consortium bio dechlor inoculum bdi demonstrated dhc activity at 40 c but sustained biotransformation of vc to ethene required temperatures not exceeding 35 c fletcher et al 2011 emphasizing the potential negative impacts of heating on the mrd process mrd has been studied extensively in static batch incubations but system scale and conditions i e presence of porous medium and dynamic flow conditions have been shown to strongly influence microbial activity in some cases impacting microbial tolerance to environmental stressors in a study designed to compare mrd in continuous flow versus batch reactor systems dhc dechlorination rates in columns exceeded those in batch reactors by more than 200 fold schaefer et al 2009 highlighting the potential for system conditions e g hydraulic parameters to substantially affect microbial activity similarly the pce and tce dechlorinating bacterium dehalobacter restrictus strain per k23 did not grow in batch reactors maintained at 10 c holliger et al 1993 despite transforming pce at a high rate of 3 7 μm h in a continuous flow column operated at the same temperature de bruin et al 1992 contaminant toxicity has also been shown to vary with system scale and microbial diversity for example despite batch study results demonstrating that four pure cultures i e sulfurospirillum multivorans desulfuromonas michiganensis strain bb1 geobacter lovleyi strain sz and desulfitobacterium sp strain viet1 were unable to dechlorinate pce when concentrations exceeded 540 μm amos et al 2007 2008 mrd of pce near the aqueous solubility csat pce 1200 μm has been reported in column isalou et al 1998 aquifer cell cápiro et al 2015 and pilot adamson et al 2003 studies the underlying reasons for these discrepancies are unclear but geochemical conditions such as dissolved oxygen amos et al 2008 heavner et al 2018 temperature bradley et al

biofilms microenvironments costerton et al 1995 lens et al 1993 can have strain specific impacts leading to variability in microbial growth and dechlorination activity several well studied dhc strains involved in the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes each possess a single copy of the dhc 16s rrna gene and a single copy of one of the reductive dehalogenase rdase genes implicated in cis

2013 the vcra and bvca genes are often monitored in groundwater via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr analysis because of their association with ethene formation holmes et al 2006 lee et al 2008 müller et al 2004 scheutz et al 2008 several studies have demonstrated that dhc strains harboring the vcra and bvca genes appear to have different responses to geochemical conditions behrens et al 2008 heavner et al 2018 van der zaan et al 2010 yan et al 2015 yang et al 2017a 2017b for example shifts in the relative abundance of dhc strains occurred during istt at a site in fort lewis wa wherein heating from ambient temperature 12 c to 33 c caused a relative increase of the bvca gene versus the vcra gene macbeth et al 2012 during field application of electrical resistance heating erh a widely used istt technology treatment zone temperatures of 80 110 c are commonly targeted to achieve desorption and volatilization of organic contaminants allowing for gas phase recovery and subsequent above ground treatment triplett kingston et al 2010 laboratory scale microcosm studies showed that these conditions lead to viability loss of bacteria capable of mrd fletcher et al 2011 friis et al 2007 however mrd activity could be retained or even increased in peripheral and down gradient zones where temperatures were lower but still elevated relative to ambient groundwater alternatively istt could be specifically designed to moderately increase groundwater temperatures with the goal of stimulating mrd this strategy has substantially lower energy requirements than conventional istt and eliminates the need for costly gas phase extraction and above ground treatment systems beyke and fleming 2005 macbeth et al 2012 despite being a promising remedial strategy the potential benefits of coupling low temperature istt e g up to 50 c with mrd have received little quantitative attention particularly with respect to the simultaneous effects of variable temperature and flow through porous media macbeth et al 2012 truex et al 2007 given the potential impacts of system scale and flow conditions on microbial activity the results of batch studies are not immediately transferrable to in situ conditions thus the objectives of this study were to a assess the impacts of simultaneous low temperature thermal treatment and 1 d flow through a porous medium on the extent of mrd of pce and its chlorinated transformation products and b determine the impacts of increasing temperature on strain specific growth and activity of dhc in continuous flow 1 d column systems dissolved pce was continuously introduced to columns bioaugmented with a pce to ethene dechlorinating consortium and the columns were cooled or heated to represent groundwater temperatures at an unheated site or a site undergoing low temperature istt respectively chlorinated ethenes and ethene concentrations as well as the abundance and distribution of dhc 16s rrna and rdase genes were

bioaugmentation the kb 1 consortium used to bioaugment columns ai15 and bi35 contained 1 4 0 2 107 dhc 16s rrna gene copies ml 1 4 0 0 107 vcra gene copies ml and 4 5 1 1 104 bvca gene copies ml the culture also contained 77 1 μm ethene but no chlorinated ethenes accounting for cells immediately washed out during bioaugmentation the initial aqueous dhc 16s rrna gene abundance was 9 7 2 2 106 gene copies ml in column ai15 and 1 2 0 2 107 gene copies ml in column bi35 more than 99 of dhc cells retained in each column immediately following bioaugmentation possessed the vcra gene while only 0 3 possessed the bvca gene the tcea gene was not detected in the inoculum nor in any of the samples collected throughout the experiment consistent with previous studies demonstrating low relative abundance of tcea compared to the vcra and bvca genes in the kb 1 consortium liang et al 2015 influent and effluent ph values fell within the range of 7 0 7 2 for the experiment duration and measured orp values were consistently less than 100 mv regardless of changes in dhc abundance or system temperature within 17 pvs post bioaugmentation effluent lactate concentrations decreased from 5 2 to 1 8 mm and 5 3 to 0 2 mm in columns ai15 and bi35 respectively however lactate fermentation products acetate 0 2 3 8 mm and propionate 2 7 4 9 mm were consistently detected indicating that availability of carbon and fermentable organic substrates were not limiting mrd during the experiment table s1 3 2 effects of heating on dechlorination phase i of the experiment assessed dechlorination activity pcein 258 46 μm at a typical ambient groundwater temperature 15 c column ai15 versus a moderately elevated temperature 35 c column bi35 within the first 20 pvs following bioaugmentation pce and tce in the effluent of column ai15 was transformed primarily to cis dce 127 0 μm with lower levels of vc 41 1 μm and ethene 14 0 μm fig 1 a 0 20 pvs in contrast pce and tce were not detected in the effluent of column bi35 post bioaugmentation and cis dce 132 13 μm initially detected in the column bi35 effluent was rapidly degraded to vc 163 3 μm and ethene 63 0 μm within the same period fig 2 a 0 20 pvs these results indicate that a 20 c temperature difference substantially impacts the extent of dechlorination between otherwise equivalent continuous flow systems with comparable initial abundances of dhc cells during phase ii the cis dce concentration in the column ai15 effluent decreased from 142 2 to 86 1 μm as the system was heated from 15 to 35 c fig 1a 52 61 pvs then fell below the 1 μm detection limit over the next 17 pvs at 35 c fig 1a 61 78 pvs effluent vc concentration rose from 31 0 to 74 1 μm over the duration of the temperature increase fig 1a 52 61 pvs the observed shift in dechlorination products was likely due to the increased activity of existing dhc in response to the temperature increase as evidenced by the rapid decline in cis dce despite consistent aqueous dhc 16s rrna gene abundances prior to 2 4 0 4 105 1 0 0 1 106 gene copies ml fig 1c and immediately following 1 3 0 0 105 9 6 0 4 105 gene copies ml fig 1d the temperature increase however the elevated temperature also prompted the growth of new dhc cells fig 1b e contributing to the continued decrease in cis dce concentrations after the 35 c target was reached the same 15 to 35 c temperature increase that prompted rapid cis dce degradation had no immediately apparent impact on vc to ethene dechlorination potentially due to inhibition of dhc by the cis dce itself despite being reported in the literature amos et al 2009 azizian et al 2008 sabalowsky and semprini 2010 yu et al 2005 yu and semprini 2004 the mechanisms governing the inhibitory effects of cis dce on dhc dechlorination activity are poorly understood however laboratory and modeling based kinetic studies indicate that major factors may include acute toxic effects i e increased cellular decay decreased growth rates and preferential reduction of more highly chlorinated compounds i e competitive inhibition adamson et al 2004 chu 2004 cupples et al 2004 lee et al 2004 sabalowsky and semprini 2010 yu et al 2005 yu and semprini 2004 after column ai15 had been maintained at 35 c for approximately 60 pvs the effluent ethene concentration began to rise fig 1a 121 pvs and surpassed vc as the primary 50 mol dechlorination product after 74 pvs at 35 c fig 1a 135 pvs this phenomenon of rapid cis dce degradation with delayed ethene formation also occurred in column bi35 with effluent ethene concentration surpassing vc concentration only after column bi35 had been at 35 c for 73 pvs fig 2a 73 pvs the consistent duration of the lag period between complete cis dce reduction and rapid ethene formation suggests that high cis dce concentrations limited dhc activity as observed previously or that the abundance of the dhc strain s primarily responsible for vc reduction at 35 c was initially low in the kb 1 consortium used for bioaugmentation this latter point is discussed in more detail in section 3 4 furthermore the similar duration of the lag period 74 and 73 pvs in column ai15 and column bi35 respectively demonstrates that the order of remedy application i e heating following bioaugmentation versus bioaugmentation following heating did not substantially impact the ultimate extent of dechlorination concentrations of vc in both columns continued to decline during the periods of rapid ethene formation but these reductions in vc mass accounted for only 18 2 and 18 4 of the increased ethene mass in column ai15 fig 1a 121 165 pvs and column bi35 fig 2a 50 94 pvs respectively these mass balance discrepancies were attributed to equilibration between the aqueous phase and a visible gas phase that slowly developed in each column during their respective 35 c phases the discontinuity of each gas phase precluded direct sampling but analyses of aqueous port samples collected from column ai15 revealed that ethene accumulated in the column at 35 c fig 3 b temporarily delaying ethene elution and inflating subsequent effluent concentrations this hypothesis was supported by results of post experiment tracer tests which revealed markedly lower mobile porosities na final 0 33 cm3 cm3 nb final 0 30 cm3 cm3 compared to initial column conditions na initial 0 40 cm3 cm3 nb initial 0 40 cm3 cm3 consistent with formation of the visible gas phases within each column during prolonged heating at 35 c 3 3 maximum temperatures permissive of dechlorination activity in order to assess whether the optimal 25 30 c löffler et al 2013 and maximum temperature 35 40 c fletcher et al 2011 ranges determined for dhc in batch reactors are applicable to a continuous flow system column bi35 was gradually heated phase iii during this period of gradual heating starting at 35 c the effluent concentration of vc continued to decrease from 115 3 to 61 1 μm fig 2a 95 114 pvs ethene concentration remained high 250 μm and cis dce remained below detection indicating continued dhc activity heating was paused at 40 c when low concentrations 2 3 μm of cis dce were again detected in effluent samples fig 2a 103 108 pvs but resumed upon confirmation that vc 68 2 μm and ethene 285 5 μm concentrations remained steady however once the temperature of column bi35 reached 43 c effluent vc and ethene concentrations declined sharply and cis dce concentrations rebounded to 100 1 μm within 14 pvs fig 2a 113 127 pvs suggesting that a maximum temperature permissive of dhc activity had been reached phase iv like phase iii was intended to determine a maximum temperature permissive of dechlorination activity in a continuous flow system but with focus on pce and tce dechlorination i e dechlorination by non dhc bacteria in kb 1 heating of column bi35 was continued from 43 c until reaching a final temperature of 74 c fig 2a 134 169 pvs these high temperatures led to increased gas formation and loss of contaminant mass that did not occur at lower temperatures 15 43 c limiting further quantitative assessment of pce and its dechlorination transformation products losses were confirmed by results of aqueous port sample analyses of column bi35 fig s2b and column ccontrol fig s3 which demonstrated a decline in total concentrations of chlorinated ethenes and ethene in the direction of flow consistent with volatile losses through the pierced septa the result was an overall mass balance of 81 for column bi35 compared to 95 for column ai15 despite these losses due to volatilization low concentrations of cis dce persisted in the column bi35 effluent indicating that pce to cis dce dechlorinating microbes remained active at temperatures exceeding 43 c however lack of vc in effluent samples suggested that continued low concentrations of ethene were likely not indicative of continued dhc activity but instead resulted from the aqueous gas equilibration discussed in section 3 2 these observations are consistent with the results of qpcr analysis of aqueous port samples which demonstrated a steep decline of dhc 16s rrna gene and rdase gene abundances in column bi35 following heating from 43 c figure 2f to 74 c fig 2g this decline is illustrated in port 3 samples wherein the dhc 16s rrna gene abundance decreased from 5 5 2 1 107 to 3 7 0 3 105 gene copies ml between 126 and 176 pvs fig 2f and g these results demonstrate that dhc retains metabolic activity at higher temperatures 35 43 c in continuous flow systems than previously reported for batch systems fletcher et al 2011 löffler et al 2013 caution is warranted however as even slight i e 1 3 c exceedance of the operational temperature range may cause rapid cessation of dhc activity 3 4 impacts of temperature on dehalococcoides strains results of the qpcr analyses performed on aqueous port samples fig 1b g 2b g were consistent with dechlorination activity observed in columns ai15 and bi35 for example aqueous samples collected from port 3 nearest to effluent of the cooled column ai15 at 18 pvs post bioaugmentation contained 2 5 0 3 105 dhc 16s rrna gene copies ml fig 1b compared to 7 1 0 9 106 gene copies ml fig 2b in corresponding samples collected from the heated column bi35 furthermore although dhc 16s rrna gene abundance continued to increase in both columns from 18 to 47 pvs the average abundance over ports 1 3 increased only 3 fold in column ai15 fig 1b and c compared to a 12 fold increase in column bi35 fig 2b and c following heating of column ai15 from 15 to 35 c fig 1a 52 61 pvs dhc 16s rrna gene abundance increased further reaching a maximum of 5 0 0 2 107 gene copies ml by the end of the experiment this dhc growth represents a 230 fold overall increase fig 1b g and demonstrates the relationship between dhc 16s rrna gene abundance and system temperature the column data also indicate that individual dhc strains within the same culture i e consortium kb 1 respond differently to temperature changes as noted previously dhc strains possessing the vcra gene accounted for more than 99 of dhc in the inoculum this predominance of vcra over bvca was maintained throughout the entire 15 c phase of column ai15 and the beginning of the 35 c phase fig 1b d however vcra gene abundance remained static or declined during heating from 15 c 9 2 3 1 104 1 1 0 5 106 copies ml to 35 c 1 1 0 0 105 4 2 0 2 105 copies ml despite increases in dhc 16s rrna gene abundance at every sampling port between 47 and 92 pvs fig 1c e abundance of the bvca gene increased from 2 8 0 9 103 1 3 0 2 104 copies ml to 2 6 0 4 105 4 2 0 9 105 copies ml during this period indicating that growth of a dhc strain carrying bvca was positively impacted by the same temperature increase that limited growth of dhc strains harboring the vcra gene interestingly effluent ethene concentration in column ai15 exceeded vc concentration fig 1a 121 pvs only after bvca gene abundance surpassed that of the vcra gene fig 1f over the remainder of the experiment vcra gene abundance in column ai15 slowly began to increase but still lagged behind bvca gene abundance by an order of magnitude or greater fig 1f and g these strain specific responses were also observed in column bi35 ethene became the primary 50 mol degradation product fig 2b 73 pvs after bvca gene abundance exceeded vcra gene abundance fig 2c and d and bvca gene abundance averaged over ports 1 3 increased 3 fold during the 35 to 43 c temperature increase fig 2a 95 113 pvs while average vcra abundance remained unchanged fig 2e and f this apparent correlation between increased bvca gene abundance and ethene production at elevated temperatures is consistent with data obtained at the field scale macbeth et al 2012 these findings support the mounting volume of evidence demonstrating that despite coding for enzymes with seemingly identical function i e cis dce and vc reduction dhc strains carrying vcra versus bvca genes are not equivalent in terms of in situ dechlorination performance under different environmental conditions behrens et al 2008 heavner et al 2018 van der zaan et al 2010 yan et al 2015 yang et al 2017a 2017b the recognition that functionally equivalent i e cis dce to ethene dechlorinating dhc strains respond differently to environmental parameters is relevant and suggests that further optimization of bioaugmentation consortia for site specific treatment is possible destructive sampling and subsequent qpcr analysis revealed that 95 98 of dhc 16s rrna gene copies in column ai15 35 c at experiment conclusion were associated with the solid phase fig 4 a this finding is generally consistent with results of a previous study quantifying solid phase attachment rates in a room temperature 21 c federal fine ottawa sand column wherein 73 89 of dhc cells were attached to the solid phase at the conclusion of the experiment cápiro et al 2014 in the same study a positive relationship was identified between extent of cellular attachment and dechlorination activity greater extents of cellular attachment 95 98 and dechlorination in column ai15 compared to the room temperature study support this relationship and allude to a potentially complex link between system temperature cellular attachment and dechlorination activity furthermore results of the column ai15 qpcr analysis suggest that extent of dhc attachment at 35 c may be strain specific dhc strains possessing the bvca gene averaged over ports 1 3 were less likely to attach to the solid phase 87 18 attachment than strains possessing the vcra gene 94 9 attachment given the importance of dhc 16s rrna and rdase genes in assessing likely indicators of ethene formation e g aqueous dhc 16s rrna abundance 0 05 of total bacteria 103 gene copies ml vcra bvca abundance further study is warranted to ensure the continued accurate interpretation of these biomarkers if elevated temperatures result in greater dhc attachment and activity for instance then ethene formation may remain likely despite a lower abundance of dhc cells in the aqueous phase dhc 16s rrna and rdase gene abundances were low in solid phase samples collected 3 15 cm from the influent of column bi35 fig 4b which was held at 74 c during the final stage of the experiment the maximum total dhc abundance was only 1 1 0 2 106 gene copies g and rdase gene abundances were near or below the 1 0 104 gene copies g detection limit for solid phase samples solid phase abundances of dhc 16s rrna genes 1 2 0 3 107 gene copies g vcra 2 9 0 9 105 gene copies g and bvca 2 7 0 6 105 gene copies g at the column bi35 inlet remained elevated however the lack of vc and ethene in port samples collected at the end of the experiment fig s2b indicated that these remaining cells were inactive and likely trapped within immobile pore spaces that developed during formation of the gas phase 4 conclusions for more than a decade the coupling of istt with mrd has been proposed as an attractive remedial alternative that retains beneficial aspects of each standalone technology while minimizing disadvantageous aspects such as high energy demand and prolonged cleanup time however progression to rigorous field scale application has been hindered by scarce and sometimes conflicting reports particularly with respect to the optimal and maximum temperatures at which dhc transforms cis dce to vc and ethene native microbes will respond to physical chemical in situ remediation approaches and the responses of resident microbiology must be understood to take full advantage of potential synergistic effects the findings presented here provide valuable insight to assist researchers and practitioners in the successful integration of in situ thermal and microbial treatments under continuous flow conditions most notably the demonstration of sustained dhc dechlorination activity at temperatures previously considered to be inhibitory 35 c emphasizes the critical importance of physical scale and complexity resembling that of the field with groundwater flow and porous medium of experimental systems i e batch reactors versus continuous flow columns when assessing microbial tolerance thresholds and potential the demonstration of rapid and substantial impact of increasing system temperature on the extent of cis dce to vc dechlorination will provide remediation professionals an additional tool to combat the cis dce stall that frequently occurs at contaminated sites undergoing mrd the results demonstrating that dechlorination extent was independent of the order of remedial application may provide practitioners flexibility to modify existing or underperforming standalone thermal or biological treatment systems the evidence that bvca harboring dhc strains may supersede vcra harboring strains as the key contributors to ethene production at elevated temperatures will allow for more effective monitoring of mrd performance in systems operating at elevated temperatures the identification of system temperature control as a means to induce dhc strain specific responses provides opportunities to improve bioaugmentation cultures for

19291,while cyanobacteria have been widely recognised as the most common cause of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol related taste and odour t o episodes in drinking water supplies many reported occurrences could not be attributed to these organisms the streptomyces genus of soil bacteria also includes producers of these compounds however their potential role in such occurrences is poorly understood and often disregarded on the basis that they are terrestrial rather than aquatic organisms with their detection in water samples assumed to reflect the presence of dormant spores rather than metabolically active vegetative cells using qpcr and a differential cell lysis technique for dna extraction allowing distinction of spores from vegetative cells the aim of this study was to determine the distribution abundance and potential activity of streptomyces species across a range of aquatic and marginal habitat zones in two drinking water reservoirs including exposed soil submerged sediments plant debris and emergent macrophytes at the margins marginal and offshore surface waters deep offshore waters and offshore benthic sediments marginal substrates including soil sediment and plant debris were identified as the dominant habitat zones for streptomyces concentrations up to 1 1 107 cells g 1 supporting the concept of wash in from the margins due to run off or water level rise following rainfall as the likely pathway for streptomyces induced t o in reservoirs however vegetative cells were also found to comprise a substantial proportion of streptomyces populations in the reservoir water mass itself 90 in some surface and bottom water samples suggesting the potential for these bacteria to be metabolically active in the water and therefore contribute to in situ production of t o metabolites graphical abstract image 1 keywords geosmin 2 methylisoborneol streptomyces taste and odour quantitative pcr reservoir 1 introduction earthy musty taste and odour t o episodes in drinking water supplies involving the terpenoids geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib are frequent and often unpredictable while they do not pose a public health risk elevated levels are aesthetically undesirable to consumers and can erode public confidence in the general quality and safety of the water supply as a consequence water utilities must bear the costs of advanced treatment processes to remove these chemically stable compounds cyanobacteria are the most widely recognised agents of t o production involving geosmin and 2 mib although not all occurrences can be attributed to them juttner and watson 2007 among other groups of microorganisms considered as potential contributors to t o episodes are prominent soil bacteria streptomyces evidence linking streptomyces to t o episodes is tenuous largely because their total abundances and distribution across drinking water reservoirs and the degree to which they represent a metabolically active component of aquatic microbial communities has been difficult to establish zaitlin and watson 2006 juttner and watson 2007 asquith et al 2013 numerous attempts have been made to enumerate streptomyces using culture dependent methods and establish correlations with concentrations of geosmin and 2 mib with limited success weete et al 1977 jensen et al 1994 sugiura and nakano 2000 despite the general lack of solid evidence in support of streptomyces as primary causative organisms there is nonetheless a reasonable theoretical basis for their implication as contributors to the presence of geosmin and 2 mib in drinking water reservoirs being saprophytic bacteria streptomyces are abundant and widely distributed in soils goodfellow and williams 1983 and it has been long held that they are strictly terrestrial bacteria cross 1981 the existence of aquatic streptomyces has been largely disputed and detections of these bacteria in water are often considered an artefact of wash in of surrounding terrestrial substrates and spore survival johnston and cross 1976 cross 1981 it has been suggested that their primary mechanism of contributing to t o events would be through their growth and odour production in the marginal soils sediments and plant material adjacent to reservoirs as streptomyces are obligate aerobes their growth and production of t o metabolites requires exposure to adequate levels of oxygen which would be favoured during times of water level recession when marginal substrates such as soil sediment and plant debris become exposed wood et al 1983 these sites could then represent a significant source of streptomyces and it is therefore plausible that following rainfall events these bacteria entrained with their odorous metabolites would be washed into reservoirs the findings of several studies support this concept as a potential mechanism by which streptomyces might contribute to t o in aquatic systems jensen et al 1994 lanciotti et al 2003 zaitlin et al 2003a 2003b to further investigate the capacity for in situ geosmin and 2 mib production by streptomyces an analytical ability was required to distinguish between vegetative active cells and metabolically dormant spores present in samples as colonies can originate from either mycelial cells or spores this distinction between growing and dormant forms in total streptomyces population estimates is not readily achievable using traditional culture based techniques such as growth on selective agar media this problem can be overcome by appropriate application of molecular methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish or quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr fish has been used to determine activity levels of filamentous actinobacteria in aquatic environments klausen et al 2005 nielsen et al 2006 however these studies were limited by the non specificity of the probes for streptomyces species while qpcr has been successfully used to specifically measure total streptomyces abundance in a number of drinking water reservoirs lylloff et al 2012 jørgensen et al 2016 and in soil schlatter et al 2010 relative abundances of spores and vegetative cells were not established in these studies this study employed a spatial and temporal sampling program at two drinking water reservoirs on the east coast of australia to determine the distribution and abundance of streptomyces in various reservoir substrates and habitat zones during periods of both high and low rainfall frequency both reservoirs have a long history of sporadic geosmin and 2 mib related t o episodes at these sites elevated concentrations of geosmin have been linked to blooms of the cyanobacterial genus dolichospermum formerly anabaena in many but not all instances while the biological source of 2 mib in the reservoirs remains unidentified cole and williams 2011 streptomyces have been suspected to be a potential cause of t o events that could not be attributed to cyanobacteria the reservoirs were considered ideal sites for this research as they are spatially diverse aquatic systems with a number of potentially suitable habitats to harbour streptomyces populations to differentiate between vegetative cells and spores two cell lysis procedures were adapted from previous methods for the extraction of environmental dna to exploit the differential resistance of streptomyces vegetative cells and spores to rupturing daza et al 1989 cresswell et al 1991 filippova et al 2005 mincer et al 2005 this enabled ready differentiation between and qpcr quantitation of streptomyces dna extracted from vegetative cells as opposed to spores allowing evaluation of both the potential of streptomyces as causative agents of t o events in reservoirs via wash in from terrestrial margins and the degree to which they might exist as metabolically active components of aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and collection two freshwater storage facilities supplying drinking water to the lower hunter river region of nsw australia were selected for the study grahamstown reservoir the primary drinking water supply for the region is shallower average depth 9 m with a larger surface area 28 km2 and storage capacity 182 305 ml in contrast chichester reservoir is deeper maximum depth 37 m with a smaller surface area 1 8 km2 and storage capacity 18 356 ml the majority of chichester reservoir s 199 km2 catchment area is comprised of forest whereas grahamstown reservoir s catchment 115 km2 is largely impacted by rural or urban land use cole and williams 2011 two sampling events were carried out at each reservoir to investigate differences in streptomyces abundance and activity between wet and dry conditions the first occurred when the reservoirs were at 100 storage capacity after a prolonged period of rain feb 12 and april 23 2013 for grahamstown and chichester reservoir respectively and again after an extensive dry period nov 9 and oct 1 2013 respectively where lowering of the water level had exposed the soil and sediments at the margins of the reservoirs the sampling protocol was designed to examine a wide variety of substrates water soil sediment and plant material which have been identified in the literature as possible growth sites of streptomyces and where there is potential for t o production to originate table 1 provides details of the samples collected including macrophyte species there were two sampling locations within the reservoirs marginal sampling sites were those at the edge of the reservoirs where the effects of water level fluctuations could be investigated the open water sampling locations were offshore sites located in the mid sections of the reservoirs at marginal locations surficial top 5 cm soil and sediment samples were collected and placed in 500 ml screw capped sterile cylindrical polycarbonate sample jars bacto laboratories pty ltd where present plant debris and emergent macrophytes were also collected marginal water samples were collected within a 1 m distance from the exposed bank at the offshore sampling sites surface water samples were collected from a depth of 0 5 m and bottom water samples were obtained with a van dorn sampling device less than 1 m above the sediment water samples were collected in duplicate and stored in 600 ml sterile bacteriological bottles bacto laboratories pty ltd a grab sampler was used to collect bottom sediments at each of the open water locations samples were transported back to the laboratory within 4 h of collection stored at 4 c and processed within 48 h as the abundance of streptomyces was expressed on a per dry weight basis of solid sample subsamples were used to determine the moisture content gravimetrically by freeze drying to constant weight 2 2 extraction of dna from environmental samples prior to dna extraction microorganisms in the water samples were concentrated by filtration 250 ml sample volume onto 0 45 μm 47 mm diameter sterile polycarbonate membranes millipore these filters and the plant material samples 250 mg were aseptically cut into small pieces 1 cm2 for dna extraction for total dna extraction from both spores and vegetative cells the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc was used as per the manufacturer s protocol with the following modification to ensure effective lysis of spores after addition of samples to the bead beating tubes containing lysis reagents tubes were briefly vortexed then incubated at 70 c for 1 h the effectiveness of this commercial kit in isolating high yields and pure bacterial and eukaryotic dna from a variety of soil types and from streptomyces specifically has been demonstrated cotarlet et al 2010 schlatter et al 2010 dna extraction from all samples including water solid substrates 250 mg and plant material was performed in duplicate a lysis method to extract environmental dna from vegetative cells using conditions determined not to lyse streptomyces spores was adapted from previous methods daza et al 1989 cresswell et al 1991 filippova et al 2005 mincer et al 2005 the combination of conditions reported in the literature as being ineffective in lysing spores including enzymatic treatment using lysozyme chemical treatment using sds and heat treatment were applied in duplicate 250 mg of solid substrate samples soil sediment and plant material or filter pieces containing filtered water samples 250 ml were placed in 2 ml polyethylene tubes and suspended in te buffer 450 μl containing lysozyme sigma aldrich at a concentration of 1 mg ml 1 followed by incubation at 37 c for 1 h sds sigma aldrich was added at a concentration of 1 5 w v and samples were vortexed briefly and further incubated for 1 h at 55 c tubes were then centrifuged 10 000 g 1 min and the supernatant containing crude dna was transferred to clean 2 ml polyethylene tubes for purification following the powersoil dna isolation kit purification protocol details of experiments conducted to confirm that the enzymatic chemical heat cell lysis method was ineffective at rupturing streptomyces spores have been included in the supplementary material fig s1 2 3 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr protocol detection and quantification of streptomyces in collected samples was achieved using genus specific primers targeting the 16s rrna gene generating an amplicon of 99 bp table 2 as designed by suutari et al 2001 quantitative pcr qpcr was carried out using a hot start pcr reaction master mix faststart essential dna green master 2 conc roche diagnostics australia pty ltd containing faststarttaq dna polymerase reaction buffer dntps sybr green i dye and mgcl2 each qpcr reaction was performed with 5 μl of the master mix 0 2 μl dimethyl sulfoxide sigma aldrich 0 1 μl of each forward and reverse primer from 25 μm working solutions 0 25 μm 2 5 μl template dna and 2 1 μl of pcr grade water to bring the reaction volume to 10 μl the amplification conditions for streptomyces specific 16s rrna targeting primers were as follows pre incubation at 95 c for 600s followed by 45 cycles at 95 c for 15s denaturation 64 c for 15s annealing and 72 c for 15s extension duplicate dna extractions were performed for each sample and qpcr reactions for each extract were performed in triplicate providing six determinations per sample for measuring streptomyces abundance negative controls containing pcr grade water rather than template dna were included for each qpcr experiment in addition to positive controls containing s coelicolor a3 2 dna reactions were performed in 96 well pcr plates using the lightcycler 96 real time pcr system roche diagnostics australia pty ltd a post pcr dissociation melting curve analysis was performed at the end of qpcr runs to determine the melting temperature tm of the pcr product produced for the primer pair and thus to confirm that the fluorescent signal was generated from the target amplicon the melting program consisted of incubation at 95 c for 10s followed by 65 c for 60s with continuous heating at 0 2 c s 1 to 97 c finally the pcr products were cooled to 37 c at 2 2 c s 1 the tm value of the single peak was identified to be 84 c only samples displaying a single peak aligning with this temperature in the melting curve analysis were considered positive results the specificity of the qpcr assay for detecting the target gene was verified by conventional pcr using dna isolated from s coelicolor a3 2 atcc 471 and s antibioticus str0 a photograph of the amplification products separated by gel electrophoresis is contained in the supplementary material fig s2 the primer blast tool also confirmed the specificity of the primers for streptomyces based on sequences available in the genbank database dna isolated from heavily sporulating cultures of s coelicolor a3 2 and s antibioticus stro grown on starch casein agar sca were used as standards for the qpcr assay dna was extracted from 200 μl of the spore suspensions as described previously and ten fold serial dilutions 100 to 10 6 in pcr grade water of the purified extracts were analysed using the qpcr assay to determine cycle threshold values ct the density of the streptomyces spores in the suspensions prepared for dna extraction was determined by diluting and plating the suspensions on sca followed by incubation for 7 days at 28 c and enumeration of colony forming units cfu with the assumption that each spore produced a single colony densities of spores were related to the ct values obtained through the qpcr reactions of diluted spore dna and were used to determine calibration curves supplementary material fig s3 the measured abundance of the target sequences in environmental dna determined by the ct value was presented as an average of values calculated from both regression equations densities of cells were expressed on a per dry weight basis for solid samples cells g 1 and in cells l 1 for water samples 2 4 data analysis all qpcr data on streptomyces abundance were log transformed t tests were used to assess differences between wet and dry conditions in relation to the abundance of streptomyces 16s rrna in each environmental sample one way analysis of variance anova tests were performed to examine significant differences in the abundance of streptomyces detected between environmental samples obtained during the same sampling events for all analyses the probability threshold for significant difference was set at p 0 05 statistical analyses were carried out using jmp version 7 0 3 results 3 1 streptomyces abundance and activity in water samples vegetative cells of streptomyces were detected in all water samples where cell numbers were higher in samples collected during wet conditions the differential between wet and dry numbers of streptomyces were most obvious for those collected at the bottom and surface locations for chichester reservoir fig 1 but were markedly different for wet dry conditions at the marginal zones in grahamstown reservoir fig 2 streptomyces population densities in water samples collected during both wet and dry conditions figs 1 and 2 ranged from a maximum in grahamstown reservoir of 85 104 cells l 1 central bottom water to a minimum of 0 18 104 cells l western marginal water in chichester reservoir the greatest density was found to be 29 104 cells l 1 south marginal water compared to the lowest 0 27 104 cells l 1 south bottom water the marginal water samples generally contained significantly greater streptomyces densities compared to water collected from the offshore locations in chichester reservoir although abundance in the north surface water during the wet sampling period was comparable with that found in marginal waters at grahamstown reservoir by comparison the observed abundance of streptomyces in open water samples surface and bottom was typically similar or greater than that detected in marginal water samples for both wet and dry sampling periods results from all locations for each reservoir were averaged to provide cell concentrations during the wet sampling period following rainfall events for comparison with those collected from the same locations during the extended dry period overall mean streptomyces cell densities detected in water samples during the wet sampling period for chichester and grahamstown reservoirs were 18 104 cells l 1 and 33 104 cells l 1 respectively compared with corresponding means for the dry period of 2 2 104 cells l 1 and 1 3 104 cells l 1 these evaluations indicated an 8 fold increase in cell numbers following rain in the chichester reservoir and a 25 fold increase in the grahamstown reservoir in the chichester water samples the proportion of vegetative cells was greater during wet conditions with an overall mean of 82 varying from 36 north surface water to 100 in some samples south marginal and bottom water samples from both offshore locations fig 1 during dry conditions vegetative cells were still the dominant morphological form present in streptomyces populations and the overall average of 60 was not significantly different to wet conditions the lowest and maximal vegetative cell proportions were 25 north surface water and 81 south bottom water respectively these findings differed greatly to grahamstown water samples during wet conditions the proportion of vegetative cells was low comprising 10 overall mean 2 of total streptomyces abundance whereas samples collected during dry conditions contained a much greater vegetative cell proportion ranging from 13 western marginal water to 94 south bottom water with an overall average proportion of 54 fig 2 3 2 streptomyces abundance and activity in solid environmental substrates the abundance of streptomyces in the soils and sediments at the margins of both reservoirs as well as the bottom sediment collected at the offshore sampling locations were generally higher than those levels measured in the corresponding water samples figs 3 and 4 the observed abundances of streptomyces from the bottom sediment samples were usually found to be lower compared to those in marginal soil and sediments particularly during the dry sampling period the overall mean streptomyces abundance in chichester bottom sediment was found to be 0 85 105 cells g 1 range 0 5 1 3 105 cells g 1 in comparison marginal soil and sediment populations were up to 10 and 100 fold greater with the overall mean population density being 19 105 cells g 1 range 0 2 109 105 cells g 1 streptomyces populations in grahamstown marginal soils and sediments were also greater compared to bottom sediments with overall mean abundances of 3 4 105 cells g 1 range 0 8 20 105 cells g 1 and 0 4 105 cells g 1 range 0 08 1 3 105 cells g 1 respectively streptomyces densities in soils and sediments at the margins of the reservoirs were found to change between wet and dry conditions at chichester all dry period marginal soil and sediment samples contained significantly greater abundances average 25 105 cellsg 1 than the corresponding wet period samples 1 2 105 cells g 1 at grahamstown the mean density of streptomyces during dry conditions 4 4 105 cells g 1 exceeded that obtained in wet conditions 2 4 105 cells g 1 although the difference was not statistically significant no significant changes in streptomyces densities were detected in bottom samples from chichester between sampling events bottom sediments from grahamstown north and central showed some significant variation between wet and dry conditions but the disparities were smaller compared to marginal soils and sediment and no significant difference was observed between the overall mean bottom sediment streptomyces densities between dry and wet conditions the proportion of vegetative cells remained relatively constant between wet and dry conditions in chichester marginal soil and sediment samples overall mean values of 40 and 43 respectively but varied between samples ranging from 13 north sediment to 84 north soil fig 3 bottom sediment samples contained a lower proportion of vegetative cells 2 27 which were slightly higher during the wet conditions overall mean of 18 range 9 27 compared to dry conditions overall mean of 3 5 range 2 5 in contrast the proportion of vegetative cells was not found to vary between wet and dry sampling events for bottom sediment samples from grahamstown ranging from 5 to 19 and 3 17 respectively fig 4 the overall average proportion of vegetative cells detected in marginal soil and sediment samples in grahamstown during wet conditions 5 range 1 27 was found to be lower compared to dry conditions 24 range 9 100 complex mixtures of plant debris collected from the margins of chichester reservoir were found to support large streptomyces populations comparable to those detected in marginal soil and sediment with an overall average abundance of 4 2 105 cells g 1 fig 3 significantly greater numbers were detected in debris during dry conditions when these substrates were exposed compared to wet conditions densities were 5 5 fold and 35 fold greater during dry conditions in south and north marginal debris samples respectively the proportion of vegetative cells was also greater during dry conditions changing from 40 to 79 and from 27 to 76 for south and north marginal debris respectively a variety of emergent macrophyte samples were also obtained from marginal sampling sites to examine streptomyces populations in both reservoirs macrophytes supported comparatively lower densities being several orders of magnitude lower than most other solid substrate samples 4 discussion the primary objective of this study was to assess the distribution abundance and activity of streptomyces spp across a diverse range of reservoir habitats in consideration of their potential contribution to the occurrence of geosmin and 2 mib related t o in drinking water storages while the results confirmed the validity of wash in from marginal terrestrial habitats as the likely mechanism for potential streptomyces generated t o in reservoirs the data also revealed a previously unconfirmed potential for streptomyces activity and in situ production of t o compounds in the water column the most conclusive finding in support of the wash in scenario was the significantly elevated abundance of streptomyces in the water during the wet sampling periods relative to the dry periods evident in all water samples from both reservoirs of perhaps greater significance however was the predominance of vegetative cells observed in these samples debate surrounding the extent to which streptomyces washed in from the margins of water bodies continue to be active in the water column and therefore capable of in situ geosmin and 2 mib production remains unresolved with several authors having contended that these bacteria occur in water only as metabolically inactive spores johnston and cross 1976 cross 1981 jensen et al 1994 zaitlin et al 2003b the results obtained in this study support the proposition that they may also be numerous and active components of microbial communities in the water mass albeit to a much lesser extent than in terrestrial environments despite lower population densities in the water mass during dry conditions streptomyces were largely present as vegetative cells considering that in the absence of rainfall the wash in of streptomyces from surrounding terrestrial environments would be limited this suggests that they continue to remain metabolically active in the water mass as opposed to existing solely as inactive spores it must be emphasised that detection of vegetative cells in these samples cannot provide absolute certainty that these bacteria were growing in situ due to the possibility of the wash in of vegetative forms from surrounding terrestrial environments resuspension from bottom sediments or their existence as non viable mycelial fragments however the high proportion of vegetative cells found in the water mass during the dry weather sampling period provides strong evidence to suggest that they were metabolically active components of the water mass this finding is significant as it has been widely surmised that dormant spores represent the dominant form of this genus in the water mass of aquatic environments wood et al 1983 zaitlin and watson 2006 other findings consistent with the concept of a streptomyces influence on t o levels in the water originating from marginal sources included significantly higher overall abundance in marginal substrates relative to offshore benthic sediments in marginal substrates during dry relative to wet weather periods in the water column during wet relative to dry periods and substantially greater proportion of vegetative cells in marginal soils and plant debris relative to benthic sediments especially during dry periods these results are all in accordance with past speculation regarding the possible role of streptomyces in the generation of t o stemming from their prolific abundance and known capacity for production of geosmin and 2 mib in soil their growth and activity in substrates at the margins of water bodies has been considered to increase dramatically when these substrates are periodically exposed during water level recessions wood et al 1983 enhanced geosmin production by streptomyces has also been demonstrated when increased concentrations of atmospheric oxygen are available dionigi and ingram 1994 schrader and blevins 1999 suggesting that extended dry periods would facilitate ideal conditions for expansive growth of aerobic streptomyces and accumulation of t o compounds at the margins of aquatic systems the terrestrial prominence and aerobic growth habit of streptomyces has been the basis of assumptions that in offshore deeper water benthic sediments they would exist predominantly as dormant spores due to low oxygen availability johnston and cross 1976 willoughby 1976 while oxygen levels were not measured the offshore sediments collected from the two reservoirs of this study mainly fine mud with a medium to heavy clay texture were found to exhibit the characteristic hydrogen sulphide odour indicative of anaerobic conditions inimical to the growth of streptomyces accordingly overall abundances detected in these sediments were comparatively low on average one to two orders of magnitude less than those of marginal soils and sediments with the majority detected as spores rather than vegetative cells however several previous reports have suggested that such habitats may still be significant sources of t o derived from streptomyces issatchenko and egorova 1944 willoughby 1976 with one study reporting production of geosmin and 2 mib by two streptomyces spp under anoxic conditions suggesting utilisation of nitrate rather than oxygen as an electron acceptor for respiration guttman and van rijn 2008 in this context it should be recognised that in the current study although in minority relative to spores vegetative cell densities of up to 104 g 1 were observed in the offshore sediments nonetheless total abundances and proportionate vegetative cell densities were substantially greater overall in soils and plant debris in the onshore margins than in the offshore sediments this was especially evident during the dry sampling period consistent with expected elevations in streptomyces growth and activity under these conditions and a potential terrestrial origin for streptomyces induced aquatic t o although the data for both reservoirs was generally consistent with the wash in hypothesis several differences between the two systems were apparent firstly total streptomyces abundances in marginal sediments and plant debris during the dry period were approximately 10 fold greater at chichester than at grahamstown a difference of similar magnitude existed between the dry and wet period samples from chichester while at grahamstown the distinction between the wet and dry sampling periods was less evident in contrast the overall average proportion of vegetative cells in marginal soils and sediments at grahamstown was significantly higher during dry conditions compared to wet conditions but at chichester the spore to active cell ratio did not vary greatly the precise reason for these distinctions between the two systems is not clear but may reflect differences in the structure or nutrient composition of the soils and sediment inputs riparian vegetation or bank gradient and aspect and the potential importance of these factors to the occurrence of t o in surface water storages plant communities at the margins of rivers lakes and reservoirs have also been suggested as possible sites of streptomyces growth and odour production silvey and roach 1975 however investigation of the relative significance of these substrates has been limited in a previous study at grahamstown reservoir streptomyces were isolated from sediments using selective growth media but could not be recovered from marginal macrophytes using this method hobson et al 2010 the data presented here indicate a high vegetative cell to spore ratio on marginal macrophyte surfaces although the comparatively low abundances relative to other substrates suggest that these populations probably represent a less significant source of t o studies using molecular techniques including fish fluorescence in situ hybridisation and fish with catalysed reporter deposition card targeting rrna molecules indicative of metabolically active cells have demonstrated that active filamentous actinobacteria assumed to be streptomyces are ubiquitous and can be important components of freshwater microbial communities klausen et al 2005 nielsen et al 2006 the key limitation of these assays has been lack of specificity for streptomyces the main geosmin and 2 mib producing genus of actinobacteria the presumptive densities of streptomyces 10 2000 106 cells l 1 in these studies far exceed the range of densities of this genus in water samples 1829 cells l 1 to 846 079 cells l 1 determined in this study this suggests that the fish based studies have perhaps overestimated the populations of potentially active streptomyces which are certainly not the only filamentous and numerous genus of actinobacteria streptomyces population densities detected in the water mass align more closely with those reported by lylloff et al 2012 and jørgensen et al 2016 who used a qpcr assay targeting streptomyces 23s rrna sequences to quantify this genus in water samples obtained from a river weir and reservoirs in subtropical australia lylloff et al 2012 found streptomyces densities varied from 0 23 to 45 103 cells l 1 and jørgensen et al 2016 from 0 7 to 775 103 cells l 1 and in both studies densities were greatest in bottom water samples several other reports have emerged in recent years which utilised qpcr to determine streptomyces cell densities in aquatic systems in relation to t o via detection of genes related to geosmin biosynthesis auffret et al 2011 kutovaya and watson 2014 the significance of streptomyces as potential contributors to geosmin and 2 mib episodes in reservoirs can be tentatively estimated from known production rates in laboratory cultures lylloff et al 2012 and cell specific production rates by selected streptomyces strains isolated from aquatic environments have been determined to be in the range of 0 1 30 ag cell 1h 1 for both compounds klausen et al 2005 based on these theoretical production rates and densities of vegetative potentially active streptomyces cells detected in water samples the largest concentration produced over the course of a week would be 147 mg l 1 thus population densities in water samples could account for earthy musty t o events based on vegetative cell densities marginal substrates could produce up to 4639 mg g 1 week 1 thus representing a more significant source of t o compounds which could enter water via wash in however such theoretical estimates do not take into consideration either loss of these compounds through processes such as volatilisation and biodegradation or the fact that not all streptomyces spp produce geosmin and or 2 mib juttner and watson 2007 5 conclusions the findings represent the first qpcr quantification of streptomyces populations in drinking water reservoir habitats and confirm the potential role of these bacteria in t o events the key implications arising from this study are that potential streptomyces activity in aquatic systems can be effectively assessed using a novel qpcr method involving differential extraction of dna from spores and vegetative cells significant rainfall events following extended dry periods in which water levels have receded represent conditions for elevated risk of streptomyces induced t o episodes in drinking water reservoirs streptomyces remain metabolically active in the water mass suggesting their further potential for in situ t o production in aquatic systems monitoring of streptomyces abundances particularly during the aforementioned conditions of elevated risk may inform strategic water quality management of drinking water storage systems experiencing recurring t o problems controlled investigation of the t o generating capacity of the individual streptomyces species detected in these samples under simulated environmental conditions would undoubtedly provide further

19291,while cyanobacteria have been widely recognised as the most common cause of geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol related taste and odour t o episodes in drinking water supplies many reported occurrences could not be attributed to these organisms the streptomyces genus of soil bacteria also includes producers of these compounds however their potential role in such occurrences is poorly understood and often disregarded on the basis that they are terrestrial rather than aquatic organisms with their detection in water samples assumed to reflect the presence of dormant spores rather than metabolically active vegetative cells using qpcr and a differential cell lysis technique for dna extraction allowing distinction of spores from vegetative cells the aim of this study was to determine the distribution abundance and potential activity of streptomyces species across a range of aquatic and marginal habitat zones in two drinking water reservoirs including exposed soil submerged sediments plant debris and emergent macrophytes at the margins marginal and offshore surface waters deep offshore waters and offshore benthic sediments marginal substrates including soil sediment and plant debris were identified as the dominant habitat zones for streptomyces concentrations up to 1 1 107 cells g 1 supporting the concept of wash in from the margins due to run off or water level rise following rainfall as the likely pathway for streptomyces induced t o in reservoirs however vegetative cells were also found to comprise a substantial proportion of streptomyces populations in the reservoir water mass itself 90 in some surface and bottom water samples suggesting the potential for these bacteria to be metabolically active in the water and therefore contribute to in situ production of t o metabolites graphical abstract image 1 keywords geosmin 2 methylisoborneol streptomyces taste and odour quantitative pcr reservoir 1 introduction earthy musty taste and odour t o episodes in drinking water supplies involving the terpenoids geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib are frequent and often unpredictable while they do not pose a public health risk elevated levels are aesthetically undesirable to consumers and can erode public confidence in the general quality and safety of the water supply as a consequence water utilities must bear the costs of advanced treatment processes to remove these chemically stable compounds cyanobacteria are the most widely recognised agents of t o production involving geosmin and 2 mib although not all occurrences can be attributed to them juttner and watson 2007 among other groups of microorganisms considered as potential contributors to t o episodes are prominent soil bacteria streptomyces evidence linking streptomyces to t o episodes is tenuous largely because their total abundances and distribution across drinking water reservoirs and the degree to which they represent a metabolically active component of aquatic microbial communities has been difficult to establish zaitlin and watson 2006 juttner and watson 2007 asquith et al 2013 numerous attempts have been made to enumerate streptomyces using culture dependent methods and establish correlations with concentrations of geosmin and 2 mib with limited success weete et al 1977 jensen et al 1994 sugiura and nakano 2000 despite the general lack of solid evidence in support of streptomyces as primary causative organisms there is nonetheless a reasonable theoretical basis for their implication as contributors to the presence of geosmin and 2 mib in drinking water reservoirs being saprophytic bacteria streptomyces are abundant and widely distributed in soils goodfellow and williams 1983 and it has been long held that they are strictly terrestrial bacteria cross 1981 the existence of aquatic streptomyces has been largely disputed and detections of these bacteria in water are often considered an artefact of wash in of surrounding terrestrial substrates and spore survival johnston and cross 1976 cross 1981 it has been suggested that their primary mechanism of contributing to t o events would be through their growth and odour production in the marginal soils sediments and plant material adjacent to reservoirs as streptomyces are obligate aerobes their growth and production of t o metabolites requires exposure to adequate levels of oxygen which would be favoured during times of water level recession when marginal substrates such as soil sediment and plant debris become exposed wood et al 1983 these sites could then represent a significant source of streptomyces and it is therefore plausible that following rainfall events these bacteria entrained with their odorous metabolites would be washed into reservoirs the findings of several studies support this concept as a potential mechanism by which streptomyces might contribute to t o in aquatic systems jensen et al 1994 lanciotti et al 2003 zaitlin et al 2003a 2003b to further investigate the capacity for in situ geosmin and 2 mib production by streptomyces an analytical ability was required to distinguish between vegetative active cells and metabolically dormant spores present in samples as colonies can originate from either mycelial cells or spores this distinction between growing and dormant forms in total streptomyces population estimates is not readily achievable using traditional culture based techniques such as growth on selective agar media this problem can be overcome by appropriate application of molecular methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish or quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr fish has been used to determine activity levels of filamentous actinobacteria in aquatic environments klausen et al 2005 nielsen et al 2006 however these studies were limited by the non specificity of the probes for streptomyces species while qpcr has been successfully used to specifically measure total streptomyces abundance in a number of drinking water reservoirs lylloff et al 2012 jørgensen et al 2016 and in soil schlatter et al 2010 relative abundances of spores and vegetative cells were not established in these studies this study employed a spatial and temporal sampling program at two drinking water reservoirs on the east coast of australia to determine the distribution and abundance of streptomyces in various reservoir substrates and habitat zones during periods of both high and low rainfall frequency both reservoirs have a long history of sporadic geosmin and 2 mib related t o episodes at these sites elevated concentrations of geosmin have been linked to blooms of the cyanobacterial genus dolichospermum formerly anabaena in many but not all instances while the biological source of 2 mib in the reservoirs remains unidentified cole and williams 2011 streptomyces have been suspected to be a potential cause of t o events that could not be attributed to cyanobacteria the reservoirs were considered ideal sites for this research as they are spatially diverse aquatic systems with a number of potentially suitable habitats to harbour streptomyces populations to differentiate between vegetative cells and spores two cell lysis procedures were adapted from previous methods for the extraction of environmental dna to exploit the differential resistance of streptomyces vegetative cells and spores to rupturing daza et al 1989 cresswell et al 1991 filippova et al 2005 mincer et al 2005 this enabled ready differentiation between and qpcr quantitation of streptomyces dna extracted from vegetative cells as opposed to spores allowing evaluation of both the potential of streptomyces as causative agents of t o events in reservoirs via wash in from terrestrial margins and the degree to which they might exist as metabolically active components of aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and collection two freshwater storage facilities supplying drinking water to the lower hunter river region of nsw australia were selected for the study grahamstown reservoir the primary drinking water supply for the region is shallower average depth 9 m with a larger surface area 28 km2 and storage capacity 182 305 ml in contrast chichester reservoir is deeper maximum depth 37 m with a smaller surface area 1 8 km2 and storage capacity 18 356 ml the majority of chichester reservoir s 199 km2 catchment area is comprised of forest whereas grahamstown reservoir s catchment 115 km2 is largely impacted by rural or urban land use cole and williams 2011 two sampling events were carried out at each reservoir to investigate differences in streptomyces abundance and activity between wet and dry conditions the first occurred when the reservoirs were at 100 storage capacity after a prolonged period of rain feb 12 and april 23 2013 for grahamstown and chichester reservoir respectively and again after an extensive dry period nov 9 and oct 1 2013 respectively where lowering of the water level had exposed the soil and sediments at the margins of the reservoirs the sampling protocol was designed to examine a wide variety of substrates water soil sediment and plant material which have been identified in the literature as possible growth sites of streptomyces and where there is potential for t o production to originate table 1 provides details of the samples collected including macrophyte species there were two sampling locations within the reservoirs marginal sampling sites were those at the edge of the reservoirs where the effects of water level fluctuations could be investigated the open water sampling locations were offshore sites located in the mid sections of the reservoirs at marginal locations surficial top 5 cm soil and sediment samples were collected and placed in 500 ml screw capped sterile cylindrical polycarbonate sample jars bacto laboratories pty ltd where present plant debris and emergent macrophytes were also collected marginal water samples were collected within a 1 m distance from the exposed bank at the offshore sampling sites surface water samples were collected from a depth of 0 5 m and bottom water samples were obtained with a van dorn sampling device less than 1 m above the sediment water samples were collected in duplicate and stored in 600 ml sterile bacteriological bottles bacto laboratories pty ltd a grab sampler was used to collect bottom sediments at each of the open water locations samples were transported back to the laboratory within 4 h of collection stored at 4 c and processed within 48 h as the abundance of streptomyces was expressed on a per dry weight basis of solid sample subsamples were used to determine the moisture content gravimetrically by freeze drying to constant weight 2 2 extraction of dna from environmental samples prior to dna extraction microorganisms in the water samples were concentrated by filtration 250 ml sample volume onto 0 45 μm 47 mm diameter sterile polycarbonate membranes millipore these filters and the plant material samples 250 mg were aseptically cut into small pieces 1 cm2 for dna extraction for total dna extraction from both spores and vegetative cells the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc was used as per the manufacturer s protocol with the following modification to ensure effective lysis of spores after addition of samples to the bead beating tubes containing lysis reagents tubes were briefly vortexed then incubated at 70 c for 1 h the effectiveness of this commercial kit in isolating high yields and pure bacterial and eukaryotic dna from a variety of soil types and from streptomyces specifically has been demonstrated cotarlet et al 2010 schlatter et al 2010 dna extraction from all samples including water solid substrates 250 mg and plant material was performed in duplicate a lysis method to extract environmental dna from vegetative cells using conditions determined not to lyse streptomyces spores was adapted from previous methods daza et al 1989 cresswell et al 1991 filippova et al 2005 mincer et al 2005 the combination of conditions reported in the literature as being ineffective in lysing spores including enzymatic treatment using lysozyme chemical treatment using sds and heat treatment were applied in duplicate 250 mg of solid substrate samples soil sediment and plant material or filter pieces containing filtered water samples 250 ml were placed in 2 ml polyethylene tubes and suspended in te buffer 450 μl containing lysozyme sigma aldrich at a concentration of 1 mg ml 1 followed by incubation at 37 c for 1 h sds sigma aldrich was added at a concentration of 1 5 w v and samples were vortexed briefly and further incubated for 1 h at 55 c tubes were then centrifuged 10 000 g 1 min and the supernatant containing crude dna was transferred to clean 2 ml polyethylene tubes for purification following the powersoil dna isolation kit purification protocol

2 3 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr protocol detection and quantification of streptomyces in collected samples was achieved using genus specific primers targeting the 16s rrna gene generating an amplicon of 99 bp table 2 as designed by suutari et al 2001 quantitative pcr qpcr was carried out using a hot start pcr reaction master mix faststart essential dna green master 2 conc roche diagnostics australia pty ltd containing faststarttaq dna polymerase reaction buffer dntps sybr green i dye and mgcl2 each qpcr reaction was performed with 5 μl of the master mix 0 2 μl dimethyl sulfoxide sigma aldrich 0 1 μl of each forward and reverse primer from 25 μm working solutions 0 25 μm 2 5 μl template dna and 2 1 μl of pcr grade water to bring the reaction volume to 10 μl the amplification conditions for streptomyces specific 16s rrna targeting primers were as follows pre incubation at 95 c for 600s followed by 45 cycles at 95 c for 15s denaturation 64 c for 15s annealing and 72 c for 15s extension duplicate dna extractions were performed for each sample and qpcr reactions for each extract were performed in triplicate providing six determinations per sample for measuring streptomyces abundance negative controls containing pcr grade water rather than template dna were included for each qpcr experiment in addition to positive controls containing s coelicolor a3 2 dna reactions were performed in 96 well pcr plates using the lightcycler 96 real time pcr system roche diagnostics australia pty ltd a post pcr dissociation melting curve analysis was performed at the end of qpcr runs to determine the melting temperature tm of the pcr product produced for the primer pair and thus to confirm that the fluorescent signal was generated from the target amplicon the melting program consisted of incubation at 95 c for 10s followed by 65 c for 60s with continuous heating at 0 2 c s 1 to 97 c finally the pcr products were cooled to 37 c at 2 2 c s 1 the tm value of the single peak was identified to be 84 c only samples displaying a single peak aligning with this temperature in the melting curve analysis were considered positive results the specificity of the qpcr assay for detecting the target gene was verified by conventional pcr using dna isolated from s coelicolor a3 2 atcc 471 and s antibioticus str0 a photograph of the amplification products separated by gel electrophoresis is contained in the supplementary material fig s2 the primer blast tool also confirmed the specificity of the primers for streptomyces based on sequences available in the genbank database dna isolated from heavily sporulating cultures of s coelicolor a3 2 and s antibioticus stro grown on starch casein agar sca were used as standards for the qpcr assay dna was extracted from 200 μl of the spore suspensions as described previously and ten fold serial dilutions 100 to 10 6 in pcr grade water of the purified extracts were analysed using the qpcr assay to determine cycle threshold values ct the density of the streptomyces spores in the suspensions prepared for dna extraction was determined by diluting and plating the suspensions on sca followed by incubation for 7 days at 28 c and enumeration of colony forming units cfu with the assumption that each spore produced a single colony densities of spores were related to the ct values obtained through the qpcr reactions of diluted spore dna and were used to determine calibration curves supplementary material fig s3 the measured abundance of the target sequences in environmental dna determined by the ct value was presented as an average of values calculated from both regression equations densities of cells were expressed on a per dry weight basis for solid samples cells g 1 and in cells l 1 for water samples 2 4 data analysis all qpcr data on streptomyces abundance were log transformed t tests were used to assess differences between wet and dry conditions in relation to the abundance of streptomyces 16s rrna in each environmental sample one way analysis of variance anova tests were performed to examine significant differences in the abundance of streptomyces detected between environmental samples obtained during the same sampling events for all analyses the probability threshold for significant difference was set at p 0 05 statistical analyses were carried out using jmp version 7 0 3 results 3 1 streptomyces abundance and activity in water samples vegetative cells of streptomyces were detected in all water samples where cell numbers were higher in samples collected during wet conditions the differential between wet and dry numbers of streptomyces were most obvious for those collected at the bottom and surface locations for chichester reservoir fig 1 but were markedly different for wet dry conditions at the marginal zones in grahamstown reservoir fig 2 streptomyces population densities in water samples collected during both wet and dry conditions figs 1 and 2 ranged from a maximum in grahamstown reservoir of 85 104 cells l 1 central bottom water to a minimum of 0 18 104 cells l western marginal water in chichester reservoir the greatest density was found to be 29 104 cells l 1 south marginal water compared to the lowest 0 27 104 cells l 1 south bottom water the marginal water samples generally contained significantly greater streptomyces densities compared to water collected from the offshore locations in chichester reservoir although abundance in the north surface water during the wet sampling period was comparable with that found in marginal waters at grahamstown reservoir by comparison the observed abundance of streptomyces in open water samples surface and bottom was typically similar or greater than that detected in marginal water samples for both wet and dry sampling periods results from all locations for each reservoir were averaged to provide cell concentrations during the wet sampling period following rainfall events for comparison with those collected from the same locations during the extended dry period overall mean streptomyces cell densities detected in water samples during the wet sampling period for chichester and grahamstown reservoirs were 18 104 cells l 1 and 33 104 cells l 1 respectively compared with corresponding means for the dry period of 2 2 104 cells l 1 and 1 3 104 cells l 1 these evaluations indicated an 8 fold increase in cell numbers following rain in the chichester reservoir and a 25 fold increase in the grahamstown reservoir in the chichester water samples the proportion of vegetative cells was greater during wet conditions with an overall mean of 82 varying from 36 north surface water to 100 in some samples south marginal and bottom water samples from both offshore locations fig 1 during dry conditions vegetative cells were still the dominant morphological form present in streptomyces populations and the overall average of 60 was not significantly different to wet conditions the lowest and maximal vegetative cell proportions were 25 north surface water and 81 south bottom water respectively these findings differed greatly to grahamstown water samples during wet conditions the proportion of vegetative cells was low comprising 10 overall mean 2 of total streptomyces abundance whereas samples collected during dry conditions contained a much greater vegetative cell proportion ranging from 13 western marginal water to 94 south bottom water with an overall average proportion of 54 fig 2 3 2 streptomyces abundance and activity in solid environmental substrates the abundance of streptomyces in the soils and sediments at the margins of both reservoirs as well as the bottom sediment collected at the offshore sampling locations were generally higher than those levels measured in the corresponding water samples figs 3 and 4 the observed abundances of streptomyces from the bottom sediment samples were usually found to be lower compared to those in marginal soil and sediments particularly during the dry sampling period the overall mean streptomyces abundance in chichester bottom sediment was found to be 0 85 105 cells g 1 range 0 5 1 3 105 cells g 1 in comparison marginal soil and sediment populations were up to 10 and 100 fold greater with the overall mean population density being 19 105 cells g 1 range 0 2 109 105 cells g 1 streptomyces populations in grahamstown marginal soils and sediments were also greater compared to bottom sediments with overall mean abundances of 3 4 105 cells g 1 range 0 8 20 105 cells g 1 and 0 4 105 cells g 1 range 0 08 1 3 105 cells g 1 respectively streptomyces densities in soils and sediments at the margins of the reservoirs were found to change between wet and dry conditions at chichester all dry period marginal soil and sediment samples contained significantly greater abundances average 25 105 cellsg 1 than the corresponding wet period samples 1 2 105 cells g 1 at grahamstown the mean density of streptomyces during dry conditions 4 4 105 cells g 1 exceeded that obtained in wet conditions 2 4 105 cells g 1 although the difference was not statistically significant no significant changes in streptomyces densities were detected in bottom samples from chichester between sampling events bottom sediments from grahamstown north and central showed some significant variation between wet and dry conditions but the disparities were smaller compared to marginal soils and sediment and no significant difference was observed between the overall mean bottom sediment streptomyces densities between dry and wet conditions the proportion of vegetative cells remained relatively constant between wet and dry conditions in chichester marginal soil and sediment samples overall mean values of 40 and 43 respectively but varied between samples ranging from 13 north sediment to 84 north soil fig 3 bottom sediment samples contained a lower proportion of vegetative cells 2 27 which were slightly higher during the wet conditions overall mean of 18 range 9 27 compared to dry conditions overall mean of 3 5 range 2 5 in contrast the proportion of vegetative cells was not found to vary between wet and dry sampling events for bottom sediment samples from grahamstown ranging from 5 to 19 and 3 17 respectively fig 4 the overall average proportion of vegetative cells detected in marginal soil and sediment samples in grahamstown during wet conditions 5 range 1 27 was found to be lower compared to dry conditions 24 range 9 100 complex mixtures of plant debris collected from the margins of chichester reservoir were found to support large streptomyces populations comparable to those detected in marginal soil and sediment with an overall average abundance of 4 2 105 cells g 1 fig 3 significantly greater numbers were detected in debris during dry conditions when these substrates were exposed compared to wet conditions densities were 5 5 fold and 35 fold greater during dry conditions in south and north marginal debris samples respectively the proportion of vegetative cells was also greater during dry conditions changing from 40 to 79 and from 27 to 76 for south and north marginal debris respectively a variety of emergent macrophyte samples were also obtained from marginal sampling sites to examine streptomyces populations in both reservoirs macrophytes supported comparatively lower densities being several orders of magnitude lower than most other solid substrate samples 4 discussion the primary objective of this study was to assess the distribution abundance and activity of streptomyces spp across a diverse range of reservoir habitats in consideration of their potential contribution to the occurrence of geosmin and 2 mib related t o in drinking water storages while the results confirmed the validity of wash in from marginal terrestrial habitats as the likely mechanism for potential streptomyces generated t o in reservoirs the data also revealed a previously unconfirmed potential for streptomyces activity and in situ production of t o compounds in the water column the most conclusive finding in support of the wash in scenario was the significantly elevated abundance of streptomyces in the water during the wet sampling periods relative to the dry periods evident in all water samples from both reservoirs of perhaps greater significance however was the predominance of vegetative cells observed in these samples debate surrounding the extent to which streptomyces washed in from the margins of water bodies continue to be active in the water column and therefore capable of in situ geosmin and 2 mib production remains unresolved with several authors having contended that these bacteria occur in water only as metabolically inactive spores johnston and cross 1976 cross 1981 jensen et al 1994 zaitlin et al 2003b the results obtained in this study support the proposition that they may also be numerous and active components of microbial communities in the water mass albeit to a much lesser extent than in terrestrial environments despite lower population densities in the water mass during dry conditions streptomyces were largely present as vegetative cells considering that in the absence of rainfall the wash in of streptomyces from surrounding terrestrial environments would be limited this suggests that they continue to remain metabolically active in the water mass as opposed to existing solely as inactive spores it must be emphasised that detection of vegetative cells in these samples cannot provide absolute certainty that these bacteria were growing in situ due to the possibility of the wash in of vegetative forms from surrounding terrestrial environments resuspension from bottom sediments or their existence as non viable mycelial fragments however the high proportion of vegetative cells found in the water mass during the dry weather sampling period provides strong evidence to suggest that they were metabolically active components of the water mass this finding is significant as it has been widely surmised that dormant spores represent the dominant form of this genus in the water mass of aquatic environments wood et al 1983 zaitlin and watson 2006 other findings consistent with the concept of a streptomyces influence on t o levels in the water originating from marginal sources included significantly higher overall abundance in marginal substrates relative to offshore benthic sediments in marginal substrates during dry relative to wet weather periods in the water column during wet relative to dry periods and substantially greater proportion of vegetative cells in marginal soils and plant debris relative to benthic sediments especially during dry periods these results are all in accordance with past speculation regarding the possible role of streptomyces in the generation of t o stemming from their prolific abundance and known capacity for production of geosmin and 2 mib in soil their growth and activity in substrates at the margins of water bodies has been considered to increase dramatically when these substrates are periodically exposed during water level recessions wood et al 1983 enhanced geosmin production by streptomyces has also been demonstrated when increased concentrations of atmospheric oxygen are available dionigi and ingram 1994 schrader and blevins 1999 suggesting that extended dry periods would facilitate ideal conditions for expansive growth of aerobic streptomyces and accumulation of t o compounds at the margins of aquatic systems the terrestrial prominence and aerobic growth habit of streptomyces has been the basis of assumptions that in offshore deeper water benthic sediments they would exist predominantly as dormant spores due to low oxygen availability johnston and cross 1976 willoughby 1976 while oxygen levels were not measured the offshore sediments collected from the two reservoirs of this study mainly fine mud with a medium to heavy clay texture were found to exhibit the characteristic hydrogen sulphide odour indicative of anaerobic conditions inimical to the growth of streptomyces accordingly overall abundances detected in these sediments were comparatively low on average one to two orders of magnitude less than those of marginal soils and sediments with the majority detected as spores rather than vegetative cells however several previous reports have suggested that such habitats may still be significant sources of t o derived from streptomyces issatchenko and egorova 1944 willoughby 1976 with one study reporting production of geosmin and 2 mib by two streptomyces spp under anoxic conditions suggesting utilisation of nitrate rather than oxygen as an electron acceptor for respiration guttman and van rijn 2008 in this context it should be recognised that in the current study although in minority relative to spores vegetative cell densities of up to 104 g 1 were observed in the offshore sediments nonetheless total abundances and proportionate vegetative cell densities were substantially greater overall in soils and plant debris in the onshore margins than in the offshore sediments this was especially evident during the dry sampling period consistent with expected elevations in streptomyces growth and activity under these conditions and a potential terrestrial origin for streptomyces induced aquatic t o although the data for both reservoirs was generally consistent with the wash in hypothesis several differences between the two systems were apparent firstly total streptomyces abundances in marginal sediments and plant debris during the dry period were approximately 10 fold greater at chichester than at grahamstown a difference of similar magnitude existed between the dry and wet period samples from chichester while at grahamstown the distinction between the wet and dry sampling periods was less evident in contrast the overall average proportion of vegetative cells in marginal soils and sediments at grahamstown was significantly higher during dry conditions compared to wet conditions but at chichester the spore to active cell ratio did not vary greatly the precise reason for these distinctions between the two systems is not clear but may reflect differences in the structure or nutrient composition of the soils and sediment inputs riparian vegetation or bank gradient and aspect and the potential importance of these factors to the occurrence of t o in surface water storages plant communities at the margins of rivers lakes and reservoirs have also been suggested as possible sites of streptomyces growth and odour production silvey and roach 1975 however investigation of the relative significance of these substrates has been limited in a previous study at grahamstown reservoir streptomyces were isolated from sediments using selective growth media but could not be recovered from marginal macrophytes using this method hobson et al 2010 the data presented here indicate a high vegetative cell to spore ratio on marginal macrophyte surfaces although the comparatively low abundances relative to other substrates suggest that these populations probably represent a less significant source of t o studies using molecular techniques including fish fluorescence in situ hybridisation and fish with catalysed reporter deposition card targeting rrna molecules indicative of metabolically active cells have demonstrated that active filamentous actinobacteria assumed to be streptomyces are ubiquitous and can be important components of freshwater microbial communities klausen et al 2005 nielsen et al 2006 the key limitation of these assays has been lack of specificity for streptomyces the main geosmin and 2 mib producing genus of actinobacteria the presumptive densities of streptomyces 10 2000 106 cells l 1 in these studies far exceed the range of densities of this genus in water samples 1829 cells l 1 to 846 079 cells l 1 determined in this study this suggests that the fish based studies have perhaps overestimated the populations of potentially active streptomyces which are certainly not the only filamentous and numerous genus of actinobacteria streptomyces population densities detected in the water mass align more closely with those reported by lylloff et al 2012 and jørgensen et al 2016 who used a qpcr assay targeting streptomyces 23s rrna sequences to quantify this genus in water samples obtained from a river weir and reservoirs in subtropical australia lylloff et al 2012 found streptomyces densities varied from 0 23 to 45 103 cells l 1 and jørgensen et al 2016 from 0 7 to 775 103 cells l 1 and in both studies densities were greatest in bottom water samples several other reports have emerged in recent years which utilised qpcr to determine streptomyces cell densities in aquatic systems in relation to t o via detection of genes related to geosmin biosynthesis auffret et al 2011 kutovaya and watson 2014 the significance of streptomyces as potential contributors to geosmin and 2 mib episodes in reservoirs can be tentatively estimated from known production rates in laboratory cultures lylloff et al 2012 and cell specific production rates by selected streptomyces strains isolated from aquatic environments have been determined to be in the range of 0 1 30 ag cell 1h 1 for both compounds klausen et al 2005 based on these theoretical production rates and densities of vegetative potentially active streptomyces cells detected in water samples the largest concentration produced over the course of a week would be 147 mg l 1 thus population densities in water samples could account for earthy musty t o events based on vegetative cell densities marginal substrates could produce up to 4639 mg g 1 week 1 thus representing a more significant source of t o compounds which could enter water via wash in however such theoretical estimates do not take into consideration either loss of these compounds through processes such as volatilisation and biodegradation or the fact that not all streptomyces spp produce geosmin and or 2 mib juttner and watson 2007 5 conclusions the findings represent the first qpcr quantification of streptomyces populations in drinking water reservoir habitats and confirm the potential role of these bacteria in t o events the key implications arising from this study are that potential streptomyces activity in aquatic systems can be effectively assessed using a novel qpcr method involving differential extraction of dna from spores and vegetative cells significant rainfall events following extended dry periods in which water levels have receded represent conditions for elevated risk of streptomyces induced t o episodes in drinking water reservoirs streptomyces remain metabolically active in the water mass suggesting their further potential for in situ t o production in aquatic systems monitoring of streptomyces abundances particularly during the aforementioned conditions of elevated risk may inform strategic water quality management of drinking water storage systems experiencing recurring t o problems controlled investigation of the t o generating capacity of the individual streptomyces species detected in these samples under simulated environmental conditions would undoubtedly provide further insight into the full potential of streptomyces to contribute to problematic t o occurrence in drinking water reservoirs and other aquatic systems conflicts of interest authors declare no conflict of

19292,algal extracellular organic matter eom released from microcystis aeruginosa can cause severe membrane fouling during algae laden water treatment to solve this problem three typical sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops i e ferrous iron peroxymonosulfate fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms were employed as membrane pretreatment strategies their performance on mitigating eom fouling of a ceramic uf membrane was systematically investigated and compared in the present study the results indicated that sr aops pretreatments could promote the reduction of doc and uv254 and the removal performance showed an apparent regularity of uv fe ii pms fe ii pms uv pms the pretreatments were very effective for decomposing high mw biopolymers 20 000 da into low mw humic substances 1000 20 000 da thus reducing the accumulation of high mw biopolymers on membrane surface with respect to membrane fouling control fe ii pms significantly mitigated both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling whereas uv pms only reduced reversible fouling and exhibited little effect on irreversible fouling by contrast uv fe ii pms showed the best performance for fouling reduction due to the synergistic effect of uv and fe ii for pms activation the dominating fouling mechanism was governed by both pore blockage and cake filtration likely due to the bimodal mw distribution of eom and sr aops pretreatments delayed the transition from pore blockage to cake filtration in addition sr aops prior to uf membrane were also very effective to improve the removal of micropollutants i e atz smt and p cnb these results demonstrate the potential application of sr aops as pretreatment for membrane fouling control during algae laden water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops ceramic uf membrane membrane fouling extracellular organic matter eom micropollutants 1 introduction algal blooms frequently occur in many lakes and reservoirs resulting in the deterioration of water quality and decrease of treatment efficiency huang et al 2009b li et al 2012 due to the effective retention of algal cells ultrafiltration uf is a promising strategy for the treatment of algae laden waters qu et al 2014 compared with polymeric membranes ceramic membranes are more increasingly used in water and wastewater treatment due to their inherent advantages such as higher chemical and mechanical stability longer lifespan and high water productivity lee et al 2013 lee and kim 2014 however membrane fouling during algae laden water treatment is still an obstacle for the widespread application of uf algal extracellular organic matter eom is a typical type of autochthonous natural organic matter during algal blooms eom contains a high proportion of high molecular weight mw biopolymers such as proteinaceous and polysaccharides substances which have been identified as major membrane foulants causing severe fouling for both polymeric and ceramic uf membranes qu et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 many strategies were proposed to mitigate membrane fouling caused by eom among which feed water pretreatment has been demonstrated as a common and effective method such as ferric chloride coagulation alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 adsorption with mesoporous adsorbent resin li et al 2014 and pre ozonation wei et al 2016 as one of typical hydroxyl radical oh based advanced oxidation processes hr aops uv h2o2 uv dose 16 32 j cm 2 h2o2 dose 0 25 0 50 mm was also utilized to mitigate ceramic membrane fouling caused by soluble algal organic matter and achieved a marked flux improvement zhang et al 2015 in comparison with hr aops sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are emerging oxidant alternatives and gaining popularity in water treatment it is generally considered that sr aops are less influenced by the composition of water matrix and effective to remove recalcitrant organic compounds sr aops have been increasingly used to degrade organic contaminants in aqueous solutions such as atrazine luo et al 2015 4 chlorophenol rastogi et al 2009a polychlorinated biphenyls rastogi et al 2009b 2 methylisoborneol and geosmin xie et al 2015 etc with a high standard redox potential e0 2 6 v vs nhe and strong oxidizing property so4 may has the potential to decrease membrane foulants hence mitigating membrane fouling however very limited work on the application of sr aops for membrane fouling control has been done especially for eom fouling thus it is of particular interest to use sr aops treatment for uf membrane fouling control in terms of membrane material ceramic membrane is more feasible to integrate with oxidation processes due to its excellent antioxidant capacity so4 can be generated by activation of persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms with several methods such as ultrasonic heat transition metal ions and uv antoniou et al 2010 rastogi et al 2009b in our recent study cheng et al 2017 ferrous ion fe ii was selected as an activator for pms due to its low operational costs and environmentally friendly nature and the pretreatment of fe ii pms with doses of 15 and 50 μm was demonstrated to be an effective method for both membrane fouling control and micropollutants removal however this study mainly focused on model organic compounds which have some discrepancies with eom in natural waters except for fe ii uv irradiation is another available and convenient method for ps or pms activation khan et al 2014 but little study has been conducted on the application of uv ps or uv pms for membrane fouling control it is noteworthy that significant differences exist between these two activation methods which may result in different performances for fouling mitigation therefore it is essential to conduct a comparative study between fe ii and uv for ps pms activation and further their application for membrane fouling control in previous study khan et al 2013 the combination of fe ii and uv has also been employed for ps pms activation and the processes of uv pms fe ii and uv ps fe ii were demonstrated to be very effective for micropollutants removal however its performance on membrane fouling control was rarely reported to this end sr aops activated by fe ii and uv alone or in combination with each other need to be further studied to obtain a comprehensive understanding about their effects on eom fouling control in the present study pms was selected as an oxidant alternative due to its universal activation nature over ps rastogi et al 2009b three typical sr aops i e fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms were innovatively proposed to mitigate ceramic uf membrane fouling caused by eom released from microcystis aeruginosa the most notorious and widely occurring cyanobacteria the effects of pretreatments on the removal and characteristics of eom fluorescence spectra and mw distribution were systematically investigated then the performance of membrane fouling control was evaluated through membrane flux decline fouling reversibility analysis and model fits using pore blocking cake filtration model furthermore the effect of sr aops pretreatments on the removal of micropollutants was also studied the results of this study were expected to compare different activation methods for pms and further illustrate the feasibility of sr aops on controlling membrane fouling caused by algal eom the proposed method would make breakthroughs on membrane fouling control strategy and mechanism which may provide solution thoughts and technical supports for the fouling problems faced by ceramic uf membranes during algae laden water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of algae and eom extraction microcystis aeruginosa pcc7820 was supplied by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china they were axenically cultivated in a 1 l conical flask using bg 11 medium which was placed in a biological incubator at the temperature of 25 c to simulate natural light conditions a 17 7 h light dark cycle was employed every day microcystis aeruginosa was harvested in the early stationary growth phase with the culture time of 35 days centrifugation of the algal cell suspension at 10 000 r min and 4 c for 15 min and the subsequent filtration of the supernatant using 0 45 μm cellulose filters taoyuan china were conducted to extract the algal eom 2 2 preparation of feed water the feed water was prepared by diluting the extracted eom to a doc concentration of 4 7 0 2 mg l with ultrapure water and the ph was adjusted to approximately 7 0 using 1 mmol l hcl or 1 mmol l naoh to investigate the effect of sr aops pretreatments on micropollutants removal atrazine atz sigma aldrich usa sulfamethazine smt sigma aldrich usa and p chloronitrobenzene p cnb aladdin chemicals china were employed and individually spiked into the feed water with a concentration of 1 μmol l prior to the experiment 2 3 experimental setup 2 3 1 sr aops pretreatments as illustrated in fig 1 fe ii pms denoted as fp1 fp2 uv pms denoted as up1 up2 and uv fe ii pms denoted as ufp1 ufp2 were employed in the present study as representatives of typical sr aops ferrous sulfate feso4 of guaranteed reagent grade was purchased from bench chemicals tianjin china and potassium peroxymonosulfate 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 pms was supplied by aladdin chemicals shanghai china the stock solutions of feso4 and pms were both freshly prepared and standardized using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and the iodometric method rastogi et al 2009b respectively fe ii pms pretreatment was performed in triangular flasks which was initiated by adding certain doses of pms 0 1 and 0 2 mmol l into the feed water containing fe ii at desirable concentrations 0 05 and 0 1 mmol l followed by mixing with a constant stirring rate for 0 5 or 1 h the uv based oxidation pretreatment was conducted in a uv irradiation device consisting of four low pressure uv lamps 254 nm 15 w heraeus germany placed in the lamps house as shown in fig 2 a uv pms pretreatment was started by adding desirable doses of pms to the feed water whereas certain doses of fe ii and pms were successively injected into the feed water to start the reaction of uv fe ii pms process then the reaction solution was mixed with a constant stirring rate using a thermostatic magnetic stirrer b11 2 shanghai sile instrument co ltd china and exposed under a vertical tube in the center of the uv light extending from the lamps house to ensure homogeneous irradiation the distance from the uv light to the surface of the reaction solution was 33 cm and the optical path length was 3 cm the irradiation intensity was determined using a uv radiometer uv b photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university china and the uv irradiance was calibrated following the method proposed by bolton and linden 2003 the average fluence rate was determined as 0 2 mw cm 2 and the uv doses of 360 and 720 mj cm 2 corresponding to irradiation times of 0 5 and 1 h were used in the present study all the pretreatments were conducted at room temperature 20 2 c and the pretreated samples were immediately used for filtration tests without removal of the precipitate generated during fe ii involved processes 2 3 2 membrane filtration the characteristics of the employed ceramic uf membrane are summarized in table 1 and the scanning electron microscope images are illustrated in fig s1 as shown in fig 2 b membrane filtration experiments were carried out in a self prepared filtration cell made of plexiglass with an effective volume of 125 ml the membrane was placed at the bottom of the cell with its filtration layer towards water samples the experiment was performed in down flow dead end filtration mode and a nitrogen gas bottle qinghua industrial gas co ltd harbin china was used to maintain the constant trans membrane pressure tmp of 100 kpa in this study each experiment contained filtration of water samples 125 ml hydraulic backwash and filtration of ultrapure water 40 ml during filtration the permeate flux was calculated by periodically recording the weight data of the permeate water using an electronic balance bsa3202s sartorius germany during hydraulic backwash a higher pressure of approximately 150 kpa was applied to force the ultrapure water flow from the permeate side to the feed side of membrane 2 4 membrane fouling resistance calculation to evaluate the effect of sr aops pretreatments on membrane fouling the resistance in series model cheng et al 2016 was utilized for fouling resistance calculation as shown in eq 1 1 r t t m p μ j r m r r r i r where r t is the total membrane fouling resistance m 1 tmp is trans membrane pressure pa μ is the dynamic viscosity for the feed water pa s j is the permeate flux m s r m is intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 r r and r ir are hydraulic reversible and irreversible fouling resistance m 1 respectively during the experiment the average ultrapure water flux of virgin membrane was recorded as j 0 then the intrinsic membrane resistance r m was calculated according to eq 2 subsequently total fouling resistance r t was evaluated through the permeate flux at the end of feed water filtration j 1 using eq 3 after hydraulic backwash the average membrane flux was recorded as j 2 and reversible fouling resistance r r was calculated via eq 4 when r t r m and r r were determined the irreversible fouling resistance r ir was calculated according to eq 5 2 r m t m p μ j 0 3 r t t m p μ j 1 4 r r t m p μ j 1 t m p μ j 2 5 r i r r t r m r r 2 5 fouling mechanism analysis the flux decline during membrane filtration can be described by different fouling mechanisms including complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration the dominating mechanism during filtration can be determined according to a common characteristic equation park et al 2017 as shown in eq 6 6 d 2 t d v 2 k d t d v n where t is the filtration time s v is the total filtered volume m3 k is the fouling coefficient and n is the fouling behavior index n characterizes the dominating fouling mechanism with n equal to 0 1 1 5 or 2 for cake filtration intermediate blocking standard blocking and complete blocking respectively the required derivatives in eq 6 can be calculated according to eqs 7 8 ho and zydney 2000 yuan et al 2002 7 d t d v 1 j a 8 d 2 t d v 2 1 j 3 a 2 d j d t where j is the filtrate flux m s a is the surface area of membrane m2 and dj dt can be evaluated by numerical differentiating the data of flux versus time to take the derivative of a series of piecewise cubic splines that were fit to the original data subsequently the filtrate flux data were replotted as d 2 t dv 2 versus dt dv and the value of n can be obtained graphically palacio et al 2002 2 6 analytical methods prior to analysis all the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany and ultraviolet absorbance uv254 was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 puxi china at wavelength of 254 nm fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems spectra were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan the spectra was scanned over excitation ex wavelengths of 200 450 nm at 5 nm increment and emission em wavelengths of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm to eliminate the raman scatter peaks in fluorescence spectra an ultrapure water blank spectrum measured in the same condition was subtracted from each sample eem murphy et al 2011 the apparent mw distributions were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc wufeng lc 100 china coupled with on line uv lc uv at a wavelength of 254 nm and doc detection lc doc m9 ge usa it was performed using a silica gel column 7 8 300 mm 10 μm tsk gel g4000pwxl tosoh japan with a mobile phase of phosphate buffer solution 0 008 mol l na2hpo4 and 0 018 mol l kh2po4 ph 6 85 the flow rate and column temperature were controlled at 0 6 ml min and 30 c respectively the mw calibration curve determined by sodium polystyrene sulfonates standards is shown in fig s2 micropollutants were measured by hplc agilent 1200 usa with a c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm spherisorb s5 ods2 waters usa and a uv detection specifically atz was measured using an eluent of methanol ultrapure water 70 30 v v at wavelength of 225 nm smt was analyzed at a wavelength of 270 nm using a mobile phase of methanol ultrapure water 40 60 v v and p cnb was quantified using an eluent of methanol ultrapure water 80 20 v v at a wavelength of 275 nm the eluent flow rate was 1 0 ml min and the column temperature was 30 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of sr aops pretreatments on the removal of eom the effect of sr aops with different doses on the removal of doc and uv254 for algal eom is illustrated in fig 3 and the principle reactions occurring in these processes are summarized in table 2 as shown in fig 3 a fe ii pms pretreatment significantly decreased the doc concentration of uf feed with the removal rates of 17 and 40 for fp1 and fp2 respectively by contrast uv pms exhibited relatively lower doc reduction efficiency at the same pms dose 7 and 11 for up1 and up2 respectively in fact the mechanisms of these two methods on doc removal were considered to be significantly different to be specific the reaction between fe ii and pms simultaneously resulted in the formation of fe iii and so4 reaction 1 in neutral eom solutions the in situ formed fe iii can work as a coagulant through hydrolysis cheng et al 2017 guan et al 2009 and so4 promoted the formation of oh reaction 4 on the other hand oh also reacted with sulfate groups and produced so4 at acidic conditions reaction 5 coagulation could destabilize contaminants to cause aggregation or adsorption on coagulant precipitates huang et al 2009a thus enhancing the removal of eom especially high mw organic matter at the same time some low mw organic matter could be mineralized by so4 and oh oxidation hence both coagulation and chemical oxidation contributed to the reduction of doc by contrast activation of pms by uv irradiation only led to the generation of so4 and oh reaction 2 thus oxidative degradation was the main removal mechanism during uv pms process reactions 8 and 9 resulting in the relatively lower removal rate of doc the result also indicated that the applied oxidant dose could hardly achieve substantial doc mineralization hence it can be speculated that coagulation with in situ formed fe iii played a major role for doc removal in the fe ii pms process rather than chemical oxidation as seen in fig 3 a the co existence of uv and fe ii for pms activation showed the best performance for doc reduction and further increased the removal rates to 27 and 55 it was worth noting that excessive amounts of pms was employed because excessive fe ii would consume the generated so4 and oh reactions 6 and 7 thus the synergistic effect of uv and fe ii could activate pms more thoroughly in addition uv radiation also contributed to the regeneration of fe ii reaction 3 khan et al 2013 which accelerated the consumption of residual pms to better understand the reduction of doc in different sr aops pretreatments the decomposition of pms was further investigated and the result is shown in fig s3 in the fe ii pms process the concentration of pms decreased rapidly within 5 min and remained nearly constant during the remaining time indicating that pms was immediately decomposed to form fe iii and so4 after the addition of pms this phenomenon could be interpreted by the fast reaction between fe ii and pms by contrast pms was gradually decomposed with the increase of irradiation time in the uv pms process under the combined action of fe ii and uv the degradation of pms was significantly improved and the residual pms was nearly disappeared suggesting that pms has been made full use of during uv fe ii pms process after filtration with uf membrane the permeate doc concentration of raw eom was obviously decreased with the rejection rate of approximately 11 however as for the feed water pretreated by various sr aops the permeate doc concentrations were only slightly lower than the feed and the doc rejection rates of uf membrane were significantly reduced these results suggested that less organic matter was accumulated on membrane surface by sr aops pretreatments which might contribute to membrane fouling mitigation fig 3 b shows the effect of sr aops pretreatments on uv254 removal the removal effect of uv254 was similar to that of doc and the permeate uv254 values were significantly decreased after various pretreatments uv254 represents the electron rich organic substrates in algal eom such as conjugated c c double bonds or aromatic chromophores primarily humics leenheer and croué 2003 which was more susceptible to oxidizing agents and preferentially attacked by radical oxidation thus so4 and oh generated during pretreatments with strong oxidation ability could significantly reduce the permeate uv254 values it was noteworthy that uv pms exhibited better removal effect for uv254 19 28 than doc suggesting the decrease of specific uv absorbance i e uv absorbance divided by the doc concentration and the increase of hydrophilic reaction products after uv pms oxidation the removal performance of doc and uv254 for eom showed an apparent regularity of uv fe ii pms fe ii pms uv pms 3 2 effect of sr aops pretreatments on the characteristics of eom 3 2 1 fluorescence eem spectra the fluorescence eem spectra of algal eom samples with different pretreatments are shown in fig 4 the spectrum of untreated eom mainly consisted of three significant fluorescence peaks including t1 ex em 275 nm 310 nm c ex em 350 nm 425 nm and a ex em 275 nm 430 nm fig 4 a it can also be seen that peak t1 showed relatively stronger fluorescence intensity than peaks a and c specifically peak t1 is related to tryptophan protein like substances while peaks a and c are associated with humic like substances mainly humic and fulvic acids derived from the breakdown of plant material henderson et al 2009 therefore it was indicated that both humic like and protein like substances existed in microcystis eom pretreatments with fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms at a lower dose efficiently reduced the fluorescence intensity of peak t1 by 32 29 and 65 respectively whereas the intensities of peaks a and c changed little the results suggested that these pretreatments exhibited a better performance in removing protein like than humic like substances with a higher oxidant dose all the peak intensities were further decreased by uv pms pretreatment and the fluorescence peaks even disappeared when treated by fe ii pms and uv fe ii pms it was noteworthy that the humic like and protein like substances were not completely removed by sr aops and the disappearing of fluorescence peaks was attributed to the quenching of fluorescence after oxidation as well as the partial removal of eom 3 2 2 mw distribution in order to examine the effect of sr aops on algal eom the apparent mw distribution of eom solutions with different pretreatments were determined by lc doc and lc uv and the results are shown in fig 5 the lc doc chromatogram revealed that the untreated eom contained two significant peaks representing biopolymers 20 000 da and humic substances 1000 20 000 da respectively huber et al 2011 as illustrated in fig 5 a the peak for biopolymers was reduced significantly after fp1 treatment whereas the peak for humic substances was observably increased with the increase of fe ii pms dose i e fp2 the humic peak was further reduced compared with fp1 treatment but was still higher than the untreated eom and the peak for biopolymers disappeared the removal of biopolymers was attributed to the synergistic effect of fe iii coagulation and so4 oh oxidation and the increase of humic substances was due to the generation of smaller molecules by decomposition of biopolymers as for uv pms pretreatment the biopolymers peak was decreased with the increase of oxidant dose whereas the peak for humic substance exhibited a reverse trend different from fe ii pms this change was mainly ascribed to the oxidation of biopolymers without the effect of coagulation zhang et al 2015 also reported that uv h2o2 could partially oxidize biopolymers and consequently break them down into smaller molecules uv fe ii pms pretreatment showed a similar trend with fe ii pms but with a relatively lower peak intensity indicating the intensification of fe ii pms under uv irradiation as shown in fig 5 b the peak of biopolymers was not detected in lc uv chromatograms due to the lack of uv absorbing chromophores whereas the peak for humic substances was clearly visible unlike lc doc chromatogram the uv response for humic substances was decreased to some extent after various pretreatments suggesting that uv absorbing compounds were more susceptible to oxidation treatment the above results indicated that sr aops were very effective for decomposing high mw biopolymers of algal eom into smaller molecules i e humic substances as well as removing uv absorbing compounds 3 3 flux curves and fouling reversibility analyses in order to assess membrane fouling caused by eom and its mitigation through various pretreatments membrane filtration tests were conducted fig 6 a presents the flux decline curves during eom filtration raw eom without any pretreatment led to a drastic flux decline with the final normalized flux j j0 the ratio of instantaneous flux to initial water flux of 0 32 to be specific the flux was sharply decreased in the initial 50 ml followed by a gradual decrease during the later filtration stage the initial rapid decrease was possibly attributed to pore blocking caused by low mw compounds of eom and the subsequent slow decrease was related to the formation of cake layer resulting from the accumulation of high mw components on membrane surface yan et al 2017 by contrast if the feed water was pretreated by fe ii pms the flux was significantly improved with the final normalized flux of 0 50 and 0 70 as shown in fig 3 fe ii pms could reduce the organic loading through the combined effect of coagulation and oxidation which contributed to membrane flux improvement however uv pms pretreatment only slightly alleviate flux decline compared with raw eom with the final normalized flux of 0 34 and 0 42 since uv pms exhibited limited doc reduction rate fig 3 the slight improvement in flux was mainly ascribed to the structural change of eom i e high mw biopolymers were converted into smaller molecules by radical oxidation uv fe ii pms showed the best performance for flux improvement and the final normalized flux was increased to 0 53 and 0 81 indicating that uv irradiation was a feasible way to further improve the performance of fe ii pms in flux improvement furthermore membrane fouling resistance was calculated and the result of fouling reversibility is illustrated in fig 6 b raw eom caused the most severe reversible and irreversible fouling with the fouling resistances of 2 34 1012 and 0 29 1012 m 1 respectively the result of fouling reversibility showed that reversible fouling played a dominant role in ceramic uf membrane fouling caused by eom this phenomenon was also consistent with previous report using polymeric membranes qu et al 2012 fe ii pms treatment prior to uf membrane substantially reduced both reversible and irreversible fouling resistances and the performance improved with the increase of oxidant dose since coagulation with fe iii was very effective for the removal of eom especially high mw fractions resulting in the decrease of organic foulants deposited on membrane surface thus the reversible fouling resistance was significantly reduced simultaneously mineralization of some low mw fractions contributed to the mitigation of irreversible fouling in the case of uv pms pretreatment reversible fouling was considerably mitigated due to the decomposition of high mw biopolymers however the change of irreversible fouling resistance was not significant on the one hand the generated hydrophilic and low mw fractions may penetrate into membrane pores causing severe pore blocking shen et al 2010 on the other hand some low mw fractions were mineralized by uv pms oxidation which contributed to fouling mitigation hence it can be speculated that the negative impact on the irreversible fouling was offset by the positive impact resulting in a nearly constant irreversible fouling resistance uv fe ii pms as expected showed the best performance for reducing both reversible and irreversible fouling resistances which was attributed to the lowest organic loading after pretreatment compared with fe ii pms the addition of uv irradiation could promote the generation of so4 and oh and it was also reported to be effective to enhance coagulation yu et al 2016 hence the lowest fouling resistance was observed when uv fe ii pms was applied for membrane pretreatment 3 4 effect of sr aops pretreatments on membrane fouling mechanisms to better understand the mechanisms of membrane fouling caused by algal eom the experimental results were replotted as normalized flux versus time and fitted to the combined pore blockage cake filtration model text s1 proposed by ho and zydney 2000 the fitting results shown in fig 7 a illustrate that all data fitted well with pore blockage cake filtration model r 2 0 990 suggesting the co existence of both pore blockage and cake filtration in the filtration of eom irrespective of the presence of pretreatments the result was also consistent with the simultaneous involvement of both reversible and irreversible fouling fig 6 which was likely ascribed to the combined fouling effects caused by high mw biopolymers and low mw humic substances in eom qu et al 2014 used polymeric uf membranes to investigate membrane fouling caused by eom and found similar results that the mechanism for fouling formation was mainly attributed to cake formation allowing for the occurrence of standard blocking and intermediate blocking zhang et al 2014 also reported similar results using a ceramic mf membrane it seemed that the main mechanism for eom fouling was hardly affected by the properties of membrane during the same filtration volume the filtration time of raw eom without any pretreatment was longest indicating the relatively lower filtration flux and more serious membrane fouling when feed water was pretreated by various sr aops the filtration time was shorten to varying degrees to examine the transition of dominating mechanisms from initial pore blockage to cake filtration during the filtration the experimental results were further replotted as d 2 t dv 2 versus dt dv based on eqs 6 8 as shown in fig 7 b it was noted that the plots for raw eom had larger values of both dt dv and d 2 t dv 2 which was caused by the lower initial flux yielded by the fast flux decline caused by raw eom pretreatments with fe ii pms and uv fe ii pms considerably reduced the values of both dt dv and d 2 t dv 2 whereas uv pms exhibited little effect for most sets of data negative slopes n 0 appeared followed by zero slopes n 0 this phenomenon seemed counterintuitive but was not uncommon and has been reported by several studies byun et al 2011 duclos orsello et al 2006 lee et al 2013 it was generally considered that the negative slope was ascribed to the transition regime of filtration mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration byun et al 2011 fig 7 b also shows that the volume required for the transition namely transition volume was significantly increased after fe ii pms and uv fe ii pms pretreatments implying that these treatments delayed the transition of fouling mechanisms this phenomenon was attributed to the reduction of both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling by constrast uv pms only slightly increased the transition volume which was consistent with the unchanged irreversible fouling when uv pms pretreatment was applied 3 5 micropollutants removal to further verify the oxidation mechanism of different sr aops for membrane fouling mitigation their performance on emerging micropollutants removal were systemically investigated and compared in algae laden water treatment atz smt and p cnb were selected as typical micropolluants representing herbicides antibiotic pharmaceutical product and industrial chemical intermediates respectively these pollutants are frequently detected in the source of drinking water which is a threat to human health and ecological environment garoma et al 2010 graymore et al 2001 the effect of sr aops pretreatments on micropollutants removal was investigated and the results are shown in fig 8 it is generally recognized that size exclusion is the core mechanism for pollutants removal by uf membrane since the mw of these micropollutants 215 68 278 33 and 157 55 respectively is much smaller than the mw cutoff of ceramic uf membrane 150 kda single uf without any pretreatment exhibited a poor performance for micropollutants removal with a rejection rate of lower than 8 actually the poor removal of low mw organic matter for uf membrane is still a critical impediment limiting its further application in algae laden water treatment as shown in fig 8 sr aops prior to membrane significantly improved the removal rates of micropollutants when feed water was pretreated by fe ii pms the removal efficiencies of atz and smt were substantially increased to 35 71 and 77 90 respectively and the removal performance was improved with the increase of oxidant dose by contrast the removal for p cnb was only slightly improved with the removal rates of 18 25 uv pms pretreatment exhibited similar performance and the removal rates of atz smt and p cnb were increased to 30 64 82 94 and 19 28 respectively the generated so4 and oh during sr aops with strong oxidation ability could mineralize or convert micropollutants into other intermediate products generally less harmful thus playing a major role in their removal it was noteworthy that the relatively lower improvement for p cnb removal was due to the low reaction rate between nitrobenzene compounds and so4 k 106 m 1s 1 neta et al 1977 as expected the removal performance for micropollutants could be significantly promoted under uv irradiation and the removal efficiencies for atz smt and p cnb were further increased to 68 98 86 99 and 31 76 respectively this was caused by the increased production of oxidative radicals under the synergistic effect of uv and fe ii for pms activation the above results indicated that sr aops prior to membrane were feasible and convenient methods to improve micropollutants removal among which uv fe ii pms showed significantly better performance than the other two methods especially for p cnb removal the above results also verified the oxidation properties of different sr aops as was mentioned above which played an important role in membrane fouling control overall the above results demonstrated the potential application of sr aops as pretreatment for ceramic uf membrane fouling control during algae laden water treatment however from the standpoint of full scale applications some problems still need to be addressed for example the dose of pms should be carefully optimized to avoid excess because excess pms is highly oxidative and would cause environmental issues the residual pms in the water can be removed by adding reducing agent such as sodium thiosulfate sodium sulfite etc furthermore to solve the problem of residual sulfate in the water subsequent advanced treatment by high pressure membrane filtration such as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis can be further utilized for algae laden water treatment 4 conclusions 1 sr aops pretreatments including fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms could promote the reduction of algal eom i e doc and uv254 as far as its removal performance was concerned the priority of the pretreatments showed an apparent regularity of uv fe ii pms fe ii pms uv pms 2 due to oxidative degradation by so4 and oh sr aops were very effective for decomposing high mw biopolymers into smaller molecules i e humic substances thus reducing the accumulation of high mw biopolymers on membrane surface 3 fe ii pms pretreatment significantly improved membrane flux and mitigated both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling whereas uv pms slightly alleviate flux decline and only reduced reversible fouling the performance of fe ii pms for fouling reduction could be intensified under uv irradiation due to the synergistic effect of uv and fe ii for pms activation 4 the dominating mechanism of eom fouling for ceramic uf membrane was converted from initial pore blockage to cake filtration during filtration and sr aops pretreatments delayed the transition and increased the transition volume to varying degrees 5 sr aops prior to uf membrane were very effective to improve the removal of typical micropollutants i e atz smt and p cnb among which uv fe ii pms showed the best performance acknowledgement this research was jointly

radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops i e ferrous iron peroxymonosulfate fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms were employed as membrane pretreatment strategies their performance on mitigating eom fouling of a ceramic uf membrane was systematically investigated and compared in the present study the results indicated that sr aops pretreatments could promote the reduction of doc and uv254 and the removal performance showed an apparent regularity of uv fe ii pms fe ii pms uv pms the pretreatments were very effective for decomposing high mw biopolymers 20 000 da into low mw humic substances 1000 20 000 da thus reducing the accumulation of high mw biopolymers on membrane surface with respect to membrane fouling control fe ii pms significantly mitigated both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling whereas uv pms only reduced reversible fouling and exhibited little effect on irreversible fouling by contrast uv fe ii pms showed the best performance for fouling reduction due to the synergistic effect of uv and fe ii for pms activation the dominating fouling mechanism was governed by both pore blockage and cake filtration likely due to the bimodal mw distribution of eom and sr aops pretreatments delayed the transition from pore blockage to cake filtration in addition sr aops prior to uf membrane were also very effective to improve the removal of micropollutants i e atz smt and p cnb these results demonstrate the potential application of sr aops as pretreatment for membrane fouling control during algae laden water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops ceramic uf membrane membrane fouling extracellular organic matter eom micropollutants 1 introduction algal blooms frequently occur in many lakes and reservoirs resulting in the deterioration of water quality and decrease of treatment efficiency huang et al 2009b li et al 2012 due to the effective retention of algal cells ultrafiltration uf is a promising strategy for the treatment of algae laden waters qu et al 2014 compared with polymeric membranes ceramic membranes are more increasingly used in water and wastewater treatment due to their inherent advantages such as higher chemical and mechanical stability longer lifespan and high water productivity lee et al 2013 lee and kim 2014 however membrane fouling during algae laden water treatment is still an obstacle for the widespread application of uf algal extracellular organic matter eom is a typical type of autochthonous natural organic matter during algal blooms eom contains a high proportion of high molecular weight mw biopolymers such as proteinaceous and polysaccharides substances which have been identified as major membrane foulants causing severe fouling for both polymeric and ceramic uf membranes qu et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 many strategies were proposed to mitigate membrane fouling caused by eom among which feed water pretreatment has been demonstrated as a common and effective method such as ferric chloride coagulation alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 adsorption with mesoporous adsorbent resin li et al 2014 and pre ozonation wei et al 2016 as one of typical hydroxyl radical oh based advanced oxidation processes hr aops uv h2o2 uv dose 16 32 j cm 2 h2o2 dose 0 25 0 50 mm was also utilized to mitigate ceramic membrane fouling caused by soluble algal organic matter and achieved a marked flux improvement zhang et al 2015 in comparison with hr aops sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are emerging oxidant alternatives and gaining popularity in water treatment it is generally considered that sr aops are less influenced by the composition of water matrix and effective to remove recalcitrant organic compounds sr aops have been increasingly used to degrade organic contaminants in aqueous solutions such as atrazine luo et al 2015 4 chlorophenol rastogi et al 2009a polychlorinated biphenyls rastogi et al 2009b 2 methylisoborneol and geosmin xie et al 2015 etc with a high standard redox potential e0 2 6 v vs nhe and strong oxidizing property so4 may has the potential to decrease membrane foulants hence mitigating membrane fouling however very limited work on the application of sr aops for membrane fouling control has been done especially for eom fouling thus it is of particular interest to use sr aops treatment for uf membrane fouling control in terms of membrane material ceramic membrane is more feasible to integrate with oxidation processes due to its excellent antioxidant capacity so4 can be generated by activation of persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms with several methods such as ultrasonic heat transition metal ions and uv antoniou et al 2010 rastogi et al 2009b in our recent study cheng et al 2017 ferrous ion fe ii was selected as an activator for pms due to its low operational costs and environmentally friendly nature and the pretreatment of fe ii pms with doses of 15 and 50 μm was demonstrated to be an effective method for both membrane fouling control and micropollutants removal however this study mainly focused on model organic compounds which have some discrepancies with eom in natural waters except for fe ii uv irradiation is another available and convenient method for ps or pms activation khan et al 2014 but little study has been conducted on the application of uv ps or uv pms for membrane fouling control it is noteworthy that significant differences exist between these two activation methods which may result in different performances for fouling mitigation therefore it is essential to conduct a comparative study between fe ii and uv for ps pms activation and further their application for membrane fouling control in previous study khan et al 2013 the combination of fe ii and uv has also been employed for ps pms activation and the processes of uv pms fe ii and uv ps fe ii were demonstrated to be very effective for micropollutants removal however its performance on membrane fouling control was rarely reported to this end sr aops activated by fe ii and uv alone or in combination with each other need to be further studied to obtain a comprehensive understanding about their effects on eom fouling control in the present study pms was selected as an oxidant alternative due to its universal activation nature over ps rastogi et al 2009b three typical sr aops i e fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms were innovatively proposed to mitigate ceramic uf membrane fouling caused by eom released from microcystis aeruginosa the most notorious and widely occurring cyanobacteria the effects of pretreatments on the removal and characteristics of eom fluorescence spectra and mw distribution were systematically investigated then the performance of membrane fouling control was evaluated through membrane flux decline fouling reversibility analysis and model fits using pore blocking cake filtration model furthermore the effect of sr aops pretreatments on the removal of micropollutants was also studied the results of this study were expected to compare different activation methods for pms and further illustrate the feasibility of sr aops on controlling membrane fouling caused by algal eom the proposed method would make breakthroughs on membrane fouling control strategy and mechanism which may provide solution thoughts and technical supports for the fouling problems faced by ceramic uf membranes during algae laden water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of algae and eom extraction microcystis aeruginosa pcc7820 was supplied by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china they were axenically cultivated in a 1 l conical flask using bg 11 medium which was placed in a biological incubator at the temperature of 25 c to simulate natural light conditions a 17 7 h light dark cycle was employed every day microcystis aeruginosa was harvested in the early stationary growth phase with the culture time of 35 days centrifugation of the algal cell suspension at 10 000 r min and 4 c for 15 min and the subsequent filtration of the supernatant using 0 45 μm cellulose filters taoyuan china were conducted to extract the algal eom 2 2 preparation of feed water the feed water was prepared by diluting the extracted eom to a doc concentration of 4 7 0 2 mg l with ultrapure water and the ph was adjusted to approximately 7 0 using 1 mmol l hcl or 1 mmol l naoh to investigate the effect of sr aops pretreatments on micropollutants removal atrazine atz sigma aldrich usa sulfamethazine smt sigma aldrich usa and p chloronitrobenzene p cnb aladdin chemicals china were employed and individually spiked into the feed water with a concentration of 1 μmol l prior to the experiment 2 3 experimental setup 2 3 1 sr aops pretreatments as illustrated in fig 1 fe ii pms denoted as fp1 fp2 uv pms denoted as up1 up2 and uv fe ii pms denoted as ufp1 ufp2 were employed in the present study as representatives of typical sr aops ferrous sulfate feso4 of guaranteed reagent grade was purchased from bench chemicals tianjin china and potassium peroxymonosulfate 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 pms was supplied by aladdin chemicals shanghai china the stock solutions of feso4 and pms were both freshly prepared and standardized using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and the iodometric method rastogi et al 2009b respectively fe ii pms pretreatment was performed in triangular flasks which was initiated by adding certain doses of pms 0 1 and 0 2 mmol l into the feed water containing fe ii at desirable concentrations 0 05 and 0 1 mmol l followed by mixing with a constant stirring rate for 0 5 or 1 h the uv based oxidation pretreatment was conducted in a uv irradiation device consisting of four low pressure uv lamps 254 nm 15 w heraeus germany placed in the lamps house as shown in fig 2 a uv pms pretreatment was started by adding desirable doses of pms to the feed water whereas certain doses of fe ii and pms were successively injected into the feed water to start the reaction of uv fe ii pms process then the reaction solution was mixed with a constant stirring rate using a thermostatic magnetic stirrer b11 2 shanghai sile instrument co ltd china and exposed under a vertical tube in the center of the uv light extending from the lamps house to ensure homogeneous irradiation the distance from the uv light to the surface of the reaction solution was 33 cm and the optical path length was 3 cm the irradiation intensity was determined using a uv radiometer uv b photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university china and the uv irradiance was calibrated following the method proposed by bolton and linden 2003 the average fluence rate was determined as 0 2 mw cm 2 and the uv doses of 360 and 720 mj cm 2 corresponding to irradiation times of 0 5 and 1 h were used in the present study all the pretreatments were conducted at room temperature 20 2 c and the pretreated samples were immediately used for filtration tests without removal of the precipitate generated during fe ii involved processes 2 3 2 membrane filtration the characteristics of the employed ceramic uf membrane are summarized in table 1 and the scanning electron microscope images are illustrated in fig s1 as shown in fig 2 b membrane filtration experiments were carried out in a self prepared filtration cell made of plexiglass with an effective volume of 125 ml the membrane was placed at the bottom of the cell with its filtration layer towards water samples the experiment was performed in down flow dead end filtration mode and a nitrogen gas bottle qinghua industrial gas co ltd harbin china was used to maintain the constant trans membrane pressure tmp of 100 kpa in this study each experiment contained filtration of water samples 125 ml hydraulic backwash and filtration of ultrapure water 40 ml during filtration the permeate flux was calculated by periodically recording the weight data of the permeate water using an electronic balance bsa3202s sartorius germany during hydraulic backwash a higher pressure of approximately 150 kpa was applied to force the ultrapure water flow from the permeate side to the feed side of membrane 2 4 membrane fouling resistance calculation to evaluate the effect of sr aops pretreatments on membrane fouling the resistance in series model cheng et al 2016 was utilized for fouling resistance calculation as shown in eq 1 1 r t t m p μ j r m r r r i r where r t is the total membrane fouling resistance m 1 tmp is trans membrane pressure pa μ is the dynamic viscosity for the feed water pa s j is the permeate flux m s r m is intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 r r and r ir are hydraulic reversible and irreversible fouling resistance m 1 respectively during the experiment the average ultrapure water flux of virgin membrane was recorded as j 0 then the intrinsic membrane resistance r m was calculated according to eq 2 subsequently total fouling resistance r t was evaluated through the permeate flux at the end of feed water filtration j 1 using eq 3 after hydraulic backwash the average membrane flux was recorded as j 2 and reversible fouling resistance r r was calculated via eq 4 when r t r m and r r were determined the irreversible fouling resistance r ir was calculated according to eq 5 2 r m t m p μ j 0 3 r t t m p μ j 1 4 r r t m p μ j 1 t m p μ j 2 5 r i r r t r m r r 2 5 fouling mechanism analysis the flux decline during membrane filtration can be described by different fouling mechanisms including complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration the dominating mechanism during filtration can be determined according to a common characteristic equation park et al 2017 as shown in eq 6 6 d 2 t d v 2 k d t d v n where t is the filtration time s v is the total filtered volume m3 k is the fouling coefficient and n is the fouling behavior index n characterizes the dominating fouling mechanism with n equal to 0 1 1 5 or 2 for cake filtration intermediate blocking standard blocking and complete blocking respectively the required derivatives in eq 6 can be calculated according to eqs 7 8 ho and zydney 2000 yuan et al 2002 7 d t d v 1 j a 8 d 2 t d v 2 1 j 3 a 2 d j d t where j is the filtrate flux m s a is the surface area of membrane m2 and dj dt can be evaluated by numerical differentiating the data of flux versus time to take the derivative of a series of piecewise cubic splines that were fit to the original data subsequently the filtrate flux data were replotted as d 2 t dv 2 versus dt dv and the value of n can be obtained graphically palacio et al 2002 2 6 analytical methods prior to analysis all the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany and ultraviolet absorbance uv254 was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 puxi china at wavelength of 254 nm fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems spectra were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan the spectra was scanned over excitation ex wavelengths of 200 450 nm at 5 nm increment and emission em wavelengths of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm to eliminate the raman scatter peaks in fluorescence spectra an ultrapure water blank spectrum measured in the same condition was subtracted from each sample eem murphy et al 2011 the apparent mw distributions were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc wufeng lc 100 china coupled with on line uv lc uv at a wavelength of 254 nm and doc detection lc doc m9 ge usa it was performed using a silica gel column 7 8 300 mm 10 μm tsk gel g4000pwxl tosoh japan with a mobile phase of phosphate buffer solution 0 008 mol l na2hpo4 and 0 018 mol l kh2po4 ph 6 85 the flow rate and column temperature were controlled at 0 6 ml min and 30 c respectively the mw calibration curve determined by sodium polystyrene sulfonates standards is shown in fig s2 micropollutants were measured by hplc agilent 1200 usa with a c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm spherisorb s5 ods2 waters usa and a uv detection specifically atz was measured using an eluent of methanol ultrapure water 70 30 v v at wavelength of 225 nm smt was analyzed at a wavelength of 270 nm using a mobile phase of methanol ultrapure water 40 60 v v and p cnb was quantified using an eluent of methanol ultrapure water 80 20 v v at a wavelength of 275 nm the eluent flow rate was 1 0 ml min and the column temperature was 30 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of sr aops pretreatments on the removal of eom the effect of sr aops with different doses on the removal of doc and uv254 for algal eom is illustrated in fig 3 and the principle reactions occurring in these processes are summarized in table 2 as shown in fig 3 a fe ii pms pretreatment significantly decreased the doc concentration of uf feed with the removal rates of 17 and 40 for fp1 and fp2 respectively by contrast uv pms exhibited relatively lower doc reduction efficiency at the same pms dose 7 and 11 for up1 and up2 respectively in fact the mechanisms of these two methods on doc removal were considered to be significantly different to be specific the reaction between fe ii and pms simultaneously resulted in the formation of fe iii and so4 reaction 1 in neutral eom solutions the in situ formed fe iii can work as a coagulant through hydrolysis cheng et al 2017 guan et al 2009 and so4 promoted the formation of oh reaction 4 on the other hand oh also reacted with sulfate groups and produced so4 at acidic conditions reaction 5 coagulation could destabilize contaminants to cause aggregation or adsorption on coagulant precipitates huang et al 2009a thus enhancing the removal of eom especially high mw organic matter at the same time some low mw organic matter could be mineralized by so4 and oh oxidation hence both coagulation and chemical oxidation contributed to the reduction of doc by contrast activation of pms by uv irradiation only led to the generation of so4 and oh reaction 2 thus oxidative degradation was the main removal mechanism during uv pms process reactions 8 and 9 resulting in the relatively lower removal rate of doc the result also indicated that the applied oxidant dose could hardly achieve substantial doc mineralization hence it can be speculated that coagulation with in situ formed fe iii played a major role for doc removal in the fe ii pms process rather than chemical oxidation as seen in fig 3 a the co existence of uv and fe ii for pms activation showed the best performance for doc reduction and further increased the removal rates to 27 and 55 it was worth noting that excessive amounts of pms was employed because excessive fe ii would consume the generated so4 and oh reactions 6 and 7 thus the synergistic effect of uv and fe ii could activate pms more thoroughly in addition uv radiation also contributed to the regeneration of fe ii reaction 3 khan et al 2013 which accelerated the consumption of residual pms to better understand the reduction of doc in different sr aops pretreatments the decomposition of pms was further investigated and the result is shown in fig s3 in the fe ii pms process the concentration of pms decreased rapidly within 5 min and remained nearly constant during the remaining time indicating that pms was immediately decomposed to form fe iii and so4 after the addition of pms this phenomenon could be interpreted by the fast reaction between fe ii and pms by contrast pms was gradually decomposed with the increase of irradiation time in the uv pms process under the combined action of fe ii and uv the degradation of pms was significantly improved and the residual pms was nearly disappeared suggesting that pms has been made full use of during uv fe ii pms process after filtration with uf membrane the permeate doc concentration of raw eom was obviously decreased with the rejection rate of approximately 11 however as for the feed water pretreated by various sr aops the permeate doc concentrations were only slightly lower than the feed and the doc rejection rates of uf membrane were significantly reduced these results suggested that less organic matter was accumulated on membrane surface by sr aops pretreatments which might contribute to membrane fouling mitigation fig 3 b shows the effect of sr aops pretreatments on uv254 removal the removal effect of uv254 was similar to that of doc and the permeate uv254 values were significantly decreased after various pretreatments uv254 represents the electron rich organic substrates in algal eom such as conjugated c c double bonds or aromatic chromophores primarily humics leenheer and croué 2003 which was more susceptible to oxidizing agents and preferentially attacked by radical oxidation thus so4 and oh generated during pretreatments with strong oxidation ability could significantly reduce the permeate uv254 values it was noteworthy that uv pms exhibited better removal effect for uv254 19 28 than doc suggesting the decrease of specific uv absorbance i e uv absorbance divided by the doc concentration and the increase of hydrophilic reaction products after uv pms oxidation the removal performance of doc and uv254 for eom showed an apparent regularity of uv fe ii pms fe ii pms uv pms 3 2 effect of sr aops pretreatments on the characteristics of eom 3 2 1 fluorescence eem spectra the fluorescence eem spectra of algal eom samples with different pretreatments are shown in fig 4 the spectrum of untreated eom mainly consisted of three significant fluorescence peaks including t1 ex em 275 nm 310 nm c ex em 350 nm 425 nm and a ex em 275 nm 430 nm fig 4 a it can also be seen that peak t1 showed relatively stronger fluorescence intensity than peaks a and c specifically peak t1 is related to tryptophan protein like substances while peaks a and c are associated with humic like substances mainly humic and fulvic acids derived from the breakdown of plant material henderson et al 2009 therefore it was indicated that both humic like and protein like substances existed in microcystis eom pretreatments with fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms at a lower dose efficiently reduced the fluorescence intensity of peak t1 by 32 29 and 65 respectively whereas the intensities of peaks a and c changed little the results suggested that these pretreatments exhibited a better performance in removing protein like than humic like substances with a higher oxidant dose all the peak intensities were further decreased by uv pms pretreatment and the fluorescence peaks even disappeared when treated by fe ii pms and uv fe ii pms it was noteworthy that the humic like and protein like substances were not completely removed by sr aops and the disappearing of fluorescence peaks was attributed to the quenching of fluorescence after oxidation as well as the partial removal of eom 3 2 2 mw distribution in order to examine the effect of sr aops on algal eom the apparent mw distribution of eom solutions with different pretreatments were determined by lc doc and lc uv and the results are shown in fig 5 the lc doc chromatogram revealed that the untreated eom contained two significant peaks representing biopolymers 20 000 da and humic substances 1000 20 000 da respectively huber et al 2011 as illustrated in fig 5 a the peak for biopolymers was reduced significantly after fp1 treatment whereas the peak for humic substances was observably increased with the increase of fe ii pms dose i e fp2 the humic peak was further reduced compared with fp1 treatment but was still higher than the untreated eom and the peak for biopolymers disappeared the removal of biopolymers was attributed to the synergistic effect of fe iii coagulation and so4 oh oxidation and the increase of humic substances was due to the generation of smaller molecules by decomposition of biopolymers as for uv pms pretreatment the biopolymers peak was decreased with the increase of oxidant dose whereas the peak for humic substance exhibited a reverse trend different from fe ii pms this change was mainly ascribed to the oxidation of biopolymers without the effect of coagulation zhang et al 2015 also reported that uv h2o2 could partially oxidize biopolymers and consequently break them down into smaller molecules uv fe ii pms pretreatment showed a similar trend with fe ii pms but with a relatively lower peak intensity indicating the intensification of fe ii pms under uv irradiation as shown in fig 5 b the peak of biopolymers was not detected in lc uv chromatograms due to the lack of uv absorbing chromophores whereas the peak for humic substances was clearly visible unlike lc doc chromatogram the uv response for humic substances was decreased to some extent after various pretreatments suggesting that uv absorbing compounds were more susceptible to oxidation treatment the above results indicated that sr aops were very effective for decomposing high mw biopolymers of algal eom into smaller molecules i e humic substances as well as removing uv absorbing compounds 3 3 flux curves and fouling reversibility analyses in order to assess membrane fouling caused by eom and its mitigation through various pretreatments membrane filtration tests were conducted fig 6 a presents the flux decline curves during eom filtration raw eom without any pretreatment led to a drastic flux decline with the final normalized flux j j0 the ratio of instantaneous flux to initial water flux of 0 32 to be specific the flux was sharply decreased in the initial 50 ml followed by a gradual decrease during the later filtration stage the initial rapid decrease was possibly attributed to pore blocking caused by low mw compounds of eom and the subsequent slow decrease was related to the formation of cake layer resulting from the accumulation of high mw components on membrane surface yan et al 2017 by contrast if the feed water was pretreated by fe ii pms the flux was significantly improved with the final normalized flux of 0 50 and 0 70 as shown in fig 3 fe ii pms could reduce the organic loading through the combined effect of coagulation and oxidation which contributed to membrane flux improvement however uv pms pretreatment only slightly alleviate flux decline compared with raw eom with the final normalized flux of 0 34 and 0 42 since uv pms exhibited limited doc reduction rate fig 3 the slight improvement in flux was mainly ascribed to the structural change of eom i e high mw biopolymers were converted into smaller molecules by radical oxidation uv fe ii pms showed the best performance for flux improvement and the final normalized flux was increased to 0 53 and 0 81 indicating that uv irradiation was a feasible way to further improve the performance of fe ii pms in flux improvement furthermore membrane fouling resistance was calculated and the result of fouling reversibility is illustrated in fig 6 b raw eom caused the most severe reversible and irreversible fouling with the fouling resistances of 2 34 1012 and 0 29 1012 m 1 respectively the result of fouling reversibility showed that reversible fouling played a dominant role in ceramic uf membrane fouling caused by eom this phenomenon was also consistent with previous report using polymeric membranes qu et al 2012 fe ii pms treatment prior to uf membrane substantially reduced both reversible and irreversible fouling resistances and the performance improved with the increase of oxidant dose since coagulation with fe iii was very effective for the removal of eom especially high mw fractions resulting in the decrease of organic foulants deposited on membrane surface thus the reversible fouling resistance was significantly reduced simultaneously mineralization of some low mw fractions contributed to the mitigation of irreversible fouling in the case of uv pms pretreatment reversible fouling was considerably mitigated due to the decomposition of high mw biopolymers however the change of irreversible fouling resistance was not significant on the one hand the generated hydrophilic and low mw fractions may penetrate into membrane pores causing severe pore blocking shen et al 2010 on the other hand some low mw fractions were mineralized by uv pms oxidation which contributed to fouling mitigation hence it can be speculated that the negative impact on the irreversible fouling was offset by the positive impact resulting in a nearly constant irreversible fouling resistance uv fe ii pms as expected showed the best performance for reducing both reversible and irreversible fouling resistances which was attributed to the lowest organic loading after pretreatment compared with fe ii pms the addition of uv irradiation could promote the generation of so4 and oh and it was also reported to be effective to enhance coagulation yu et al 2016 hence the lowest fouling resistance was observed when uv fe ii pms was applied for membrane pretreatment 3 4 effect of sr aops pretreatments on membrane fouling mechanisms to better understand the mechanisms of membrane fouling caused by algal eom the experimental results were replotted as normalized flux versus time and fitted to the combined pore blockage cake filtration model text s1 proposed by ho and zydney 2000 the fitting results shown in fig 7 a illustrate that all data fitted well with pore blockage cake filtration model r 2 0 990 suggesting the co existence of both pore blockage and cake filtration in the filtration of eom irrespective of the presence of pretreatments the result was also consistent with the simultaneous involvement of both reversible and irreversible fouling fig 6 which was likely ascribed to the combined fouling effects caused by high mw biopolymers and low mw humic substances in eom qu et al 2014 used polymeric uf membranes to investigate membrane fouling caused by eom and found similar results that the mechanism for fouling formation was mainly attributed to cake formation allowing for the occurrence of standard blocking and intermediate blocking zhang et al 2014 also reported similar results using a ceramic mf membrane it seemed that the main mechanism for eom fouling was hardly affected by the properties of membrane during the same filtration volume the filtration time of raw eom without any pretreatment was longest indicating the relatively lower filtration flux and more serious membrane fouling when feed water was pretreated by various sr aops the filtration time was shorten to varying degrees to examine the transition of dominating mechanisms from initial pore blockage to cake filtration during the filtration the experimental results were further replotted as d 2 t dv 2 versus dt dv based on eqs 6 8 as shown in fig 7 b it was noted that the plots for raw eom had larger values of both dt dv and d 2 t dv 2 which was caused by the lower initial flux yielded by the fast flux decline caused by raw eom pretreatments with fe ii pms and uv fe ii pms considerably reduced the values of both dt dv and d 2 t dv 2 whereas uv pms exhibited little effect for most sets of data negative slopes n 0 appeared followed by zero slopes n 0 this phenomenon seemed counterintuitive but was not uncommon and has been reported by several studies byun et al 2011 duclos orsello et al 2006 lee et al 2013 it was generally considered that the negative slope was ascribed to the transition regime of filtration mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration byun et al 2011 fig 7 b also shows that the volume required for the transition namely transition volume was significantly increased after fe ii pms and uv fe ii pms pretreatments implying that these treatments delayed the transition of fouling mechanisms this phenomenon was attributed to the reduction of both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling by constrast uv pms only slightly increased the transition volume which was consistent with the unchanged irreversible fouling when uv pms pretreatment was applied 3 5 micropollutants removal to further verify the oxidation mechanism of different sr aops for membrane fouling mitigation their performance on emerging micropollutants removal were systemically investigated and compared in algae laden water treatment atz smt and p cnb were selected as typical micropolluants representing herbicides antibiotic pharmaceutical product and industrial chemical intermediates respectively these pollutants are frequently detected in the source of drinking water which is a threat to human health and ecological environment garoma et al 2010 graymore et al 2001 the effect of sr aops pretreatments on micropollutants removal was investigated and the results are shown in fig 8 it is generally recognized that size exclusion is the core mechanism for pollutants removal by uf membrane since the mw of these micropollutants 215 68 278 33 and 157 55 respectively is much smaller than the mw cutoff of ceramic uf membrane 150 kda single uf without any pretreatment exhibited a poor performance for micropollutants removal with a rejection rate of lower than 8 actually the poor removal of low mw organic matter for uf membrane is still a critical impediment limiting its further application in algae laden water treatment as shown in fig 8 sr aops prior to membrane significantly improved the removal rates of micropollutants when feed water was pretreated by fe ii pms the removal efficiencies of atz and smt were substantially increased to 35 71 and 77 90 respectively and the removal performance was improved with the increase of oxidant dose by contrast the removal for p cnb was only slightly improved with the removal rates of 18 25 uv pms pretreatment exhibited similar performance and the removal rates of atz smt and p cnb were increased to 30 64 82 94 and 19 28 respectively the generated so4 and oh during sr aops with strong oxidation ability could mineralize or convert micropollutants into other intermediate products generally less harmful thus playing a major role in their removal it was noteworthy that the relatively lower improvement for p cnb removal was due to the low reaction rate between nitrobenzene compounds and so4 k 106 m 1s 1 neta et al 1977 as expected the removal performance for micropollutants could be significantly promoted under uv irradiation and the removal efficiencies for atz smt and p cnb were further increased to 68 98 86 99 and 31 76 respectively this was caused by the increased production of oxidative radicals under the synergistic effect of uv and fe ii for pms activation the above results indicated that sr aops prior to membrane were feasible and convenient methods to improve micropollutants removal among which uv fe ii pms showed significantly better performance than the other two methods especially for p cnb removal the above results also verified the oxidation properties of different sr aops as was mentioned above which played an important role in membrane fouling control overall the above results demonstrated the potential application of sr aops as pretreatment for ceramic uf membrane fouling control during algae laden water treatment however from the standpoint of full scale applications some problems still need to be addressed for example the dose of pms should be carefully optimized to avoid excess because excess pms is highly oxidative and would cause environmental issues the residual pms in the water can be removed by adding reducing agent such as sodium thiosulfate sodium sulfite etc furthermore to solve the problem of residual sulfate in the water subsequent advanced treatment by high pressure membrane filtration such as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis can be further utilized for algae laden water treatment 4 conclusions 1 sr aops pretreatments including fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms could promote the reduction of algal eom i e doc and uv254 as far as its removal performance was concerned the priority of the pretreatments showed an apparent regularity of uv fe ii pms fe ii pms uv pms 2 due to oxidative degradation by so4 and oh sr aops were very effective for decomposing high mw biopolymers into smaller molecules i e humic substances thus reducing the accumulation of high mw biopolymers on membrane surface 3 fe ii pms pretreatment significantly improved membrane flux and mitigated both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling whereas uv pms slightly alleviate flux decline and only reduced reversible fouling the performance of fe ii pms for fouling reduction could be intensified under uv irradiation due to the synergistic effect of uv and fe ii for pms activation 4 the dominating mechanism of eom fouling for ceramic uf membrane was converted from initial pore blockage to cake filtration during filtration and sr aops pretreatments delayed the transition and increased the transition volume to varying degrees 5 sr aops prior to uf membrane were very effective to improve the removal of typical micropollutants i e atz smt and p cnb among which uv fe ii pms showed the best performance acknowledgement this research was jointly

19293,although fungi play important roles in biogeochemical cycling in aquatic ecosystems and have received a great deal of attention much remains unknown about the living fractions of fungal communities in aquifers of the terrestrial subsurface in terms of diversity community dynamics functional roles the impact of environmental factors and presence of fungal pathogens here we address this gap in knowledge by using rna based high throughput pair end illumina sequencing analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer its gene markers to target the living fractions of groundwater fungal communities from fractured alternating carbonate siliciclastic rock aquifers of the hainich critical zone exploratory the probed levels of the hillslope multi storey aquifer system differ primarily in their oxygen and nitrogen content due to their different connections to the surface we discovered highly diverse living fungal communities 384 operational taxonomic units otus with different taxonomic affiliations and ecological functions the observed fungal communities primarily belonged to three phyla ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota perceived dynamics in the composition of living fungal communities were significantly shaped by the concentration of ammonium in the moderately agriculturally impacted aquifer system apart from fungal saprotrophs we also detected living plant and animal pathogens for the first time in this aquifer system this work also demonstrates that the rna based high throughput pair end illumina sequencing method can be used in future for water quality monitoring in terms of living fungal load and subsequent risk assessments in general this study contributes towards the growing knowledge of aquatic fungi in terrestrial subsurface biogeosphere keywords groundwater living fungi fungal diversity subsurface biosphere its critical zone exploratory 1 introduction in terrestrial environments the subsurface is markedly subdivided into unsaturated zones spanning organism rich soils less diverse subsoils parts of bedrock caves and saturated zones mainly bedrocks including aquifers the saturated zones and the aquifers hold prime importance by suppling tremendous amounts of freshwater 30 griebler and avramov 2015 to more than 25 of the world population for domestic agricultural and industrial use ford and williams 2013 martin and white 2008 because of their incredible importance to human lives aquifer systems have been studied to investigate the presence of different microbial groups and their potential roles in nutrient cycling by employing both culture dependent and culture independent high throughput methods however most of such studies with the focus on geo microbiology in subsurface aquifer systems have targeted prokaryotes bacteria and archaea flynn et al 2013 gray and engel 2013 herrmann et al 2015 lazar et al 2017 opitz et al 2014 shabarova and pernthaler 2010 shabarova et al 2014 the potential presence activity and ecological importance of microbial eukaryotes such as fungi have largely been overlooked with only a few studies specifically targeting fungi in pristine carbonate rock aquifers lategan et al 2012 nawaz et al 2016 schwab et al 2017 fungi are a wide spread group of microbial eukaryotes with 2 2 3 8 million species hawksworth and lucking 2017 that not only play significant roles in ecosystem functioning but also influence humans and human related activities mueller and bills 2004 owing to the characteristic lifestyle decomposers symbionts and pathogens the ability to develop long hyphal networks produce spores and grow as single yeast cells fungal omnipresence has widely been accepted in terrestrial tedersoo et al 2014 marine ivarsson et al 2016 xu et al 2014 and freshwater nawaz et al 2016 wurzbacher et al 2010 2011 ecosystems like in terrestrial and marine environments the ecological importance of fungi in freshwater systems is also significant in several key areas e g degradation and decomposition of organic and inorganic materials which results in subsequent recycling of nutrients and energy and ultimately impacts the downstream food web dynamics goh and hyde 1996 kagami et al 2014 kuehn 2016 wurzbacher et al 2011 when referring to the subsurface freshwater systems in fractured bedrock regions supplying fresh water for domestic purposes apart from the presence of saprotrophs the quality of the water is also heavily depending on the presence of potential pathogens hageskal et al 2009 that can infect animals plants and ultimately humans therefore to access the significance of fungi in ecosystem functioning of subsurface aquifers we need to develop a comprehensive picture of the actual metabolically active fungal communities in a previous study we analyzed total dna from groundwater samples of the hainich critical zone exploratory hainich cze well transect that accesses a pristine multi storey aquifer system hosted in thin bedded carbonate siliciclastic alternations nawaz et al 2016 the sole purpose of our previous dna based study was to get an evidence on the existence presence of fungi in the subsurface aquifer system of hainich cze and when yes assess their community composition along with the evidence of fungal presence in this ecosystem we found that the two aquifers assemblages of the middle triassic bedrocks exhibit distinct fungal communities across different relief positions and depths along the hainich hillslope that differ in their respective oxygen and nitrate concentrations küsel et al 2016 nevertheless it is important to consider that the previous studies in subsurface aquifers have used environmental dna edna to target the unexplored biodiversity of aquatic fungi and their potential roles in ecosystem functioning lategan et al 2012 nawaz et al 2016 panzer et al 2015 risse buhl et al 2013 although the edna inventory gives an overall impression of the microbial biodiversity it bears the possibility that the retrieved dna also reflects metabolically inactive or even dead species rajala et al 2011 therefore to get a better understanding of the functioning of subsurface aquifer system there is a need to capture the fractions of the fungal communities which are actually metabolically active rather than detecting the recoverable fungal communities in this study we aimed to extend the scope of available information regarding the presence of different fungal groups and community composition in terrestrial subsurface aquifers from total fungal populations to the level of living fractions we used culture independent rna based paired end illumina sequencing analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer its2 region to target the metabolically active fraction of the fungal community in two pristine aquifer assemblages in hainich cze specifically considering three sampling campaigns in different seasons we aimed to i investigate spatiotemporal variability in the diversity of living fungi in two superimposed bedrock aquifer assemblages ii identify abiotic factors shaping the living groundwater fungal community composition iii identify the living functional groups including the detection of potential animal and plant pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study took advantage of the groundwater monitoring wells of the hainich cze within the framework of collaborative research centre aquadiva crc aquadiva the hainich cze covers parts of the eastern hainich hillslope including parts of the hainich national park in the northwest of the federal state of thuringia germany as described in more detail in küsel et al 2016 the forested hainich low mountain ridge and agriculturally used gently inclined 2 eastern hillslope function as the recharge area for regionally used groundwater resources in the multi storey aquifer system of triassic bedrock kohlhepp et al 2017 the 6 km long downslope well transect accesses the subsurface habitats of sloping fractured limestone mudstone alternations at several relief positions and depths or at different distances to preferential surface recharge outcrop areas kohlhepp et al 2017 respectively fig 1 in the upper muschelkalk germanic triassic lithostratigraphic subgroup strata the multi storey aquifer system can be aggregated to the lower aquifer assemblage htl representing one aquifer in the trochitenkalk formation motk and to the upper aquifer assemblage htu hosting nine aquifer storeys that in turn aggregate the hydrostratigraphy of the thin bedded alternations of the meissner formation mom kohlhepp et al 2017 fig 1 marked differences in the two aquifer assemblages htl and htu in hydrochemistry oxicity nutrient supply due to the aquifer configuration overburden and land use were reported in küsel et al 2016 and were reconstructed in kohlhepp et al 2017 specifically the htu aquifers are generally oxygen deficient and the htl aquifer is oxygen rich 2 2 groundwater sampling groundwater samples for physico chemical and biological analysis were collected during regular four weekly joint sampling campaigns in december 2014 march 2015 and june 2015 representing winter groundwater low stand spring groundwater high stand and summer respectively water samples from sites h3 h4 and h5 were collected from seven permanently water bearing monitoring wells namely h32 h43 h52 and h53 htu and h31 h41 h51 htl the hilltop upper slope sites h1 and h2 were not sampled because of very low groundwater quantities due to seasonal or overall low local saturation prior to sampling the groundwater was pumped out and discarded using a submersible sampling pump mp1 grundfos denmark until the physico chemical parameters i e ph dissolved oxygen redox potential and specific conductivity were stabilized for molecular analysis rna extraction the collected groundwater was transferred to sterile glass bottles stored at 4 c and transported to laboratory within 1 h approximately 2 3 l of groundwater was filtered through 0 2 μm polycarbonate filters nuclepore whatman merck usa the filters were then transferred into sterile reaction tubes

ag11 hc precolumn and total organic carbon toc concentrations were determined using a toc analyzer analytikjena jena germany 2 4 rna extraction amplicon library and illumina miseq sequencing extraction of total rna was carried out from polycarbonate filter disks by using the powerwater rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa according to the manufacturer s protocol in addition to on column dnase treatment included in the protocol of the powerwater rna isolation kit rna extracts were treated with turbodna free thermo fisher scientific usa and checked for pcr amplification using universal fungal primers to ensure the absence of any traces of dna the rna extracts were then transcribed to cdna using the nebnext first strand synthesis kit including random haxamers new england biolabs usa following the manufacturers protocol the cdna extracts were purified using minelute columns qiagen to target the living fungal community an its2 library was constructed using the primer combination fits7 ihrmark et al 2012 and its4 white et al 1990 which anneal to the 5 8s and lsu rrna genes respectively the pcr reaction mix included 5 ng of cdna extract as template 15 pmol of each forward primer fits7 and reverse primer its4 in 20 μl volume of mytaq buffer containing 1 5 units mytaq dna polymerase bioline and 2 μl of biostabii pcr enhancer sigma usa for each sample the forward and reverse primers had the same 8 nt barcode sequence pcrs were carried out for 30 cycles using the following parameters 2 min 96 c pre denaturation 96 c for 15s 50 c for 30s 72 c for 60s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min the concentration of amplicons was determined by gel electrophoresis when needed pcr products showing low yields were further amplified for 3 7 cycles cdna samples that failed to give pcr products were diluted 10 times and the pcr reaction was repeated about 20 ng amplicons of each sample were pooled for up to 48 samples carrying different barcodes the amplicon pools were purified with one volume ampure xp beads agencourt to remove primer dimer and other short mispriming products followed by an additional purification on minelute columns qiagen about 100 ng of each purified amplicon pool was used to construct illumina libraries using the ovation rapid dr multiplex system 1 96 nugen illumina libraries were pooled and size selected by preparative gel electrophoresis sequencing was done on an illumina miseq using v3 chemistry illumina at lgc genomics berlin 2 5 sequence processing and bioinformatic analysis sequential bioinformatic analysis was performed to filter out high quality reads from the paired end sequences generated by the illumina miseq sequencing platform using mothur schloss et al 2009 and obi tools boyer et al 2016 software suits briefly read pairs were extracted from raw libraries if the two reads hold the expected primer forward primer for forward library reverse primer for reverse library at its 5 end forward and reverse raw reads from the same sample were assembled by using the simple bayesian algorithm with a threshold of 0 6 and a minimum overlap of 20 nucleotides as implemented in pandaseq masella et al 2012 to extract high quality reads all the assembled reads were trimmed with the following parameters i minimum average phred score of 25 on the trimmed length ii no ambiguities in the sequence length and iii maximum length of 10 homopolymers in the sequence the reads were then pre clustered using cd hit est allowing a maximum of 1 of dissimilarity and with only one base allowed per indel niu et al 2010 in order to merge those reads arising likely from sequencing errors huse et al 2010 chimeric sequences were detected using the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 as implemented in mothur after removal of chimeric sequences reads from each sample were pooled together and were dereplicated into unique sequences and sorted by decreasing abundance the resulting reads were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the cd hit est algorithm fu et al 2012 at a threshold of 97 sequence similarity the otu representative sequences the most abundant sequence in each otu were taxonomically assigned against the reference sequences from the unite database version unite v7 koljalg et al 2013 using the naive bayesian classifier wang et al 2007 as implemented in mothur using the default parameters the sequences identified as fungi were further classified against the full version of the unite v7 0 database to improve their taxonomic annotation finally all the sequences identified as fungi were again classified against fungal sequences of the unite database augmented with non fungal eukaryotic sequences from ncbi version 211 benson et al 2013 in order to detect sequences from non target organisms in order to assess the effect of the removal of rare otus which potentially might originate from artificial sequences kunin et al 2010 we performed a mantel test using bray curtis dissimilarities to assess the correlations between the whole matrix and a matrix excluding the rare otus singletons doubletons and tripletons nawaz et al 2016 the result indicated that the removal of rare otus from the total community had no effect on the fungal community composition rmantel 0 999 p 0 001 therefore the final dataset without rare otus was used for further statistical analysis unless otherwise stated the fungal otus taxa retrieved in this study living fungi were compared to the fungal otus from our previous study nawaz et al 2016 using the cd hit est 2d algorithm at 97 sequence similarity threshold http weizhong lab ucsd edu cd hit finally representative sequences of the dominant fungal otus removing the rare taxa were assigned to functional or ecological groups using the funguild database nguyen et al 2016 the fungal its2 raw sequence dataset are deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra under bioproject number prjna436133 2 6 statistical analysis the r r development core team 2015 and past v2 17 software hammer et al 2001 were used for the data analysis the otu matrix was randomly normalized to the smallest number of reads per sample to get minimum common sequencing depth of 1024 reads for the generation of rarefaction curves and alpha diversity calculation the otu data matrix including single double and triple tons was used whereas for all the other analyses the abundant otu data without single double and triple tons matrix was used unless otherwise stated sample based individual rarefaction curves hurlbert 1971 were generated for all the groundwater samples from lower and upper aquifer assemblages to access the sampling efforts by using the function diversity in past in this study we used the observed fungal otu richness as the measure for fungal diversity differences in the species richness between the sampling seasons spring summer and winter were compared using anova followed by tukey post hoc test whereas the differences in the species richness between two aquifer assemblages lower and upper aquifer assemblages were compared using two sample t test in past to minimize the effect of differences in the abundance measure of different otus in the data set we used presence absence data for the community composition analysis using jaccard s dissimilarity index by using the vegan package oksanen et al 2015 implemented in r to visualize the fungal community composition in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages across the different sampled seasons we used two dimensional non metric multidimensional scaling 2d nmds ordination based on jaccard dissimilarity index using the vegan package to assess similarities in the fungal community composition of lower and upper aquifer assemblages we performed non parametric multivariate analysis of variances npmanova using past we also tested for differences in the homogeneity of multivariate dispersion between the two groups htl and htu using betadisper function in the vegan package of r physico chemical parameters of the groundwater samples from both aquifer assemblages were fitted to the nmds ordination plot using the envfit function of the vegan package as implemented in r goodness of fit statistics r 2 were calculated with p values based on 999 permutations based on the goodness of fit statistics p 0 05 all significant physico chemical parameters were further analyzed by distance based redundancy analysis dbrda using the jaccard dissimilarity index with the vegan package function capscale to determine the most influential physico chemical parameter describing the living fungal community composition for all the analysis a p value of 0 05 was considered as significant and p values between 0 05 and 0 1 were considered as marginally significant core genus was defined as the genus that consistently appeared in at least 90 of the samples caporaso et al 2011 huse et al 2012 loudon et al 2014 being considered for the analysis 3 results 3 1 physico chemical parameters based clustering of groundwater wells the milieu of the two aquifer assemblages is characterized by neutral ph values between 7 2 and 7 4 and temperatures ranging from 8 8 to 10 1 c similarly hco3 measured as acid neutralizing capacity and toc 2 mg l 1 of the samples from the lower and upper aquifer assemblages did not differ significantly the mean specific electrical conductivity from both aquifer assemblages ranges between 514 7 and 770 3 μs cm 1 in the lower aquifer assemblage the mean oxygen

were higher compared to the anoxic wells h42 h43 h52 and h53 except for well h32 which had the highest measured mean nitrate concentration 31 85 3 4 mg l 1 similarly higher mean concentrations of total sulfur st 30 10 0 57 102 97 3 35 mg l 1 and sulfate 89 4 0 1 296 1 15 9 mg l 1 were also observed in wells of lower aquifer assemblage contrary to this water samples from the anoxic htu wells

positive correlation with pc1 whereas specific electrical conductivity redox potential concentrations of dissolved o2 ca2 st so4 2 and no3 showed a significant p 0 05 negative correlation with pc1 fig 2 specifically the concentrations of so4 2 and st showed a significant p 0 05 positive correlation with pc2 which separated the samples from well h51 in the lower aquifer assemblage from the rest furthermore the significant p 0 05 positive correlation of the concentrations of nh4 and na with pc 1 separated the anoxic wells h42 h43 h52 h53 from h4 and h5 groundwater samples from well h42 and h43 have higher tic and hco3 but lower nh4 k and na compared to the groundwater samples from the wells h52 and h53 of the upper aquifer assemblage 3 2 overview of bioinformatic analysis a total of 447 613 raw reads were generated by paired end illumina miseq sequencing of the water samples from lower and upper aquifer assemblages at sites h3 h4 and h5 after trimming and removal of chimeric sequences a total of 149 295 33 35 high quality fungal its2 reads were used in the downstream analysis sequence clustering at 97 similarity followed by the removal of non target sequences 7 otus represented by 59 reads resulted in separating out a total of 1443 fungal otus represented by 17 963 reads the removal of rare otus single double and triple tons resulted in the final dataset with 382 otus comprising of 16 701 reads mantel test based on the bray curtis distance measures with 999 permutations rmantel 0 999 p 0 001 indicated no impact of the removal of rare otus from the dataset the number of reads after different bioinformatic steps are summarized in table s2 3 3 distribution of metabolically active fungi in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages the final dataset from the two aquifer assemblages contained 382 fungal otus which could be taxonomically assigned to 4 phyla 12 classes 34 orders 54 families and 83 genera out of these 382 identified fungal otus 94 and 195 otus were exclusively present in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages respectively while 93 otus 24 3 were shared between the two aquifer assemblages the sample based individual rarefaction curves for all the samples from the upper and lower aquifer assemblage were close to saturation indicating towards the undiscovered community in the system figure s1 we used the observed otu richness number of otus as a measure of the diversity of living fungi purahong et al 2016 we found that the living fungal diversity differed between the two aquifer assemblages htl and htu and within the aquifer assemblages wells h3 h4 and h5 fig 3 a specifically when all the htl wells h31 h41 h51 were considered together the highest number of living fungal otus was observed in the groundwater of well h41 in winter 153 otus while the lowest number of living fungal otus was observed in the well h41 in summer 68 otus similarly for the htu wells h32 h42 h43 h52 h53 the highest number of living fungal otus was observed in well h53 in winter and the lowest number of living fungal otus was found in well h32 in summer overall in the htl and htu groundwater wells the highest living fungal diversity was observed in winter fig 3a likewise when all the samples from htl and htu aquifer assemblages were unified according to the sampling seasons anova followed by a tukey post hoc pair wise comparison showed the fungal species richness in winter was significantly different p 0 05 anova from those in summer and spring fig 3b considering the fungal taxonomic distribution a total of four fungal phyla ascomycota basidiomycota chytridiomycota and zygomycota were found in the upper muschelkalk groundwater samples fig 4 the living fungal communities were primarily dominated by three phyla together accounting for 58 of the total relative abundance the phyla ascomycota and basidiomycota were the two most frequently observed phyla in both aquifer assemblages accounting for 55 of the total relative abundance whereas chytridiomycota and zygomycota contributed little to the overall taxonomic distribution at phylum level 4 of the total relative abundance it is important to consider that the phylum chytridiomycota typical of lake and sediment ecosystems was only detected in the groundwater samples from wells h32 in the oxic domain of the upper aquifer assemblage fig 4 in the final dataset according to the unite database 40 of the abundant otus were identified as fungi but without further taxonomic resolution among the oxic environments of the lower aquifer assemblage in well h31 the phylum ascomycota was highly represented 89 with small fractions of the phylum zygomycota 2 in spring in contrast in summer the phylum basidiomycota appeared with 12 relative abundance along with ascomycota 73 the groundwater samples in winter from the well h41 were dominated by members of phylum basidiomycota 44 followed by ascomycota 23 and zygomycota 6 whereas in spring the phylum zygomycota was not observed at all and the relative abundance of ascomycota and basidiomycota also decreased slightly 23 10 and 44 41 respectively interestingly in summer the phylum ascomycota was highly 61 and basidiomycota was least detected 23 when compared to the winter and spring samples fig 4 in well h51 associated with more sulfate and calcium ions the phylum ascomycota was highly detected 53 relative abundance with only 7 of basidiomycota in winter surprisingly the relative abundance of ascomycota and basidiomycota decreased enormously in spring to 4 and 5 respectively similarly in the htu well h32 associated with higher nitrate concentrations the living fungal taxonomic distribution was primarily contributed by the phyla of ascomycota and basidiomycota in winter and spring in summer the phylum ascomycota was highly detected 60 while basidiomycota contributed only little 17 the phylum chytridiomycota was only detected in the groundwater samples form well h32 in spring fig 4 among the anoxic environments of the upper aquifer assemblage wells h42 and h43 showed different distributions of the living fungal phyla compared to the wells h52 and h53 fig 4 in winter the phylum ascomycota was highly detected in well h43 54 compared to well h42 8 surprisingly in well h43 the relative abundance of the phylum ascomycota was reduced considerably in spring to 8 compared to winter 54 in the anoxic groundwater wells at site h5 h52 and h53 the phylum zygomycota was highly detected 23 in h52 and 27 in h53 in winter compared to all other wells either in lower or upper aquifer assemblage 3 4 well and aquifer assemblage specific core fungal genera considering the sampling seasons together for the individual groundwater wells in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages we identified the core genera associated with each specific well table 2 in the htl we identified seven and three genera from the wells h31 and h51 respectively which accounted for 38 52 and 8 74 of the total sequences in their respective wells in the htu core genera ranging between one and three were identified from wells h32 h42 h43 h52 and h53 and the fraction of sequences associated with these genera were 14 21 3 31 1 16 3 61 and 1 of the total sequences in their corresponding wells when all the groundwater wells in the lower aquifer assemblage were considered together mycosphaerella was identified as core genus in the htl which was represented by 5 5 of the total sequences in contrast no core genus could be identified in the htu across all wells 3 5 fungal community composition and physico chemical parameters the living fungal community composition in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages is presented in two dimensional non metric multidimensional scaling 2d nmds ordination based on presence absence data using jaccard distance measures fig 5 the npmanova analysis showed that the living fungal community composition of the two aquifer assemblages are significantly different from one another f 1 623 p 0 003 with no significant effect on multivariate dispersion between the groups betadisper f 0 77 p 0 39 in the nmds ordination the groundwater samples from the htu except from h42 and h43 appeared to be in close proximity separating the samples from the htl fig 5 this indicated that fungal communities of the respective aquifer assemblages are most similar the physico chemical parameters of the groundwater samples important for fungal growth were correlated with the living fungal community composition to identify the factors that played significant roles in shaping the community in the two aquifer assemblages we found that a set of physico chemical parameters environmental abiotic variables were significant predictors of the living fungal communities in the aquifers the significant and marginally significant physico chemical parameters are presented in table 3 these parameters included extraction temperature ph total inorganic carbon tic and concentrations of ammonium orthophosphate total iron and potassium among all the parameters the differences in the living fungal community composition between the two aquifer assemblages were significantly explained by ammonium nh4 f 2 0742 p 0 001 determined by distance based redundancy analysis dbrda 3 6 functional groups in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages detection of potential animal and plant pathogens to get meaningful ecological and functional categories of the identified fungal otus in our dataset we used funguild an annotation tool for parsing fungal ngs datasets in general from the two aquifer assemblages fungi belonging to three different trophic modes i e saprotroph 57 otus 15 pathotrophs 34 otus 9 and symbiotrophs 9 otus 2 4 were identified within each trophic mode we also identified fungi belonging to different ecological guilds fungi within the pathotrophic mode were subcategorized into animal 16 otus 47 plant 17 otus 31 and fungal pathogens 3 otus 9 these ecological functional groups were distributed along different fungal phyla animal and plant pathogens were highly represented by the phylum ascomycota 89 100 in contrast ectomycorrhizal fungi and fungal pathogens were highly represented by the phylum basidiomycota 60 100 and saprotrophs were represented by three different phyla i e ascomycota 37 basidiomycota 31 and zygomycota 28 the fungal otus with unidentified ecological functional groups made up the largest fraction in the dataset 259 otus 68 4 discussion when carbonate rock aquifers in the terrestrial subsurface biosphere are explicitly taken into account a huge information gap exits about fungal diversity community composition and roles of environmental factors in shaping these communities this paucity of knowledge is primarily due to the fact that in the past the most common methods used for studying aquatic fungal diversity were either based on the microscopic identification of asexual spores or culture based identifications grossart and rojas jimenez 2016 all such methods have their intrinsic limitations which results in incomplete description of the actual fungal diversity in an ecosystem jeewon and hyde 2007 schmit and lodge 2005 keeping in mind the potential inherent biases of culture independent techniques lucking et al 2014 tedersoo et al 2010 this work provides an in depth picture and novel insights about living fungal diversity community composition and fungal functional groups in pristine aquifer assemblages of the hainich cze in the terrestrial subsurface biosphere along with that it also encompasses the role of environmental factors in shaping such community compositions 4 1 aquifers harbor highly diverse living fungal communities to our knowledge despite the oligotrophic and pristine conditions of the studied subsurface ecosystem we have reported a diverse pool of living aquatic fungi than what has been published in previous studies from bedrock aquifers or related freshwater habitats however a direct comparison of our findings about living fungal diversity and community composition with previously published studies is difficult because there are few studies about aquatic fungi in subsurface pristine aquifer systems for instance by using culture based techniques lategan et al 2012 have reported 83 fungal strains from shallow unconfined aquifers in australia and hageskal et al 2006 isolated 24 species from norwegian groundwater sources specifically from the same aquifer system in hainich cze up to 437 fungal otus have been reported by sequencing 18s rna gene fragments risse buhl et al 2013 and fungal its regions nawaz et al 2016 however it is important to consider that the studies mentioned above were dna based which target the total communities whereas in this work targeting the living fractions of the fungal communities from the groundwater samples we reported 382 fungal otus such huge numbers and diversities of living fungal otus reflect the fact that subsurface aquifer system is much more vibrant from the mycological point of view than thought before it is also important to consider that 40 of the retrieved fungal otus could only be identified as fungi but without further taxonomic resolution this indicates either insufficient representation of the aquatic fungal sequences in the actual databases or that these fungal species may not have been characterized before and could be considered as potentially novel fungal groups specialized for aquatic habitats in either case this points towards an unexplored pool of fungal species in aquifers interestingly by comparing the living fungal otus detected in this study with the fungal otus from our previous dna based study using 454 sequencing nawaz et al 2016 we found an overlap of only 5 8 of the living fungal otus with the ones previously reported this shows that there exists a marked difference between recoverable fungal community and the community that is living in the environment consequently this signifies the importance of the rna based approach used in this study to target the living players of the fungal communities to better understated the role of microbes in the ecosystem functioning of such habitats the fungal diversity varies across the different sampling campaigns which represent different seasons spring summer and winter higher living fungal diversity of the winter samples from both aquifer assemblages compared to spring and summer samples indicate the temporal variability and natural seasonal dynamics of the fungal communities this trend could be associated with the groundwater low and high stand in the respective seasons which points to the dilution effect of the fungal biomass but to confirm this hypothesis repeated measurements in the same season would be needed in future to confirm such seasonal dynamics in the studied aquifer system interestingly within the same aquifer assemblage different sampling wells showed variable distributions of the fungal phyla this finding is in good agreement with our previous study nawaz et al 2016 specifically when all the groundwater wells in the lower oxic aquifer htl are considered together the members of dothideomycetes were most frequently identified in wells h31 and h41 fungi from the class dothideomycetes were also reported to be abundant in the aquifers korbel et al 2017 this is the most diverse and largest fungal class of the phylum ascomycota kirk et al 2008 which is a heterogeneous group of organisms that persists in most of the habitats where fungi can be found additionally in our dataset we also found a fraction of fungal otus belonging to family nectriaceae in anoxic groundwater wells it has been reported that in the absence of oxygen facultative anaerobic microscopic fungi from family nectriaceae are capable of using nitrate as alternative terminal electron acceptor in their respiration process kurakov et al 2008 in the lower aquifer assemblage the genus mycosphaerella was identified as core genus the members of the genus mycosphaerella are generally classified as endophytes saprotrophs and symbionts but most of the members are plant pathogens causing heavy loss to the agricultural crops worldwide crous et al 2001 moreover by comparing the reported core fungal genera in this study with the previously published studies we identified that the genera alternaria aureobasidium beauveria and mortierella were reported before in groundwater surface water and lakes oliveira et al 2013 wurzbacher et al 2016 and the genus malassezia from deep sea sediments amend 2014 singh et al 2012 and deep groundwater bedrock fractured zones sohlberg et al 2015 whereas the rest of the genera observed in this study were reported for the first time in terrestrial subsurface aquifers some of the fungal genera we identified in this study have also been reported in different terrestrial habitats which suggests that those fungi may have non aquatic origin or there is a life style transition in their life cycle shearer et al 2007 vijaykrishna and hyde 2006 4 2 factors corelating the living fungal community composition the groundwater wells accessing the two aquifer assemblages in hainich cze showed different environmental conditions as indicated by distinct clustering patterns based on their physico chemical parameters fig 2 this result is supported by previous studies which also reported marked differences in the oxygen and nitrate contents along with the concentrations of sulfate and iron in the two aquifers htl and htu kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 schwab et al 2017 generally differences in physico chemical parameters of the water samples are important in shaping aquatic fungal community compositions gulis and suberkropp 2004 manoharachary and ramarao 1981 medeiros et al 2009 in our case we found differences in the living fungal communities in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages and these variations in the overall community composition was significantly correlated to the ammonium nh4 concentration similarly strong correlations between fungal diversity and ammonium and nitrate concentrations have also been previously reported in deep fractured zones sohlberg et al 2015 in marine environments tisthammer et al 2016 and anoxic sub seafloor sediments orsi et al 2013 although the employed methods set of measured environmental variables the studied ecosystem and the geographic locations of the studies mentioned above are not directly comparable with our study but they all agree that the environmental filtering is important in the aquatic fungal community composition in oxic conditions fungi use oxygen as substrate to produce energy for their biological activities but the studied aquifer system in the hainich cze also has sub oxic to anoxic domains in the upper aquifer assemblage kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 to support their growth under anoxic conditions filamentous fungi members of sub kingdom dikarya have been reported to induce a set of genes to produce o2 independent energy producing metabolic mechanisms takasaki et al 2004 by such oxygen independent metabolic mechanisms fungi can reduce nitrate to ammonium to gain energy takasaki et al 2004 zhou et al 2010 this phenomenon has been previously attributed to the facultative or anaerobic bacteria and archaea but growing evidence suggesting that this mechanism is also widely distributed among many eukaryotic microbes including different fungal groups kamp et al 2015 zhou et al 2002 2010 such fungal abilities to thrive in the anoxic conditions of the hainich aquifer systems points towards their versatile mode of survival in adverse conditions and their potential roles in the nutrient cycling in the terrestrial subsurface aquifers 4 3 diverse functional groups inhabit the aquifers in the past fungi have been thought to have negligible ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems but it has been established that apart from terrestrial environments fungi also play important roles in element cycling and mineralization in aquatic ecosystems ivarsson et al 2016 we found that in our studied aquifer system after unidentified fungal functional groups saprotrophs were highly detected in an ecosystem saprotrophs are considered as backbone of the elemental cycling processes therefore the living fungal saprotrophs in the studied oligotrophic aquifer system may contribute to the solubilisation of minerals and decomposition of natural compounds into simpler substance due to their broad spectrum of enzymatic capabilities giraud et al 2001 junghanns et al 2005 subsequently those simpler substances could be used further by other organisms in the aquifer food web apart from the fungal groups involved in elemental cycling in subsurface aquifers the pathotrophs including animal and plant pathogens are also important to consider such aquifers around the world are considered major source of water for domestic purposes martin and white 2008 therefore the presence of potential animal and plant pathogens in such aquifer systems cannot be overlooked as exposure to pathogenic fungi would have health concerns for humans pereira et al 2010 specifically in the analyzed groundwater samples we found fungal otus that are known animal plants and human pathogens i e rhodotorula mucilaginosa opportunistic human pathogen in immune compromised patients da cunha et al 2009 kaur et al 2007 paecilomyces lilacinus human and animal pathogen luangsa ard et al 2011 lecanicillium lecanii entomopathogenic fungus and blumeria graminis plant pathogen cowger et al 2018 ilyas et al 2014 pathogenicity is one aspect but fungal presence in water sources is also associated with taste and odor problems doggett 2000 pereira et al 2010 in our previous dna based study nawaz et al 2016 fungal plant pathogens were also detected however in dna based approaches it is quite possible to detect the dead dormant species as well rajala et al 2011 but the detection of fungal plant pathogens in this rna based study confirms that these groups are not only present in the aquifers but also are also alive considering the geological structural setting of hainich cze our targeted subsurface aquifer system is primarily recharged by the infiltration of rainfall and snow melts and the recharge areas are located in different land use types i e forest grassland and cropland but dominated by forest land use kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 during the recharge events the location of the recharge areas not only impacts the kind of organic matter that is being transported with water but also the type of microbes lehman 2007 somaratne 2014 the detection of living plant and animal pathogens in our dataset points to a surface origin of unknown percentage of the living fungal groups which along with infiltrating water might have been transported from the surface to the subsurface considering the fractured zones in the bedrock aquifer system nevertheless the fate of surface sourced fungi in the aquatic subsurface oligotrophic environment is relatively unknown in the literature 5 conclusions following conclusions can be drawn within the framework of present study investigating subsurface groundwater aquifers using high throughput illumina sequencing allowed us to identify a diverse both taxonomic and functional pool of metabolically active fungal communities the living fungal communities in the shallow aquifers in the mixed carbonate siliciclastic alternations were significantly corelated with ammonium and tic supply an overlap of only 5 8 of the living fungal otus with the ones in the dna based study highlighted a marked difference between total fungal community and the community that is living in an environment in the targeted subsurface aquifer system we detected living fungal otus that are known plant pathogens in the literature and the databases the presence of these fungal groups in such environments points towards the transitional ability of fungi in their life styles lifestyle switching but further studies are required in the future to comprehensively test such hypothesis in aquatic habitats we suggest that the fungal meta barcoding approach used in this study can be used to monitor and assess the quality of water supplies considering the presence of potential fungal pathogens which could be harmful for animals plants and humans furthermore the role of fungal saprotrophs in such oligotrophic subsurface environment is

19293,although fungi play important roles in biogeochemical cycling in aquatic ecosystems and have received a great deal of attention much remains unknown about the living fractions of fungal communities in aquifers of the terrestrial subsurface in terms of diversity community dynamics functional roles the impact of environmental factors and presence of fungal pathogens here we address this gap in knowledge by using rna based high throughput pair end illumina sequencing analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer its gene markers to target the living fractions of groundwater fungal communities from fractured alternating carbonate siliciclastic rock aquifers of the hainich critical zone exploratory the probed levels of the hillslope multi storey aquifer system differ primarily in their oxygen and nitrogen content due to their different connections to the surface we discovered highly diverse living fungal communities 384 operational taxonomic units otus with different taxonomic affiliations and ecological functions the observed fungal communities primarily belonged to three phyla ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota perceived dynamics in the composition of living fungal communities were significantly shaped by the concentration of ammonium in the moderately agriculturally impacted aquifer system apart from fungal saprotrophs we also detected living plant and animal pathogens for the first time in this aquifer system this work also demonstrates that the rna based high throughput pair end illumina sequencing method can be used in future for water quality monitoring in terms of living fungal load and subsequent risk assessments in general this study contributes towards the growing knowledge of aquatic fungi in terrestrial subsurface biogeosphere keywords groundwater living fungi fungal diversity subsurface biosphere its critical zone exploratory 1 introduction in terrestrial environments the subsurface is markedly subdivided into unsaturated zones spanning organism rich soils less diverse subsoils parts of bedrock caves and saturated zones mainly bedrocks including aquifers the saturated zones and the aquifers hold prime importance by suppling tremendous amounts of freshwater 30 griebler and avramov 2015 to more than 25 of the world population for domestic agricultural and industrial use ford and williams 2013 martin and white 2008 because of their incredible importance to human lives aquifer systems have been studied to investigate the presence of different microbial groups and their potential roles in nutrient cycling by employing both culture dependent and culture independent high throughput methods however most of such studies with the focus on geo microbiology in subsurface aquifer systems have targeted prokaryotes bacteria and archaea flynn et al 2013 gray and engel 2013 herrmann et al 2015 lazar et al 2017 opitz et al 2014 shabarova and pernthaler 2010 shabarova et al 2014 the potential presence activity and ecological importance of microbial eukaryotes such as fungi have largely been overlooked with only a few studies specifically targeting fungi in pristine carbonate rock aquifers lategan et al 2012 nawaz et al 2016 schwab et al 2017 fungi are a wide spread group of microbial eukaryotes with 2 2 3 8 million species hawksworth and lucking 2017 that not only play significant roles in ecosystem functioning but also influence humans and human related activities mueller and bills 2004 owing to the characteristic lifestyle decomposers symbionts and pathogens the ability to develop long hyphal networks produce spores and grow as single yeast cells fungal omnipresence has widely been accepted in terrestrial tedersoo et al 2014 marine ivarsson et al 2016 xu et al 2014 and freshwater nawaz et al 2016 wurzbacher et al 2010 2011 ecosystems like in terrestrial and marine environments the ecological importance of fungi in freshwater systems is also significant in several key areas e g degradation and decomposition of organic and inorganic materials which results in subsequent recycling of nutrients and energy and ultimately impacts the downstream food web dynamics goh and hyde 1996 kagami et al 2014 kuehn 2016 wurzbacher et al 2011 when referring to the subsurface freshwater systems in fractured bedrock regions supplying fresh water for domestic purposes apart from the presence of saprotrophs the quality of the water is also heavily depending on the presence of potential pathogens hageskal et al 2009 that can infect animals plants and ultimately humans therefore to access the significance of fungi in ecosystem functioning of subsurface aquifers we need to develop a comprehensive picture of the actual metabolically active fungal communities in a previous study we analyzed total dna from groundwater samples of the hainich critical zone exploratory hainich cze well transect that accesses a pristine multi storey aquifer system hosted in thin bedded carbonate siliciclastic alternations nawaz et al 2016 the sole purpose of our previous dna based study was to get an evidence on the existence presence of fungi in the subsurface aquifer system of hainich cze and when yes assess their community composition along with the evidence of fungal presence in this ecosystem we found that the two aquifers assemblages of the middle triassic bedrocks exhibit distinct fungal communities across different relief positions and depths along the hainich hillslope that differ in their respective oxygen and nitrate concentrations küsel et al 2016 nevertheless it is important to consider that the previous studies in subsurface aquifers have used environmental dna edna to target the unexplored biodiversity of aquatic fungi and their potential roles in ecosystem functioning lategan et al 2012 nawaz et al 2016 panzer et al 2015 risse buhl et al 2013 although the edna inventory gives an overall impression of the microbial biodiversity it bears the possibility that the retrieved dna also reflects metabolically inactive or even dead species rajala et al 2011 therefore to get a better understanding of the functioning of subsurface aquifer system there is a need to capture the fractions of the fungal communities which are actually metabolically active rather than detecting the recoverable fungal communities in this study we aimed to extend the scope of available information regarding the presence of different fungal groups and community composition in terrestrial subsurface aquifers from total fungal populations to the level of living fractions we used culture independent rna based paired end illumina sequencing analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer its2 region to target the metabolically active fraction of the fungal community in two pristine aquifer assemblages in hainich cze specifically considering three sampling campaigns in different seasons we aimed to i investigate spatiotemporal variability in the diversity of living fungi in two superimposed bedrock aquifer assemblages ii identify abiotic factors shaping the living groundwater fungal community composition iii identify the living functional groups including the detection of potential animal and plant pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study took advantage of the groundwater monitoring wells of the hainich cze within the framework of collaborative research centre aquadiva crc aquadiva the hainich cze covers parts of the eastern hainich hillslope including parts of the hainich national park in the northwest of the federal state of thuringia germany as described in more detail in küsel et al 2016 the forested hainich low mountain ridge and agriculturally used gently inclined 2 eastern hillslope function as the recharge area for regionally used groundwater resources in the multi storey aquifer system of triassic bedrock kohlhepp et al 2017 the 6 km long downslope well transect accesses the subsurface habitats of sloping fractured limestone mudstone alternations at several relief positions and depths or at different distances to preferential surface recharge outcrop areas kohlhepp et al 2017 respectively fig 1 in the upper muschelkalk germanic triassic lithostratigraphic subgroup strata the multi storey aquifer system can be aggregated to the lower aquifer assemblage htl representing one aquifer in the trochitenkalk formation motk and to the upper aquifer assemblage htu hosting nine aquifer storeys that in turn aggregate the hydrostratigraphy of the thin bedded alternations of the meissner formation mom kohlhepp et al 2017 fig 1 marked differences in the two aquifer assemblages htl and htu in hydrochemistry oxicity nutrient supply due to the aquifer configuration overburden and land use were reported in küsel et al 2016 and were reconstructed in kohlhepp et al 2017 specifically the htu aquifers are generally oxygen deficient and the htl aquifer is oxygen rich 2 2 groundwater sampling groundwater samples for physico chemical and biological analysis were collected during regular four weekly joint sampling campaigns in december 2014 march 2015 and june 2015 representing winter groundwater low stand spring groundwater high stand and summer respectively water samples from sites h3 h4 and h5 were collected from seven permanently water bearing monitoring wells namely h32 h43 h52 and h53 htu and h31 h41 h51 htl the hilltop upper slope sites h1 and h2 were not sampled because of very low groundwater quantities due to seasonal or overall low local saturation prior to sampling the groundwater was pumped out and discarded using a submersible sampling pump mp1 grundfos denmark until the physico chemical parameters i e ph dissolved oxygen redox potential and specific conductivity were stabilized for molecular analysis rna extraction the collected groundwater was transferred to sterile glass bottles stored at 4 c and transported to laboratory within 1 h approximately 2 3 l of groundwater was filtered through 0 2 μm polycarbonate filters nuclepore whatman merck usa the filters were then transferred into sterile reaction tubes

ag11 hc precolumn and total organic carbon toc concentrations were determined using a toc analyzer analytikjena jena germany 2 4 rna extraction amplicon library and illumina miseq sequencing extraction of total rna was carried out from polycarbonate filter disks by using the powerwater rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa according to the manufacturer s protocol in addition to on column dnase treatment included in the protocol of the powerwater rna isolation kit rna extracts were treated with turbodna free thermo fisher scientific usa and checked for pcr amplification using universal fungal primers to ensure the absence of any traces of dna the rna extracts were then transcribed to cdna using the nebnext first strand synthesis kit including random haxamers new england biolabs usa following the manufacturers protocol the cdna extracts were purified using minelute columns qiagen to target the living fungal community an its2 library was constructed using the primer combination fits7 ihrmark et al 2012 and its4 white et al 1990 which anneal to the 5 8s and lsu rrna genes respectively the pcr reaction mix included 5 ng of cdna extract as template 15 pmol of each forward primer fits7 and reverse primer its4 in 20 μl volume of mytaq buffer containing 1 5 units mytaq dna polymerase bioline and 2 μl of biostabii pcr enhancer sigma usa for each sample the forward and reverse primers had the same 8 nt barcode sequence pcrs were carried out for 30 cycles using the following parameters 2 min 96 c pre denaturation 96 c for 15s 50 c for 30s 72 c for 60s and a final extension at 72 c for 5 min the concentration of amplicons was determined by gel electrophoresis when needed pcr products showing low yields were further amplified for 3 7 cycles cdna samples that failed to give pcr products were diluted 10 times and the pcr reaction was repeated about 20 ng amplicons of each sample were pooled for up to 48 samples carrying different barcodes the amplicon pools were purified with one volume ampure xp beads agencourt to remove primer dimer and other short mispriming products followed by an additional purification on minelute columns qiagen about 100 ng of each purified amplicon pool was used to construct illumina libraries using the ovation rapid dr multiplex system 1 96 nugen illumina libraries were pooled and size selected by preparative gel electrophoresis sequencing was done on an illumina miseq using v3 chemistry illumina at lgc genomics berlin 2 5 sequence processing and bioinformatic analysis sequential bioinformatic analysis was performed to filter out high quality reads from the paired end sequences generated by the illumina miseq sequencing platform using mothur schloss et al 2009 and obi tools boyer et al 2016 software suits briefly read pairs were extracted from raw libraries if the two reads hold the expected primer forward primer for forward library reverse primer for reverse library at its 5 end forward and reverse raw reads from the same sample were assembled by using the simple bayesian algorithm with a threshold of 0 6 and a minimum overlap of 20 nucleotides as implemented in pandaseq masella et al 2012 to extract high quality reads all the assembled reads were trimmed with the following parameters i minimum average phred score of 25 on the trimmed length ii no ambiguities in the sequence length and iii maximum length of 10 homopolymers in the sequence the reads were then pre clustered using cd hit est allowing a maximum of 1 of dissimilarity and with only one base allowed per indel niu et al 2010 in order to merge those reads arising likely from sequencing errors huse et al 2010 chimeric sequences were detected using the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 as implemented in mothur after removal of chimeric sequences reads from each sample were pooled together and were dereplicated into unique sequences and sorted by decreasing abundance the resulting reads were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the cd hit est algorithm fu et al 2012 at a threshold of 97 sequence similarity the otu representative sequences the most abundant sequence in each otu were taxonomically assigned against the reference sequences from the unite database version unite v7 koljalg et al 2013 using the naive bayesian classifier wang et al 2007 as implemented in mothur using the default parameters the sequences identified as fungi were further classified against the full version of the unite v7 0 database to improve their taxonomic annotation finally all the sequences identified as fungi were again classified against fungal sequences of the unite database augmented with non fungal eukaryotic sequences from ncbi version 211 benson et al 2013 in order to detect sequences from non target organisms in order to assess the effect of the removal of rare otus which potentially might originate from artificial sequences kunin et al 2010 we performed a mantel test using bray curtis dissimilarities to assess the correlations between the whole matrix and a matrix excluding the rare otus singletons doubletons and tripletons nawaz et al 2016 the result indicated that the removal of rare otus from the total community had no effect on the fungal community composition rmantel 0 999 p 0 001 therefore the final dataset without rare otus was used for further statistical analysis unless otherwise stated the fungal otus taxa retrieved in this study living fungi were compared to the fungal otus from our previous study nawaz et al 2016 using the cd hit est 2d algorithm at 97 sequence similarity threshold http weizhong lab ucsd edu cd hit finally representative sequences of the dominant fungal otus removing the rare taxa were assigned to functional or ecological groups using the funguild database nguyen et al 2016 the fungal its2 raw sequence dataset are deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra under bioproject number prjna436133 2 6 statistical analysis the r r development core team 2015 and past v2 17 software hammer et al 2001 were used for the data analysis the otu matrix was randomly normalized to the smallest number of reads per sample to get minimum common sequencing depth of 1024 reads for the generation of rarefaction curves and alpha diversity calculation the otu data matrix including single double and triple tons was used whereas for all the other analyses the abundant otu data without single double and triple tons matrix was used unless otherwise stated sample based individual rarefaction curves hurlbert 1971 were generated for all the groundwater samples from lower and upper aquifer assemblages to access the sampling efforts by using the function diversity in past in this study we used the observed fungal otu richness as the measure for fungal diversity differences in the species richness between the sampling seasons spring summer and winter were compared using anova followed by tukey post hoc test whereas the differences in the species richness between two aquifer assemblages lower and upper aquifer assemblages were compared using two sample t test in past to minimize the effect of differences in the abundance measure of different otus in the data set we used presence absence data for the community composition analysis using jaccard s dissimilarity index by using the vegan package oksanen et al 2015 implemented in r to visualize the fungal community composition in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages across the different sampled seasons we used two dimensional non metric multidimensional scaling 2d nmds ordination based on jaccard dissimilarity index using the vegan package to assess similarities in the fungal community composition of lower and upper aquifer assemblages we performed non parametric multivariate analysis of variances npmanova using past we also tested for differences in the homogeneity of multivariate dispersion between the two groups htl and htu using betadisper function in the vegan package of r physico chemical parameters of the groundwater samples from both aquifer assemblages were fitted to the nmds ordination plot using the envfit function of the vegan package as implemented in r goodness of fit statistics r 2 were calculated with p values based on 999 permutations based on the goodness of fit statistics p 0 05 all significant physico chemical parameters were further analyzed by distance based redundancy analysis dbrda using the jaccard dissimilarity index with the vegan package function capscale to determine the most influential physico chemical parameter describing the living fungal community composition for all the analysis a p value of 0 05 was considered as significant and p values between 0 05 and 0 1 were considered as marginally significant core genus was defined as the genus that consistently appeared in at least 90 of the samples caporaso et al 2011 huse et al 2012 loudon et al 2014 being considered for the analysis 3 results 3 1 physico chemical parameters based clustering of groundwater wells the milieu of the two aquifer assemblages is characterized by

have a higher mean concentration of ammonium 0 8 0 1 mg l 1 sodium 16 63 0 3 mg l 1 potassium 14 05 0 25 mg l 1 and total iron 0 16 0 02 mg l 1 compared to water samples from htl wells the physico chemical parameters of the extracted groundwater samples are summarized in table s1 principal component analysis pca using the physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples used in this study separated the samples into four distinct clusters fig 2 which explained 71 47 of total variance by the first two principal components pcs pc1 50 42 and pc2 21 05 the overall strength of correlations between the groundwater samples pca axis scores and their physico chemical parameters are summarized in table 1 total inorganic carbon tic k nh4 fet mg2 and na and hco3 showed a significant p 0 05 positive correlation with pc1 whereas specific electrical conductivity redox potential concentrations of dissolved o2 ca2 st so4 2 and no3 showed a significant p 0 05 negative correlation with pc1 fig 2 specifically the concentrations of so4 2 and st showed a significant p 0 05 positive correlation with pc2 which separated the samples from well h51 in the lower aquifer assemblage from the rest furthermore the significant p 0 05 positive correlation of the concentrations of nh4 and na with pc 1 separated the anoxic wells h42 h43 h52 h53 from h4 and h5 groundwater samples from well h42 and h43 have higher tic and hco3 but lower nh4 k and na compared to the groundwater samples from the wells h52 and h53 of the upper aquifer assemblage 3 2 overview of bioinformatic analysis a total of 447 613 raw reads were generated by paired end illumina miseq sequencing of the water samples from lower and upper aquifer assemblages at sites h3 h4 and h5 after trimming and removal of chimeric sequences a total of 149 295 33 35 high quality fungal its2 reads were used in the downstream analysis sequence clustering at 97 similarity followed by the removal of non target sequences 7 otus represented by 59 reads resulted in separating out a total of 1443 fungal otus represented by 17 963 reads the removal of rare otus single double and triple tons resulted in the final dataset with 382 otus comprising of 16 701 reads mantel test based on the bray curtis distance measures with 999 permutations rmantel 0 999 p 0 001 indicated no impact of the removal of rare otus from the dataset the number of reads after different bioinformatic steps are summarized in table s2 3 3 distribution of metabolically active fungi in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages the final dataset from the two aquifer assemblages contained 382 fungal otus which could be taxonomically assigned to 4 phyla 12 classes 34 orders 54 families and 83 genera out of these 382 identified fungal otus 94 and 195 otus were exclusively present in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages respectively while 93 otus 24 3 were shared between the two aquifer assemblages the sample based individual rarefaction curves for all the samples from the upper and lower aquifer assemblage were close to saturation indicating towards the undiscovered community in the system figure s1 we used the observed otu richness number of otus as a measure of the diversity of living fungi purahong et al 2016 we found that the living fungal diversity differed between the two aquifer assemblages htl and htu and within the aquifer assemblages wells h3 h4 and h5 fig 3 a specifically when all the htl wells h31 h41 h51 were considered together the highest number of living fungal otus was observed in the groundwater of well h41 in winter 153 otus while the lowest number of living fungal otus was observed in the well h41 in summer 68 otus similarly for the htu wells h32 h42 h43 h52 h53 the highest number of living fungal otus was observed in well h53 in winter and the lowest number of living fungal otus was found in well h32 in summer overall in the htl and htu groundwater wells the highest living fungal diversity was observed in winter fig 3a likewise when all the samples from htl and htu aquifer assemblages were unified according to the sampling seasons anova followed by a tukey post hoc pair wise comparison showed the fungal species richness in winter was significantly different p 0 05 anova from those in summer and spring fig 3b considering the fungal taxonomic distribution a total of four fungal phyla ascomycota basidiomycota chytridiomycota and zygomycota were found in the upper muschelkalk groundwater samples fig 4 the living fungal communities were primarily dominated by three phyla together accounting for 58 of the total relative abundance the phyla ascomycota and basidiomycota were the two most frequently observed phyla in both aquifer assemblages accounting for 55 of the total relative abundance whereas chytridiomycota and zygomycota contributed little to the overall taxonomic distribution at phylum level 4 of the total relative abundance it is important to consider that the phylum chytridiomycota typical of lake and sediment ecosystems was only detected in the groundwater samples from wells h32 in the oxic domain of the upper aquifer assemblage fig 4 in the final dataset according to the unite database 40 of the abundant otus were identified as fungi but without further taxonomic resolution among the oxic environments of the lower aquifer assemblage in well h31 the phylum ascomycota was highly represented 89 with small fractions of the phylum zygomycota 2 in spring in contrast in summer the phylum basidiomycota appeared with 12 relative abundance along with ascomycota 73 the groundwater samples in winter from the well h41 were dominated by members of phylum basidiomycota 44 followed by ascomycota 23 and zygomycota 6 whereas in spring the phylum zygomycota was not observed at all and the relative abundance of ascomycota and basidiomycota also decreased slightly 23 10 and 44 41 respectively interestingly in summer the phylum ascomycota was highly 61 and basidiomycota was least detected 23 when compared to the winter and spring samples fig 4 in well h51 associated with more sulfate and calcium ions the phylum ascomycota was highly detected 53 relative abundance with only 7 of basidiomycota in winter surprisingly the relative abundance of ascomycota and basidiomycota decreased enormously in spring to 4 and 5 respectively similarly in the htu well h32 associated with higher nitrate concentrations the living fungal taxonomic distribution was primarily contributed by the phyla of ascomycota and basidiomycota in winter and spring in summer the phylum ascomycota was highly detected 60 while basidiomycota contributed only little 17 the phylum chytridiomycota was only detected in the groundwater samples form well h32 in spring fig 4 among the anoxic environments of the upper aquifer assemblage wells h42 and h43 showed different distributions of the living fungal phyla compared to the wells h52 and h53 fig 4 in winter the phylum ascomycota was highly detected in well h43 54 compared to well h42 8 surprisingly in well h43 the relative abundance of the phylum ascomycota was reduced considerably in spring to 8 compared to winter 54 in the anoxic groundwater wells at site h5 h52 and h53 the phylum zygomycota was highly detected 23 in h52 and 27 in h53 in winter compared to all other wells either in lower or upper aquifer assemblage 3 4 well and aquifer assemblage specific core fungal genera considering the sampling seasons together for the individual groundwater wells in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages we identified the core genera associated with each specific well table 2 in the htl we identified seven and three genera from the wells h31 and h51 respectively which accounted for 38 52 and 8 74 of the total sequences in their respective wells in the htu core genera ranging between one and three were identified from wells h32 h42 h43 h52 and h53 and the fraction of sequences associated with these genera were 14 21 3 31 1 16 3 61 and 1 of the total sequences in their corresponding wells when all the groundwater wells in the lower aquifer assemblage were considered together mycosphaerella was identified as core genus in the htl which was represented by 5 5 of the total sequences in contrast no core genus could be identified in the htu across all wells 3 5 fungal community composition and physico chemical parameters the living fungal community composition in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages is presented in two dimensional non metric multidimensional scaling 2d nmds ordination based on presence absence data using jaccard distance measures fig 5 the npmanova analysis showed that the living fungal community composition of the two aquifer assemblages are significantly different from one another f 1 623 p 0 003 with no significant effect on multivariate dispersion between the groups betadisper f 0 77 p 0 39 in the nmds ordination the groundwater samples from the htu except from h42 and h43 appeared to be in close proximity separating the samples from the htl fig 5 this indicated that fungal communities of the respective aquifer assemblages are most similar the physico chemical parameters of the groundwater samples important for fungal growth were correlated with the living fungal community composition to identify the factors that played significant roles in shaping the community in the two aquifer assemblages we found that a set of physico chemical parameters environmental abiotic variables were significant predictors of the living fungal communities in the aquifers the significant and marginally significant physico chemical parameters are presented in table 3 these parameters included extraction temperature ph total inorganic carbon tic and concentrations of ammonium orthophosphate total iron and potassium among all the parameters the differences in the living fungal community composition between the two aquifer assemblages were significantly explained by ammonium nh4 f 2 0742 p 0 001 determined by distance based redundancy analysis dbrda 3 6 functional groups in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages detection of potential animal and plant pathogens to get meaningful ecological and functional categories of the identified fungal otus in our dataset we used funguild an annotation tool for parsing fungal ngs datasets in general from the two aquifer assemblages fungi belonging to three different trophic modes i e saprotroph 57 otus 15 pathotrophs 34 otus 9 and symbiotrophs 9 otus 2 4 were identified within each trophic mode we also identified fungi belonging to different ecological guilds fungi within the pathotrophic mode were subcategorized into animal 16 otus 47 plant 17 otus 31 and fungal pathogens 3 otus 9 these ecological functional groups were distributed along different fungal phyla animal and plant pathogens were highly represented by the phylum ascomycota 89 100 in contrast ectomycorrhizal fungi and fungal pathogens were highly represented by the phylum basidiomycota 60 100 and saprotrophs were represented by three different phyla i e ascomycota 37 basidiomycota 31 and zygomycota 28 the fungal otus with unidentified ecological functional groups made up the largest fraction in the dataset 259 otus 68 4 discussion when carbonate rock aquifers in the terrestrial subsurface biosphere are explicitly taken into account a huge information gap exits about fungal diversity community composition and roles of environmental factors in shaping these communities this paucity of knowledge is primarily due to the fact that in the past the most common methods used for studying aquatic fungal diversity were either based on the microscopic identification of asexual spores or culture based identifications grossart and rojas jimenez 2016 all such methods have their intrinsic limitations which results in incomplete description of the actual fungal diversity in an ecosystem jeewon and hyde 2007 schmit and lodge 2005 keeping in mind the potential inherent biases of culture independent techniques lucking et al 2014 tedersoo et al 2010 this work provides an in depth picture and novel insights about living fungal diversity community composition and fungal functional groups in pristine aquifer assemblages of the hainich cze in the terrestrial subsurface biosphere along with that it also encompasses the role of environmental factors in shaping such community compositions 4 1 aquifers harbor highly diverse living fungal communities to our knowledge despite the oligotrophic and pristine conditions of the studied subsurface ecosystem we have reported a diverse pool of living aquatic fungi than what has been published in previous studies from bedrock aquifers or related freshwater habitats however a direct comparison of our findings about living fungal diversity and community composition with previously published studies is difficult because there are few studies about aquatic fungi in subsurface pristine aquifer systems for instance by using culture based techniques lategan et al 2012 have reported 83 fungal strains from shallow unconfined aquifers in australia and hageskal et al 2006 isolated 24 species from norwegian groundwater sources specifically from the same aquifer system in hainich cze up to 437 fungal otus have been reported by sequencing 18s rna gene fragments risse buhl et al 2013 and fungal its regions nawaz et al 2016 however it is important to consider that the studies mentioned above were dna based which target the total communities whereas in this work targeting the living fractions of the fungal communities from the groundwater samples we reported 382 fungal otus such huge numbers and diversities of living fungal otus reflect the fact that subsurface aquifer system is much more vibrant from the mycological point of view than thought before it is also important to consider that 40 of the retrieved fungal otus could only be identified as fungi but without further taxonomic resolution this indicates either insufficient representation of the aquatic fungal sequences in the actual databases or that these fungal species may not have been characterized before and could be considered as potentially novel fungal groups specialized for aquatic habitats in either case this points towards an unexplored pool of fungal species in aquifers interestingly by comparing the living fungal otus detected in this study with the fungal otus from our previous dna based study using 454 sequencing nawaz et al 2016 we found an overlap of only 5 8 of the living fungal otus with the ones previously reported this shows that there exists a marked difference between recoverable fungal community and the community that is living in the environment consequently this signifies the importance of the rna based approach used in this study to target the living players of the fungal communities to better understated the role of microbes in the ecosystem functioning of such habitats the fungal diversity varies across the different sampling campaigns which represent different seasons spring summer and winter higher living fungal diversity of the winter samples from both aquifer assemblages compared to spring and summer samples indicate the temporal variability and natural seasonal dynamics of the fungal communities this trend could be associated with the groundwater low and high stand in the respective seasons which points to the dilution effect of the fungal biomass but to confirm this hypothesis repeated measurements in the same season would be needed in future to confirm such seasonal dynamics in the studied aquifer system interestingly within the same aquifer assemblage different sampling wells showed variable distributions of the fungal phyla this finding is in good agreement with our previous study nawaz et al 2016 specifically when all the groundwater wells in the lower oxic aquifer htl are considered together the members of dothideomycetes were most frequently identified in wells h31 and h41 fungi from the class dothideomycetes were also reported to be abundant in the aquifers korbel et al 2017 this is the most diverse and largest fungal class of the phylum ascomycota kirk et al 2008 which is a heterogeneous group of organisms that persists in most of the habitats where fungi can be found additionally in our dataset we also found a fraction of fungal otus belonging to family nectriaceae in anoxic groundwater wells it has been reported that in the absence of oxygen facultative anaerobic microscopic fungi from family nectriaceae are capable of using nitrate as alternative terminal electron acceptor in their respiration process kurakov et al 2008 in the lower aquifer assemblage the genus mycosphaerella was identified as core genus the members of the genus mycosphaerella are generally classified as endophytes saprotrophs and symbionts but most of the members are plant pathogens causing heavy loss to the agricultural crops worldwide crous et al 2001 moreover by comparing the reported core fungal genera in this study with the previously published studies we identified that the genera alternaria aureobasidium beauveria and mortierella were reported before in groundwater surface water and lakes oliveira et al 2013 wurzbacher et al 2016 and the genus malassezia from deep sea sediments amend 2014 singh et al 2012 and deep groundwater bedrock fractured zones sohlberg et al 2015 whereas the rest of the genera observed in this study were reported for the first time in terrestrial subsurface aquifers some of the fungal genera we identified in this study have also been reported in different terrestrial habitats which suggests that those fungi may have non aquatic origin or there is a life style transition in their life cycle shearer et al 2007 vijaykrishna and hyde 2006 4 2 factors corelating the living fungal community composition the groundwater wells accessing the two aquifer assemblages in hainich cze showed different environmental conditions as indicated by distinct clustering patterns based on their physico chemical parameters fig 2 this result is supported by previous studies which also reported marked differences in the oxygen and nitrate contents along with the concentrations of sulfate and iron in the two aquifers htl and htu kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 schwab et al 2017 generally differences in physico chemical parameters of the water samples are important in shaping aquatic fungal community compositions gulis and suberkropp 2004 manoharachary and ramarao 1981 medeiros et al 2009 in our case we found differences in the living fungal communities in the lower and upper aquifer assemblages and these variations in the overall community composition was significantly correlated to the ammonium nh4 concentration similarly strong correlations between fungal diversity and ammonium and nitrate concentrations have also been previously reported in deep fractured zones sohlberg et al 2015 in marine environments tisthammer et al 2016 and anoxic sub seafloor sediments orsi et al 2013 although the employed methods set of measured environmental variables the studied ecosystem and the geographic locations of the studies mentioned above are not directly comparable with our study but they all agree that the environmental filtering is important in the aquatic fungal community composition in oxic conditions fungi use oxygen as substrate to produce energy for their biological activities but the studied aquifer system in the hainich cze also has sub oxic to anoxic domains in the upper aquifer assemblage kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 to support their growth under anoxic conditions filamentous fungi members of sub kingdom dikarya have been reported to induce a set of genes to produce o2 independent energy producing metabolic mechanisms takasaki et al 2004 by such oxygen independent metabolic mechanisms fungi can reduce nitrate to ammonium to gain energy takasaki et al 2004 zhou et al 2010 this phenomenon has been previously attributed to the facultative or anaerobic bacteria and archaea but growing evidence suggesting that this mechanism is also widely distributed among many eukaryotic microbes including different fungal groups kamp et al 2015 zhou et al 2002 2010 such fungal abilities to thrive in the anoxic conditions of the hainich aquifer systems points towards their versatile mode of survival in adverse conditions and their potential roles in the nutrient cycling in the terrestrial subsurface aquifers 4 3 diverse functional groups inhabit the aquifers in the past fungi have been thought to have negligible ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems but it has been established that apart from terrestrial environments fungi also play important roles in element cycling and mineralization in aquatic ecosystems ivarsson et al 2016 we found that in our studied aquifer system after unidentified fungal functional groups saprotrophs were highly detected in an ecosystem saprotrophs are considered as backbone of the elemental cycling processes therefore the living fungal saprotrophs in the studied oligotrophic aquifer system may contribute to the solubilisation of minerals and decomposition of natural compounds into simpler substance due to their broad spectrum of enzymatic capabilities giraud et al 2001 junghanns et al 2005 subsequently those simpler substances could be used further by other organisms in the aquifer food web apart from the fungal groups involved in elemental cycling in subsurface aquifers the pathotrophs including animal and plant pathogens are also important to consider such aquifers around the world are considered major source of water for domestic purposes martin and white 2008 therefore the presence of potential animal and plant pathogens in such aquifer systems cannot be overlooked as exposure to pathogenic fungi would have health concerns for humans pereira et al 2010 specifically in the analyzed groundwater samples we found fungal otus that are known animal plants and human pathogens i e rhodotorula mucilaginosa opportunistic human pathogen in immune compromised patients da cunha et al 2009 kaur et al 2007 paecilomyces lilacinus human and animal pathogen luangsa ard et al 2011 lecanicillium lecanii entomopathogenic fungus and blumeria graminis plant pathogen cowger et al 2018 ilyas et al 2014 pathogenicity is one aspect but fungal presence in water sources is also associated with taste and odor problems doggett 2000 pereira et al 2010 in our previous dna based study nawaz et al 2016 fungal plant pathogens were also detected however in dna based approaches it is quite possible to detect the dead dormant species as well rajala et al 2011 but the detection of fungal plant pathogens in this rna based study confirms that these groups are not only present in the aquifers but also are also alive considering the geological structural setting of hainich cze our targeted subsurface aquifer system is primarily recharged by the infiltration of rainfall and snow melts and the recharge areas are located in different land use types i e forest grassland and cropland but dominated by forest land use kohlhepp et al 2017 küsel et al 2016 during the recharge events the location of the recharge areas not only impacts the kind of organic matter that is being transported with water but also the type of microbes lehman 2007 somaratne 2014 the detection of living plant and animal pathogens in our dataset points to a surface origin of unknown percentage of the living fungal groups which along with infiltrating water might have been transported from the surface to the subsurface considering the fractured zones in the bedrock aquifer system nevertheless the fate of surface sourced fungi in the aquatic subsurface oligotrophic environment is relatively unknown in the literature 5 conclusions following conclusions can be drawn within the framework of present study investigating subsurface groundwater aquifers using high throughput illumina sequencing allowed us to identify a diverse both taxonomic and functional pool of metabolically active fungal communities the living fungal communities in the shallow aquifers in the mixed carbonate siliciclastic alternations were significantly corelated with ammonium and tic supply an overlap of only 5 8 of the living fungal otus with the ones in the dna based study highlighted a marked difference between total fungal community and the community that is living in an environment in the targeted subsurface aquifer system we detected living fungal otus that are known plant pathogens in the literature and the databases the presence of these fungal groups in such environments points towards the transitional ability of fungi in their life styles lifestyle switching but further studies are required in the future to comprehensively test such hypothesis in aquatic habitats we suggest that the fungal meta barcoding approach used in this study can be used to monitor and assess the quality of water supplies considering the presence of potential fungal pathogens which could be harmful for animals plants and humans furthermore the role of fungal saprotrophs in such oligotrophic subsurface environment is

19294,the use of gadolinium gd complexes as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging mri has resulted in point source releases of anthropogenic gd into the environment and presents the opportunity to trace the fate of wastewater plumes here we collected seawater samples along the coast of northeast brazil to investigate the influence of two submarine sewage outfalls on the distribution of gd and other rare earth elements ree in the coastal waters the shale normalized rees only show a small light over heavy ree enrichment and negative ce anomalies likely reflecting the influence of freshwater inputs positive gd anomalies are observed at most of the sampling sites indicating the ubiquitous presence of anthropogenic gd in coastal waters the highest gd anomalies are found in the vicinity of the submarine sewage outfalls and decrease with increasing distance from point source the total daily discharge of 216 82 g gd and 92 0 19 3 g gd was calculated for the rio vermelho erv and boca do rio ebr submarine outfalls respectively which on population bases equates to 11 5 4 3 g gd d 1 for erv and 15 5 3 3 g gd d 1 for ebr per 100 000 persons it is estimated that in 2016 the annual emission of anthropogenic gd by hospitals and clinics in brazil varied between 527 kg and 5 3 tons it was roughly estimated that between 698 and 2021 g gd d 1 are discharged into the tropical and south atlantic waters due to submarine outfall sewage along the coast of brazil graphical abstract image 1 keywords anthropogenic gadolinium sewage outfalls gadolinium contrasting agent ree geotraces 1 introduction the intense technological progress in the past 30 years increased the need for the development of new materials and the global demand for rare earth elements rees because of their unique physical and chemical properties they are critical elements for many renewable energy and high technologies e g computer memory rechargeable batteries smart phones electric vehicles wind turbines defense and medical applications the individual properties of each ree provide performance that is currently irreplaceable by alternative materials du and graedel 2011 which is strongly influencing their demands the global production of the rees has increased exponentially since the 1950s and there are expectations that the demands will expand up to 2600 in the next 25 years in the case of dy which is heavily used in electric vehicles and wind turbines alonso et al 2012 the progressively increasing use of rees is accompanied by the release of similarly increasing amounts of those elements into the environment where their concentrations can exceed in orders of magnitude their background values that is the case for la klaver et al 2014 kulaksız and bau 2013 2011 song et

widespread in aquatic systems studies have shown anthropogenic gd gdanthr in rivers lakes groundwater and also in coastal waters all around the world e g bau et al 2006 bau and dulski 1996 bichler et al 2016 brünjes et al 2016 elbaz poulichet et al 2002 hatje et al 2016 2014 hissler et al 2015 johannesson et al 2017 knappe et al 2005 kulaksız and bau 2011 2007 lawrence and kamber 2006 möller et al 2000 verplanck et al 2005 the concentrations of gdanthr have been shown to increase over the past 20 years by a factor of 14 in the waters of san francisco bay hatje et al 2016 there is also a concern about the potential toxicity of gd due to its ability to block calcium ion channels in the cells as its ionic radius is nearly equal to the divalent ca2 that is gd3 is able to compete with ca2 in physiological processes usually binding with higher affinity than ca2 sherry et al 2009 leading to decreasing neuromuscular transmission and interference with intracellular enzymes and cell membranes processes through the transmetalation process mundim et al 2009 shellock and spinazzi 2008 uptake of natural and or anthropogenic gd has been observed for plants and organisms braun et al 2018 lingott et al 2016 martino et al 2017 parisi et al 2017 robert et al 2016 yang et al 2016 however the gd impact on aquatic organisms is still poorly understood and the gd fate behavior bioavailability and toxicological impact are urgent issues that need to be addressed since first described in river waters in the mid 1990 bau and dulski 1996 the anthropogenic anomaly of gd in the environment has been traced back to the increasing use of gd based contrast agents gd cas used in magnetic resonance imaging mri due to its paramagnetic properties gd cas have been used to enhance the detail and clarity of diagnosis in mri offering lower risk of allergies and interaction with patients than other contrasts kanal 2016 such as iodinated contrast the structural design of the gd cas varies by manufacturer due to differences in the binder which may be ionic or neutral linear or cyclic these contrast agents are commonly complexed with polyaminocarboxylic acid chelating agents telgmann et al 2013 in order to avoid the high toxicity of free gd3 yang and sachs 1989 until recently it has been considered that gd cas are not metabolized by the human organism and are quickly excreted via urine in patients with functional kidneys the administered contrast agent excretion half life is about 1 5 hrs but may exceed 30 hrs in patients with renal insufficiency idée et al 2008 and references therein although new studies have shown that patients administered with gd cas may have incorporated part of the compounds in tissues including brain bone and kidneys rogosnitzky and branch 2016 most of the gdanthr enters the public sewage system after just a few hours of the gd cas applications depending on the population size level of access to health systems and number of hospitals and clinics performing mri diagnosis the inputs of gdanthr into the environment vary strongly but can be high currently there are no data considering the impact of ocean submarine outfalls on the concentrations of rees in the marine environment despite the fact that many large coastal cities in the world have adopted this pipeline system as the main solution for their sewage disposal several of the most populated cities in latin america have submarine outfalls that discharge effluents into the ocean after having undergone no treatment or only primary treatment only removing major particles brazil has about 20 major ocean submarine outfalls discharging more than 60 m3 s of effluents into tropical coastal waters table s1 most of these outfalls are designed according to modern criteria to ensure high dilution of effluents roberts et al 2010 as for today there are no ree specific limits or standards either for ree abundances in sewage treatments effluents or receiving water bodies partly because their ecological effects are poorly understood as for places that also have secondary or tertiary treatments involving organic degradation and disinfection it is expected that gd cas pass wastewater treatment plants wwtps mostly unhindered and enter aquatic systems due to the high solubility of the polar or ionic gd cas and their high complex stability telgmann et al 2012 showed that only approximately 10 of the gd is removed during sewage treatment in wwtps and that species transformation may take place during treatment processes because of the stability of gd cas and their potentially high half lives i e more than 100 days holzbecher et al 2005 in the environment it is important to know how much anthropogenic gd has been discharged into marine waters and what has been its fate only then their distribution patterns can be explained and the potential impacts and benefits of mitigation measures can be assessed in this context this study aims to test if the two ocean submarine sewage outfalls located on the coast of salvador northeast brazil are causing anomalies in the distributions of rees in waters off the coast of salvador secondly this study aims at a rough estimation of gd inputs by brazilian ocean submarine outfalls in the tropical and south atlantic due to hospital applications in mri 2 methods 2 1 study site sampling took place off the northeastern coast of brazil in the vicinity of salvador fig 1 the third most populous 3 million city of the country two submarine wwtps serve more than 80 of the inhabitants the rio vermelho submarine outfall erv started operating in 1975 and serves 1 9 million inhabitants whereas the boca do rio outfall ebr was built in 2011 to cover the exceeding demand of the sewage system serving around 600 thousand people the erv is a 2 4 km long concrete steel pipeline with an inner diameter of 1 75 m it discharges close to the entrance of todos os santos bay at 27 m water depth with a flow rate of 8 3 m3 s 1 jordão and rosman 2016 while boca do rio submarine outfall ebr is a 3 3 km long hdpe tube with an inner diameter of 1 60 m that discharges at a water depth of 45 m and a flow rate of 5 9 m3 s 1 jordão and rosman 2016 although departing from different pretreatment stations the treatment mechanisms are similar for the sewage of both outfalls these include passing the sewage through a mesh screen to remove large objects followed by sedimentation basins where sand and larger solids are removed final sieving 2 and 1 5 mm mesh size in erv and ebr respectively and discharge through the outfalls into the ocean the hydrodynamics at the shallow coastal waters in the vicinity of the outfalls are strongly controlled by the wind field and meso scale circulation amorim et al 2012 southerly winds induce water flow to the northeast during austral winter northeasterly winds cause southwestward coastal currents during summer near the entrance of the bay costal currents become highly modulated by rising tides which during summer promote rapid westward water flow and a potential transport of discharged sewage into shore waters cirano and lessa 2007 the later causes concern because at this time of the year the number of tourists starts to increase leading to an increase in the amount of sewage generated as well as the number of bathers on the beaches of salvador the climate in salvador is tropical humid and there are only two seasons wet april to july and dry august to march the annual average precipitation is 1781 mm while the annual minimum and maximum temperature varies between 22 8 and 28 3 c respectively climate data 2018 2 2 sample collection surficial and bottom samples supplementary material table s2 were collected on november 28th and 29th of 2016 at fourteen sites off the coast of salvador sampling locations fig 1 were chosen considering the discharge position of the submarine outfalls of erv and ebr water circulation and predominant winds in order to evaluate the plume dispersion bottom water was collected with a teflon coated go flo bottle surface samples were collected with a trace metal clean surface pump system that included a peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer instrument company usa and pfa teflon tubing the sample inlet mounted on a telescopic rod was lowered to around 1 m below the water surface at each sample station and collected samples were filtered through pre cleaned 0 1m hcl capsule filters 0 2 μm supor acropak with fluorodyne ii membrane the filtered samples were collected into precleaned low density polyethylene ldpe bottles after rinsing three times with the sample and acidified to ph 1 8 hcl 30 suprapur merck and stored in double plastic bags at ambient temperature before sampling all ldpe bottles and tubing were cleaned with detergent extran merck germany all material was then soaked in a 6 n hcl solution reagent grade followed by a 7 n hno3 solution bath each cleaning step lasted for a week and followed the protocols for trace metal clean sampling of the geotraces program cutter et al 2017 the pre cleaned bottles were filled with a diluted hno3 traceselect fluka analytical germany solution and stored until sample collection the tubing and capsule filters were thoroughly rinsed with at least 3l of local water between samplings in situ ancillary variables temperature salinity depth and ph were measured using a pre calibrated multiprobe ysi 6600v ohio usa at wwtps effluent waters that feed the erv and ebr submarine outfalls were carefully collected into 250 ml pre cleaned bottles immediately prior to entering the submarine outfalls over three consecutive days 11th to 13th of april 2017 tuesday to thursday between at 3 and 3h30 p m which is the maximum flow time mota 2017 these samples were filtered using cellulose acetate membrane filter with 0 45 μm pore size sartorius stedim biotech germany and acidified to ph 1 8 2 3 pre concentration of rees and id icp ms determination the preconcentration and analysis of rees by isotope dilution id icp ms followed the method described in behrens et al 2016 briefly 5 ml aliquots of each sample were weighed and spiked with a multi element ree isotope spike the volume of spike was optimized for each sample aiming at a145nd 143nd ratio of 6 to keep the error magnification factor low while not compromising analytical precision the sample mixture was left to homogenize for at least 48 hrs and was then made up to 12 ml for dilution using acidified ultrapure water ph 2 to maintain the ph below 2 next samples were pre concentrated using the automated seafast pico system elemental scientific inc omaha nebraska usa which avoids sample handling and assures high reproducibility in this system 10 ml of spiked sample were pre concentrated and the matrix was removed to avoid interferences during analysis the details of the seafast pre concentration procedure have been previously described by behrens et al 2016 and can be summarized as follows first the pre concentration column was preconditioned using a buffer solution 157 ml high purity water 140 ml glacial acetic acid and 203 ml 20 ammonium hydroxide the sample was then loaded into the sample loop where the buffer solution was added to elevate the ph to 6 prior to passing the sample through the pre concentration column packed with a chelating resin consisting of ethylenediaminetriacetic acid and iminodiacetic acid functional groups the column was then rinsed with the buffer solution to wash out the seawater matrix the rees were eluted using 500 μl of 1 5 n hno3 into pre cleaned pfa vials the ree concentration measurements were performed by hr icp ms element thermo finnigan germany coupled to a desolvation sample introduction system aridus 2 teledyne cetac omaha usa that used a nitrogen argon gas mixture to enhance sensitivity and minimize oxide formations briefly the instrument was optimized using a 100 ng l tune solution of ba ce and lu to obtain high sensitivity and low oxide formation 0 01 0 03 for ce oxide oxide interference corrections were therefore not necessary spiked and unspiked standards were analyzed in each batch to check the sensitivity for mono isotope elements and correction of the equipment mass bias the analytical procedures have already been described in detail by behrens et al 2016 and are listed in table s3 accuracy was checked using geotraces reference samples north pacific safe 3000 m and geotraces santa barbara costal water gsc table 1 replicate analyses of samples showed 1std below 3 except yb 6 4 for effluent water samples aliquots of 10 ml per sample were evaporated and then made up to 1 ml with 0 6 m hno3 the rees for effluent samples were determined by the same hr icp ms low resolution mode r 300 oxide formation rate 0 5 without prior matrix removal by seafast analysis of slrs 4 river water crm nrcc canada indicated accuracy of 97 for gd whereas for all other rees the recovery varied between 72 and 86 compared to values presented by lawrence and kamber 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolved concentrations and normalized ree patterns in seawater all ree concentrations from this study are elevated compared to the open south atlantic ocean zheng et al 2016 and the sum of rees varied from 79 4 to 167 pmol kg 1 table 2 compared to range from 71 7 to 80 2 pmol kg 1 found in the open southwestern atlantic stations 1 3 and 4 zheng et al 2016 for the same water depths the differences in ree concentrations between surface and bottom waters at each location were not significant p 0 05 except for eu tb and er table s4 for which surface waters were slighted depleted in ree compared to bottom waters the spatial distribution of ree concentrations along the coast showed higher variability for the lrees la to eu than for the hrees gd to lu la concentrations varied by up to 34 among stations and its lowest values were found at station erv and at the entrance of todos os santos bay the hree varied only by up to 12 tb among sample locations element specific complexation by carbonate ions and affinity for various inorganic phases e g carbonates phosphates and organic ligands can explain the different concentrations of the rees in seawater e g byrne and kim 1990 byrne and sholkovitz 1996 and their spatial variability the hrees are more prone to remain in the complexed form than in the ionic state when compared to lrees bau and dulski 1996 henderson 1984 zhong and mucci 1995 hrees are less likely to be caught in reactions and be adsorbed to precipitating material than lrees therefore presenting lower spatial variability 3 1 1 ree fractionation in order to visualize the elemental fractionation relative to continental sources of rees to remove the oddo harkins effect in their natural abundances and also to allow an easy comparison with data from elsewhere ree abundance patterns are typically normalized to the average composition of the continental crust e g in post archean australian shale paas mclennan 1989 the shale normalized rees suffix sn for all stations shows relatively flat patterns with hree enrichment over lree and negative ce anomalies fig 2 these features likely reflect the influence of freshwater inputs e g jaguaribe passa vaca lucaia and todos os santos bay tributaries and are commonly observed in coastal seawaters e g bertram and elderfield 1993 garcia solsona et al 2014 jeandel 1993 zheng et al 2016 samples also presented positive gd anomalies that will be discussed separately 3 1 2 the shale normalized ersn ndsn ratios which provide a measure of fractionation across the ree series are all greater than unity table 2 fig 3 the highest ratio 3 99 is more than 2 fold the ratio from the station with the lowest ersn ndsn 1 61 the hree enrichment is more evident at sampling stations closer to the todos os santos bay entrance gradually decreasing towards the north along the salvador coast reaching a minimum enrichment at station e02 the rivers along the coast jaguaribe passa vaca lucaia the todos os santos bay with its mangroves seagrasses and coral reefs hatje and andrade 2009 and the erv and ebr submarine outfalls are important sources of organic matter for the coastal zone the depleted levels of lree close to outfalls especially at the ebr and at the entrance of the bay suggests that colloidal organic matter as well as suspended particles associated with the discharge of effluents may be controlling lree removal from seawater in similar mixing and removal processes to those of estuaries e g elderfield 1988 martin et al 1976 sholkovitz and elderfield 1988 the submarine outfalls discharge pre filtered effluents 10 30 of large particles removed silva 2011 with a large organic colloidal pool that interacts with seawater during the rapid mixture of waters along the effluent discharge plume suggesting that coagulation might account for the observed distributions organic molecules are major carriers of rees in the colloidal fraction e g bau et al 2013 tang and johannesson 2003 the higher the amount of colloids in the water the more hree enriched the samples are elderfield et al 1990 sholkovitz 1995 in addition the flat ree patterns of the coastal zone of salvador are in the same range of fractionation as the surface water observed at stations in the brazil basin southwestern atlantic surface water i e ersn ndsn of 2 64 at 11 s 330 e zheng et al 2016 and are likely to reflect the influence of the terrigenous inputs along the coast the ree values of this study were also normalized to the ree abundances of this south atlantic 11 s 330 e surface sample this normalization emphasizes subtle differences between samples that might otherwise escape detection the normalized patterns fig 4 show a slight enrichment in all rees except eu with a stronger enrichment of lrees especially for stations around the boca do rio submarine outfall stations e01 e05 including the stations e01 and e03 which are more distant from the emissaries and were not expected to be under their influence this region is under the influence of not only the ebr but also the jaguaribe river the discharge of the river in coastal waters seems to be exporting rees from geogenic pools transported from the drainage basin compared to atlantic ocean waters the ce anomalies in these samples are smaller 3 1 2 gd dissolved concentrations the anthropogenic imprints in seawaters seawater concentrations of gd concentration observed at the erv 12 0 pmol kg 1 was two fold higher than the average concentration for all other samples 5 64 0 99 pmol kg 1 and decreased with increasing distance from the outfall at this station as a result of rising of the plume above the outfall diffusers the concentration of gd in surface water 12 0 pmol kg 1 was almost 3 times the values observed for the bottom water 4 75 pmol kg 1 the peak in gd concentration coincided with the minimum salinity observed table s2 salinity difference between the sewage plume and reference e01 site at the surface δs 0 5 provide evidence for the substantial freshwater i e sewage input discharge by the erv although the input of effluents from ebr is smaller than the erv salinity differences still indicate the impact of the sewage inputs by this discharge system as well salinity anomalies are of the same order as the ones reported by ramos et al 2007 roth et al 2016 and petrenko et al 1997 for other effluent plumes the chelated form of anthropogenic gd i e gd ca largely used in clinical and diagnostic medical imaging shows an important persistence in the dissolved phase and is entirely present in the truly dissolved ree pool kulaksız and bau 2013 in contrast to the natural rees the anthropogenic gd seems to behave conservatively passing estuaries and sewage effluent seawater interfaces mostly unaffected hatje et al 2014 kulaksız and bau 2007 detailed studies on the behavior of anthropogenic gd in marine waters are lacking 3 2 ree anomalies in seawater the amount of preferential ce removal relative to its lanthanide neighbors is displayed by the ce anomaly defined as ce ce cesn lasn x prsn 0 5 mclennan 1989 lower ce ce values indicate a stronger ce removal relative to la and pr ce anomaly is an important feature found in the ocean especially at deep waters it results of the ce3 oxidation followed by preferential scavenging of the ce4 which is very insoluble in seawater byrne and kim 1990 elderfield 1988 moffett 1990 the ce anomaly varied from 0 5 in the surface waters at the entrance of the bay to less pronounced values 0 8 at surface waters in the vicinity of the erv with values around 0 6 in the vicinity of the ebr the range of this results is in accordance with previously published papers for coastal waters hatje et al 2016 ogata and terakado 2006 and lower than found in oceanic waters bertram and elderfield 1993 zheng et al 2016 once no correlation between ce and ph was observed r 0 22 p 0 05 the suspended particles moffett 1990 and organic rich material elderfield 1988 associated with the terrigenous influence as discussed above and the discharge of the outfalls may be promoting the complexation of ce3 thus avoiding its oxidation and formation of pronounced anomalies in addition the ph may be promoting the higher stability of ce3 in solution elderfield et al 1990 especially in the erv station where one of the lowest measured ph values was observed probably exerting a key role in this station natural gd anomalies in seawater have been described as the result of the tetrad effect due to the unusual high stability of gd resulting from the half filled 4f electron in its orbital shell masuda and ikeuchi 1979 despite of that the pronounced gd anomalies associated with the erv gdsn gdsn 1 7 table 2 see also fig 5 and a smaller one associated to ebr at bottom waters gdsn gdsn 1 4 table 2 fig 2 indicate that an anthropogenic point source must be responsible for gd anomalies this source is not producing anthropogenic anomalies for the other ree among the different approaches to estimate gd anomalies the 3rd order polynomial fit excluding ce and eu because of their redox chemistry is the only one that makes no implicit assumption whether gd behaves as lree or hree möller et al 2002 the application of this method is then more appealing as it can be used for the whole range of waters from effluents of wwtp to seawaters the anthropogenic component of gd gdanth was then calculated by the difference between the measured and the theoretical gd calculated by the 3rd order polynomial fit the gd anomalies estimated range from 0 96 to 3 4 fig 5 positive gd anthropogenic anomalies 1 3 are observed in most stations in the proximity to the sewage outfalls erv and ebr whereas lower positive anomalies 1 3 are observed at the stations located at the entrance of the todos os santos bay the highest concentration of gdanth 8 45 pmol kg 1 is observed at the surface of erv submarine outfall station table 2 fig s1 as can be seen in fig s1 the gdanth concentrations are highest closer to the erv up to 70 of the total gd which serves the area where most hospitals and medical clinics are located and gradually decrease with distance indicating the outfall as the source of anthropogenic gd to the seawaters off the coast of salvador the form of the wastewater spreading observed by the gd anomalies indicates a preferential transport to the south and southwest of the discharge point of the erv and an eastern dispersion at the ebr these results are consistent with the prevailing wind and tidal driven southwestern currents that may transport the effluents towards the shores during austral summer and spring amorim et al 2012 roth et al 2016 when salvador s beaches are most visited the ubiquitous occurrence and mostly conservative behavior of gdanth in effluents of wwtps indicates that this element is a useful tracer for wastewater discharges elbaz poulichet et al 2002 hatje et al 2016 lawrence et al 2009 ogata and terakado 2006 in freshwater and marine systems and a proxy for the potential presence of other contaminants associated with sewage inputs nevertheless the reports on the occurrence of anthropogenic ree anomalies in seawater compared to other systems are still scarce as illustrated in table 3 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that reports gd inputs at the discharge point of submarine outfalls among the data available in the literature table 3 the values for the anthropogenic gd anomalies found in this study are among the highest reported for marine waters within the same range of anomalies observed in san francisco bay hatje et al 2016 2014 but lower than the highest anomalies reported for tokyo bay nozaki et al 2000 however if compared to gd anomalies registered in fluvial systems that receive effluents from wwtps they are up to two orders of magnitude lower table 3 despite the intrinsic differences in the gd concentrations in sewage water leaving wwtps which are related to the number of mri performed using gd cas the difference in magnitude observed between rivers and marine water systems is possibly related to the hydrodynamics that promote dilution and transport resulting in a faster and more efficient dilution of the anthropogenic gd signal in seawater 3 3 gd in the effluents of the wwtps the coarse screening to remove large particles used in the ebr and erv wwtps do not promote removal of ree the primary secondary and tertiary treatment however can cause the removal of natural dissolved ree during treatment operations and potentially highlight the excess in gd from anthropogenic sources verplanck et al 2010 since only a minor fraction of it can be removed at wwtps telgmann et al 2012 the effluents from the wwtps are highly enriched in gd and show large differences in their daily gd concentrations measured at maximum flow time with the largest range found for the erv ranging from 1160 pmol kg 1 to 2605 pmol kg 1 table 4 the peek value was found on tuesday and the minimum value on wednesday indicating a daily variation in the discharge of anthropogenic gd in wastewater effluents gadolinium concentrations measured at the ebr 900 1382 pmol kg 1 were up to 2 9 times lower than at the erv and the daily variation for this site was only 21 about half of the variability encountered at the erv all other ree for every wwtps sample were up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than gd concentrations fig s2 the concentrations ranged from 0 8 pmol kg 1 for tb wwtp rv to 49 9 pmol kg 1 for la wwtp rv it is clear evidence that regarding the ree discharge through sewage only gd is being anomalously released the erv has the largest discharge along the coast of brazil table s1 as expected from a wwtp discharge in a densely populated area with well developed medical and health care facilities the effluents from the erv carry a clear anthropogenic gd signal despite the also high average discharge of the ebr and the fact that this submarine outfall serves around 600 thousand people only a small number of medical facilities and hospitals are present in the catchment area which in part explains the difference in gd concentrations observed between the effluents of both wwtps the gd concentration values observed here table 4 are on the same order of magnitude of values reported for wwtp discharge in densely populated areas in countries with highly developed health care systems such as australia and germany knappe et al 2005 kulaksız and bau 2007 lawrence et al 2009 in both wwtps the anthropogenic gd was detected at every sampling over three consecutive days indicating its ubiquitous occurrence in effluents continuously discharged in the coastal tropical atlantic waters there was important variability in concentrations of gd in effluent waters between sampling dates the concentrations of gd in wwtps are weekday dependent due to the predominant use of mri diagnostics between monday and friday brünjes et al 2016 kümmerer and helmers 2000 telgmann et al 2012 the daily variability was higher at erv than at the ebr that receives less effluent from medical facilities gadolinium contrast agents are expected to be applying to a relatively small number of people within the catchment area of the ebr the spikes of gd contrasts from the reduced number of applications in the area served by the ebr and or from the excreted gd contrasts applied in other regions would result in inhomogeneous loads of anthropogenic gd however given the large dilution capacity of the sewage system these spikes are mixed along transport and treatment resulting in a more homogeneous effluent the temporal variation in gd concentrations in the effluent waters of the wwtps are a result of the dynamics between the amount of gd contrasts administered daily and the time of application and excretion of contrast agents among other factors such as proportion of the population undergoing mri i e erratic population during summer months transport dilution and retention time in wwtps a total daily discharge of 216 82 g gd and 92 0 19 3 g gd was calculated for the wwtps of erv and ebr respectively on a population basis these values equate to 11 5 4 3 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people for erv and 15 5 3 3 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people for ebr in comparison heavily populated areas in berlin have wwtps discharging 5 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people as estimated for the period between 1997 and 2000 knappe et al 2005 and in se queensland a wwtp has a discharge of 3 3 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people lawrence et al 2009 less populated areas 100 000 inhabitants are expected to have a wwtp discharge orders of magnitude lower with emissions of about 0 9 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people as previously estimated by lawrence and bariel 2010 the discrepancy between the gd emissions estimated for salvador and other cities may reflect the almost exponential increase of the number of mri exams performed over the past decade suggesting that the estimates of knappe et al 2005 and lawrence and bariel 2010 may be outdated and therefore too low the number of mri exams in germany for instance almost doubled between 2005 72 8 mri exams 1000 inhabitants and 2014 131 mri exams 1000 inhabitants oecd 2018 a similar trend was also observed for other countries such as australia united states chile and canada oecd 2018 that also use submarine outfalls to discharge treated sewage in addition for this study samples were collected only on weekdays during business hours when highest gd inputs are expected to occur that is these estimates are maximum values and no true averages 3 4 estimated anthropogenic gd contribution from brazil to the atlantic ocean the number of inhabitants and the level of access to the health system directly affect in the amount of the gd that reaches wwtps and submarine outfalls lawrence et al 2009 showed that even if there are no hospitals in a neighborhood there might still be sources of anthropogenic gd since there might be people who take the exam in nearby cities and end up releasing the complex when they return home according to the brazilian ministry of health 2017 more than 31 thousand mri exams were performed in 2016 in salvador through the public health system the public health system in brazil is used for around 48 of the population whereas around 28 of the brazilian population uses private health insurance agencia brasil 2018 this system nevertheless is very deficient and patients may be on a waiting list for months before gaining access to mri exams a number of people that do not have private health insurance and are under serious health threat shall then pay for private care e g mri exams despite the high cost there is no official value for the total number of mri exams i e the sum of the public and private systems performed annually in brazil however since this is an expensive exam that has a limited administration in the brazilian public health system it is estimated that the 31 thousand exams performed by the public system correspond to only about 10 of the total rmi examinations performed in salvador i e the total number of rmi is projected in 310 thousand considering that in around 40 of mri exams a gd complex is used as a contrast agent kanal 2016 that 0 1 mmol of gd per kg of body weight is applied telgmann et al 2013 and that an average body weight is 70 kg ibge 2018 it is estimated that between 13 7 31 000 rmi exams and 137 kg 310 000 rmi exams of gd is used in salvador per year the same estimate for the largest cities in brazil would result in between 71 2 and 712 kg of gd for são paulo 162 014 mri performed by the public system in 2016 brazilian ministry of health 2017 and between 14 1 and 141 kg 32 061 mri performed by the public system in 2016 brazilian ministry of health 2017 respectively when using the number of mri exams performed by the public system in brazil 1 2 million brazilian ministry of health 2017 added to the number predicted for the private system totalizing 12 millions of exams it is estimated that between 527 kg and 5 3 tons of gd from anthropogenic sources are released to continental and marine waters potentially contaminating ground waters river waters de campos and enzweiler 2016 and seawaters as shown in this study rough order of magnitude estimations of the emissions of anthropogenic gd to the atlantic ocean coming from submarine outfalls can be performed and are presented in table s1 for these estimates it was assumed that gd release through submarine outfalls would be proportional to population size in the area and to the submarine outfall flux for large cities the number of inhabitants that undergo mri is proportional to the number of inhabitants for small cities nevertheless it is expected that gd concentrations in wwtp effluents would be more variable and the number of mri would not be proportional to the population as suggested by rabiet et al 2005 for the estimation of the outfalls emission along the cost of brazil the smallest and the highest gd values measured for the erv and the ebr were used these values provide the potential range of emissions assuming a conservative approach when using the lowest measured concentration i e minimum value at the ebr and also the highest value maximum value measured at the ebr that would represent the level of rmi usage in large brazilian cities although this value is possibly much higher for são paulo and rio de janeiro which are highly populous cities with access to a good health system for the wealthy part of the population data for most of the outfalls in brazil are of restrict access for several outfalls there was no information of the number of people served thus in these cases in order to estimate the amount of gd emitted by the outfall it was assumed that between 40 and 80 of the total population is served by each outfall according to a rough estimate between 255 and 738 kg gd year 1 are discharged into atlantic waters through brazilian submarine sewage outfalls this value does not consider the gd inputs from wwtps that discharge into freshwater systems that eventually drain into the atlantic ocean it is expected that large freshwater systems along the coast of brazil such as the capibaribe the doce and the guaiba patos lagoon system carry a substantial amount of gd the values obtained for the tropical atlantic are in the same range of inputs estimated for the osaka bay 430 kg gd year 1 ogata and terakado 2006 and the yellow sea 952 319 kg gd year 1 song et al 2017 the são paulo state the most populous one has 10 submarine outfalls it was estimated that emissions for the submarine outfalls of são paulo alone range from 3 2 to 25 2 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people adding between 105 and 303 g gd d 1 directly into atlantic waters this is considered a quite low amount since a large part of these emissaries are considered small flow 1 m3 s it is expected that the contribution coming from rivers that drain highly populous areas would be elevated due to the potential high amount of effluents they receive on the other hand the state of rio de janeiro which has three sewage outflows is considered responsible for about one third of total brazilian outfalls gd input into the atlantic ranging from 237 to 689 g gd day 1 this high input is probably due to the fact that rio de janeiro houses the second largest city in the country with about 6 5 million people ibge 2018 inhabiting the coastal zone although the calculations presented here are obviously poorly constrained they are encouraging estimations to be refined in order to understand the fate of this new contaminant and tracer in ocean water because of its stability in the environment it is important to know how much anthropogenic gd has been discharged in ocean waters and what has been its fate submarine sewage outfalls are an important conduit for anthropogenic gd to atlantic waters and likely to all other oceans the impact of these inputs and the fate of this contaminant is yet to be determined in order to subside ecosystem risk assessments and asses the benefits of development and or implementation of mitigation measures 4 conclusions the normalized ree patterns for the coastal waters are characterized by slight lree depletions and a small negative ce anomaly most samples have evident positive gd anomalies in seawaters which are attributed to the contamination by mri contrast agents in medical use there is a daily variability in the inputs of gd to the ocean associated with the variability of mri applications throughout the week the gd complex behaves conservatively and can be used as a new tracer for sewage discharges from submarine outfalls in ocean waters considering the number of mri exams performed in brazil estimated in 12 million exams per year between the public and private systems it is calculated that between 527 kg and 5 3 tons of gd from anthropogenic sources were released into the environment in 2016 it was roughly estimated that between 698 and 2021 g gd d 1 are discharged into atlantic waters due to submarine outfall sewage along the coast of brazil the application of ree as technology critical elements and for medical purposes is changing the abundance of these elements in the environment and may impair their use as tracers of natural processes in areas affected by

19294,the use of gadolinium gd complexes as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging mri has resulted in point source releases of anthropogenic gd into the environment and presents the opportunity to trace the fate of wastewater plumes here we collected seawater samples along the coast of northeast brazil to investigate the influence of two submarine sewage outfalls on the distribution of gd and other rare earth elements ree in the coastal waters the shale normalized rees only show a small light over heavy ree enrichment and negative ce anomalies likely reflecting the influence of freshwater inputs positive gd anomalies are observed at most of the sampling sites indicating the ubiquitous presence of anthropogenic gd in coastal waters the highest gd anomalies are found in the vicinity of the submarine sewage outfalls and decrease with increasing distance from point source the total daily discharge of 216 82 g gd and 92 0 19 3 g gd was calculated for the rio vermelho erv and boca do rio ebr submarine outfalls respectively which on population bases equates to 11 5 4 3 g gd d 1 for erv and 15 5 3 3 g gd d 1 for ebr per 100 000 persons it is estimated that in 2016 the annual emission of anthropogenic gd by hospitals and clinics in brazil varied between 527 kg and 5 3 tons it was roughly estimated that between 698 and 2021 g gd d 1 are discharged into

agent ree geotraces 1 introduction the intense technological progress in the past 30 years increased the need for the development of new materials and the global demand for rare earth elements rees because of their unique physical and chemical properties they are critical elements for many renewable energy and high technologies e g computer memory rechargeable batteries smart phones electric vehicles wind turbines defense and medical applications the individual properties of each ree provide performance that is currently irreplaceable by alternative materials du and graedel 2011 which is strongly influencing their demands the global production of the rees has increased exponentially since the 1950s and there are expectations that the demands will expand up to 2600 in the next 25 years in the case of dy which is heavily used in electric vehicles and wind turbines alonso et al 2012 the progressively increasing use of rees is accompanied by the release of similarly increasing amounts of those elements into the environment where their concentrations can exceed in orders of magnitude their background values that is the case for la klaver et al 2014 kulaksız and bau 2013 2011 song et

about the potential toxicity of gd due to its ability to block calcium ion channels in the cells as its ionic radius is nearly equal to the divalent ca2 that is gd3 is able to compete with ca2 in physiological processes usually binding with higher affinity than ca2 sherry et al 2009 leading to decreasing neuromuscular transmission and interference with intracellular enzymes and cell membranes processes through the transmetalation process mundim et al 2009 shellock and spinazzi 2008 uptake of natural and or anthropogenic gd has been observed for plants and organisms braun et al 2018 lingott et al 2016 martino et al 2017 parisi et al 2017 robert et al 2016 yang et al 2016 however the gd impact on aquatic organisms is still poorly understood and the gd fate behavior bioavailability and toxicological impact are urgent issues that need to be addressed since first described in river waters in the mid 1990 bau and dulski 1996 the anthropogenic anomaly of gd in the environment has been traced back to the increasing use of gd based contrast agents gd cas used in magnetic resonance imaging mri due to its paramagnetic properties gd cas have been used to enhance the detail and clarity of diagnosis in mri offering lower risk of allergies and interaction with patients than other contrasts kanal 2016 such as iodinated contrast the structural design of the gd cas varies by manufacturer due to differences in the binder which may be ionic or neutral linear or cyclic these contrast agents are commonly complexed with polyaminocarboxylic acid chelating agents telgmann et al 2013 in order to avoid the high toxicity of free gd3 yang and sachs 1989 until recently it has been considered that gd cas are not metabolized by the human organism and are quickly excreted via urine in patients with functional kidneys the administered contrast agent excretion half life is about 1 5 hrs but may exceed 30 hrs in patients with renal insufficiency idée et al 2008 and references therein although new studies have shown that patients administered with gd cas may have incorporated part of the compounds in tissues including brain bone and kidneys rogosnitzky and branch 2016 most of the gdanthr enters the public sewage system after just a few hours of the gd cas applications depending on the population size level of access to health systems and number of hospitals and clinics performing mri diagnosis the inputs of gdanthr into the environment vary strongly but can be high currently there are no data considering the impact of ocean submarine outfalls on the concentrations of rees in the marine environment despite the fact that many large coastal cities in the world have adopted this pipeline system as the main solution for their sewage disposal several of the most populated cities in latin america have submarine outfalls that discharge effluents into the ocean after having undergone no treatment or only primary treatment only removing major particles brazil has about 20 major ocean submarine outfalls discharging more than 60 m3 s of effluents into tropical coastal waters table s1 most of these outfalls are designed according to modern criteria to ensure high dilution of effluents roberts et al 2010 as for today there are no ree specific limits or standards either for ree abundances in sewage treatments effluents or receiving water bodies partly because their ecological effects are poorly understood as for places that also have secondary or tertiary treatments involving organic degradation and disinfection it is expected that gd cas pass wastewater treatment plants wwtps mostly unhindered and enter aquatic systems due to the high solubility of the polar or ionic gd cas and their high complex stability telgmann et al 2012 showed that only approximately 10 of the gd is removed during sewage treatment in wwtps and that species transformation may take place during treatment processes because of the stability of gd cas and their potentially high half lives i e more than 100 days holzbecher et al 2005 in the environment it is important to know how much anthropogenic gd has been discharged into marine waters and what has been its fate only then their distribution patterns can be explained and the potential impacts and benefits of mitigation measures can be assessed in this context this study aims to test if the two ocean submarine sewage outfalls located on the coast of salvador northeast brazil are causing anomalies in the distributions of rees in waters off the coast of salvador secondly this study aims at a rough estimation of gd inputs by brazilian ocean submarine outfalls in the tropical and south atlantic due to hospital applications in mri 2 methods 2 1 study site sampling took place off the northeastern coast of brazil in the vicinity of salvador fig 1 the third most populous 3 million city of the country two submarine wwtps serve more than 80 of the inhabitants the rio vermelho submarine outfall erv started operating in 1975 and serves 1 9 million inhabitants whereas the boca do rio outfall ebr was built in 2011 to cover the exceeding demand of the sewage system serving around 600 thousand people the erv is a 2 4 km long concrete steel pipeline with an inner diameter of 1 75 m it discharges close to the entrance of todos os santos bay at 27 m water depth with a flow rate of 8 3 m3 s 1 jordão and rosman 2016 while boca do rio submarine outfall ebr is a 3 3 km long hdpe tube with an inner diameter of 1 60 m that discharges at a water depth of 45 m and a flow rate of 5 9 m3 s 1 jordão and rosman 2016 although departing from different pretreatment stations the treatment mechanisms are similar for the sewage of both outfalls these include passing the sewage through a mesh screen to remove large objects followed by sedimentation basins where sand and larger solids are removed final sieving 2 and 1 5 mm mesh size in erv and ebr respectively and discharge through the outfalls into the ocean the hydrodynamics at the shallow coastal waters in the vicinity of the outfalls are strongly controlled by the wind field and meso scale circulation amorim et al 2012 southerly winds induce water flow to the northeast during austral winter northeasterly winds cause southwestward coastal currents during summer near the entrance of the bay costal currents become highly modulated by rising tides which during summer promote rapid westward water flow and a potential transport of discharged sewage into shore waters cirano and lessa 2007 the later causes concern because at this time of the year the number of tourists starts to increase leading to an increase in the amount of sewage generated as well as the number of bathers on the beaches of salvador the climate in salvador is tropical humid and there are only two seasons wet april to july and dry august to march the annual average precipitation is 1781 mm while the annual minimum and maximum temperature varies between 22 8 and 28 3 c respectively climate data 2018 2 2 sample collection surficial and bottom samples supplementary material table s2 were collected on november 28th and 29th of 2016 at fourteen sites off the coast of salvador sampling locations fig 1 were chosen considering the discharge position of the submarine outfalls of erv and ebr water circulation and predominant winds in order to evaluate the plume dispersion bottom water was collected with a teflon coated go flo bottle surface samples were collected with a trace metal clean surface pump system that included a peristaltic pump masterflex cole parmer instrument company usa and pfa teflon tubing the sample inlet mounted on a telescopic rod was lowered to around 1 m below the water surface at each sample station and collected samples were filtered through pre cleaned 0 1m hcl capsule filters 0 2 μm supor acropak with fluorodyne ii membrane the filtered samples were collected into precleaned low density polyethylene ldpe bottles after rinsing three times with the sample and acidified to ph 1 8 hcl 30 suprapur merck and stored in double plastic bags at ambient temperature before sampling all ldpe bottles and tubing were cleaned with detergent extran merck germany all material was then soaked in a 6 n hcl solution reagent grade followed by a 7 n hno3 solution bath each cleaning step lasted for a week and followed the protocols for trace metal clean sampling of the geotraces program cutter et al 2017 the pre cleaned bottles were filled with a diluted hno3 traceselect fluka analytical germany solution and stored until sample collection the tubing and capsule filters were thoroughly rinsed with at least 3l of local water between samplings in situ ancillary variables temperature salinity depth and ph were measured using a pre calibrated multiprobe ysi 6600v ohio usa at wwtps effluent waters that feed the erv and ebr submarine outfalls were carefully collected into 250 ml pre cleaned bottles immediately prior to entering the submarine outfalls over three consecutive days 11th to 13th of april 2017 tuesday to thursday between at 3 and 3h30 p m which is the maximum flow time mota 2017 these samples were filtered using cellulose acetate membrane filter with 0 45 μm pore size sartorius stedim biotech germany and acidified to ph 1 8 2 3 pre concentration of rees and id icp ms determination the preconcentration and analysis of rees by isotope dilution id icp ms followed the method described in behrens et al 2016 briefly 5 ml aliquots of each sample were weighed and spiked with a multi element ree isotope spike the volume of spike was optimized for each sample aiming at a145nd 143nd ratio of 6 to keep the error magnification factor low while not compromising analytical precision the sample mixture was left to homogenize for at least 48 hrs and was then made up to 12 ml for dilution using acidified ultrapure water ph 2 to maintain the ph below 2 next samples were pre concentrated using the automated seafast pico system elemental scientific inc omaha nebraska usa which avoids sample handling and assures high reproducibility in this system 10 ml of spiked sample were pre concentrated and the matrix was removed to avoid interferences during analysis the details of the seafast pre concentration procedure have been previously described by behrens et al 2016 and can be summarized as follows first the pre concentration column was preconditioned using a buffer solution 157 ml high purity water 140 ml glacial acetic acid and 203 ml 20 ammonium hydroxide the sample was then loaded into the sample loop where the buffer solution was added to elevate the ph to 6 prior to passing the sample through the pre concentration column packed with a chelating resin consisting of ethylenediaminetriacetic acid and iminodiacetic acid functional groups the column was then rinsed with the buffer solution to wash out the seawater matrix the rees were eluted using 500 μl of 1 5 n hno3 into pre cleaned pfa vials the ree concentration measurements were performed by hr icp ms element thermo finnigan germany coupled to a desolvation sample introduction system aridus 2 teledyne cetac omaha usa that used a nitrogen argon gas mixture to enhance sensitivity and minimize oxide formations briefly the instrument was optimized using a 100 ng l tune solution of ba ce and lu to obtain high sensitivity and low oxide formation 0 01 0 03 for ce oxide oxide interference corrections were therefore not necessary spiked and unspiked standards were analyzed in each batch to check the sensitivity for mono isotope elements and correction of the equipment mass bias the analytical procedures have already been described in detail by behrens et al 2016 and are listed in table s3 accuracy was checked using geotraces reference samples north pacific safe 3000 m and geotraces santa barbara costal water gsc table 1 replicate analyses of samples showed 1std below 3 except yb 6 4 for effluent water samples aliquots of 10 ml per sample were evaporated and then made up to 1 ml with 0 6 m hno3 the rees for effluent samples were determined by the same hr icp ms low resolution mode r 300 oxide formation rate 0 5 without prior matrix removal by seafast analysis of slrs 4 river water crm nrcc canada indicated accuracy of 97 for gd whereas for all other rees the recovery varied between 72 and 86 compared to values presented by lawrence and kamber 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolved concentrations and normalized ree patterns in seawater all ree concentrations from this study are elevated compared to the open south atlantic ocean zheng et al 2016 and the sum of rees varied from 79 4 to 167 pmol kg 1 table 2 compared to range from 71 7 to 80 2 pmol kg 1 found in the open southwestern atlantic stations 1 3 and 4 zheng et al 2016 for the same water depths the differences in ree concentrations between surface and bottom waters at each location were not significant p 0 05 except for eu tb and er table s4 for which surface waters were slighted depleted in ree compared to bottom waters the spatial distribution of ree concentrations along the coast showed higher variability for the lrees la to eu than for the hrees gd to lu la concentrations varied by up to 34 among stations and its lowest values were found at station erv and at the entrance of todos os santos bay the hree varied only by up to 12 tb among sample locations element specific complexation by carbonate ions and affinity for various inorganic phases e g carbonates phosphates and organic ligands can explain the different concentrations of the rees in seawater e g byrne and kim 1990 byrne and sholkovitz 1996 and their spatial variability the hrees are more prone to remain in the complexed form than in the ionic state when compared to lrees bau and dulski 1996 henderson 1984 zhong and mucci 1995 hrees are less likely to be caught in reactions and be adsorbed to precipitating material than lrees therefore presenting lower spatial variability 3 1 1 ree fractionation in order to visualize the elemental fractionation relative to continental sources of rees to remove the oddo harkins effect in their natural abundances and also to allow an easy comparison with data from elsewhere ree abundance patterns are typically normalized to the average composition of the continental crust e g in post archean australian shale paas mclennan 1989 the shale normalized rees suffix sn for all stations shows relatively flat patterns with hree enrichment over lree and negative ce anomalies fig 2 these features likely reflect the influence of freshwater inputs e g jaguaribe passa vaca lucaia and todos os santos bay tributaries and are commonly observed in coastal seawaters e g bertram and elderfield 1993 garcia solsona et al 2014 jeandel 1993 zheng et al 2016 samples also presented positive gd anomalies that will be discussed separately 3 1 2 the shale normalized ersn ndsn ratios which provide a measure of fractionation across the ree series are all greater than unity table 2 fig 3 the highest ratio 3 99 is more than 2 fold the ratio from the station with the lowest ersn ndsn 1 61 the hree enrichment is more evident at sampling stations closer to the todos os santos bay entrance gradually decreasing towards the north along the salvador coast reaching a minimum enrichment at station e02 the rivers along the coast jaguaribe passa vaca lucaia the todos os santos bay with its mangroves seagrasses and coral reefs hatje and andrade 2009 and the erv and ebr submarine outfalls are important sources of organic matter for the coastal zone the depleted levels of lree close to outfalls especially at the ebr and at the entrance of the bay suggests that colloidal organic matter as well as suspended particles associated with the discharge of effluents may be controlling lree removal from seawater in similar mixing and removal processes to those of estuaries e g elderfield 1988 martin et al 1976 sholkovitz and elderfield 1988 the submarine outfalls discharge pre filtered effluents 10 30 of large particles removed silva 2011 with a large organic colloidal pool that interacts with seawater during the rapid mixture of waters along the effluent discharge plume suggesting that coagulation might account for the observed distributions organic molecules are major carriers of rees in the colloidal fraction e g bau et al 2013 tang and johannesson 2003 the higher the amount of colloids in the water the more hree enriched the samples are elderfield et al 1990 sholkovitz 1995 in addition the flat ree patterns of the coastal zone of salvador are in the same range of fractionation as the surface water observed at stations in the brazil basin southwestern atlantic surface water i e ersn ndsn of 2 64 at 11 s 330 e zheng et al 2016 and are likely to reflect the influence of the terrigenous inputs along the coast the ree values of this study were also normalized to the ree abundances of this south atlantic 11 s 330 e surface sample this normalization emphasizes subtle differences between samples that might otherwise escape detection the normalized patterns fig 4 show a slight enrichment in all rees except eu with a stronger enrichment of lrees especially for stations around the boca do rio submarine outfall stations e01 e05 including the stations e01 and e03 which are more distant from the emissaries and were not expected to be under their influence this region is under the influence of not only the ebr but also the jaguaribe river the discharge of the river in coastal waters seems to be exporting rees from geogenic pools transported from the drainage basin compared to atlantic ocean waters the ce anomalies in these samples are smaller 3 1 2 gd dissolved concentrations the anthropogenic imprints in seawaters seawater concentrations of gd concentration observed at the erv 12 0 pmol kg 1 was two fold higher than the average concentration for all other samples 5 64 0 99 pmol kg 1 and decreased with increasing distance from the outfall at this station as a result of rising of the plume above the outfall diffusers the concentration of gd in surface water 12 0 pmol kg 1 was almost 3 times the values observed for the bottom water 4 75 pmol kg 1 the peak in gd concentration coincided with the minimum salinity observed table s2 salinity difference between the sewage plume and reference e01 site at the surface δs 0 5 provide evidence for the substantial freshwater i e sewage input discharge by the erv although the input of effluents from ebr is smaller than the erv salinity differences still indicate the impact of the sewage inputs by this discharge system as well salinity anomalies are of the same order as the ones reported by ramos et al 2007 roth et al 2016 and petrenko et al 1997 for other effluent plumes the chelated form of anthropogenic gd i e gd ca largely used in clinical and diagnostic medical imaging shows an important persistence in the dissolved phase and is entirely present in the truly dissolved ree pool kulaksız and bau 2013 in contrast to the natural rees the anthropogenic gd seems to behave conservatively passing estuaries and sewage effluent seawater interfaces mostly unaffected hatje et al 2014 kulaksız and bau 2007 detailed studies on the behavior of anthropogenic gd in marine waters are lacking 3 2 ree anomalies in seawater the amount of preferential ce removal relative to its lanthanide neighbors is displayed by the ce anomaly defined as ce ce cesn lasn x prsn 0 5 mclennan 1989 lower ce ce values indicate a stronger ce removal relative to la and pr ce anomaly is an important feature found in the ocean especially at deep waters it results of the ce3 oxidation followed by preferential scavenging of the ce4 which is very insoluble in seawater byrne and kim 1990 elderfield 1988 moffett 1990 the ce anomaly varied from 0 5 in the surface waters at the entrance of the bay to less pronounced values 0 8 at surface waters in the vicinity of the erv with values around 0 6 in the vicinity of the ebr the range of this results is in accordance with previously published papers for coastal waters hatje et al 2016 ogata and terakado 2006 and lower than found in oceanic waters bertram and elderfield 1993 zheng et al 2016 once no correlation between ce and ph was observed r 0 22 p 0 05 the suspended particles moffett 1990 and organic rich material elderfield 1988 associated with the terrigenous influence as discussed above and the discharge of the outfalls may be promoting the complexation of ce3 thus avoiding its oxidation and formation of pronounced anomalies in addition the ph may be promoting the higher stability of ce3 in solution elderfield et al 1990 especially in the erv station where one of the lowest measured ph values was observed probably exerting a key role in this station natural gd anomalies in seawater have been described as the result of the tetrad effect due to the unusual high stability of gd resulting from the half filled 4f electron in its orbital shell masuda and ikeuchi 1979 despite of that the pronounced gd anomalies associated with the erv gdsn gdsn 1 7 table 2 see also fig 5 and a smaller one associated to ebr at bottom waters gdsn gdsn 1 4 table 2 fig 2 indicate that an anthropogenic point source must be responsible for gd anomalies this source is not producing anthropogenic anomalies for the other ree among the different approaches to estimate gd anomalies the 3rd order polynomial fit excluding ce and eu because of their redox chemistry is the only one that makes no implicit assumption whether gd behaves as lree or hree möller et al 2002 the application of this method is then more appealing as it can be used for the whole range of waters from effluents of wwtp to seawaters the anthropogenic component of gd gdanth was then calculated by the difference between the measured and the theoretical gd calculated by the 3rd order polynomial fit the gd anomalies estimated range from 0 96 to 3 4 fig 5 positive gd anthropogenic anomalies 1 3 are observed in most stations in the proximity to the sewage outfalls erv and ebr whereas lower positive anomalies 1 3 are observed at the stations located at the entrance of the todos os santos bay the highest concentration of gdanth 8 45 pmol kg 1 is observed at the surface of erv submarine outfall station table 2 fig s1 as can be seen in fig s1 the gdanth concentrations are highest closer to the erv up to 70 of the total gd which serves the area where most hospitals and medical clinics are located and gradually decrease with distance indicating the outfall as the source of anthropogenic gd to the seawaters off the coast of salvador the form of the wastewater spreading observed by the gd anomalies indicates a preferential transport to the south and southwest of the discharge point of the erv and an eastern dispersion at the ebr these results are consistent with the prevailing wind and tidal driven southwestern currents that may transport the effluents towards the shores during austral summer and spring amorim et al 2012 roth et al 2016 when salvador s beaches are most visited the ubiquitous occurrence and mostly conservative behavior of gdanth in effluents of wwtps indicates that this element is a useful tracer for wastewater discharges elbaz poulichet et al 2002 hatje et al 2016 lawrence et al 2009 ogata and terakado 2006 in freshwater and marine systems and a proxy for the potential presence of other contaminants associated with sewage inputs nevertheless the reports on the occurrence of anthropogenic ree anomalies in seawater compared to other systems are still scarce as illustrated in table 3 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that reports gd inputs at the discharge point of submarine outfalls among the data available in the literature table 3 the values for the anthropogenic gd anomalies found in this study are among the highest reported for marine waters within the same range of anomalies observed in san francisco bay hatje et al 2016 2014 but lower than the highest anomalies reported for tokyo bay nozaki et al 2000 however if compared to gd anomalies registered in fluvial systems that receive effluents from wwtps they are up to two orders of magnitude lower table 3 despite the intrinsic differences in the gd concentrations in sewage water leaving wwtps which are related to the number of mri performed using gd cas the difference in magnitude observed between rivers and marine water systems is possibly related to the hydrodynamics that promote dilution and transport resulting in a faster and more efficient dilution of the anthropogenic gd signal in seawater 3 3 gd in the effluents of the wwtps the coarse screening to remove large particles used in the ebr and erv wwtps do not promote removal of ree the primary secondary and tertiary treatment however can cause the removal of natural dissolved ree during treatment operations and potentially highlight the excess in gd from anthropogenic sources verplanck et al 2010 since only a minor fraction of it can be removed at wwtps telgmann et al 2012 the effluents from the wwtps are highly enriched in gd and show large differences in their daily gd concentrations measured at maximum flow time with the largest range found for the erv ranging from 1160 pmol kg 1 to 2605 pmol kg 1 table 4 the peek value was found on tuesday and the minimum value on wednesday indicating a daily variation in the discharge of anthropogenic gd in wastewater effluents gadolinium concentrations measured at the ebr 900 1382 pmol kg 1 were up to 2 9 times lower than at the erv and the daily variation for this site was only 21 about half of the variability encountered at the erv all other ree for every wwtps sample were up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than gd concentrations fig s2 the concentrations ranged from 0 8 pmol kg 1 for tb wwtp rv to 49 9 pmol kg 1 for la wwtp rv it is clear evidence that regarding the ree discharge through sewage only gd is being anomalously released the erv has the largest discharge along the coast of brazil table s1 as expected from a wwtp discharge in a densely populated area with well developed medical and health care facilities the effluents from the erv carry a clear anthropogenic gd signal despite the also high average discharge of the ebr and the fact that this submarine outfall serves around 600 thousand people only a small number of medical facilities and hospitals are present in the catchment area which in part explains the difference in gd concentrations observed between the effluents of both wwtps the gd concentration values observed here table 4 are on the same order of magnitude of values reported for wwtp discharge in densely populated areas in countries with highly developed health care systems such as australia and germany knappe et al 2005 kulaksız and bau 2007 lawrence et al 2009 in both wwtps the anthropogenic gd was detected at every sampling over three consecutive days indicating its ubiquitous occurrence in effluents continuously discharged in the coastal tropical atlantic waters there was important variability in concentrations of gd in effluent waters between sampling dates the concentrations of gd in wwtps are weekday dependent due to the predominant use of mri diagnostics between monday and friday brünjes et al 2016 kümmerer and helmers 2000 telgmann et al 2012 the daily variability was higher at erv than at the ebr that receives less effluent from medical facilities gadolinium contrast agents are expected to be applying to a relatively small number of people within the catchment area of the ebr the spikes of gd contrasts from the reduced number of applications in the area served by the ebr and or from the excreted gd contrasts applied in other regions would result in inhomogeneous loads of anthropogenic gd however given the large dilution capacity of the sewage system these spikes are mixed along transport and treatment resulting in a more homogeneous effluent the temporal variation in gd concentrations in the effluent waters of the wwtps are a result of the dynamics between the amount of gd contrasts administered daily and the time of application and excretion of contrast agents among other factors such as proportion of the population undergoing mri i e erratic population during summer months transport dilution and retention time in wwtps a total daily discharge of 216 82 g gd and 92 0 19 3 g gd was calculated for the wwtps of erv and ebr respectively on a population basis these values equate to 11 5 4 3 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people for erv and 15 5 3 3 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people for ebr in comparison heavily populated areas in berlin have wwtps discharging 5 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people as estimated for the period between 1997 and 2000 knappe et al 2005 and in se queensland a wwtp has a discharge of 3 3 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people lawrence et al 2009 less populated areas 100 000 inhabitants are expected to have a wwtp discharge orders of magnitude lower with emissions of about 0 9 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people as previously estimated by lawrence and bariel 2010 the discrepancy between the gd emissions estimated for salvador and other cities may reflect the almost exponential increase of the number of mri exams performed over the past decade suggesting that the estimates of knappe et al 2005 and lawrence and bariel 2010 may be outdated and therefore too low the number of mri exams in germany for instance almost doubled between 2005 72 8 mri exams 1000 inhabitants and 2014 131 mri exams 1000 inhabitants oecd 2018 a similar trend was also observed for other countries such as australia united states chile and canada oecd 2018 that also use submarine outfalls to discharge treated sewage in addition for this study samples were collected only on weekdays during business hours when highest gd inputs are expected to occur that is these estimates are maximum values and no true averages 3 4 estimated anthropogenic gd contribution from brazil to the atlantic ocean the number of inhabitants and the level of access to the health system directly affect in the amount of the gd that reaches wwtps and submarine outfalls lawrence et al 2009 showed that even if there are no hospitals in a neighborhood there might still be sources of anthropogenic gd since there might be people who take the exam in nearby cities and end up releasing the complex when they return home according to the brazilian ministry of health 2017 more than 31 thousand mri exams were performed in 2016 in salvador through the public health system the public health system in brazil is used for around 48 of the population whereas around 28 of the brazilian population uses private health insurance agencia brasil 2018 this system nevertheless is very deficient and patients may be on a waiting list for months before gaining access to mri exams a number of people that do not have private health insurance and are under serious health threat shall then pay for private care e g mri exams despite the high cost there is no official value for the total number of mri exams i e the sum of the public and private systems performed annually in brazil however since this is an expensive exam that has a limited administration in the brazilian public health system it is estimated that the 31 thousand exams performed by the public system correspond to only about 10 of the total rmi examinations performed in salvador i e the total number of rmi is projected in 310 thousand considering that in around 40 of mri exams a gd complex is used as a contrast agent kanal 2016 that 0 1 mmol of gd per kg of body weight is applied telgmann et al 2013 and that an average body weight is 70 kg ibge 2018 it is estimated that between 13 7 31 000 rmi exams and 137 kg 310 000 rmi exams of gd is used in salvador per year the same estimate for the largest cities in brazil would result in between 71 2 and 712 kg of gd for são paulo 162 014 mri performed by the public system in 2016 brazilian ministry of health 2017 and between 14 1 and 141 kg 32 061 mri performed by the public system in 2016 brazilian ministry of health 2017 respectively when using the number of mri exams performed by the public system in brazil 1 2 million brazilian ministry of health 2017 added to the number predicted for the private system totalizing 12 millions of exams it is estimated that between 527 kg and 5 3 tons of gd from anthropogenic sources are released to continental and marine waters potentially contaminating ground waters river waters de campos and enzweiler 2016 and seawaters as shown in this study rough order of magnitude estimations of the emissions of anthropogenic gd to the atlantic ocean coming from submarine outfalls can be performed and are presented in table s1 for these estimates it was assumed that gd release through submarine outfalls would be proportional to population size in the area and to the submarine outfall flux for large cities the number of inhabitants that undergo mri is proportional to the number of inhabitants for small cities nevertheless it is expected that gd concentrations in wwtp effluents would be more variable and the number of mri would not be proportional to the population as suggested by rabiet et al 2005 for the estimation of the outfalls emission along the cost of brazil the smallest and the highest gd values measured for the erv and the ebr were used these values provide the potential range of emissions assuming a conservative approach when using the lowest measured concentration i e minimum value at the ebr and also the highest value maximum value measured at the ebr that would represent the level of rmi usage in large brazilian cities although this value is possibly much higher for são paulo and rio de janeiro which are highly populous cities with access to a good health system for the wealthy part of the population data for most of the outfalls in brazil are of restrict access for several outfalls there was no information of the number of people served thus in these cases in order to estimate the amount of gd emitted by the outfall it was assumed that between 40 and 80 of the total population is served by each outfall according to a rough estimate between 255 and 738 kg gd year 1 are discharged into atlantic waters through brazilian submarine sewage outfalls this value does not consider the gd inputs from wwtps that discharge into freshwater systems that eventually drain into the atlantic ocean it is expected that large freshwater systems along the coast of brazil such as the capibaribe the doce and the guaiba patos lagoon system carry a substantial amount of gd the values obtained for the tropical atlantic are in the same range of inputs estimated for the osaka bay 430 kg gd year 1 ogata and terakado 2006 and the yellow sea 952 319 kg gd year 1 song et al 2017 the são paulo state the most populous one has 10 submarine outfalls it was estimated that emissions for the submarine outfalls of são paulo alone range from 3 2 to 25 2 g gd d 1 per 100 000 people adding between 105 and 303 g gd d 1 directly into atlantic waters this is considered a quite low amount since a large part of these emissaries are considered small flow 1 m3 s it is expected that the contribution coming from rivers that drain highly populous areas would be elevated due to the potential high amount of effluents they receive on the other hand the state of rio de janeiro which has three sewage outflows is considered responsible for about one third of total brazilian outfalls gd input into the atlantic ranging from 237 to 689 g gd day 1 this high input is probably due to the fact that rio de janeiro houses the second largest city in the country with about 6 5 million people ibge 2018 inhabiting the coastal zone although the calculations presented here are obviously poorly constrained they are encouraging estimations to be refined in order to understand the fate of this new contaminant and tracer in ocean water because of its stability in the environment it is important to know how much anthropogenic gd has been discharged in ocean waters and what has been its fate submarine sewage outfalls are an important conduit for anthropogenic gd to atlantic waters and likely to all other oceans the impact of these inputs and the fate of this contaminant is yet to be determined in order to subside ecosystem risk assessments and asses the benefits of development and or implementation of mitigation measures 4 conclusions the normalized ree patterns for the coastal waters are characterized by slight lree depletions and a small negative ce anomaly most samples have evident positive gd anomalies in seawaters which are attributed to the contamination by mri contrast agents in medical use there is a daily variability in the inputs of gd to the ocean associated with the variability of mri applications throughout the week the gd complex behaves conservatively and can be used as a new tracer for sewage discharges from submarine outfalls in ocean waters considering the number of mri exams performed in brazil estimated in 12 million exams per year between the public and private systems it is calculated that between 527 kg and 5 3 tons of gd from anthropogenic sources were released into the environment in 2016 it was roughly estimated that between 698 and 2021 g gd d 1 are discharged into atlantic waters due to submarine outfall sewage along the coast of brazil the application of ree as technology critical elements and for medical purposes is changing the abundance of these elements in the environment and may impair their use as tracers of natural processes in areas affected by
