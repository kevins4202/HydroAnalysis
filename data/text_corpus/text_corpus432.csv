2160,the presence of aquatic plants in natural and artificial rivers can cause substantial changes in the flow pattern in this study laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to explore the influences of rigid non submerged plant densities on the transport of solutes in the hyporheic zone the laboratory experiments and numerical modelling results show that solute enters into the streambed around plant and solute in the overlying water experienced a sharp decrease at the beginning followed by a gradual decline phase the concentration in the shallow pore water increases rapidly and increases at a decreasing rate with the increase of depth the presence of a plant causes pressure gradients at the sediment water interface before and after the plant specifically the presence of plants induces the convection exchange of surface water and pore water enables the solute to transport in the streambed through three circulation flows solute tends to transport to the root of the plant or bypass the plant and return to the overlying water over time the rate and quantity of solute transport in the streambed are related to the streamwise and spanwise distances of the plant when the plant densities reach the distance that affect the flow structures near each other smaller streamwise distances lead to the transport of fewer solutes into the streambed and prevent them from penetrating to the deeper part of the streambed while larger spanwise distances have the same effect on solute transport in the streambed the solute effective exchange depth for streamwise distance of 20 cm is 4 3 times that of 3 cm while which for spanwise distance of 3 cm is 5 05 times that of 15 cm at time of 28 h this study shows that the presence of aquatic plants leads to the circulation of solutes in the hyporheic zone which promotes the transport of pollutants from overlying water to streambed through hyporheic exchange after the occurrence of a water pollution event further plants densely in the streamwise direction and sparsely in the spanwise direction will reduce the range of pollutants transport in the streambed this study is of great significance for water

1998 knight et al 2000 ren et al 2013 however the presence of aquatic plants may have an impact on the flow pattern and subsequently the hydraulic characteristics of the river aquatic plants can not

hydrodynamic changes due to flow plant interactions may produce pressure gradients at the sediment water interface swi and induce convection between overlying water and pore water which in turn can change the transport of pollutants between two water bodies bottacin busolin and marion 2010 harvey and bencala 1993 hester and doyle 2008 moreto el al 2022 there is increasing evidence that aquatic plants have an impact on the hydrodynamics and mitigation of pollutants in the overlying water liu et al 2008 ren et al 2020 shahmohammadi et al 2018 waters et al 2016 zhao and huai 2016 li and shen 1973 found that flow velocity was reduced to varying degrees in the presence of non submerged aquatic plants depending on their density and arrangement wu et al 1999 proposed a method to estimate the resistance coefficient of non submerged and submerged plants under uniform flow conditions nepf et al 1999 established a passive scalar diffusion model to describe the drag turbulence and diffusion of flow through non submerged plants hosoi et al 1998 compared the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen in wetlands with and without reeds and concluded that regular planting and harvesting were effective in removing excess nutrients from water bodies yuan et al 2021 established a model to simulate the hyporheic exchange driven by submerged rigid vegetation however it should be noted that the transport process of solutes in the streambed as a result of flow plant interactions is not considered in most previous studies and thus little is known about the effects of aquatic plants on the transport of solutes in the hyporheic zone therefore it is necessary to better understand the mechanism of how aquatic plants affect solutes transport process in the streambed to this end a set of experiments and numerical simulations are conducted in this study in order to clarify the transport process and destination of solutes in the streambed as they flow through aquatic plant by numerical modeling of flow pattern of pore water and quantifying the hyporheic exchange depth solutes transport depth quantity and concentration in the overlying water and pore water specifically we have focused on i the effect of single plant and different plant densities on flow pattern of pore water ii the solutes transport characteristics in the streambed due to rigid non submerged plants and iii the influences of various plant densities on the transport of solutes in the streambed the results of this study may provide important insights into the characteristics of solute transport in the streambed in the presence of aquatic plants and the use of aquatic plants for ecological restoration 2 methods 2 1 laboratory experiments laboratory experiments were performed in a recirculating flume system fig 1 a consisting of a rectangular channel of 11 5 m long 30 cm wide and 50 cm deep as described in previous studies jin et al 2018 jin et al 2022 the walls on both sides of the flume were made of pmma for the sake of observation and photography of the hyporheic exchange process in the streambed artificial sand was used in this study where the bulk porosity Î¸ was measured to be 0 46 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k was measured using a column subjected to a constant head drop chinese national standard 1999 with value of 3 87 10 3 ms 1 and it was thoroughly washed three times with deionized water before each experiment the sediment bed was 5 m long and 20 cm thick the rest of flume is placed with waterproof glass blocks that have the same thickness as the sediment bed to examine the transport of solutes along the streambed one vertical array of sampling holes was set near plant stem on the side of the flume to collect pore water from the streambed a total of 20 sampling holes were arranged from top to bottom and they were spaced 1 cm apart nacl was used as the pollutant and fd c red 40 was used as the tracer and dyestuff to indicate the transport process of nacl in the streambed during the experiment the nacl concentrations at each sampling port were monitored and photos were compared to verify the transport process of solutes in the streambed non submerged and submerged plants both have significant effect on hyporheic exchange in this study we only investigated the effect of rigid non submerged plants on solute transport characteristics in the flat streambed which were simulated using cylindrical aluminum rods with a height of 20 cm and a diameter of 0 6 cm as suggested in previous studies alkis and werth 2004 hsieh 1964 li and shen 1973 wu et al 1999 first several rods were inserted into pvc cuboid strips with drilling holes to form a group of plants fig 1 b each pvc cuboid strip was 29 9 cm length slightly shorter than the width of the tank 1 cm width 1 cm height and all holes had a diameter of 0 6 cm and were spaced 1 cm apart two horizontal tracks were installed at an appropriate height on both inner sides of the recirculating tank and they were parallel to each other each set of plant was placed in the streambed from top to bottom straddled on the track in parallel and unstaggered fig 1 c plants were attached first and then sand was added to prevent the formation of sandpit brought on by the insertion of plants into the streambed and to safeguard the sand layer from damage in order to avoid surface fluctuation and sediment initiation the flow velocity and froude number fr are required to be sufficiently small in this study the distance between two plants in the direction parallel to the flow of water is defined as the streamwise distance sx whereas the distance between two plants in the direction perpendicular the flow of water is defined as the spanwise distance sy fig 2 c the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 which take into account the distribution of non submerged plants in shallow water flume size and previous experimental conditions 2 2 numerical simulations the sequential coupling method proposed by cardenas and colleagues cardenas and wilson 2007a cardenas and wilson 2007b cardenos 2012 elliott and brooks 1997 packman et al 2000 sawyer et al 2011 was used to simulate the stream water flow in the plant domain pore water flow through the streambed and solute transport in the streambed the stream water was computed using the 3d computational fluid dynamics package fluent based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations together with the k Ï turbulence closure scheme jin et al 2010 which has been widely used to calculate flows around a circular cylinder boothroyd et al 2016 dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 zhang 2017 the predicted pressures at the swi were used as the boundary conditions in a 3d comsol based model for simulation of pore water flow and nonreactive solute transport in the streambed detailed descriptions of sequential coupling method can be found in chen et al 2015 in order to improve the calculation efficiency two unit intervals in both spanwise and streamwise directions and half plant stem before and after each side were selected as a representative domain fig 2 c in the downstream flow direction a periodic boundary condition with a pressure drop dp was applied to the upstream and downstream boundaries to drive the flow a symmetry boundary condition was applied to side walls in the spanwise direction in all model runs the vertical water depth h 0 1 m was selected as the simulated height and the froude number fr was 0 11 we assumed the water surface elevation is fixed when the froude number is smaller than 0 2 lee et al 2021 therefore the top face was treated as a frictionless rigid lid and a symmetry boundary condition was applied in numerical simulation a no slip wall boundary condition was applied to the plant stem surface and channel bottom fig 2 a the pore water flow was modeled using darcy s law and the continuity equation for incompressible flow in a non deformable medium based on boundary conditions described by jin et al 2010 symmetry boundary conditions were applied to the side walls of the pore water domain periodic boundary conditions were applied to both upstream and downstream boundaries with the same pressure drop used in the stream water flow domain a no flow boundary condition was applied to the bottom of the pore water flow domain and plant stem surface the depth of the pore water domain was the same as that in the experiment to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the model fig 2 a finally the transport of nonreactive solutes was simulated based on the pore water flow field a no flux boundary condition was applied to the bottom and plant stem surface of the pore water flow domain giving a zero concentration gradient barry and sposito 1988 parlange et al 1992 when the side walls of the pore water domain were treated as symmetry boundary on the upstream and downstream boundaries of the domain periodic conditions were imposed for both the concentration c 0 y z t c l y z t where l is the length of two unit intervals in the downstream flow direction a flux boundary condition was applied along the sediment water interface the boundary condition was set as n u 0 c n 0 n u 0 c c t where n is the unit vector normal to the interface pointing inward u is the pore water flow velocity vector and c t is the concentration of solute in the overlying water fig 2 b as this study only considered the solute transport characteristics in the hyporheic zone due to different densities of rigid non submerged plants and did not take into account the effect of the density gradients associated with the solute concentration buoyancy effect was neglected in the simulation model a structured hexahedral mesh was used in this study to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy the mesh surrounding the plant was carefully designed to have a smooth transition from a fine spacing of 0 05 mm to a coarser spacing with a size growth ratio of 1 1 the grid spacing near the bottom wall was less than 0 3 mm to maintain and resolve a viscous sublayer a boundary layer mesh was constructed near the bottom wall with a size ratio of 1 1 in order to obtain a high density of nodes the number of elements ranged from about 3 000 000 to 5 000 000 with different plant densities a tetrahedral mesh was generated for the pore water flow domain with refinement near the swi and plant stem surface using comsol multiphysics the element number of the pore water flow domain varied from 800 000 to 1 000 000 the simulation parameters are shown in table 1 in order to validate numerical model the plant density was the same as the experiment and was set as the streamwise distance of 15 cm and the spanwise distance of 5 cm furthermore the study of numerical model was extended and two plant densities were considered including a a fixed spacing of 5 cm for the spanwise distance and a variable spacing of 3 5 10 15 and 20 cm for the streamwise distance and b a fixed spacing of 10 cm for the streamwise distance and a variable spacing of 3 5 7 10 and 15 cm for the spanwise distance as the experimental and simulated results are similar under different conditions of root depth and the effect of different root depth on the pore flow field is the same we have focused only on the effects of the density of rigid non submerged plants on the transport of solutes in the hyporheic zone 2 3 metrics 2 3 1 nacl concentrations in the overlying water changes of solute concentrations in the overlying water were measured in experiments and a uniform spatial concentration was assumed along the flume because of the thorough mixing in model calibration the variation of solute concentrations in the overlying water was determined based on the mass balance of solutes between recirculating stream and pore water in the streambed the variation of ct with time due to solute exchange between overlying water and streambed is expressed as follows according to previous study jin et al 2010 1 c t c 0 v 0 v Î¸ c x y z t d v v 0 where c 0 kg m 3 is the initial solute concentration in the overlying water v 0 m3 is the total water volume in the flume system excluding v p pore water in the streambed c x y z t is the simulated nacl concentration in the pore water at location x y z and time t and v m3 is the volume of streambed this is used to define the boundary condition at the bed surface for simulations of the experiment in the further simulations with variable plant densities a fixed concentration in the overlying water is used the dimensionless concentration is defined as follows 2 c c c 0 2 3 2 effective exchange depth effective transport volume and net transport quantity in the streambed the effective exchange depth effective transport volume and net transport quantity were also quantified to characterize hyporheic exchange under different conditions of plant densities the dimensionless transport volume is an important parameter describing the influence area of hyporheic exchange defined as the ratio of solute transport volume to the streambed volume 3 v v v s where v s m3 is the volume of streambed the effective exchange depth represents an average penetration of solutes in the streambed and is also used to quantify hyporheic exchange according to the mass conservation law the following relation can be obtained 4 c 1 Î¸ s s h e v 0 5 h e h e d s where Î¸ is the bulk porosity of streambed ss m2 is the horizontal surface area of streambed fig 2 c he m is the effective exchange depth h e is the dimensionless effective exchange depth defined as the ratio of the effective exchange depth he to the depth of sediment bed ds in order to further quantify the total amount of solutes transferred from overlying water to streambed with hyporheic exchange the ratio of solute mass entering the streambed to the total solute mass in the overlying water is defined as the net transport quantity 6 m m c 0 q t d t where q t m3 s 1 is the overlying water flow and m is the solute mass entering the streambed in order to clarify the pore water flow field in the presence of a plant and the transport of solutes in the streambed the pore water flow pattern and pressure distribution at the swi are determined the pore water velocity u is normalized into 7 u ln u ln u min ln u max ln u min where u max and u min are the minimum and maximum simulated velocity in pore water respectively the pressure p at swi is normalized into cardenas and wilson 2007a 8 p p p min p max p min where p max and p min are the minimum and maximum simulated pressure respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation the simulation model is validated by comparing experimental and simulated solute concentrations in the overlying water and pore water and the transport processes of solutes both experimental and simulated solute concentrations in the overlying water decrease over time are shown and both have similar decline rate and trend fig 3 we used r2 to verify the goodness fit of the results between experiment and simulation and the correlation index r2 is 0 99 indicating the simulated results matches well with experimental results as mentioned one vertical arrays of sampling ports were installed to monitor the variation of solute concentration in the pore water it is shown that solutes can penetrate deep into the streambed over time and there is a good agreement between simulated and experimental solute concentrations in the pore water and their transport processes figs 4 5 hyporheic exchange occurs in the streambed near a plant fig 5 the solute plume first appears in the upstream and downstream of the plant and then develops into a single plume over time in the streamwise direction in the first 2 h of hyporheic exchange solutes transport steadily with a very stable plume front but the plume area gradually increases the depth of the solute plume front in spanwise profile decreases from the central section of the plant to both sides and increases over time the irregular drift of solute plume may be attributed to the large circulation and the slope of the flume in the experiment our results are also very consistent with those reported in previous studies salehin et al 2004 jin et al 2010 packman et al 2006 moreto et al 2022 overall there is a good agreement between simulated and experimental results indicating that the model can be used to explore the effects of plant density and root depth on the transport of solutes 3 2 hyporheic exchange induced by plant the vertical velocity distribution of streamwise direction and spanwise direction pressure distribution at the swi and solute particle tracing around the circular cylinder under the case of sx 15 cm and sy 5 cm is taken as an example to clarify the pore water flow field in the presence of plant and the transport characteristics of solutes in the streambed the central section of a given plant and the middle sections of adjacent plants are taken as representative sections of streamwise direction due to the symmetry of the numerical model in the spanwise direction sections are taken from 0 01 cm to 0 29 cm at 7 cm intervals the flow in the shallow area is affected by the existence of plants fig 6 the overlying water flow velocity before the plant is reduced sharply due to obstruction of the plant but increased as the flow passes through the plant due to the reduction of the cross sectional area forming a backflow zone behind the plant where the velocity reaches a minimum according to the pore water velocity distribution the flow velocity around the plant is noticeably higher than that in other areas and the velocity in the central section of the plant is lower than that between adjacent plants fig 6 the flow velocity decreases with bed depth and a low velocity zone appears at the intersection of the circulation and ambient flow induced by slope for pressure distribution a high pressure area is formed before the plant and the maximum pressure appears at the axis of the upstream face of the plant fig 7 the pressure is lower on the flank and back of the plant and perpendicular to the direction of water flow forming a low pressure area across adjacent plants the high pressure before the plant and the low pressure behind the plant result in pressure differences along the flow direction and the transverse direction between plants the result of modeled pressure pattern is similar to previous study moreto et al 2022 the pore water flow field induces convective exchange between overlying water and pore water as a result two circulation flows are formed between adjacent plants one is from the front to the back of the plant while the other one is smaller and from the front of the plant to the back of the plant in the front row thus solutes are driven to transport to the pore water of the streambed and then back to the overlying water the solute transport process during a 72 hour period in this study was observed using particle tracing fig 7 note that because of periodicity and symmetry only half of the streamwise and spanwise distance around the central plant and one side of the vertical flow direction are taken to analyze the transport of solutes the tracer particle delivery range is from x 0 075 m to 0 225 m with an increment of 0 005 m or from x 0 13 m to 0 16 m and from y 0 03 m to 0 06 m with an increment of 0 003 m respectively combined with pressure and vertical velocity distribution different circulation processes of solute tracing are observed in high pressure and low pressure areas around the plant broadly there are three circulation processes for solutes in the high pressure area before the plant a solutes close to the front of the plant transport to the root due to the pressure difference between the front and back of the plant while the solute farther away transport around the root to the back of the plant b solutes on both sides of the front of the plant flow around the plant and transport to the rear end of the plant due to the pressure difference between two adjacent plants and c solutes far away from the front of the plant transport to the low pressure area and later leave the streambed few solutes enter the streambed from the low pressure area and the solutes far away from the low pressure area transport to the back of the plant in the reverse flow direction and leave the streambed after a period of time it is concluded that the flow pattern changes substantially in the presence of a plant and the resulting pressure difference drives the transport of solutes into the streambed from the front of the plant and then out of the streambed at the back of the plant forming a small circulation flow around the plant 3 3 comparison of hyporheic exchange induced by different plant densities increasing the streamwise distance can change the pore water flow field and subsequently the transport process of solutes fig 8 the plume shapes are approximately the same at different streamwise distances due to the circulation induced by a plant a semi crescent shaped plume develops and as time passes both its volume and depth grow in the case of no ambient flow increasing the streamwise distance leads to wider and deeper areas of effects on high pressure zone as a result hyporheic exchange area grows broader and deeper enabling solutes to penetrate deeper into the streambed the disparity in the solute transport characteristic becomes more pronounced with passing time whether the plant is set up in a staggered or parallel arrangement the effect of streamwise distance on hyporheic exchange is similar yuan et al 2021 there also exist differences in the pore water flow field and solute transport process at various spanwise distances without the effect of ambient flow fig 9 the spanwise distance and streamwise distance have opposite effects on hyporheic exchange when the plant is parallel arranged in the case of small spanwise distances the high pressure regions before adjacent plants will merge into a larger area resulting in the formation of a larger hyporheic exchange area and the transport of solutes into deeper portions of the streambed with pore water flow however as the spanwise distance increases its impact on hyporheic exchange becomes less pronounced when the high pressure areas before adjacent plants no longer interact with each other it is concluded that the streamwise distance and the spanwise distance have opposite effects on the pore flow field therefore in the section that follow parametric analysis is used to quantify the influence of plant spacing on hyporheic exchange 3 4 variation of nacl concentrations in the overlying water and streambed the decline of nacl concentration in the overlying water indicates the mass transfer of nacl to the pore water it is found that the simulated nacl concentration in the overlying water varies greatly at different streamwise and spanwise distances which is attributed to the influence of plant density on the solute influx to the bed in the overlying water the nacl concentration drops rapidly in the first 3 h but more slowly in the later period of time under different plant densities fig 10 this decreasing tendency resembles hyporheic exchange brought on by sand waves jin et al 2010 zaramella et al 2003 however the decreasing trend of nacl concentration in the overlying water differs substantially depending on the plant density in the downstream flow direction a larger streamwise distance leads to a larger influx downward and a faster transport rate of solutes into the streambed the smaller the streamwise distance is the smaller the decreasing rate of nacl concentration in the overlying water in the later period of time will be fig 10 a in the spanwise direction the spanwise distances has the opposite effect and has a more pronounced effect on the decrease of nacl concentration in the overlying water in the early stage fig 10 b with the increase of both streamwise and spanwise distances the influence on hyporheic exchange gradually decreases these results indicate that the plants densely in streamwise direction can prevent solutes from entering deeper into the streambed and promotes the intensity of hyporheic exchange while the distance of plants in spanwise direction has the opposite effect the numerical simulation results with adjusted streamwise and spanwise distances are also compared in this study the depth profiles of solute concentrations at different times and plant densities are displayed fig 11 it is seen that the solute front propagates downward at different plant densities and the concentration increases slightly with the depth until a maximum is reached near the solute front after which it decreases rapidly to zero this is consistent with previous studies cardenas and wilson 2007b jin et al 2010 in the first 1 h the downward transport pattern is roughly the same at different plant densities the concentration in the shallow pore water increases rapidly and it takes only about 1 h for the solute front to reach the 4 cm depth in the streambed with the increase of depth the concentration in the pore water increases at a decreasing rate because of the increase of advection with increasing depth the difference in the depth of solute front at different streamwise or spanwise distances becomes more pronounced over time the solutes penetrate deeper into the streambed at larger streamwise distances but slowly and shallowly at a streamwise distance of 3 cm compared with other cases in addition solutes can also penetrate deeper into the streambed at smaller spanwise distances it is found that the transport of solutes to the bottom of the streambed is inhibited at smaller streamwise distances but promoted at smaller spanwise distances the convective exchange caused by a plant can be affected by the root depth in the riverbed where the root depth is 5 cm in this study and the influence on convection increases with decreasing streamwise distance but with increasing spanwise distance the transport of solutes at deeper depth is mainly influenced by diffusion which increases with decreasing streamwise distance but with increasing spanwise distance the largest depth of solute in the riverbed for sx 20 cm is 2 4 times that of sx 3 cm while which for sy 3 cm is 1 4 times that of sy 15 cm at time 36 h comparison of the variation of nacl concentrations in the pore water along the depth of streambed at different times under different streamwise and spanwise distances reveals that streamwise distance has a greater impact on solute transport in the streambed than spanwise distance indicating that streamwise distance plays a greater role in pressure gradient than spanwise distance fig 11 the reason why the simulated lines t 8 16 24 36 h sx 10 15 20 cm sy 10 cm are not smooth is that the mesh of the pore water model with depths higher than 7 cm is not fine enough to improve the computational efficiency but it does not affect the correlation analysis between solute transport in the pore water and plant distance it is concluded that plant density has an effect on the pressure gradient at the swi and subsequently the convective exchange and a high plant density will lead to high convective exchange and slow diffusion the existence of plants hinders the transport of solutes into the deeper part of the streambed 3 5 the effects of plant density on the effective exchange depth net transport quantity and effective transport volume in order to further quantify the effects of plant density on the solute transport process the dimensionless effective exchange depth section 2 3 2 of solutes is calculated from the simulation results with different streamwise and spanwise distances fig 12 he the penetration of solutes into the streambed can be divided into three stages fig 13 in the first stage t 2 h the solute enters into the riverbed at a rapid rate and the change rate of he decreases sharply in the second stage 2 h t 7 h the change rate of he decreases gradually with time and it also decreases with the decrease of streamwise distance but with the increase of spanwise distance in the last stage t 7 h the change rate of he decreases linearly with a low rate and approaches zero finally the effect of plant density is noticeable for example the solute penetration for sx 20 cm is 4 3 times that of sx 3 cm while the solute penetration for sy 3 cm is 5 05 times that of sy 15 cm at t 28 h as the distance between the two directions increases it has a more significant influence on the effective exchange depth unlike the effective exchange depth the variation of dimensionless transport quantity section 2 3 2 fig 12 m can be divided into three stages it increases rapidly to m max in a short period of time after which it decreases at a larger rate in the second stage but at a smaller rate in the third stage which is attributed to the rapid hyporheic exchange rate in the second stage the maximum net transport quantity is related to the streamwise distance and the largest one that appears at sx 10 cm is 1 8 times that of the smallest one that appears at sx 3 cm this indicates that when sx 10 cm the maximum net transport increases with sx whereas when sx exceeds 10 cm the net transport decreases with the increase of sx at t 28 h the final net transport quantity is positively correlated with sx as for spanwise distance the maximum net transport quantity is negatively correlated with sy and the largest one that appears at sy 3 cm is 5 7 times that of the smallest one that appears at sy 15 cm at t 28 h spanwise distance has only a minor influence on the final net transport quantity the variation of dimensionless transport volume section 2 3 2 can also be divided into two stages fig 14 similar to the effective exchange depth the change rate of v decreases with the decrease of streamwise distance but with the increase of spanwise distance the effective transport volume at sx 20 cm is 4 2 times that of sx 3 cm while the solute penetration at sy 3 cm is 1 4 times that of sy 15 cm at t 28 h the maximum effective transport volume increases linearly in the third stage there is a linear relationship between the effective transport volume at t 27 h when the transport volume increases linearly and the change rate of volume approaches zero and streamwise distance sx r2 0 9952 and spanwise distance sy r2 0 93 and it is positively correlated with sx but negatively correlated with sy the maximum effective transport volume can be further predicted by sx and sy through the linear equation fig 15 4 conclusions in this study laboratory experiment and numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of rigid non submerged plants on the solute transport characteristics in ths streambed the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 rigid non submerged plants have an effect on solute transport in the streambed through small circulation induced by plants the presence of aquatic plant can change the flow pattern producing a high pressure area in front of the plants and a low pressure area on the side and back of the plants at the swi this pressure difference forms circulation flows between adjacent plants and induces convective exchange between the overlying water and the shallow pore water that drive solutes transport in the streambed forming a crescent shaped plume 2 there are three circulation processes for solutes in front of the plant a solutes close to the front of the plant transport to the root due to the pressure difference between the front and back of the plant while the solutes slightly farther away transport around the roots to the back of the plant b solutes on both sides of the front of the plant transport around the sides of the plant to the back of the plant due to the pressure difference between two adjacent plants and c solutes far away from the front of the plant transport to the low pressure area at swi and later leave the streambed 3 there are differences in the hyporheic exchange depth solute transport quantity and volume at different plant densities a smaller streamwise distance of plants arrangement leads to the formation of a smaller hyporheic zone and subsequently less transport depth volume and quantity of solute in the streambed however the plant arrangement distance along spanwise direction have the opposite effect on the hyporheic exchange this study provides important insights into the mechanism of hyporheic exchange in the presence of aquatic plants and the use of aquatic plants for ecological restoration the presence of aquatic plants allows the pollutants around the plants to penetrate into the riverbed and thus promotes material circulation in the hyporheic zone however this also implies that aquatic plants are susceptible to the impact of water pollution and their growth will be affected plants densely in the streamwise direction and sparsely in the spanwise direction can effectively prevent pollutants from transport deeper into the river bed and the resulted convective exchange also accelerates the circulation process of pollutant in the riverbed the findings have implications for the use of aquatic plants for ecological restoration although the focus here was on effects of rigid non submerged plants on solute transport in the streambed submerged plants also influence the flow field and solute transport in the overlying water columns plants are always flexible and exist in the form of plant clusters in nature and there are biochemical reactions between plants and solutes therefore further investigations should be carried out to examine relevant factors which have significant effects on the hyporheic exchange and solute transport credit authorship contribution statement guangqiu jin conceptualization formal analysis funding acquisition supervision

2160,the presence of aquatic plants in natural and artificial rivers can cause substantial changes in the flow pattern in this study laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to explore the influences of rigid non submerged plant densities on the transport of solutes in the hyporheic zone the laboratory experiments and numerical modelling results show that solute enters into the streambed around plant and solute in the overlying water experienced a sharp decrease at the beginning followed by a gradual decline phase the concentration in the shallow pore water increases rapidly and increases at a decreasing rate with the increase of depth the presence of a plant causes pressure gradients at the sediment water interface before and after the plant specifically the presence of plants induces the convection exchange of surface water and pore water enables the solute to transport in the streambed through three circulation flows solute tends to transport to the root of the plant or bypass the plant and return to the overlying water over time the rate and quantity of solute transport in the streambed are related to the streamwise and spanwise distances of the plant when the plant densities reach the distance that affect the flow structures near each other smaller streamwise distances lead to the transport of fewer solutes into the streambed and prevent them from penetrating to the deeper part of the streambed while larger spanwise distances have the same effect on solute transport in the streambed the solute effective exchange depth for streamwise distance of 20 cm is 4 3 times that of 3 cm while which for spanwise distance of 3 cm is 5 05 times that of 15 cm at time of 28 h this study shows that the presence of aquatic plants leads to the circulation of solutes in the hyporheic zone which promotes the transport of pollutants from overlying water to streambed through hyporheic exchange after the occurrence of a water pollution event further plants densely in the streamwise direction and sparsely in the spanwise direction will reduce the range of pollutants transport in the streambed this study is of great significance for water

1998 knight et al 2000 ren et al 2013 however the presence of aquatic plants may have an impact on the flow pattern and subsequently the hydraulic characteristics of the river aquatic plants can not

affect sediment movement and the vertical diffusion of pollutants in the overlying water chang and constantinescu 2015 darby and stephen 1999 lv et al 2022 nepf 1999 yang and nepf 2019 the hydrodynamic changes due to flow plant interactions may produce pressure gradients at the sediment water interface swi and induce convection between overlying water and pore water which in turn can change the transport of pollutants between two water bodies bottacin busolin and marion 2010 harvey and bencala 1993 hester and doyle 2008 moreto el al 2022 there is increasing evidence that aquatic plants have an impact on the hydrodynamics and mitigation of pollutants in the overlying water liu et al 2008 ren et al 2020 shahmohammadi et al 2018 waters et al 2016 zhao and huai 2016 li and shen 1973 found that flow velocity was reduced to varying degrees in the presence of non submerged aquatic plants depending on their density and arrangement wu et al 1999 proposed a method to estimate the resistance coefficient of non submerged and submerged plants under uniform flow conditions nepf et al 1999 established a passive scalar diffusion model to describe the drag turbulence and diffusion of flow through non submerged plants hosoi et al 1998 compared the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen in wetlands with and without reeds and concluded that regular planting and harvesting were effective in removing excess nutrients from water bodies yuan et al 2021 established a model to simulate the hyporheic exchange driven by submerged rigid vegetation however it should be noted that the transport process of solutes in the streambed as a result of flow plant interactions is not considered in most previous studies and thus little is known about the effects of aquatic plants on the transport of solutes in the hyporheic zone therefore it is necessary to better understand the mechanism of how aquatic plants affect solutes transport process in the streambed to this end a set of experiments and numerical simulations are conducted in this study in order to clarify the transport process and destination of solutes in the streambed as they flow through aquatic plant by numerical modeling of flow pattern of pore water and quantifying the hyporheic exchange depth solutes transport depth quantity and concentration in the overlying water and pore water specifically we have focused on i the effect of single plant and different plant densities on flow pattern of pore water ii the solutes transport characteristics in the streambed due to rigid non submerged plants and iii the influences of various plant densities on the transport of solutes in the streambed the results of this study may provide important insights into the characteristics of solute transport in the streambed in the presence of aquatic plants and the use of aquatic plants for ecological restoration 2 methods 2 1 laboratory experiments laboratory experiments were performed in a recirculating flume system fig 1 a consisting of a rectangular channel of 11 5 m long 30 cm wide and 50 cm deep as described in previous studies jin et al 2018 jin et al 2022 the walls on both sides of the flume were made of pmma for the sake of observation and photography of the hyporheic exchange process in the streambed artificial sand was used in this study where the bulk porosity Î¸ was measured to be 0 46 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k was measured using a column subjected to a constant head drop chinese national standard 1999 with value of 3 87 10 3 ms 1 and it was thoroughly washed three times with deionized water before each experiment the sediment bed was 5 m long and 20 cm thick the rest of flume is placed with waterproof glass blocks that have the same thickness as the sediment bed to examine the transport of solutes along the streambed one vertical array of sampling holes was set near plant stem on the side of the flume to collect pore water from the streambed a total of 20 sampling holes were arranged from top to bottom and they were spaced 1 cm apart nacl was used as the pollutant and fd c red 40 was used as the tracer and dyestuff to indicate the transport process of nacl in the streambed during the experiment the nacl concentrations at each sampling port were monitored and photos were compared to verify the transport process of solutes in the streambed non submerged and submerged plants both have significant effect on hyporheic exchange in this study we only investigated the effect of rigid non submerged plants on solute transport characteristics in the flat streambed which were simulated using cylindrical aluminum rods with a height of 20 cm and a diameter of 0 6 cm as suggested in previous studies alkis and werth 2004 hsieh 1964 li and shen 1973 wu et al 1999 first several rods were inserted into pvc cuboid strips with drilling holes to form a group of plants fig 1 b each pvc cuboid strip was 29 9 cm length slightly shorter than the width of the tank 1 cm width 1 cm height and all holes had a diameter of 0 6 cm and were spaced 1 cm apart two horizontal tracks were installed at an appropriate height on both inner sides of the recirculating tank and they were parallel to each other each set of plant was placed in the streambed from top to bottom straddled on the track in parallel and unstaggered fig 1 c plants were attached first and then sand was added to prevent the formation of sandpit brought on by the insertion of plants into the streambed and to safeguard the sand layer from damage in order to avoid surface fluctuation and sediment initiation the flow velocity and froude number fr are required to be sufficiently small in this study the distance between two plants in the direction parallel to the flow of water is defined as the streamwise distance sx whereas the distance between two plants in the direction perpendicular the flow of water is defined as the spanwise distance sy fig 2 c the experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 which take into account the distribution of non submerged plants in shallow water flume size and previous experimental conditions 2 2 numerical simulations the sequential coupling method proposed by cardenas and colleagues cardenas and wilson 2007a cardenas and wilson 2007b cardenos 2012 elliott and brooks 1997 packman et al 2000 sawyer et al 2011 was used to simulate the stream water flow in the plant domain pore water flow through the streambed and solute transport in the streambed the stream water was computed using the 3d computational fluid dynamics package fluent based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations together with the k Ï turbulence closure scheme jin et al 2010 which has been widely used to calculate flows around a circular cylinder boothroyd et al 2016 dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 zhang 2017 the predicted pressures at the swi were used as the boundary conditions in a 3d comsol based model for simulation of pore water flow and nonreactive solute transport in the streambed detailed descriptions of sequential coupling method can be found in chen et al 2015 in order to improve the calculation efficiency two unit intervals in both spanwise and streamwise directions and half plant stem before and after each side were selected as a representative domain fig 2 c in the downstream flow direction a periodic boundary condition with a pressure drop dp was applied to the upstream and downstream boundaries to drive the flow a symmetry boundary condition was applied to side walls in the spanwise direction in all model runs the vertical water depth h 0 1 m was selected as the simulated height and the froude number fr was 0 11 we assumed the water surface elevation is fixed when the froude number is smaller than 0 2 lee et al 2021 therefore the top face was treated as a frictionless rigid lid and a symmetry boundary condition was applied in numerical simulation a no slip wall boundary condition was applied to the plant stem surface and channel bottom fig 2 a the pore water flow was modeled using darcy s law and the continuity equation for incompressible flow in a non deformable medium based on boundary conditions described by jin et al 2010 symmetry boundary conditions were applied to the side walls of the pore water domain periodic boundary conditions were applied to both upstream and downstream boundaries with the same pressure drop used in the stream water flow domain a no flow boundary condition was applied to the bottom of the pore water flow domain and plant stem surface the depth of the pore water domain was the same as that in the experiment to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the model fig 2 a finally the transport of nonreactive solutes was simulated based on the pore water flow field a no flux boundary condition was applied to the bottom and plant stem surface of the pore water flow domain giving a zero concentration gradient barry and sposito 1988 parlange et al 1992 when the side walls of the pore water domain were treated as symmetry boundary on the upstream and downstream boundaries of the domain periodic conditions were imposed for both the concentration c 0 y z t c l y z t where l is the length of two unit intervals in the downstream flow direction a flux boundary condition was applied along the sediment water interface the boundary condition was set as n u 0 c n 0 n u 0 c c t where n is the unit vector normal to the interface pointing inward u is the pore water flow velocity vector and c t is the concentration of solute in the overlying water fig 2 b as this study only considered the solute transport characteristics in the hyporheic zone due to different densities of rigid non submerged plants and did not take into account the effect of the density gradients associated with the solute concentration buoyancy effect was neglected in the simulation model a structured hexahedral mesh was used in this study to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy the mesh surrounding the plant was carefully designed to have a smooth transition from a fine spacing of 0 05 mm to a coarser spacing with a size growth ratio of 1 1 the grid spacing near the bottom wall was less than 0 3 mm to maintain and resolve a viscous sublayer a boundary layer mesh was constructed near the bottom wall with a size ratio of 1 1 in order to obtain a high density of nodes the number of elements ranged from about 3 000 000 to 5 000 000 with different plant densities a tetrahedral mesh was generated for the pore water flow domain with refinement near the swi and plant stem surface using comsol multiphysics the element number of the pore water flow domain varied from 800 000 to 1 000 000 the simulation parameters are shown in table 1 in order to validate numerical model the plant density was the same as the experiment and was set as the streamwise distance of 15 cm and the spanwise distance of 5 cm furthermore the study of numerical model was extended and two plant densities were considered including a a fixed spacing of 5 cm for the spanwise distance and a variable spacing of 3 5 10 15 and 20 cm for the streamwise distance and b a fixed spacing of 10 cm for the streamwise distance and a variable spacing of 3 5 7 10 and 15 cm for the spanwise distance as the experimental and simulated results are similar under different conditions of root depth and the effect of different root depth on the pore flow field is the same we have focused only on the effects of the density of rigid non submerged plants on the transport of solutes in the hyporheic zone 2 3 metrics 2 3 1 nacl concentrations in the overlying water changes of solute concentrations in the overlying water were measured in experiments and a uniform spatial concentration was assumed along the flume because of the thorough mixing in model calibration the variation of solute concentrations in the overlying water was determined based on the mass balance of solutes between recirculating stream and pore water in the streambed the variation of ct with time due to solute exchange between overlying water and streambed is expressed as follows according to previous study jin et al 2010 1 c t c 0 v 0 v Î¸ c x y z t d v v 0 where c 0 kg m 3 is the initial solute concentration in the overlying water v 0 m3 is the total water volume in the flume system excluding v p pore water in the streambed c x y z t is the simulated nacl concentration in the pore water at location x y z and time t and v m3 is the volume of streambed this is used to define the boundary condition at the bed surface for simulations of the experiment in the further simulations with variable plant densities a fixed concentration in the overlying water is used the dimensionless concentration is defined as follows 2 c c c 0 2 3 2 effective exchange depth effective transport volume and net transport quantity in the streambed the effective exchange depth effective transport volume and net transport quantity were also quantified to characterize hyporheic exchange under different conditions of plant densities the dimensionless transport volume is an important parameter describing the influence area of hyporheic exchange defined as the ratio of solute transport volume to the streambed volume 3 v v v s where v s m3 is the volume of streambed the effective exchange depth represents an average penetration of solutes in the streambed and is also used to quantify hyporheic exchange according to the mass conservation law the following relation can be obtained 4 c 1 Î¸ s s h e v 0 5 h e h e d s where Î¸ is the bulk porosity of streambed ss m2 is the horizontal surface area of streambed fig 2 c he m is the effective exchange depth h e is the dimensionless effective exchange depth defined as the ratio of the effective exchange depth he to the depth of sediment bed ds in order to further quantify the total amount of solutes transferred from overlying water to streambed with hyporheic exchange the ratio of solute mass entering the streambed to the total solute mass in the overlying water is defined as the net transport quantity 6 m m c 0 q t d t where q t m3 s 1 is the overlying water flow and m is the solute mass entering the streambed in order to clarify the pore water flow field in the presence of a plant and the transport of solutes in the streambed the pore water flow pattern and pressure distribution at the swi are determined the pore water velocity u is normalized into 7 u ln u ln u min ln u max ln u min where u max and u min are the minimum and maximum simulated velocity in pore water respectively the pressure p at swi is normalized into cardenas and wilson 2007a 8 p p p min p max p min where p max and p min are the minimum and maximum simulated pressure respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation the simulation model is validated by comparing experimental and simulated solute concentrations in the overlying water and pore water and the transport processes of solutes both experimental and simulated solute concentrations in the overlying water decrease over time are shown and both have similar decline rate and trend fig 3 we used r2 to verify the goodness fit of the results between experiment and simulation and the correlation index r2 is 0 99 indicating the simulated results matches well with experimental results as mentioned one vertical arrays of sampling ports were installed to monitor the variation of solute concentration in the pore water it is shown that solutes can penetrate deep into the streambed over time and there is a good agreement between simulated and experimental solute concentrations in the pore water and their transport processes figs 4 5 hyporheic exchange occurs in the streambed near a plant fig 5 the solute plume first appears in the upstream and downstream of the plant and then develops into a single plume over time in the streamwise direction in the first 2 h of hyporheic exchange solutes transport steadily with a very stable plume front but the plume area gradually increases the depth of the solute plume front in spanwise profile decreases from the central section of the plant to both sides and increases over time the irregular drift of solute plume may be attributed to the large circulation and the slope of the flume in the experiment our results are also very consistent with those reported in previous studies salehin et al 2004 jin et al 2010 packman et al 2006 moreto et al 2022 overall there is a good agreement between simulated and experimental results indicating that the model can be used to explore the effects of plant density and root depth on the transport of solutes 3 2 hyporheic exchange induced by plant the vertical velocity distribution of streamwise direction and spanwise direction pressure distribution at the swi and solute particle tracing around the circular cylinder under the case of sx 15 cm and sy 5 cm is taken as an example to clarify the pore water flow field in the presence of plant and the transport characteristics of solutes in the streambed the central section of a given plant and the middle sections of adjacent plants are taken as representative sections of streamwise direction due to the symmetry of the numerical model in the spanwise direction sections are taken from 0 01 cm to 0 29 cm at 7 cm intervals the flow in the shallow area is affected by the existence of plants fig 6 the overlying water flow velocity before the plant is reduced sharply due to obstruction of the plant but increased as the flow passes through the plant due to the reduction of the cross sectional area forming a backflow zone behind the plant where the velocity reaches a minimum according to the pore water velocity distribution the flow velocity around the plant is noticeably higher than that in other areas and the velocity in the central section of the plant is lower than that between adjacent plants fig 6 the flow velocity decreases with bed depth and a low velocity zone appears at the intersection of the circulation and ambient flow induced by slope for pressure distribution a high pressure area is formed before the plant and the maximum pressure appears at the axis of the upstream face of the plant fig 7 the pressure is lower on the flank and back of the plant and perpendicular to the direction of water flow forming a low pressure area across adjacent plants the high pressure before the plant and the low pressure behind the plant result in pressure differences along the flow direction and the transverse direction between plants the result of modeled pressure pattern is similar to previous study moreto et al 2022 the pore water flow field induces convective exchange between overlying water and pore water as a result two circulation flows are formed between adjacent plants one is from the front to the back of the plant while the other one is smaller and from the front of the plant to the back of the plant in the front row thus solutes are driven to transport to the pore water of the streambed and then back to the overlying water the solute transport process during a 72 hour period in this study was observed using particle tracing fig 7 note that because of periodicity and symmetry only half of the streamwise and spanwise distance around the central plant and one side of the vertical flow direction are taken to analyze the transport of solutes the tracer particle delivery range is from x 0 075 m to 0 225 m with an increment of 0 005 m or from x 0 13 m to 0 16 m and from y 0 03 m to 0 06 m with an increment of 0 003 m respectively combined with pressure and vertical velocity distribution different circulation processes of solute tracing are observed in high pressure and low pressure areas around the plant broadly there are three circulation processes for solutes in the high pressure area before the plant a solutes close to the front of the plant transport to the root due to the pressure difference between the front and back of the plant while the solute farther away transport around the root to the back of the plant b solutes on both sides of the front of the plant flow around the plant and transport to the rear end of the plant due to the pressure difference between two adjacent plants and c solutes far away from the front of the plant transport to the low pressure area and later leave the streambed few solutes enter the streambed from the low pressure area and the solutes far away from the low pressure area transport to the back of the plant in the reverse flow direction and leave the streambed after a period of time it is concluded that the flow pattern changes substantially in the presence of a plant and the resulting pressure difference drives the transport of solutes into the streambed from the front of the plant and then out of the streambed at the back of the plant forming a small circulation flow around the plant 3 3 comparison of hyporheic exchange induced by different plant densities increasing the streamwise distance can change the pore water flow field and subsequently the transport process of solutes fig 8 the plume shapes are approximately the same at different streamwise distances due to the circulation induced by a plant a semi crescent shaped plume develops and as time passes both its volume and depth grow in the case of no ambient flow increasing the streamwise distance leads to wider and deeper areas of effects on high pressure zone as a result hyporheic exchange area grows broader and deeper enabling solutes to penetrate deeper into the streambed the disparity in the solute transport characteristic becomes more pronounced with passing time whether the plant is set up in a staggered or parallel arrangement the effect of streamwise distance on hyporheic exchange is similar yuan et al 2021 there also exist differences in the pore water flow field and solute transport process at various spanwise distances without the effect of ambient flow fig 9 the spanwise distance and streamwise distance have opposite effects on hyporheic exchange when the plant is parallel arranged in the case of small spanwise distances the high pressure regions before adjacent plants will merge into a larger area resulting in the formation of a larger hyporheic exchange area and the transport of solutes into deeper portions of the streambed with pore water flow however as the spanwise distance increases its impact on hyporheic exchange becomes less pronounced when the high pressure areas before adjacent plants no longer interact with each other it is concluded that the streamwise distance and the spanwise distance have opposite effects on the pore flow field therefore in the section that follow parametric analysis is used to quantify the influence of plant spacing on hyporheic exchange 3 4 variation of nacl concentrations in the overlying water and streambed the decline of nacl concentration in the overlying water indicates the mass transfer of nacl to the pore water it is found that the simulated nacl concentration in the overlying water varies greatly at different streamwise and spanwise distances which is attributed to the influence of plant density on the solute influx to the bed in the overlying water the nacl concentration drops rapidly in the first 3 h but more slowly in the later period of time under different plant densities fig 10 this decreasing tendency resembles hyporheic exchange brought on by sand waves jin et al 2010 zaramella et al 2003 however the decreasing trend of nacl concentration in the overlying water differs substantially depending on the plant density in the downstream flow direction a larger streamwise distance leads to a larger influx downward and a faster transport rate of solutes into the streambed the smaller the streamwise distance is the smaller the decreasing rate of nacl concentration in the overlying water in the later period of time will be fig 10 a in the spanwise direction the spanwise distances has the opposite effect and has a more pronounced effect on the decrease of nacl concentration in the overlying water in the early stage fig 10 b with the increase of both streamwise and spanwise distances the influence on hyporheic exchange gradually decreases these results indicate that the plants densely in streamwise direction can prevent solutes from entering deeper into the streambed and promotes the intensity of hyporheic exchange while the distance of plants in spanwise direction has the opposite effect the numerical simulation results with adjusted streamwise and spanwise distances are also compared in this study the depth profiles of solute concentrations at different times and plant densities are displayed fig 11 it is seen that the solute front propagates downward at different plant densities and the concentration increases slightly with the depth until a maximum is reached near the solute front after which it decreases rapidly to zero this is consistent with previous studies cardenas and wilson 2007b jin et al 2010 in the first 1 h the downward transport pattern is roughly the same at different plant densities the concentration in the shallow pore water increases rapidly and it takes only about 1 h for the solute front to reach the 4 cm depth in the streambed with the increase of depth the concentration in the pore water increases at a decreasing rate because of the increase of advection with increasing depth the difference in the depth of solute front at different streamwise or spanwise distances becomes more pronounced over time the solutes penetrate deeper into the streambed at larger streamwise distances but slowly and shallowly at a streamwise distance of 3 cm compared with other cases in addition solutes can also penetrate deeper into the streambed at smaller spanwise distances it is found that the transport of solutes to the bottom of the streambed is inhibited at smaller streamwise distances but promoted at smaller spanwise distances the convective exchange caused by a plant can be affected by the root depth in the riverbed where the root depth is 5 cm in this study and the influence on convection increases with decreasing streamwise distance but with increasing spanwise distance the transport of solutes at deeper depth is mainly influenced by diffusion which increases with decreasing streamwise distance but with increasing spanwise distance the largest depth of solute in the riverbed for sx 20 cm is 2 4 times that of sx 3 cm while which for sy 3 cm is 1 4 times that of sy 15 cm at time 36 h comparison of the variation of nacl concentrations in the pore water along the depth of streambed at different times under different streamwise and spanwise distances reveals that streamwise distance has a greater impact on solute transport in the streambed than spanwise distance indicating that streamwise distance plays a greater role in pressure gradient than spanwise distance fig 11 the reason why the simulated lines t 8 16 24 36 h sx 10 15 20 cm sy 10 cm are not smooth is that the mesh of the pore water model with depths higher than 7 cm is not fine enough to improve the computational efficiency but it does not affect the correlation analysis between solute transport in the pore water and plant distance it is concluded that plant density has an effect on the pressure gradient at the swi and subsequently the convective exchange and a high plant density will lead to high convective exchange and slow diffusion the existence of plants hinders the transport of solutes into the deeper part of the streambed 3 5 the effects of plant density on the effective exchange depth net transport quantity and effective transport volume in order to further quantify the effects of plant density on the solute transport process the dimensionless effective exchange depth section 2 3 2 of solutes is calculated from the simulation results with different streamwise and spanwise distances fig 12 he the penetration of solutes into the streambed can be divided into three stages fig 13 in the first stage t 2 h the solute enters into the riverbed at a rapid rate and the change rate of he decreases sharply in the second stage 2 h t 7 h the change rate of he decreases gradually with time and it also decreases with the decrease of streamwise distance but with the increase of spanwise distance in the last stage t 7 h the change rate of he decreases linearly with a low rate and approaches zero finally the effect of plant density is noticeable for example the solute penetration for sx 20 cm is 4 3 times that of sx 3 cm while the solute penetration for sy 3 cm is 5 05 times that of sy 15 cm at t 28 h as the distance between the two directions increases it has a more significant influence on the effective exchange depth unlike the effective exchange depth the variation of dimensionless transport quantity section 2 3 2 fig 12 m can be divided into three stages it increases rapidly to m max in a short period of time after which it decreases at a larger rate in the second stage but at a smaller rate in the third stage which is attributed to the rapid hyporheic exchange rate in the second stage the maximum net transport quantity is related to the streamwise distance and the largest one that appears at sx 10 cm is 1 8 times that of the smallest one that appears at sx 3 cm this indicates that when sx 10 cm the maximum net transport increases with sx whereas when sx exceeds 10 cm the net transport decreases with the increase of sx at t 28 h the final net transport quantity is positively correlated with sx as for spanwise distance the maximum net transport quantity is negatively correlated with sy and the largest one that appears at sy 3 cm is 5 7 times that of the smallest one that appears at sy 15 cm at t 28 h spanwise distance has only a minor influence on the final net transport quantity the variation of dimensionless transport volume section 2 3 2 can also be divided into two stages fig 14 similar to the effective exchange depth the change rate of v decreases with the decrease of streamwise distance but with the increase of spanwise distance the effective transport volume at sx 20 cm is 4 2 times that of sx 3 cm while the solute penetration at sy 3 cm is 1 4 times that of sy 15 cm at t 28 h the maximum effective transport volume increases linearly in the third stage there is a linear relationship between the effective transport volume at t 27 h when the transport volume increases linearly and the change rate of volume approaches zero and streamwise distance sx r2 0 9952 and spanwise distance sy r2 0 93 and it is positively correlated with sx but negatively correlated with sy the maximum effective transport volume can be further predicted by sx and sy through the linear equation fig 15 4 conclusions in this study laboratory experiment and numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of rigid non submerged plants on the solute transport characteristics in ths streambed the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 rigid non submerged plants have an effect on solute transport in the streambed through small circulation induced by plants the presence of aquatic plant can change the flow pattern producing a high pressure area in front of the plants and a low pressure area on the side and back of the plants at the swi this pressure difference forms circulation flows between adjacent plants and induces convective exchange between the overlying water and the shallow pore water that drive solutes transport in the streambed forming a crescent shaped plume 2 there are three circulation processes for solutes in front of the plant a solutes close to the front of the plant transport to the root due to the pressure difference between the front and back of the plant while the solutes slightly farther away transport around the roots to the back of the plant b solutes on both sides of the front of the plant transport around the sides of the plant to the back of the plant due to the pressure difference between two adjacent plants and c solutes far away from the front of the plant transport to the low pressure area at swi and later leave the streambed 3 there are differences in the hyporheic exchange depth solute transport quantity and volume at different plant densities a smaller streamwise distance of plants arrangement leads to the formation of a smaller hyporheic zone and subsequently less transport depth volume and quantity of solute in the streambed however the plant arrangement distance along spanwise direction have the opposite effect on the hyporheic exchange this study provides important insights into the mechanism of hyporheic exchange in the presence of aquatic plants and the use of aquatic plants for ecological restoration the presence of aquatic plants allows the pollutants around the plants to penetrate into the riverbed and thus promotes material circulation in the hyporheic zone however this also implies that aquatic plants are susceptible to the impact of water pollution and their growth will be affected plants densely in the streamwise direction and sparsely in the spanwise direction can effectively prevent pollutants from transport deeper into the river bed and the resulted convective exchange also accelerates the circulation process of pollutant in the riverbed the findings have implications for the use of aquatic plants for ecological restoration although the focus here was on effects of rigid non submerged plants on solute transport in the streambed submerged plants also influence the flow field and solute transport in the overlying water columns plants are always flexible and exist in the form of plant clusters in nature and there are biochemical reactions between plants and solutes therefore further investigations should be carried out to examine relevant factors which have significant effects on the hyporheic exchange and solute transport credit authorship contribution statement guangqiu jin conceptualization formal analysis funding acquisition supervision

the effects of lapse rate reducing the value of seasonal scale bias and improving the measurement of actual temperatures in diurnal cycles the outcomes demonstrate that there was much better agreement

according to monteiro et al 2018 using ground data gathered by a network of climate stations the np climate database of precipitation in iran with a timescale from 1987 to 2017 was also checked for the climate study of sicily italy daily weather variables from the np archive were suggested because ground weather stations installed in inland high elevations produce unreliable estimates of the relative air temperature and humidity negm et al 2018 nasa data for brazil s relative humidity temperature dew point were examined by hazra et al 2019 even though the relative humidity data did not agree well with one another they discovered a statistically high agreement between the np and the temperature data recorded by the ground stations de aguiar and junior 2020 compared weather data

between them on any timescale daily monthly or yearly the np climate data product has not been examined over the al euphrates river basin furthermore no previous study has ever compared the quality of climate data products over the al euphrates river basin over both time and space the current study examines the spatial and temporal evaluation of the np data of some weather variables in al euphrates over a 30 year span from 1981 to 2013 on daily monthly and annual timescales at 0 5 resolution in an effort to close this gap 2 materials and methods 2 1 selected site the euphrates river er which is thought to be the longest river in southwest asia and has a total length of about 2786 km was chosen as a case study iraq syria and turkey make up the river s three primary riparian nations fig 1 er is situated at longitudes of 37 and 42 e and latitudes of 34 to 37 n the er basin erb experiences hot dry summers with little to no precipitation and mild winters with little to no precipitation each year erb is located in an area with a humid subtropical climate the basin was chosen because of its characteristics which include being semi arid and vulnerable to desertification downstream mean annual precipitation in the basin is 1000 mm upstream and gradually drops to 200 mm in the south escwa 2013 the desert covers about 75 of the river basin s land the geographical diversity exposed the river basin to various annual climatic impacts on both global and local scales the river basin is impacted by the mediterranean weather in the north upper part while approaching the semi desert and desert climate in the middle and lower part of the basin causing irregular rainfall 2 2 collected data the iraqi metrological organization and seismology imos for stations in iraq and the irrigation operation and technology center cotr for stations in syria and turkey provided the daily monthly and annual meteorological data from 9 ground weather stations as shown in table 1 and fig 2 but many weather stations still lack information particularly in developing countries like syria and iraq in the absence of measured and ongoing meteorological data np data can be used to fill in the gaps lindsay et al 2013 the weather variables like rainfall and minimum and maximum air temperatures were measured at the same period of observations in both satellite stations and ground stations which are necessary for hydrological simulation and were obtained from np at the closest grid point to the target location after the allen et al 1998 procedures were validated because they have a regular and uniform grid and a spatial resolution of 0 5longitude latitude the study used np reanalysis products at the grid point closest to the target location np data collected the same weather variables that ground weather stations had collected during the same period of observations 2 3 accuracy evaluation microsoft excel has been used to apply and carry out various statistical methods to compare the monthly and annual np data and observed measurements accuracy was evaluated using the following metrics root mean square error rmse mean error me coefficient of determination r2 and sutcliffe

3 provides the research s workflow 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term climate pattern using the observed monthly mean data precipitation maximum and minimum temperature at each station for the years 1984 to 2013 the annual weather data for the chosen atmospheric variables are calculated the geographic information system arcgis 10 5 software then interpolates these annual climates between stations using the inverse distance weighting idw technique to cover all basins in the selected region the annual average of the climate data is effectively spatially interpolated as a result as shown in fig 4 this graph shows that the average annual precipitation is between 0 24 and 1 09 mm day the mean temperature is between 16 98 and 21 84 c the annual relative humidity is between 37 41 and 56 91 the solar radiation is between 4 96 and 5 19 mjm 2d and the wind speed is between 3 88 and 4 51 m sec average annual precipitation and relative humidity are rise in coastal stations and decreases gradually in southern stations respectively in contrast to winds which are the antipodes of one another it is simple to understand how the mediterranean sea affects egypt given the inverse relationship between the annual average temperature precipitation and relative humidity as can be seen from fig 4 the results demonstrate that the mediterranean sea has a significant influence on meteorological data at the upper part of the euphrates river basin before the influence becomes limited at the middle and gradually decreases until it almost completely disappears at the lower part of the basin the highest annual temperatures and solar radiation were recorded at stations in the south of the basin while the lowest annual average water levels were found at stations in the north average annual precipitation and relative humidity are high in coastal stations and low in southern stations respectively in contrast to winds which are the antipodes of one another it is simple to understand how the mediterranean sea affects egypt given the opposite relationship between the annual average temperature precipitation and relative humidity 3 2 climate variables evaluation 3 2 1 precipitation the daily quantitative statistics for precipitation over various climatic regions along the basin are shown in fig 5 a c fig 5a demonstrates that between the np and ground based datasets g4 has the highest correlation coefficients r2 0 91 while g8 and g9 have the lowest this site has low agreement as a result of the extremely low seasonal precipitation 44 mm year in those regions errors from rain gauges and satellite sources are affected by low seasonal precipitation tapiador et al 2012 the highest mbes and lowest mbes respectively are found in the southern regions of the basin s g8 and g9 mbe 1 75 1 63 respectively which have arid climates g2 mbe 0 09 at north part of basin as shown in fig 5 the daily parameter nse analysis fig 5b shows that np performance is nearly acceptable with the exception of g9 g8 nse 0 59 0 60 which includes the south portions of the basin in iraq fig 5d f displays the quantitative statistics on a monthly basis in general all climatic regions r2 values extent from 0 84 to 0 89 and the basin region r2 0 97 have high correlation coefficients with the exception of the g6 r2 0 64 additionally g4 and g2 have the highest correlations r2 0 98 it is evident from fig 5f that the g8 region has the lowest mbe 0 02 and the g7 region has the highest mbe 4 79 and the basin wide range is 1 61 the nse parameter values calculated in the climate regions nse extent from 0 49 to 0 97 show that the satellite data provides good estimates of the observed data fig 5g i displays the quantitative measurement indices obtained in the study except g8 yearly scale the np product provides a respectable agreement r2 0 81 nse 0 87 with ground based precipitation data along all basins additionally some regions including g1 to g7 and g9 have correlation coefficients that range from 0 67 to 0 93 fig 5g however there is a possibility of positive nse in every region along the basin fig 5h on an annual scale the mbe value for the basin is 1 75 additionally the g3 mbe 0 1 and g1 mbe 4 05 regions of the np product have the lowest and highest errors respectively results showed good agreement between np and ground based data at a daily and monthly time scale which is consistent with what other authors have reported while in jordan 13 different stations evaluated remotely sensed np and ground precipitation data and found significant correlations between the two that ranged from 0 72 0 91 al kilani et al 2021 annual scale data for r2 values ranging from 0 72 to 0 8675 have been reported similar to poyang lake basin guo and liu 2016 which demonstrate the precision of the satellite output and that nasa outperforms other satellites in terms of precipitation according to research by according to ebert et al 2007 concluded from the observed results that satellite rainfall data give high performance in temperate and dry climates fig 6 shows that the spatial patterns of the annual np product s quantitative statistics over different time scales are only moderately consistent with ground based data in the majority of the site s basin without much room for error it is clear that the lowest range of monthly r2 values was found the results of the nse are comparable and relate to the mbe at various time scales 3 2 2 maximum air temperature when compared to the measured data the temperature data tmax of the np system have a different time scale the daily quantitative statistics for the maximum temperature over the various climatic regions along the basin are shown in fig 7 a c as shown in fig 7a all stations with range exhibit high agreement between the np and ground datasets with r2 0 97 and g9 exhibits the lowest r2 0 86 according to fig 7c the mbe is highest in g8 and g9 which have arid and semi arid climates mbe 0 08 0 06 and lowest in g4 which has humid climates mbe 0 01 according to an analysis of the daily nse fig 7b nasa s performance is nearly acceptable in the majority of climatic regions with a range of 0 985 the quantitative statistics are shown on a monthly basis in fig 7d f there is a significant correlation between the two variables as indicated by the high correlation coefficients across the basin r2 0 98 and across all climatic regions r2 values ranging from 0 86 to 0 94 the highest correlations are found in g1 and g7 g8 and g9 with a range of 0 98 the mbe values in the g6 region are the lowest mbe 0 25 and highest mbe 2 48 in the g4 station with a range of 2 08 along all basins as can be seen in fig 7f based on the nse parameter values it was acquired from climatic regions nse extent from 0 66 to 0 98 fig 7e the satellite data provides good estimation of the observed data excluding the g5 nse 0 78 the quantitative indices obtained on an annual basis are shown in fig 7g i the np product is provided with respectable agreement r2 0 78 nse 0 93 with ground based precipitation data along all basins with the exception of g3 nse 0 34 every region along the basin has a chance of having a positive nse on an annual basis the mbe value for the basin extant from g1 1 3 tog7 0 15 regions as shown in fig 7i the findings confirmed those published by other authors and demonstrated that daily agreement between np and ground based data was generally good white et al 2008 found that the average r2 for tmax was 0 88 these results demonstrate relatively high correlation and agreement between tmax data calculated from np and the observed one for most of the chosen basin stations and low errors at the monthly time scale as shown in fig 8 3 2 3 minimum air temperature fig 9 a i compares observations from weather stations to np statistical indicators for daily monthly and annual averages of the minimum temperature tmin the daily monthly and annual maximum and minimum values of r2 at stations along the basin were respectively 0 9 and 0 47 0 97 and 0 67 and 0 83 and 0 54 the results show that the np tmin dataset is most accurate at stations located between 550 and 980 m from the sea at different elevations as with tmax north of 37o n and west of 38o e additionally the tmin calculated from np has about 85 positive mean bias overestimation compared to observation and a 90 positive mean bias overestimation and 15 of the stations with a negative bias are located in g5 and g6 at an average monthly scale due to a 100 positive mean bias overestimation versus average annual measurements the nse value of np tmin values is higher than the observations of the majority of weather stations along the basin on an annual time scale these values indicate relatively acceptable agreement and correlation between the np tmin data and the measured one for the majority of the selected stations as shown in fig 10 despite the fact that 85 of the stations have positive nse values at daily and monthly intervals with ranges between 0 49 and 0 92 for daily time scales and 0 97 and 0 98 for monthly time scales 4 conclusions the results show that for the years 1981 to 2013 np generally predicted the majority of datasets of weather variables within the al euphrates river basin region correctly where the data show high accuracy agreement and the goodness of variable fit when compared to the ground data with few under and overestimations and no need for bias correction the average r2 nse and mbe at different time scales daily monthly and annual according to statistical estimates are as follows for the maximum temperature the average r2 is 0 94 c the average nse is 0 85 c the average mbe is 0 63 c and the average mbe for the minimum temperature is 0 03 c 0 41 c and 1 41 c respectively for the same variables bai et al 2010 for china monteiro et al 2017 for brazil and negm et al 2018 for italy all came to similar conclusions for the continental usa white et al 2008 as well as in southern portugal rodrigues et al 2021 aboelkhair et al 2019 for egypt on a daily monthly and annual timescale the results of the spatial statistical analysis were used to assess the product performance of the dataset taken from np during the same time period it was shown that np provides good agreement and performance on the monthly scale in the majority of areas along the basin where the average r2 nse and mbe at various time scales daily monthly and annual were r2 0 90 0 98 and 0 77 nse 0 75 0 78 and 0 832 and positive mbe 0 3 1 5 and 0 97 respectively the performance pattern also deteriorates and for the majority of the months excessive precipitation is experienced in the basin s south and east in most areas of the basin np performed satisfactorily overall it can be recommended as a good and acceptable alternative for climatological and hydrological studies in the al euphrates basin the same result for the precipitation climate variable was found in iran by kheyruri and sharafati 2022 and in jordan by al kilani et al 2021 furthermore the performance pattern decreases and overestimated precipitation occurs in most months in the south and east of the basin in general the np performed well in most regions of the basin and can be recommended for hydrological and climatological studies in the al euphrates basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

3 provides the research s workflow 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term climate pattern using the observed monthly mean data precipitation maximum and minimum temperature at each station for the years 1984 to 2013 the annual weather data for the chosen atmospheric variables are calculated the geographic information system arcgis 10 5 software then interpolates these annual climates between stations using the inverse distance weighting idw technique to cover all basins in the selected region the annual average of the climate data is effectively spatially interpolated as a result as shown in fig 4 this graph shows that the average annual precipitation is between 0 24 and 1 09 mm day the mean temperature is between 16 98 and 21 84 c the annual relative humidity is between 37 41 and 56 91 the solar radiation is between 4 96 and 5 19 mjm 2d and the wind speed is between 3 88 and 4 51 m sec average annual precipitation and relative humidity are rise in coastal stations and decreases gradually in southern stations respectively in contrast to winds which are the antipodes of one another it is simple to understand how the mediterranean sea affects egypt given the inverse relationship between the annual average temperature precipitation and relative humidity as can be seen from fig 4 the results demonstrate that the mediterranean sea has a significant influence on meteorological data at the upper part of the euphrates river basin before the influence becomes limited at the middle and gradually decreases until it almost completely disappears at the lower part of the basin the highest annual temperatures and solar radiation were recorded at stations in the south of the basin while the lowest annual average water levels were found at stations in the north average annual precipitation and relative humidity are high in coastal stations and low in southern stations respectively in contrast to winds which are the antipodes of one another it is simple to understand how the mediterranean sea affects egypt given the opposite relationship between the annual average temperature precipitation and relative humidity 3 2 climate variables evaluation 3 2 1 precipitation the daily quantitative statistics for precipitation over various climatic regions along the basin are shown in fig 5 a c fig 5a demonstrates that between the np and ground based datasets g4 has the highest correlation coefficients r2 0 91 while g8 and g9 have the lowest this site has low agreement as a result of the extremely low seasonal precipitation 44 mm year in those regions errors from rain gauges and satellite sources are affected by low seasonal precipitation tapiador et al 2012 the highest mbes and lowest mbes respectively are found in the southern regions of the basin s g8 and g9 mbe 1 75 1 63 respectively which have arid climates g2 mbe 0 09 at north part of basin as shown in fig 5 the daily parameter nse analysis fig 5b shows that np performance is nearly acceptable with the exception of g9 g8 nse 0 59 0 60 which includes the south portions of the basin in iraq fig 5d f displays the quantitative statistics on a monthly basis in general all climatic regions r2 values extent from 0 84 to 0 89 and the basin region r2 0 97 have high correlation coefficients with the exception of the g6 r2 0 64 additionally g4 and g2 have the highest correlations r2 0 98 it is evident from fig 5f that the g8 region has the lowest mbe 0 02 and the g7 region has the highest mbe 4 79 and the basin wide range is 1 61 the nse parameter values calculated in the climate regions nse extent from 0 49 to 0 97 show that the satellite data provides good estimates of the observed data fig 5g i displays the quantitative measurement indices obtained in the study except g8 yearly scale the np product provides a respectable agreement r2 0 81 nse 0 87 with ground based precipitation data along all basins additionally some regions including g1 to g7 and g9 have correlation coefficients that range from 0 67 to 0 93 fig 5g however there is a possibility of positive nse in every region along the basin fig 5h on an annual scale the mbe value for the basin is 1 75 additionally the g3 mbe 0 1 and g1 mbe 4 05 regions of the np product have the lowest and highest errors respectively results showed good agreement between np and ground based data at a daily and monthly time scale which is consistent with what other authors have reported while in jordan 13 different stations evaluated remotely sensed np and ground precipitation data and found significant correlations between the two that ranged from 0 72 0 91 al kilani et al 2021 annual scale data for r2 values ranging from 0 72 to 0 8675 have been reported similar to poyang lake basin guo and liu 2016 which demonstrate the precision of the satellite output and that nasa outperforms other satellites in terms of precipitation according to research by according to ebert et al 2007 concluded from the observed results that satellite rainfall data give high performance in temperate and dry climates fig 6 shows that the spatial patterns of the annual np product s quantitative statistics over different time scales are only moderately consistent with ground based data in the majority of the site s basin without much room for error it is clear that the lowest range of monthly r2 values was found the results of the nse are comparable and relate to the mbe at various time scales 3 2 2 maximum air temperature when compared to the measured data the temperature data tmax of the np system have a different time scale the daily quantitative statistics for the maximum temperature over the various climatic regions along the basin are shown in fig 7 a c as shown in fig 7a all stations with range exhibit high agreement between the np and ground datasets with r2 0 97 and g9 exhibits the lowest r2 0 86 according to fig 7c the mbe is highest in g8 and g9 which have arid and semi arid climates mbe 0 08 0 06 and lowest in g4 which has humid climates mbe 0 01 according to an analysis of the daily nse fig 7b nasa s performance is nearly acceptable in the majority of climatic regions with a range of 0 985 the quantitative statistics are shown on a monthly basis in fig 7d f there is a significant correlation between the two variables as indicated by the high correlation coefficients across the basin r2 0 98 and across all climatic regions r2 values ranging from 0 86 to 0 94 the highest correlations are found in g1 and g7 g8 and g9 with a range of 0 98 the mbe values in the g6 region are the lowest mbe 0 25 and highest mbe 2 48 in the g4 station with a range of 2 08 along all basins as can be seen in fig 7f based on the nse parameter values it was acquired from climatic regions nse extent from 0 66 to 0 98 fig 7e the satellite data provides good estimation of the observed data excluding the g5 nse 0 78 the quantitative indices obtained on an annual basis are shown in fig 7g i the np product is provided with respectable agreement r2 0 78 nse 0 93 with ground based precipitation data along all basins with the exception of g3 nse 0 34 every region along the basin has a chance of having a positive nse on an annual basis the mbe value for the basin extant from g1 1 3 tog7 0 15 regions as shown in fig 7i the findings confirmed those published by other authors and demonstrated that daily agreement between np and ground based data was generally good white et al 2008 found that the average r2 for tmax was 0 88 these results demonstrate relatively high correlation and agreement between tmax data calculated from np and the observed one for most of the chosen basin stations and low errors at the monthly time scale as shown in fig 8 3 2 3 minimum air temperature fig 9 a i compares observations from weather stations to np statistical indicators for daily monthly and annual averages of the minimum temperature tmin the daily monthly and annual maximum and minimum values of r2 at stations along the basin were respectively 0 9 and 0 47 0 97 and 0 67 and 0 83 and 0 54 the results show that the np tmin dataset is most accurate at stations located between 550 and 980 m from the sea at different elevations as with tmax north of 37o n and west of 38o e additionally the tmin calculated from np has about 85 positive mean bias overestimation compared to observation and a 90 positive mean bias overestimation and 15 of the stations with a negative bias are located in g5 and g6 at an average monthly scale due to a 100 positive mean bias overestimation versus average annual measurements the nse value of np tmin values is higher than the observations of the majority of weather stations along the basin on an annual time scale these values indicate relatively acceptable agreement and correlation between the np tmin data and the measured one for the majority of the selected stations as shown in fig 10 despite the fact that 85 of the stations have positive nse values at daily and monthly intervals with ranges between 0 49 and 0 92 for daily time scales and 0 97 and 0 98 for monthly time scales 4 conclusions the results show that for the years 1981 to 2013 np generally predicted the majority of datasets of weather variables within the al euphrates river basin region correctly where the data show high accuracy agreement and the goodness of variable fit when compared to the ground data with few under and overestimations and no need for bias correction the average r2 nse and mbe at different time scales daily monthly and annual according to statistical estimates are as follows for the maximum temperature the average r2 is 0 94 c the average nse is 0 85 c the average mbe is 0 63 c and the average mbe for the minimum temperature is 0 03 c 0 41 c and 1 41 c respectively for the same variables bai et al 2010 for china monteiro et al 2017 for brazil and negm et al 2018 for italy all came to similar conclusions for the continental usa white et al 2008 as well as in southern portugal rodrigues et al 2021 aboelkhair et al 2019 for egypt on a daily monthly and annual timescale the results of the spatial statistical analysis were used to assess the product performance of the dataset taken from np during the same time period it was shown that np provides good agreement and performance on the monthly scale in the majority of areas along the basin where the average r2 nse and mbe at various time scales daily monthly and annual were r2 0 90 0 98 and 0 77 nse 0 75 0 78 and 0 832 and positive mbe 0 3 1 5 and 0 97 respectively the performance pattern also deteriorates and for the majority of the months excessive precipitation is experienced in the basin s south and east in most areas of the basin np performed satisfactorily overall it can be recommended as a good and acceptable alternative for climatological and hydrological studies in the al euphrates basin the same result for the precipitation climate variable was found in iran by kheyruri and sharafati 2022 and in jordan by al kilani et al 2021 furthermore the performance pattern decreases and overestimated precipitation occurs in most months in the south and east of the basin in general the np performed well in most regions of the basin and can be recommended for hydrological and climatological studies in the al euphrates basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

2162,nitrate contamination of groundwater due to improper management of fertilizer application and controls during agricultural activities is an escalating worldwide issue numerous studies have reported similar contamination in the ryukyu limestone aquifer in the southern part of okinawa island the study area has a unique setting where the subsurface dams hold the groundwater behind their cut off walls probably holding contaminated waters this study provides updated insights on the source of contamination using stable n and o isotope ratios of dissolved nitrate áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 in the aquifer waters to propose a better reference in the source fingerprinting assessment a special emphasis was placed on the isotopic comparison between the fertilizers and farmland soils where the respective fertilizers were applied a total of 176 groundwater samples were collected from several spatial and monthly sampling campaigns for the purpose of source determination our isotopic comparison detected the enrichment of 15n of nitrate nitrogen in the soil samples after the application of both chemical fertilizers and manure due to nitrification and volatilization unlike results from previous studies the áº15nno3 compositions of most groundwater samples did not fall into the range of soils mainly controlled by chemical fertilizers from 3 to 5 but were comparable to the soils affected by mixed fertilizers including both chemical fertilizers and manure from 7 to 9 the soils beneath untreated manure storage sites characterized by the highest áº15nno3 values from 18 to 20 affected some groundwater which shows an even higher value 9 the contaminated waters tend to be gathered close to the subsurface dams and this tendency did not differ between two subsurface dam settings komesu and giza however due to more impact from manure storage sites the groundwater in the komesu area tends to show slightly higher Î´15nno3 values than those in the giza area our study demonstrated the usefulness of soil samples for precise isotopic source identification in farmland areas keywords nitrate pollution stable isotopes groundwater limestone aquifer okinawa data availability i have shared the data that we use for this research in the form of supplementary tables s1 to s6 1 introduction groundwater nitrate contamination is one of the most widespread watershed contamination problems globally e g gillham and cherry 1978 ronen et al 1983 spalding and exner 1991 cook and herczeg 2000 galloway 2003 rivett et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 ward et al 2018 romanelli et al 2020 yin et al 2020 the no3 n concentration does not usually exceed 3 mg l 1 in natural aquatic environments burkart and kolpin 1993 except in areas with certain geological conditions lowe and wallace 1999a min et al 2002 stadler et al 2008 among several types of aquifers karst or limestone aquifers are one of the most vulnerable systems to this type of pollution because of their high transmissibility field 1988 buzek et al 1998 bakalowicz 2005 stevanoviÄ 2015 husic et al 2020 yin et al 2020 kalvÄns et al 2021 identifying the source of nitrogen that causes pollution particularly in such fields is a fundamental countermeasure that can be employed as quickly as possible agricultural activity is one of the major activities that cause contamination but it is often difficult to precisely pinpoint the principal causes due to their non point source characteristics besides chemical fertilizers nitrogen is largely released through multiple sources from organic compounds such as crops residue fertilizers livestock manure manure piles house effluent within farmlands and their mixtures with somewhat similar isotopic signatures e g aravena et al 1993 aravena and robertson 1998 lowe and wallace 1999a vitÃ²ria et al 2004 widory et al 2004 bateman and kelly 2007 hristov et al 2009 szpak 2014 minet et al 2017 kim et al 2019 margalef marti et al 2021 which is often indistinguishable by simple tracer applications thus an appropriate approach for this assessment should be developed urgently stable n and o isotopic tracers represent one of the most advantageous tools available in geochemistry to investigate the source of nitrogen oxides e g aravena and robertson 1998 kendall 1998 kendall and doctor 2003 kendall et al 2008 umezawa et al 2008 xue et al 2012 hosono et al 2013 minet et al 2017 ogrinc et al 2019 yin et al 2020 it becomes more powerful if it is combined with other isotopes e g clark and fritz 1997 aravena and robertson 1998 vitÃ²ria et al 2004 widory et al 2004 otero et al 2009 xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2014 puig et al 2017 torres martÃ­nez et al 2020 or other parameters e g bÃ¶hlke and denver 1995 katz and griffin 2008 norrman et al 2015 erostate et al 2018 carrey et al 2021 however the dual n and o stable isotope ratios of dissolved nitrate expressed hereafter as Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 respectively remain as the most fundamental tool for identifying the cause of groundwater nitrate pollution since it is a direct tracer of nitrate itself many researchers have measured Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values in groundwater samples and compared them directly with values of potential nitrogen sources to estimate possible contamination sources on the other hand it is notable that Î´15n values of loading materials are altered during the transformation of nitrogen compounds that generally occurs in the upper 50 cm of soils on the surface e g persson and wirÃ©n 1995 craine et al 2015 osaka et al 2018 hyodo et al 2021 therefore it may bring some errors in source identification if one solely refers to the isotopic values of potential nitrogen sources directly wassenaar 1995 fogg et al 1998 brunet et al 2011 such alteration could happen even on karst or limestone aquifers with a thin layer of their topsoils therefore it seems more important to consider the isotopic compositions of soil pore waters as source indicators together with the potential nitrogen sources there are not many works that carefully consider this distinct point we think it is a crucial problem to be addressed to possibly establish proper fingerprinting assessment in agricultural fields with the application of mixed source loading previous studies have documented nitrate groundwater contamination caused by intense agricultural activities in the ryukyu limestone aquifers in southern okinawa island agata et al 2001 yoshimoto et al 2007 nakano et al 2013 nakaya et al 2018 the increased agricultural practices induced a huge amount of groundwater extraction in the study area fig 1 two subsurface dams komesu and giza were constructed in 2005 to maintain sustainable water sources and food production okinawa general bureau 2006 both subsurface dams are located in contrasting hydrogeological settings the komesu area is on a flat coastal land while the giza area is on a higher terrain and the groundwater is discharged from the coastal cliff fig 2 yoshimoto et al 2011 nakaya et al 2018 the komesu subsurface dam is extraordinary since it is the first full scale subsurface dam construction to prevent saltwater intrusion in japan nawa and miyazaki 2009 the groundwater from the giza area is partly used for drinking purposes thus identifying the source of nitrate contamination in this area is important considering the abovementioned unique settings it has been suggested that the major nitrate contaminant source in the southern okinawa area is chemical fertilizers from crop farming mainly sugarcane commodities fig 1b agata et al 2001 yoshimoto et al 2007 2011 nakaya et al 2018 a contribution of domestic wastewater was also reported in the residential areas at the local scale yoshimoto et al 2011 however it is also confirmed that livestock manure has been increasingly applied to promote the environmentally friendly farming campaign by the okinawa government ministry of agriculture 2003 okinawa prefecture 2008 although its impact on groundwater contamination has not been evaluated in detail in addition untreated manure piles lying just near the farmlands without any protections which are placed on site until just before the application might affect groundwater quality therefore more systematic source identification of groundwater contamination based on spatial sampling and seasonal monitoring should be performed considering these new possible contamination sources the main goal of this study is to characterize Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 compositions of soil pore waters from different land use settings and to demonstrate the soil samples are an advantageous reference as end members for fingerprinting assessment of the groundwater nitrate contamination compared to direct measurement of potential nitrogen source materials in this study we obtained both potential nitrogen source materials chemical fertilizers crops residue fertilizers and livestock manure and soils from each individual farmland with different fertilization logs and settings in the study area in addition to groundwater samples fig 1 based on the fingerprinting assessment we will address the distinct sources and behavior of nitrate contamination behind subsurface dams represented by two dam catchments with different hydrogeological settings in southern okinawa 2 study area 2 1 topography and climate the study area is located in the southern part of okinawa island fig 1a based on the municipality the survey was conducted in itoman city 46 6 km2 and yaese town 26 9 km2 the total population in itoman city and yaese town in 2020 are 60 704 and 30 681 respectively okinawa prefecture 2020 topographically the area consists of a series of coastal marine terraces the landform of the ryukyu limestone is represented by mesa and cuesta takayasu 1978 the climate is categorized as humid subtropical according to the kÃ¶ppen climate classification the average annual rainfall and mean air temperature from 1978 to 2018 are 2 004 mm and 21 2 c respectively according to the itokazu weather radar station in nanjo city one of the nearest stations to our study area japan meteorology agency jma 2018 most of the rainfall occurs in the rainy season may june and the typhoon season july september yoshimoto et al 2013 2 2 geology the basement rocks of the ryukyu limestone are mainly composed of permian to neogene sedimentary rocks fig 2a in the southern part the sedimentary basement rocks are categorized as the shimajiri group the shimajiri group has a thickness of more than 2000 m that consists of thick siltstone with intercalations of sandstone and tuff fukuta et al 1971 a pleistocene ryukyu limestone terrace in the southern part of okinawa island unconformably overlays the shimajiri group of miocene pliocene age fig 2b takayasu 1978 ishida et al 2003 odawara et al 2005 sagae et al 2012 nakaya et al 2018 the limestone in this area is composed of uplifted coral reefs and foraminifera fossils this terrace is separated into several permeable blocks by conjugate fault systems figs 2 and 3 these fault systems generally show ne sw and nw se orientations along the fault scarps the limestone has been altered and recrystallized odawara et al 2005 sagae et al 2012 yoshimoto et al 2013 nakaya et al 2018 2 3 hydrogeology groundwater in the southern okinawa region is recharged by precipitation over most of the surface land in the study area and the northern hilly area then it flows along the topographical gradient through the pores and conduits of the ryukyu limestone above the impermeable shimajiri group the aquifer in the study area is categorized as an unconfined aquifer and has a thickness of around 60 80 m as faults act as hydrogeological boundaries aquifer systems of the limestone terraces are subdivided by each block as an individual groundwater basin fig 3 okinawa general bureau 2006 yoshimoto et al 2011 yamanaka 2012 according to furukawa et al 1976 the study area consists of two groundwater basins komesu and giza figs 1 3 these two basins have an area of 9 0 km2 and 5 2 km2 respectively each subsurface dam was constructed along the coast in order to hold the groundwater inside each basin the komesu subsurface dam is 2 3 km in length and 60 80 m in depth while the giza subsurface dam has a smaller size of 1 2 km in length and 30 40 m in depth fig 1b okinawa general bureau 2006 the ryukyu limestone aquifers have several caves and caverns with rapid groundwater flow hence conduit type fracture flow exists in the study area on the other hand shoji et al 1999 and momii et al 2003 simulated the groundwater flow systems of the aquifers using numerical models based on darcy s law with the assumption that diffuse type flow matrix flow could be applied on a regional scale however it is still difficult to accurately explain whole groundwater flow systems in the ryukyu limestone aquifers and to develop a well reproduced simulation model is still challenging yoshimoto et al 2011 suggested from well sensibility tests that both fracture and matrix flows exist in the study area 2 4 land use according to geospatial information authority of japan gsi 2006 the major land use in the study area is agriculture 51 which has continued for a few decades fig 1b sugarcane is the dominant crop fig 1b additionally residential areas 22 are distributed along and around the main roads forests 21 are distributed mainly along the fault scarps figs 1 and 3 other areas are dominated by uncultivated land and public property due to urbanization land use has gradually shifted from agricultural fields to residential areas yoshimoto et al 2011 yoshimoto et al 2013 additionally although sugarcane is still the most cultivated commodity vegetable and flower farming have become important agricultural practices after sugarcane ministry of agriculture 2015 the number of livestock farms peaked around 1990 most of the livestock farms are located near the agricultural area the number of cattle cows hogs and chickens in itoman city and yaese town in 2015 was 437 154 28 842 and 1 171 respectively ministry of agriculture 2015 okinawa prefecture 2003a okinawa prefecture 2006a okinawa prefecture 2006b recommends that 0 22 kg m 2 of nitrogen to be applied yearly for cultivation of sugarcane vegetables and flowers they recommend organic fertilizers such as compost to be applied in addition to chemical fertilizers law for promoting the introduction of sustainable agricultural production practices passed the local bill in 1999 and it recommends farmers to apply composts to improve soil quality instead of chemical fertilizers along with a guideline on a national scale ministry of agriculture 2003 accordingly increased livestock farming activities enhanced the production and application of more manure waste after 2000 it is important to note that untreated manure piles are placed on several fallow lands just near the farmlands without any coverings especially in the komesu area and thus it might contribute to groundwater contamination yoshimoto et al 2011 described livestock manure and chemical fertilizers are the two major nitrogen potential sources in the research area nitrogen loads from chemical fertilizers peaked in 1990 and then declined until recently 64 3 kg ha 1 in 2005 due to a decrease in agricultural farming areas however nitrogen loads from livestock manure in itoman city rather increased from 85 8 kg ha 1 in 1980 to 171 6 kg ha 1 in 2005 given that itoman city and yaese town have similar land use patterns and agricultural policies the livestock manure became the largest potential nitrogen source in the study area during the early 21st century in 2010 the nitrogen load through application of fertilizers was 7 7 kg ha 1 in itoman city and 10 6 kg ha 1 in yaese town while the load from livestock manure was 21 2 kg ha 1 in itoman city and 28 1 kg ha 1 in yaese town ministry of agriculture 2010 supporting the above explanation 2 5 soil properties soils in the study area are locally classified as red yellow soils or one sub order of entisols of united states department of agriculture usda comprehensive soil classification systems soil survey staff usda 1999 sedentary soils developed on the ryukyu limestone are characterized by heavy clay texture i e the clay less than 2 Î¼m in diameter content of fine earth passed through 2 mm in diameter exceeds 70 by weight due to their poor tilth the plow layer 15 cm deep is widely top dressed by crushed mudstones carried from neighboring areas consisting of miocene strata of the shimajiri group major clay minerals which possibly regulate the dynamics of the applied nitrogen nutrition are vermiculite or micaceous smectite by which ammonium is selectively retained by their specific adsorption the content of organic carbon in the plow layer is normally low in the range of less than 1 by weight 3 methods 3 1 groundwater sampling the sampling locations of this study are displayed in fig 1b groundwater samples were collected from 50 drilled wells of which 35 and 15 are located in the komesu and giza areas respectively those drilled wells were installed to monitor groundwater levels and quality before and after the dam construction the wells are multi screened at various depths between 8 and 55 m tables s1 and s2 we conducted a total of 4 sampling campaigns with different coverage and purposes the first sampling campaign was held in november 2012 in the komesu area this campaign intended to gather general information regarding the spatial distribution of nitrate contamination we analyzed Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 in groundwater samples from 33 wells the following year a second campaign was conducted in the komesu area for groundwater chemical and isotopic monitoring purposes for 5 representative wells the samples were continuously collected monthly for 16 months from 2013 to 2014 the third sampling was performed in the giza area for this sampling groundwater samples were collected monthly for 12 months from 2017 to 2018 from 4 selected wells the fourth campaign was organized in the giza area to seek spatial features of groundwater characteristics and samples were collected from 15 wells in august 2020 here the first and fourth samplings are defined as spatial sampling whereas the second and third samplings are defined as seasonal sampling in total 176 groundwater samples were analyzed of which 48 were from spatial samplings and 128 were from seasonal samplings a portable global positioning system gps device was used to plot the coordinates of the sampling points in the field groundwater levels were measured using a handy water level sensor the groundwater table contour map was generated by applying kriging interpolation method based on our direct measurement during the spatial sampling campaign groundwater samples were collected by an electrical pump the groundwater samples were pumped from the depth of 5 10 m below the hydraulic head in the komesu area considering the depth profiles of the groundwater chemistry as shown in the results section while the samples were pumped at the middle depth of the wells in the giza area tables s1 and s2 water samples from wells were pumped into plastic buckets and purged until the temperature ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp values became stable samples for isotopic and chemical analyses were stored in 50 ml and 100 ml polyethylene bottles respectively after filtering using a 0 2 Âµm membrane filter the ph ec do and orp values were measured using portable instruments sc82 yokogawa electric co japan and d 25 horiba ltd japan the ph was measured using a glass electrode orp was measured as the potential difference between a pt electrode and an ag agcl reference electrode and do was measured using a do electrode tip do tip 5401 horiba ltd 3 2 samples for soil and potential nitrogen source materials we collected 11 soil samples fig 1b from farmlands assuming the water soluble fraction in the soil is a proper proxy to evaluate the source of contamination based on the direct observations in the field we collected soils with different agricultural logs as follows the soils which were dominantly treated with chemical fertilizers that are typically found in fruit farms albeit a small mixture of manure could not be avoided the soils from available farmlands treated with livestock manures and multiple fertilizers including chemical crops residue and manure fertilizers and the soils near the manure storage site we collected 1 kg of soil samples from a depth below 60 cm using a hand auger from each farmland considering the possible occurrence of microbial processes at the upper 50 cm e g persson and wirÃ©n 1995 craine et al 2015 osaka et al 2018 yin et al 2020 margalef marti et al 2021 the reactions of which can possibly lead to isotopic fractionation this was an attempt to obtain appropriate isotopic reference values of each source material after the reactions in the topsoils had been completed and before being vertically transported to deeper aquifers the collected soil samples were taken back to the laboratory and their water contents were measured by comparing the weight of the original samples and the dried samples afterwards 100 g of each sample was mixed with 1000 ml of distilled water for 48 h to extract soluble fractions in the soil then the samples were filtered by a 0 2 Âµm membrane filter for chemical and isotopic analysis potential nitrogen source materials including chemical fertilizers n 5 crops residue fertilizers n 4 manure fertilizers n 2 and fresh manure in a representative manure storage site n 1 were obtained or directly collected from the field which correspond to all possible fertilizers that local farmers use in the research area the detailed types of chemical fertilizers are listed in table s3 the chemical fertilizers were pulverized with an agate mortar and the powdered samples were dissolved into 50 ml ultrapure water these water samples were filtered with a 0 2 Âµm membrane filter organic materials were dried at 80 c in the oven for 24 h and powdered using an agate mortar and then the powdered samples were used for isotopic analysis 3 3 analytical methods major ion concentrations were analyzed using ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland the Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values were determined using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 the denitrifier method relies on the isotope ratio analysis of nitrous oxide produced from sample nitrate by cultured denitrifying bacteria that lack n2o reductase activity this method has several steps including the preparation of denitrifier cultures and the conversion of samples into nitrous oxide schematically the n2o was obtained from the sample using helium carrier gas purified using cryogenic trapping precon system thermo fisher scientific usa separated chromatographically gas bench ii thermo fisher scientific usa and analyzed using mass spectrometry delta v advantage thermo fisher

flows the dam controlled hydrogeological settings differ significantly between the komesu and giza areas fig 3a the aquifer systems in the komesu area developed at lower altitudes with average groundwater levels of 10 6 m above sea level asl compared with those of the giza area at 40 6 m asl the density of contour lines of the groundwater table in the komesu area are sparser than in the giza area with a higher hydraulic gradient fig 3a this suggests that the groundwater flow in the komesu area is rather sluggish compared to that in the giza area where the flow is faster and more dynamic the giza intake dam is located on the coastal cliff and the elevation of its heads generally exceeds 20 m asl following its relatively steep water flow gradient the groundwater always flows out the intake dam through the annual hydrological cycle in contrast the komesu subsurface dam tends to hold and prevent the groundwater from outflowing over the intake wall during the low water season though groundwater is generally outflowing over the dam head ca 7 m asl in the high water season nawa and miyazaki 2009 yoshimoto et al 2013 these two different dam structures manifest distinct groundwater discharging patterns into the sea 4 2 hydrochemical features hydrochemical features based on major ion concentrations of the groundwater samples from all spatial sampling campaigns were expressed using a stiff diagram fig 3a as expected the major water quality type prevalent in the ryukyu limestone aquifers was the ca hco3 type the other water types were found mainly near the shoreline outside the intake wall of the komesu subsurface dam of these most samples showed ca so4 and ca cl water types most likely due to the mixing of the saline component while one well water well 6 with ec values of 2 660 Âµs cm 1 showed na cl water type due to clear saltwater intrusion fig 3a we confirmed the subsurface dam efficiently blocked seawater intrusion and is capable of holding freshwaters for the use of irrigation purposes as many other researchers have reported nawa and miyazaki 2009 yoshimoto et al 2011 2013 nakaya et al 2018 4 3 nitrogen concentrations the distribution of nitrate concentrations of groundwater samples from all spatial samplings is presented in fig 3b groundwater with a high nitrate concentration was found typically in the discharge area near the subsurface dams in both the komesu and giza areas and also near geological structures in some locations fig 3b for the spatial sampling the average no3 n concentration was 7 2 mg l 1 with values varying from 2 4 to 14 9 mg l 1 for all 47 samples the observed variation implies that the nitrate contamination had a broad heterogeneity across the basin among them 6 of 32 from komesu and 2 of 15 from giza areas observation wells surpassed the no3 n concentration of the world health organization who drinking water standard 10 mg l 1 world health organization who 2017 the mean no3 n concentrations were slightly higher in 32 wells in the komesu area 7 6 mg l 1 than in 15 wells in the giza area 6 5 mg l 1 we have measured nitrate concentration at multiple depths for selected wells fig s1 and confirmed that it generally showed a stable vertical profile irrespective of location thus we assume that the observed spatial distributional pattern in nitrate concentrations fig 3b is a good representative regardless of the depth in the studied unconfined limestone aquifers although there might be some exceptions since we did not check all of the groundwater wells in this study we hypothesize that dissolved nitrate in the aquifer travels along the lateral groundwater flow with a relatively well mixed characteristic in which nitrate nitrogen is loaded on the surface and transported vertically by soil water percolation to reach the saturated zone it is also notable that nh4 concentration was depleted generally 0 01 mg l 1 or under the detection limit for both soil and groundwater samples suggesting that the majority of microbial nitrification was completed in topsoil environments after nitrogen was loaded onto the agricultural farmlands there were some depleted nitrate concentrations as shown by the green circles in fig 3b among the highest concentrations we realized that some aquifer waters with low no3 n typically less than 2 5 mg l 1 were in anoxic conditions confirmed by their low do values below 2 0 mg l 1 table s1 these waters were typically found in the komesu area at 6 borehole locations reduced microbial activities are generally rare in the fast flow limestone aquifer systems such as the ryukyu limestone however since the low do condition is a favorable environment for the occurrence of denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 rivett et al 2008 hong et al 2019 that changes Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values in groundwater due to isotopic fractionation gillham and cherry 1978 mariotti et al 1988 mcmahon and bÃ¶hlke 1996 aravena and robertson 1998 panno et al 2006 rivett et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 osaka et al 2018 we removed the data from these groundwater samples from the following discussion to avoid the possibility of misinterpretation in our source fingerprinting assessment 4 4 n and o isotope ratios based on the spatial sampling the áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 of groundwater samples in the whole area varied from 4 to 13 5 and from 1 4 to 8 2 respectively fig 4 and fig s2 the komesu area had slightly higher ranges of áº15nno3 and áº18o no3 from 5 9 to 13 5 and from 1 6 to 8 2 respectively compared to the giza area áº15nno3 4 to 9 6 and áº18ono3 1 4 to 4 1 the five chemical fertilizer samples showed áº15n values ranging from 2 2 to 2 1 fig 4 while four crops residue fertilizer samples had slightly higher áº15n ranging between 1 9 and 4 5 the fresh manure and manure fertilizers had the highest áº15n among all analyzed potential nitrogen sources ranging from 9 9 to 11 8 n 3 for the soil samples the analytical results table s4 fall into three isotopically different categories depending on their fertilization logs regardless of the komesu and giza areas fig 4 first the farmland soils with a dominant application of chemical fertilizers displayed the lowest áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 ranging from 3 1 to 4 7 and from 4 4 to 0 9 respectively second the soils from farmlands where a mixture of all kinds of fertilizers could be applied defined as normal farmlands showed intermediate áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 compositions ranging from 6 8 to 9 and from 0 8 to 2 7 respectively lastly the soils from the manure storage sites exhibited distinctively elevated áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 ranging from 18 1 to 20 and from 10 6 to 13 1 respectively our results showed a gradual increase in isotope ratios from chemical fertilizers through crops residue fertilizers to fresh manure both for potential nitrogen sources and relevant soil samples fig 4 additionally systematic 15n isotopic enrichment was confirmed between potential nitrogen sources and soil samples fig 4 these detailed characterizations on possible contamination sources are useful for proper isotopic fingerprinting assessment through comparison with groundwater samples of our concern which will be discussed later 4 5 seasonal variations the groundwater levels at the monitoring wells were relatively stable fluctuating by approximately 1 m through the annual hydrological cycle except for wells 37 41 and 44 which showed a sharp response increasing up to 5 m to heavy rain over 500 mm month in may rainy season in the komesu area fig 5 after the quick water level rise it tended to return to its base level in 2 3 months interestingly these wells are located just behind the structural boundaries in the upgradient areas in komesu fig 3 where the natural faults play an important role as a hydrogeological structure that holds groundwater during high water season these water level fluctuations were not found in the giza area nitrate concentrations were rather stable regardless of monitoring sites except for three specific wells wells 41 44 and g 5 which showed unique patterns fig 5 that will be explained later the average no3 n concentration of all samples from monitoring sampling campaigns in the komesu area n 78 was 9 5 mg l 1 with values varying from 3 9 to 17 mg l 1 while in the giza area n 47 it was 14 8 mg l 1 with a range between 4 5 and 39 4 mg l 1 the average no3 n concentrations of each well during seasonal sampling n 16 for each well for komesu and n 12 for each well for giza were as follows 9 0 8 mg l 1 for well 8 8 7 1 8 mg l 1 for well 24 7 5 1 6 mg l 1 for well 37 14 9 1 7 mg l 1 for well 41 7 3 1 3 mg l 1 for well 44 27 3 6 4 mg l 1 for well g 5 12 4 1 9 mg l 1 for well g 7 8 3 0 9 mg l 1 for well g 23 and 11 1 2 4 mg l 1 for well n 15 most samples showed do values greater than 2 mg l 1 and did not show anaerobic nitrate reduction tendency mcmahon and chapelle 2008 clune and denver 2012 for wells 41 and 44 the no3 n concentrations decreased in may fig 5 which can be explained by dilution because of heavy rainfall this effect is maintained by their unique hydrogeological setting as mentioned earlier that the structure can hold much diluted rainwater particularly in the high water season distinctively elevated nitrate concentrations were found in well g 5 in the giza area where no3 n concentrations exceeded the who drinking water standard throughout the year av 27 3 mg l 1 n 12 and showed clear seasonal changes fig 5 possibly reflecting the timing of nitrogen loads applied on the land surface the áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 of groundwater samples from all monitoring campaigns ranged between 6 8 and 11 8 and 0 3 and 6 6 respectively the average áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 for all samples in the komesu area were 9 and 3 5 respectively n 76 while those in the giza area were 8 2 and 3 9 respectively n 47 the explanation for the observed changes in áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 data from monitoring campaigns will be discussed along with no3 n concentrations in the following section 5 discussion 5 1 n isotopic comparison between potential nitrogen sources and no3 in soils the n isotope ratio of potential nitrogen sources dissolved or mineralized in farmland soils mostly in the form of nh4 modifies its composition through various biological microbiological and physical processes in a topsoil environment e g kreitler 1979 wassenaar 1995 mcmahon and bÃ¶hlke 1996 robinson 2001 kelley et al 2013 szpak 2014 craine et al 2015 most typically occurring at depths shallower than 50 cm persson and wirÃ©n 1995 craine et al 2015 osaka et al 2018 yin et al 2020 hyodo et al 2021 margalef marti et al 2021 these processes include uptake and assimilation by plants nitrification and volatilization feigin et al 1974 kreitler and jones 1975 heaton 1986 hÃ¶gberg 1997 ostrom et al 1998 mengis et al 2001 robinson 2001 widory et al 2004 szpak 2014 puig et al 2017 lentz and lehrsch 2018 osaka et al 2018 which increase Î´15n of the residue materials up to 60 e g feigin et al 1974 clark and fritz 1997 robinson 2001 szpak 2014 puig et al 2017 margalef marti et al 2021 it is also well recognized that the vertical soil profile commonly shows great variability in áº15nno3 for the upper ca 50 cm due to the multiple processes mentioned above but it becomes stable in deeper unsaturated soils persson and wirÃ©n 1995 craine et al 2015 lentz and lehrsch 2018 osaka et al 2018 hyodo et al 2021 margalef marti et al 2021 therefore dissolved nitrate passing through the upper critical soil zone is vertically transported and reaches shallow aquifers without changing its áº15nno3 composition if active denitrification reaction does not take place during infiltration gebauer and dietrich 1993 nadelhoffer and fry 1994 persson and wirÃ©n 1995 wassenaar 1995 spoelstra et al 2007 beeckman et al 2018 these previous works suggest that n isotopic source identification of groundwater contamination may make a mistake if one directly uses potential nitrogen sources as isotopic end members some previous studies provided additional key information supporting the benefit of using soil samples as isotopic source indicators for example fogg et al 1998 reported that soil Î´15nno3 could be characterized based on the difference in fertilization logs the result of Î´15nno3 differed between soils with the application of chemical fertilizers 4 7 5 4 n 148 and animal waste 14 8 8 n 42 similarly wassenaar 1995 described that soils with the application of synthetic ammonium fertilizers showed áº15nno3 values ranging from 1 5 to 0 6 n 6 while those affected by manure had higher áº15nno3 values ranging from 7 9 to 8 6 n 3 non contaminated soils displayed áº15nno3 values ranging from 3 5 to 4 9 n 3 observed systematic variations in soil áº15nno3 following land use types suggest that soil samples can be used as end member compositions although these previous works did not show áº15n of potential nitrogen sources and did not discuss isotopic fractionation between potential nitrogen sources and soils which might differ depending on climate conditions and soil properties in this study chemical fertilizers had áº15ntotal values ranging from 2 2 to 2 1 while the farmland soils with a dominant application of the same chemical fertilizers showed relatively higher áº15nno3 ranging from 3 1 to 4 7 fig 4 resulting in 15n isotopic enrichment up to 6 9 the isotopic enrichment observed is possibly due to the nitrification reaction in the topsoils gebauer and dietrich 1993 nadelhoffer and fry 1994 ostrom et al 1998 spoelstra et al 2007 margalef marti et al 2021 yu et al 2021 our results for soil áº15nno3 compositions correspond well to fogg et al 1998 on the other side the soils from the normal farmlands with a mixed application of chemical fertilizers and other organic fertilizers such as crops residue and manure fertilizers showed intermediate áº15nno3 compositions compared to the other farmlands fig 4 these results suggest their compositions were the results of both contributions from multiple source mixtures and the isotopic fractionation in the topsoil nevertheless we reasonably distinguished the isotopic feature of two major contaminant sources in agricultural farmlands for the manure storage site soil samples exhibited distinctively high áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 values showing isotopic fractionation of áº15nno3 up to 10 relative to fresh manure samples fig 4 at this specific point untreated manures were stacked into piles and directly exposed to the ground soil and therefore water reacting with these manures can easily leak into the surrounding soils progressive denitrification is one of the possible processes to explain observed isotopic fractionation of both áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 gillham and cherry 1978 mariotti et al 1988 mcmahon and bÃ¶hlke 1996 aravena and robertson 1998 ostrom et al 1998 panno et al 2006 rivett et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 osaka et al 2018 however this hypothesis seems unlikely because we did not monitor any anoxic condition occurring in these particular locations and more certainly because these soil waters showed the highest no3 n 60 mg l 1 among all analyzed samples fig 6 an alternative explanation for this strong isotopic fractionation is the occurrence of intensive ammonia volatilization which is typically found in the farmlands affected by the spreading of urea and manures kreitler and jones 1975 wassenaar 1995 hÃ¶gberg 1997 robinson 2001 puig et al 2017 margalef marti et al 2021 urea is one of the major n bearing compounds composited in animal waste it can easily be hydrolyzed to ammonium eq 1 transformed to ammonia eq 2 and finally nitrified to nitrate the hydrolysis of urea increases ph which facilitates the loss of ammonia as gas by volatilization eq 3 kreitler and jones 1975 heaton 1986 1 co nh2 2 2h2o nh4 2co3 2 nh4 2co3 2h 2nh4 co2 h2o 3 nh4 oh nh3 h2o the overall reaction causes a substantial loss of ammonia which is more depleted in 15n relative to the ammonium in the solution phase as a result the ammonium with relatively enriched 15n is later nitrified resulting in 15n enriched nitrate that may have áº15nno3 20 kreitler and jones 1975 heaton 1986 widory et al 2004 puig et al 2017 margalef marti et al 2021 explaining our results we also detected high áº18ono3 values up to 13 from the soil samples near the manure storage sites compared to any other soil samples fig 4 suggesting that an additional process caused observed stable o isotopic fractionation we speculated that the nitrate might have been formed through nitrification by incorporating ambient soil waters that have experienced strong evaporation which causes enrichment of heavier 18o in the residue waters hsieh et al 1998 wingate et al 2008 it has been proposed that one third and two thirds of oxygen in no3 formed during nitrification are derived from atmospheric oxygen and ambient water respectively andersson and hooper 1983 hollocher 1984 yoshinari and wahlen 1985 bÃ¶hlke et al 1997 nejatijahromi et al 2019 here áº18ono3 values can be calculated with the following equation 4 áº18ono3 2 3áº18oh2o 1 3áº18oo2 where áº18oh2o is the water oxygen isotope ratio of the ambient water and áº18oo2 represents the atmospheric oxygen isotope ratio ca 23 bÃ¶hlke et al 1997 wexler et al 2012 nejatijahromi et al 2019 based on equation 4 and assuming that áº18oo2 is 23 the áº18o of hypothesized water in the manure piles can be calculated to be 7 9 showing an isotopic feature that was fractionated by evaporation from ambient water which generally shows áº18oh2o of around 9 to 3 nakasone et al 2021 in general temperature inside manure piles can increase up to 70 c during fermentation reactions mizota et al 2019 and nitrate minerals formed through a similar process have similar elevated áº18ono3 up to 10 mizota et al 2021 2022 okinawa prefecture 2022 these facts allow us to suggest that the elevated áº18ono3 values observed only in soils under the manure piles are due to strong evaporation process through n isotopic comparison between potential nitrogen sources and no3 in soils we have successfully defined the isotopic characteristics of three major source end members as follows nitrogen through the application of chemical fertilizers in particular farmlands áº15nno3 3 1 to 4 7 áº18ono3 4 4 to 0 9 mixed fertilizers in the normal farmlands áº15nno3 6 8 to 9 áº18ono3 0 8 to 2 7 and manure piles in the manure storage sites áº15nno3 18 1 to 20 áº18ono3 10 6 to 13 1 which correspond to general classification kendall 1998 based on the case of our current study setting we propose that this categorization of end members can effectively be used to identify the source of nitrate contamination in aquifer systems in certain conditions that áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 values of all groundwater samples fall within the range of those proposed end members fig 4 and isotopic fractionation due to denitrification in an anoxic environment could be negligible 5 2 source identification of the groundwater nitrate contamination groundwater samples are compared with soil samples that were classified into three different categories on the áº15nno3 versus áº18ono3 diagrams separately shown for komesu fig 6a and giza fig 6b areas in fig 6 most groundwater samples are plotted on the n isotopic ranges between the soils from normal farmlands and soils from manure storage sites this tendency is clearer in komesu than in the giza area therefore it is likely that manure was the major source of contamination besides the chemical fertilizers in the study area at the timing of our investigations a simple source mixing model is usually used for estimating detailed contributions from each contaminant widory et al 2005 norrman et al 2015 cejudo et al 2018 erostate et al 2018 lentz and lehrsch 2019 however this approach was not applicable in this study since all three end members are plotted on a linear array on the áº15nno3 versus áº18ono3 diagrams figs 4 and 6a and b moreover the concentration of no3 in the soils is a varying parameter and thus the mixing model could not be tested on the usual áº15nno3 versus no3 diagrams therefore we first applied a qualitative approach by comparing the Î´15nno3 data of groundwater samples with compositional ranges of each soil type involving all soil samples irrespective of whether it was collected from the komesu or giza area fig 6c f fig 6c f show that the samples with the highest no3 concentrations tend to have Î´15nno3 compositions in a range of soils from normal farmlands where the mixed fertilizers chemical fertilizers crops residue fertilizers and manure were applied fig 6c and d both for spatial sampling and seasonal sampling campaigns these diagrams also show that none of the samples fell on the Î´15nno3 compositions of soils from farmlands treated with chemical fertilizers dominantly fig 6c and d except two groundwater samples from the giza area wells g 4 and g 6 with relatively low no3 n concentrations around 5 mg l 1 fig 6d these results seem to be contradictive to previous reports agata et al 2001 yoshimoto et al 2011 nakano et al 2013 nakaya et al 2018 that concluded the groundwater nitrate contaminations in the study area are mainly caused by the application of chemical fertilizers in the farmlands our results are rather consistent with the recent shift in major sources of nitrogen loads from chemical fertilizers to livestock manures see section 2 4 the highest no3 n concentrations during seasonal sampling campaigns were recorded at well 41 from komesu and well g 5 from giza fig 6e and f the samples from well 41 showed relatively homogeneous isotope ratios and no3 concentrations fig 6e except for a plummet in concentration by dilution during the high water season fig 5 the homogenous isotope ratios suggest that intensive nitrogen loading from normal farmlands contributed to the aquifer constantly affecting well 41 wells 8 24 and g 23 exhibited similar seasonal behaviors in nitrate contamination with moderate concentrations fig 6e and f on the other hand samples from well g 5 showed wider ranges in both Î´15nno3 compositions and no3 concentrations figs 5 and 6d indicating the strong contribution of contaminants from multiple sources with variable intensity nitrate behavior based on the groundwater seasonal pattern implied groundwater from well 41 had diffused flow character while groundwater from well g 5 might be characterized by a faster flow that showed a quick response to the nitrogen loads from the surface in fig 6c f another plot tendency was observed for the groundwater samples that had higher áº15nno3 values 9 with decreased no3 concentrations this isotopic signature can only be explained by additional contribution from soils in the manure storage sites with the highest áº15nno3 values fig 6c and d assuming that it was not caused by isotopic fractionation during denitrification the results from the seasonal monitoring campaign provide additional insights into the mechanism of groundwater contamination in studied aquifers monthly monitoring results from wells 44 and n 15 showed an increasing tendency in áº15nno3 with a gain in no3 concentrations suggesting that the contamination was progressed by receiving an impact of nitrogen loads from soils in the manure storage sites both for komesu and giza areas fig 6e and f well g 7 exhibited a somewhat similar tendency however well 37 showed a reverse trend this can be explained by dilution in the rainy season in april 2013 and may 2014 fig 5 denitrification is not a reasonable explanation for the reverse trend though this groundwater well showed relatively low do throughout the year table s5 this interpretation is more clearly supported by the sample plot s tendency on the áº15nno3 versus no3 cl diagrams fig 7 which are often used for contamination source identification vystavna et al 2017 nejatijahromi et al 2019 yin et al 2020 and allow us to test three components mixing model we hypothesized some representative áº15nno3 and no3 cl molar ratio values of three end members taking distribution of sample plots on fig 7b and c we also understand that these hypothesized end compositions or ratios could be variable to some extents nevertheless at the given condition our mixing model roughly implies that 50 85 of nitrate was derived from manure piles at manure storage sites while mixed fertilizers from normal farmlands shared minimum impact ca 15 30 for four wells 37 44 g 7 and n 15 discussed in previous paragraphs fig 7b and c a similar plot tendency was observed in the results for the spatial sampling campaign for some samples fig 7a and a similar interpretation could be applicable we assume that the pollution from manure storage sites had a point source characteristic since they were distributed at only a few spots over the study area however there were no distinct systematic seasonal patterns on the intensity of this pollution fig 5 therefore we still could not trace particular seasonality in this type of pollution within our dataset tables s5 and s6 nevertheless our results demonstrated that nitrogen load from manure storage sites was an important contributor to groundwater nitrate contamination in the study area in addition to the application of chemical fertilizers application of organic fertilizers including crops residue compost and manure in normal farmlands seem to have the least impact on the groundwater nitrate contamination as it has an advantage from an environmental protection point of view 5 3 comparison of nitrate contamination behavior between the komesu and giza areas we have characterized differences in the hydrogeological systems between komesu and giza subsurface dammed aquifers the giza area has a more dynamic groundwater flow with a steeper hydraulic gradient than the komesu area fig 3 which is placed on relatively flat terrain toward a coast only the giza subsurface dam leads groundwater to keep outflowing throughout the year while the waters are not overflowing from the komesu subsurface dam during low water season we expected those hydrogeological differences might generate contrast in the manner of contaminated water accumulation however a significant difference in frequency distribution on no3 n concentrations were not recognized between the two subsurface dam settings and a slightly higher median value was observed in the komesu area fig 8 a thus the difference in hydrogeological structures might not be a key function that controls the contaminated groundwater behavior some unique patterns in contaminated groundwater behavior were observed on the spatial distributional map fig 3b in which high no3 n concentrations were often seen near the upstream side of the cut off wall and major ne sw faults that were more common in the komesu area it implies that contaminated groundwaters tend to be gathered near structural barriers where waters with dissolved materials keep being held regardless of whether these structures were built by human construction or natural geological events our findings correspond to the results from miyako island in okinawa where the groundwater no3 n concentrations surged after the construction of the sunagawa subsurface dam in 1993 and the highest values were characteristically distributed near the cut off wall in 2000 ishida et al 2011 the groundwater samples from spatial sampling campaigns show komesu area tended to have higher Î´15nno3 values than the giza area fig 8b komesu area had groundwater with Î´15nno3 values more than 10 while none of the groundwater exceeded this value in the giza area according to our isotopic fingerprinting assessment it can be explained that the komesu area received more contaminants from soils in the manure storage sites than the giza area it seems to match our visual observation that these manure storage sites were more often seen in the komesu area than in the giza area some of these manure piles in the manure storage sites were placed directly on the ground or farmlands without any concrete or cover when they were stored we strongly recommend that the local farmers store their manure piles in proper conditions to prevent soil infiltration and seeping water from this high contaminant source into the groundwater to preserve groundwater quality 6 conclusions this study applied stable n and o isotope ratios to assess the cause of groundwater nitrate contamination in subsurface dammed limestone aquifers through isotopic comparison with possible nitrogen source materials these include chemical fertilizers crops residue fertilizers manure fertilizers manure from manure storage sites and soils associated with each fertilization log the results of our study successfully demonstrated the importance of using the isotope ratios of soil samples taken from deeper soil profiles this is because they reflect homogeneous compositions after complex microbiological physical reactions have occurred in on topsoil in accordance with the conventional approach we recommend employing isotope ratios of soil samples as end members for source fingerprinting assessment along with the isotope compositions of potential nitrogen sources as a result of using soil samples as the updated isotopic references our study indicates that nitrogen input from manure piles at the manure storage sites is becoming a major cause of groundwater nitrate pollution in the studied aquifers besides the chemical fertilizers reported by the previous studies we strongly recommend taking proper action to improve conditions at manure storage sites moreover our findings suggest that those contaminated waters tended to gather near the geological structures and the cut off wall of the subsurface dams neither the komesu nor giza areas displayed distinctly different patterns of nitrate behavior although the komesu area was relatively more affected by contamination from the manure piles in the manure storage sites than the giza area anaerobic microbiological attenuation processes should be investigated through a deep study by applying multiple isotopes and genetic analysis in future work credit authorship contribution statement oktanius richard hermawan conceptualization investigation formal analysis writing original draft

2162,nitrate contamination of groundwater due to improper management of fertilizer application and controls during agricultural activities is an escalating worldwide issue numerous studies have reported similar contamination in the ryukyu limestone aquifer in the southern part of okinawa island the study area has a unique setting where the subsurface dams hold the groundwater behind their cut off walls probably holding contaminated waters this study provides updated insights on the source of contamination using stable n and o isotope ratios of dissolved nitrate áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 in the aquifer waters to propose a better reference in the source fingerprinting assessment a special emphasis was placed on the isotopic comparison between the fertilizers and farmland soils where the respective fertilizers were applied a total of 176 groundwater samples were collected from several spatial and monthly sampling campaigns for the purpose of source determination our isotopic comparison detected the enrichment of 15n of nitrate nitrogen in the soil samples after the application of both chemical fertilizers and manure due to nitrification and volatilization unlike results from previous studies the áº15nno3 compositions of most groundwater samples did not fall into the range of soils mainly controlled by chemical fertilizers from 3 to 5 but were comparable to the soils affected by mixed fertilizers including both chemical fertilizers and manure from 7 to 9 the soils beneath untreated manure storage sites characterized by the highest áº15nno3 values from 18 to 20 affected some groundwater which shows an even higher value 9 the contaminated waters tend to be gathered close to the subsurface dams and this tendency did not differ between two subsurface dam settings komesu and giza however due to more impact from manure storage sites the groundwater in the komesu area tends to show slightly higher Î´15nno3 values than those in the giza area our study demonstrated the usefulness of soil samples for precise isotopic source identification in farmland areas keywords nitrate pollution stable isotopes groundwater limestone aquifer okinawa data availability i have shared the data that we use for this research in the form of supplementary tables s1 to s6 1 introduction groundwater nitrate contamination is one of the most widespread watershed contamination problems globally e g gillham and cherry 1978 ronen et al 1983 spalding and exner 1991 cook and herczeg 2000 galloway 2003 rivett et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 ward et al 2018 romanelli et al 2020 yin et al 2020 the no3 n concentration does not usually exceed 3 mg l 1 in natural aquatic environments burkart and kolpin 1993 except in areas with certain geological conditions lowe and wallace 1999a min et al 2002 stadler et al 2008 among several types of aquifers karst or limestone aquifers are one of the most vulnerable systems to this type of pollution because of their high transmissibility field 1988 buzek et al 1998 bakalowicz 2005 stevanoviÄ 2015 husic et al 2020 yin et al 2020 kalvÄns et al 2021 identifying the source of nitrogen that causes pollution particularly in such fields is a fundamental countermeasure that can be employed as quickly as possible agricultural activity is one of the major activities that cause contamination but it is often difficult to precisely pinpoint the principal causes due to their non point source characteristics besides chemical fertilizers nitrogen is largely released through multiple sources from organic compounds such as crops residue fertilizers livestock manure manure piles house effluent within farmlands and their mixtures with somewhat similar isotopic signatures e g aravena et al 1993 aravena and robertson 1998 lowe and wallace 1999a vitÃ²ria et al 2004 widory et al 2004 bateman and kelly 2007 hristov et al 2009 szpak 2014 minet et al 2017 kim et al 2019 margalef marti et al 2021 which is often indistinguishable by simple tracer applications thus an appropriate approach for this assessment should be developed urgently stable n and o isotopic tracers represent one of the most advantageous tools available in geochemistry to investigate the source of nitrogen oxides e g aravena and robertson 1998 kendall 1998 kendall and doctor 2003 kendall et al 2008 umezawa et al 2008 xue et al 2012 hosono et al 2013 minet et al 2017 ogrinc et al 2019 yin et al 2020 it becomes more powerful if it is combined with other isotopes e g clark and fritz 1997 aravena and robertson 1998 vitÃ²ria et al 2004 widory et al 2004 otero et al 2009 xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2014 puig et al 2017 torres martÃ­nez et al 2020 or other parameters e g bÃ¶hlke and denver 1995 katz and griffin 2008 norrman et al 2015 erostate et al 2018 carrey et al 2021 however the dual n and o stable isotope ratios of dissolved nitrate expressed hereafter as Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 respectively remain as the most fundamental tool for identifying the cause of groundwater nitrate pollution since it is a direct tracer of nitrate itself many researchers have measured Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values in groundwater samples and compared them directly with values of potential nitrogen sources to estimate possible contamination sources on the other hand it is notable that Î´15n values of loading materials are altered during the transformation of nitrogen compounds that generally occurs in the upper 50 cm of soils on the surface e g persson and wirÃ©n 1995 craine et al 2015 osaka et al 2018 hyodo et al 2021 therefore it may bring some errors in source identification if one solely refers to the isotopic values of potential nitrogen sources directly wassenaar 1995 fogg et al 1998 brunet et al 2011 such alteration could happen even on karst or limestone aquifers with a thin layer of their topsoils therefore it seems more important to consider the isotopic compositions of soil pore waters as source indicators together with the potential nitrogen sources there are not many works that carefully consider this distinct point we think it is a crucial problem to be addressed to possibly establish proper fingerprinting assessment in agricultural fields with the application of mixed source loading previous studies have documented nitrate groundwater contamination caused by intense agricultural activities in the ryukyu limestone aquifers in southern okinawa island agata et al 2001 yoshimoto et al 2007 nakano et al 2013 nakaya et al 2018 the increased agricultural practices induced a huge amount of groundwater extraction in the study area fig 1 two subsurface dams komesu and giza were constructed in 2005 to maintain sustainable water sources and food production okinawa general bureau 2006 both subsurface dams are located in contrasting hydrogeological settings the komesu area is on a flat coastal land while the giza area is on a higher terrain and the groundwater is discharged from the coastal cliff fig 2 yoshimoto et al 2011 nakaya et al 2018 the komesu subsurface dam is extraordinary since it is the first full scale subsurface dam construction to prevent saltwater intrusion in japan nawa and miyazaki 2009 the groundwater from the giza area is partly used for drinking purposes thus identifying the source of nitrate contamination in this area is important considering the abovementioned unique settings it has been suggested that the major nitrate contaminant source in the southern okinawa area is chemical fertilizers from crop farming mainly sugarcane commodities fig 1b agata et al 2001 yoshimoto et al 2007 2011 nakaya et al 2018 a contribution of domestic wastewater was also reported in the residential areas at the local scale yoshimoto et al 2011 however it is also confirmed that livestock manure has been increasingly applied to promote the environmentally friendly farming campaign by the okinawa government ministry of agriculture 2003 okinawa prefecture 2008 although its impact on groundwater contamination has not been evaluated in detail in addition untreated manure piles lying just near the farmlands without any protections which are placed on site until just before the application might affect groundwater quality therefore more systematic source identification of groundwater contamination based on spatial sampling and seasonal monitoring should be performed considering these new possible contamination sources the main goal of this study is to characterize Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 compositions of soil pore waters from different land use settings and to demonstrate the soil samples are an advantageous reference as end members for fingerprinting assessment of the groundwater nitrate contamination compared to direct measurement of potential nitrogen source materials in this study we obtained both potential nitrogen source materials chemical fertilizers crops residue fertilizers and livestock manure and soils from each individual farmland with different fertilization logs and settings in the study area in addition to groundwater samples fig 1 based on the fingerprinting assessment we will address the distinct sources and behavior of nitrate contamination behind subsurface dams represented by two dam catchments with different hydrogeological settings in southern okinawa 2 study area 2 1 topography and climate the study area is located in the southern part of okinawa island fig 1a based on the municipality the survey was conducted in itoman city 46 6 km2 and yaese town 26 9 km2 the total population in itoman city and yaese town in 2020 are 60 704 and 30 681 respectively okinawa prefecture 2020 topographically the area consists of a series of coastal marine terraces the landform of the ryukyu limestone is represented by mesa and cuesta takayasu 1978 the climate is categorized as humid subtropical according to the kÃ¶ppen climate classification the average annual rainfall and mean air temperature from 1978 to 2018 are 2 004 mm and 21 2 c respectively according to the itokazu weather radar station in nanjo city one of the nearest stations to our study area japan meteorology agency jma 2018 most of the rainfall occurs in the rainy season may june and the typhoon season july september yoshimoto et al 2013 2 2 geology the basement rocks of the ryukyu limestone are mainly composed of permian to neogene sedimentary rocks fig 2a in the southern part the sedimentary basement rocks are categorized as the shimajiri group the shimajiri group has a thickness of more than 2000 m that consists of thick siltstone with intercalations of sandstone and tuff fukuta et al 1971 a pleistocene ryukyu limestone terrace in the southern part of okinawa island unconformably overlays the shimajiri group of miocene pliocene age fig 2b takayasu 1978 ishida et al 2003 odawara et al 2005 sagae et al 2012 nakaya et al 2018 the limestone in this area is composed of uplifted coral reefs and foraminifera fossils this terrace is separated into several permeable blocks by conjugate fault systems figs 2 and 3 these fault systems generally show ne sw and nw se orientations along the fault scarps the limestone has been altered and recrystallized odawara et al 2005 sagae et al 2012 yoshimoto et al 2013 nakaya et al 2018 2 3 hydrogeology groundwater in the southern okinawa region is recharged by precipitation over most of the surface land in the study area and the northern hilly area then it flows along the topographical gradient through the pores and conduits of the ryukyu limestone above the impermeable shimajiri group the aquifer in the study area is categorized as an unconfined aquifer and has a thickness of around 60 80 m as faults act as hydrogeological boundaries aquifer systems of the limestone terraces are subdivided by each block as an individual groundwater basin fig 3 okinawa general bureau 2006 yoshimoto et al 2011 yamanaka 2012 according to furukawa et al 1976 the study area consists of two groundwater basins komesu and giza figs 1 3 these two basins have an area of 9 0 km2 and 5 2 km2 respectively each subsurface dam was constructed along the coast in order to hold the groundwater inside each basin the komesu subsurface dam is 2 3 km in length and 60 80 m in depth while the giza subsurface dam has a smaller size of 1 2 km in length and 30 40 m in depth fig 1b okinawa general bureau 2006 the ryukyu limestone aquifers have several caves and caverns with rapid groundwater flow hence conduit type fracture flow exists in the study area on the other hand shoji et al 1999 and momii et al 2003 simulated the groundwater flow systems of the aquifers using numerical models based on darcy s law with the assumption that diffuse type flow matrix flow could be applied on a regional scale however it is still difficult to accurately explain whole groundwater flow systems in the ryukyu limestone aquifers and to develop a well reproduced simulation model is still challenging yoshimoto et al 2011 suggested from well sensibility tests that both fracture and matrix flows exist in the study area 2 4 land use according to geospatial information authority of japan gsi 2006 the major land use in the study area is agriculture 51 which has continued for a few decades fig 1b sugarcane is the dominant crop fig 1b additionally residential areas 22 are distributed along and around the main roads forests 21 are distributed mainly along the fault scarps figs 1 and 3 other areas are dominated by uncultivated land and public property due to urbanization land use has gradually shifted from agricultural fields to residential areas yoshimoto et al 2011 yoshimoto et al 2013 additionally although sugarcane is still the most cultivated commodity vegetable and flower farming have become important agricultural practices after sugarcane ministry of agriculture 2015 the number of livestock farms peaked around 1990 most of the livestock farms are located near the agricultural area the number of cattle cows hogs and chickens in itoman city and yaese town in 2015 was 437 154 28 842 and 1 171 respectively ministry of agriculture 2015 okinawa prefecture 2003a okinawa prefecture 2006a okinawa prefecture 2006b recommends that 0 22 kg m 2 of nitrogen to be applied yearly for cultivation of sugarcane vegetables and flowers they recommend organic fertilizers such as compost to be applied in addition to chemical fertilizers law for promoting the introduction of sustainable agricultural production practices passed the local bill in 1999 and it recommends farmers to apply composts to improve soil quality instead of chemical fertilizers along with a guideline on a national scale ministry of agriculture 2003 accordingly increased livestock farming activities enhanced the production and application of more manure waste after 2000 it is important to note that untreated manure piles are placed on several fallow lands just near the farmlands without any coverings especially in the komesu area and thus it might contribute to groundwater contamination yoshimoto et al 2011 described livestock manure and chemical fertilizers are the two major nitrogen potential sources in the research area nitrogen loads from chemical fertilizers peaked in 1990 and then declined until recently 64 3 kg ha 1 in 2005 due to a decrease in agricultural farming areas however nitrogen loads from livestock manure in itoman city rather increased from 85 8 kg ha 1 in 1980 to 171 6 kg ha 1 in 2005 given that itoman city and yaese town have similar land use patterns and agricultural policies the livestock manure became the largest potential nitrogen source in the study area during the early 21st century in 2010 the nitrogen load through application of fertilizers was 7 7 kg ha 1 in itoman city and 10 6 kg ha 1 in yaese town while the load from livestock manure was 21 2 kg ha 1 in itoman city and 28 1 kg ha 1 in yaese town ministry of agriculture 2010 supporting the above explanation 2 5 soil properties soils in the study area are locally classified as red yellow soils or one sub order of entisols of united states department of agriculture usda comprehensive soil classification systems soil survey staff usda 1999 sedentary soils developed on the ryukyu limestone are characterized by heavy clay texture i e the clay less than 2 Î¼m in diameter content of fine earth passed through 2 mm in diameter exceeds 70 by weight due to their poor tilth the plow layer 15 cm deep is widely top dressed by crushed mudstones carried from neighboring areas consisting of miocene strata of the shimajiri group major clay minerals which possibly regulate the dynamics of the applied nitrogen nutrition are vermiculite or micaceous smectite by which ammonium is selectively retained by their specific adsorption the content of organic carbon in the plow layer is normally low in the range of less than 1 by weight 3 methods 3 1 groundwater sampling the sampling locations of this study are displayed in fig 1b groundwater samples were collected from 50 drilled wells of which 35 and 15 are located in the komesu and giza areas respectively those drilled wells were installed to monitor groundwater levels and quality before and after the dam construction the wells are multi screened at various depths between 8 and 55 m tables s1 and s2 we conducted a total of 4 sampling campaigns with different coverage and purposes the first sampling campaign was held in november 2012 in the komesu area this campaign intended to gather general information regarding the spatial distribution of nitrate contamination we analyzed Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 in groundwater samples from 33 wells the following year a second campaign was conducted in the komesu area for groundwater chemical and isotopic monitoring purposes for 5 representative wells the samples were continuously collected monthly for 16 months from 2013 to 2014 the third sampling was performed in the giza area for this sampling groundwater samples were collected monthly for 12 months from 2017 to 2018 from 4 selected wells the fourth campaign was organized in the giza area to seek spatial features of groundwater characteristics and samples were collected from 15 wells in august 2020 here the first and fourth samplings are defined as spatial sampling whereas the second and third samplings are defined as seasonal sampling in total 176 groundwater samples were analyzed of which 48 were from spatial samplings and 128 were from seasonal samplings a portable global positioning system gps device was used to plot the coordinates of the sampling points in the field groundwater levels were measured using a handy water level sensor the groundwater table contour map was generated by applying kriging interpolation method based on our direct measurement during the spatial sampling campaign groundwater samples were collected by an electrical pump the groundwater samples were pumped from the depth of 5 10 m below the hydraulic head in the komesu area considering the depth profiles of the groundwater chemistry as shown in the results section while the samples were pumped at the middle depth of the wells in the giza area tables s1 and s2 water samples from wells were pumped into plastic buckets and purged until the temperature ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp values became stable samples for isotopic and chemical analyses were stored in 50 ml and 100 ml polyethylene bottles respectively after filtering using a 0 2 Âµm membrane filter the ph ec do and orp values were measured using portable instruments sc82 yokogawa electric co japan and d 25 horiba ltd japan the ph was measured using a glass electrode orp was measured as the potential difference between a pt electrode and an ag agcl reference electrode and do was measured using a do electrode tip do tip 5401 horiba ltd 3 2 samples for soil and potential nitrogen source materials we collected 11 soil samples fig 1b from farmlands assuming the water soluble fraction in the soil is a proper proxy to evaluate the source of contamination based on the direct observations in the field we collected soils with different agricultural logs as follows the soils which were dominantly treated with chemical fertilizers that are typically found in fruit farms albeit a small mixture of manure could not be avoided the soils from available farmlands treated with livestock manures and multiple fertilizers including chemical crops residue and manure fertilizers and the soils near the manure storage site we collected 1 kg of soil samples from a depth below 60 cm using a hand auger from each farmland considering the possible occurrence of microbial processes at the upper 50 cm e g persson and wirÃ©n 1995 craine et al 2015 osaka et al 2018 yin et al 2020 margalef marti et al 2021 the reactions of which can possibly lead to isotopic fractionation this was an attempt to obtain appropriate isotopic reference values of each source material after the reactions in the topsoils had been completed and before being vertically transported to deeper aquifers the collected soil samples were taken back to the laboratory and their water contents were measured by comparing the weight of the original samples and the dried samples afterwards 100 g of each sample was mixed with 1000 ml of distilled water for 48 h to extract soluble fractions in the soil then the samples were filtered by a 0 2 Âµm membrane filter for chemical and isotopic analysis potential nitrogen source materials including chemical fertilizers n 5 crops residue fertilizers n 4 manure fertilizers n 2 and fresh manure in a representative manure storage site n 1 were obtained or directly collected from the field which correspond to all possible fertilizers that local farmers use in the research area the detailed types of chemical fertilizers are listed in table s3 the chemical fertilizers were pulverized with an agate mortar and the powdered samples were dissolved into 50 ml ultrapure water these water samples were filtered with a 0 2 Âµm membrane filter organic materials were dried at 80 c in the oven for 24 h and powdered using an agate mortar and then the powdered samples were used for isotopic analysis 3 3 analytical methods major ion concentrations were analyzed using ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland the Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values were determined using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 the denitrifier method relies on the isotope ratio analysis of nitrous oxide produced from sample nitrate by cultured denitrifying bacteria that lack n2o reductase activity this method has several steps including the preparation of denitrifier cultures and the conversion of samples into nitrous oxide schematically the n2o was obtained from the sample using helium carrier gas purified using cryogenic trapping precon system thermo fisher scientific usa separated chromatographically gas bench ii thermo fisher scientific usa and analyzed using mass spectrometry delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific usa the ratios of 15n 14n and 18o 16o were compared relative to atmospheric nitrogen and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow respectively the calibration of isotopic values maintained the united states geological society usgs and international atomic energy agency iaea internationally recognized nitrate standards usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea n3 based on replicate measurements of standards and samples the analytical precision for Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 were better than 0 2 and 0 3 respectively nitrogen stable isotope ratios of organic materials such as manure and crops residue fertilizers were determined using a continuous flow gas ratio mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific usa interfaced with an elemental analyzer flash 2000 thermo fisher scientific usa international standard materials such as nbs123 and several carbon bearing materials l alanine and iaea 600 were used for calibration and quality checks the precision of Î´15n analyses was generally better than 0 2 based on replicated measurements of standards and samples all analyzed hydrochemical and isotopic data for all samples are provided in tables s1 s6 4 results 4 1 groundwater flows the dam controlled hydrogeological settings differ significantly between the komesu and giza areas fig 3a the aquifer systems in the komesu area developed at lower altitudes with average groundwater levels of 10 6 m above sea level asl compared with those of the giza area at 40 6 m asl the density of contour lines of the groundwater table in the komesu area are sparser than in the giza area with a higher hydraulic gradient fig 3a this suggests that the groundwater flow in the komesu area is rather sluggish compared to that in the giza area where the flow is faster and more dynamic the giza intake dam is located on the coastal cliff and the elevation of its heads generally exceeds 20 m asl following its relatively steep water flow gradient the groundwater always flows out the intake dam through the annual hydrological cycle in contrast the komesu subsurface dam tends to hold and prevent the groundwater from outflowing over the intake wall during the low water season though groundwater is generally outflowing over the dam head ca 7 m asl in the high water season nawa and miyazaki 2009 yoshimoto et al 2013 these two different dam structures manifest distinct groundwater discharging patterns into the sea 4 2 hydrochemical features hydrochemical features based on major ion concentrations of the groundwater samples from all spatial sampling campaigns were expressed using a stiff diagram fig 3a as expected the major water quality type prevalent in the ryukyu limestone aquifers was the ca hco3 type the other water types were found mainly near the shoreline outside the intake wall of the komesu subsurface dam of these most samples showed ca so4 and ca cl water types most likely due to the mixing of the saline component while one well water well 6 with ec values of 2 660 Âµs cm 1 showed na cl water type due to clear saltwater intrusion fig 3a we confirmed the subsurface dam efficiently blocked seawater intrusion and is capable of holding freshwaters for the use of irrigation purposes as many other researchers have reported nawa and miyazaki 2009 yoshimoto et al 2011 2013 nakaya et al 2018 4 3 nitrogen concentrations the distribution of nitrate concentrations of groundwater samples from all spatial samplings is presented in fig 3b groundwater with a high nitrate concentration was found typically in the discharge area near the subsurface dams in both the komesu and giza areas and also near geological structures in some locations fig 3b for the spatial sampling the average no3 n concentration was 7 2 mg l 1 with values varying from 2 4 to 14 9 mg l 1 for all 47 samples the observed variation implies that the nitrate contamination had a broad heterogeneity across the basin among them 6 of 32 from komesu and 2 of 15 from giza areas observation wells surpassed the no3 n concentration of the world health organization who drinking water standard 10 mg l 1 world health organization who 2017 the mean no3 n concentrations were slightly higher in 32 wells in the komesu area 7 6 mg l 1 than in 15 wells in the giza area 6 5 mg l 1 we have measured nitrate concentration at multiple depths for selected wells fig s1 and confirmed that it generally showed a stable vertical profile irrespective of location thus we assume that the observed spatial distributional pattern in nitrate concentrations fig 3b is a good representative regardless of the depth in the studied unconfined limestone aquifers although there might be some exceptions since we did not check all of the groundwater wells in this study we hypothesize that dissolved nitrate in the aquifer travels along the lateral groundwater flow with a relatively well mixed characteristic in which nitrate nitrogen is loaded on the surface and transported vertically by soil water percolation to reach the saturated zone it is also notable that nh4 concentration was depleted generally 0 01 mg l 1 or under the detection limit for both soil and groundwater samples suggesting that the majority of microbial nitrification was completed in topsoil environments after nitrogen was loaded onto the agricultural farmlands there were some depleted nitrate concentrations as shown by the green circles in fig 3b among the highest concentrations we realized that some aquifer waters with low no3 n typically less than 2 5 mg l 1 were in anoxic conditions confirmed by their low do values below 2 0 mg l 1 table s1 these waters were typically found in the komesu area at 6 borehole locations reduced microbial activities are generally rare in the fast flow limestone aquifer systems such as the ryukyu limestone however since the low do condition is a favorable environment for the occurrence of denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 rivett et al 2008 hong et al 2019 that changes Î´15nno3 and Î´18ono3 values in groundwater due to isotopic fractionation gillham and cherry 1978 mariotti et al 1988 mcmahon and bÃ¶hlke 1996 aravena and robertson 1998 panno et al 2006 rivett et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 osaka et al 2018 we removed the data from these groundwater samples from the following discussion to avoid the possibility of misinterpretation in our source fingerprinting assessment 4 4 n and o isotope ratios based on the spatial sampling the áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 of groundwater samples in the whole area varied from 4 to 13 5 and from 1 4 to 8 2 respectively fig 4 and fig s2 the komesu area had slightly higher ranges of áº15nno3 and áº18o no3 from 5 9 to 13 5 and from 1 6 to 8 2 respectively compared to the giza area áº15nno3 4 to 9 6 and áº18ono3 1 4 to 4 1 the five chemical fertilizer samples showed áº15n values ranging from 2 2 to 2 1 fig 4 while four crops residue fertilizer samples had slightly higher áº15n ranging between 1 9 and 4 5 the fresh manure and manure fertilizers had the highest áº15n among all analyzed potential nitrogen sources ranging from 9 9 to 11 8 n 3 for the soil samples the analytical results table s4 fall into three isotopically different categories depending on their fertilization logs regardless of the komesu and giza areas fig 4 first the farmland soils with a dominant application of chemical fertilizers displayed the lowest áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 ranging from 3 1 to 4 7 and from 4 4 to 0 9 respectively second the soils from farmlands where a mixture of all kinds of fertilizers could be applied defined as normal farmlands showed intermediate áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 compositions ranging from 6 8 to 9 and from 0 8 to 2 7 respectively lastly the soils from the manure storage sites exhibited distinctively elevated áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 ranging from 18 1 to 20 and from 10 6 to 13 1 respectively our results showed a gradual increase in isotope ratios from chemical fertilizers through crops residue fertilizers to fresh manure both for potential nitrogen sources and relevant soil samples fig 4 additionally systematic 15n isotopic enrichment was confirmed between potential nitrogen sources and soil samples fig 4 these detailed characterizations on possible contamination sources are useful for proper isotopic fingerprinting assessment through comparison with groundwater samples of our concern which will be discussed later 4 5 seasonal variations the groundwater levels at the monitoring wells were relatively stable fluctuating by approximately 1 m through the annual hydrological cycle except for wells 37 41 and 44 which showed a sharp response increasing up to 5 m to heavy rain over 500 mm month in may rainy season in the komesu area fig 5 after the quick water level rise it tended to return to its base level in 2 3 months interestingly these wells are located just behind the structural boundaries in the upgradient areas in komesu fig 3 where the natural faults play an important role as a hydrogeological structure that holds groundwater during high water season these water level fluctuations were not found in the giza area nitrate concentrations were rather stable regardless of monitoring sites except for three specific wells wells 41 44 and g 5 which showed unique patterns fig 5 that will be explained later the average no3 n concentration of all samples from monitoring sampling campaigns in the komesu area n 78 was 9 5 mg l 1 with values varying from 3 9 to 17 mg l 1 while in the giza area n 47 it was 14 8 mg l 1 with a range between 4 5 and 39 4 mg l 1 the average no3 n concentrations of each well during seasonal sampling n 16 for each well for komesu and n 12 for each well for giza were as follows 9 0 8 mg l 1 for well 8 8 7 1 8 mg l 1 for well 24 7 5 1 6 mg l 1 for well 37 14 9 1 7 mg l 1 for well 41 7 3 1 3 mg l 1 for well 44 27 3 6 4 mg l 1 for well g 5 12 4 1 9 mg l 1 for well g 7 8 3 0 9 mg l 1 for well g 23 and 11 1 2 4 mg l 1 for well n 15 most samples showed do values greater than 2 mg l 1 and did not show anaerobic nitrate reduction tendency mcmahon and chapelle 2008 clune and denver 2012 for wells 41 and 44 the no3 n concentrations decreased in may fig 5 which can be explained by dilution because of heavy rainfall this effect is maintained by their unique hydrogeological setting as mentioned earlier that the structure can hold much diluted rainwater particularly in the high water season distinctively elevated nitrate concentrations were found in well g 5 in the giza area where no3 n concentrations exceeded the who drinking water standard throughout the year av 27 3 mg l 1 n 12 and showed clear seasonal changes fig 5 possibly reflecting the timing of nitrogen loads applied on the land surface the áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 of groundwater samples from all monitoring campaigns ranged between 6 8 and 11 8 and 0 3 and 6 6 respectively the average áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 for all samples in the komesu area were 9 and 3 5 respectively n 76 while those in the giza area were 8 2 and 3 9 respectively n 47 the explanation for the observed changes in áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 data from monitoring campaigns will be discussed along with no3 n concentrations in the following section 5 discussion 5 1 n isotopic comparison between potential nitrogen sources and no3 in soils the n isotope ratio of potential nitrogen sources dissolved or mineralized in farmland soils mostly in the form of nh4 modifies its composition through various biological microbiological and physical processes in a topsoil environment e g kreitler 1979 wassenaar 1995 mcmahon and bÃ¶hlke 1996 robinson 2001 kelley et al 2013 szpak 2014 craine et al 2015 most typically occurring at depths shallower than 50 cm persson and wirÃ©n 1995 craine et al 2015 osaka et al 2018 yin et al 2020 hyodo et al 2021 margalef marti et al 2021 these processes include uptake and assimilation by plants nitrification and volatilization feigin et al 1974 kreitler and jones 1975 heaton 1986 hÃ¶gberg 1997 ostrom et al 1998 mengis et al 2001 robinson 2001 widory et al 2004 szpak 2014 puig et al 2017 lentz and lehrsch 2018 osaka et al 2018 which increase Î´15n of the residue materials up to 60 e g feigin et al 1974 clark and fritz 1997 robinson 2001 szpak 2014 puig et al 2017 margalef marti et al 2021 it is also well recognized that the vertical soil profile commonly shows great variability in áº15nno3 for the upper ca 50 cm due to the multiple processes mentioned above but it becomes stable in deeper unsaturated soils persson and wirÃ©n 1995 craine et al 2015 lentz and lehrsch 2018 osaka et al 2018 hyodo et al 2021 margalef marti et al 2021 therefore dissolved nitrate passing through the upper critical soil zone is vertically transported and reaches shallow aquifers without changing its áº15nno3 composition if active denitrification reaction does not take place during infiltration gebauer and dietrich 1993 nadelhoffer and fry 1994 persson and wirÃ©n 1995 wassenaar 1995 spoelstra et al 2007 beeckman et al 2018 these previous works suggest that n isotopic source identification of groundwater contamination may make a mistake if one directly uses potential nitrogen sources as isotopic end members some previous studies provided additional key information supporting the benefit of using soil samples as isotopic source indicators for example fogg et al 1998 reported that soil Î´15nno3 could be characterized based on the difference in fertilization logs the result of Î´15nno3 differed between soils with the application of chemical fertilizers 4 7 5 4 n 148 and animal waste 14 8 8 n 42 similarly wassenaar 1995 described that soils with the application of synthetic ammonium fertilizers showed áº15nno3 values ranging from 1 5 to 0 6 n 6 while those affected by manure had higher áº15nno3 values ranging from 7 9 to 8 6 n 3 non contaminated soils displayed áº15nno3 values ranging from 3 5 to 4 9 n 3 observed systematic variations in soil áº15nno3 following land use types suggest that soil samples can be used as end member compositions although these previous works did not show áº15n of potential nitrogen sources and did not discuss isotopic fractionation between potential nitrogen sources and soils which might differ depending on climate conditions and soil properties in this study chemical fertilizers had áº15ntotal values ranging from 2 2 to 2 1 while the farmland soils with a dominant application of the same chemical fertilizers showed relatively higher áº15nno3 ranging from 3 1 to 4 7 fig 4 resulting in 15n isotopic enrichment up to 6 9 the isotopic enrichment observed is possibly due to the nitrification reaction in the topsoils gebauer and dietrich 1993 nadelhoffer and fry 1994 ostrom et al 1998 spoelstra et al 2007 margalef marti et al 2021 yu et al 2021 our results for soil áº15nno3 compositions correspond well to fogg et al 1998 on the other side the soils from the normal farmlands with a mixed application of chemical fertilizers and other organic fertilizers such as crops residue and manure fertilizers showed intermediate áº15nno3 compositions compared to the other farmlands fig 4 these results suggest their compositions were the results of both contributions from multiple source mixtures and the isotopic fractionation in the topsoil nevertheless we reasonably distinguished the isotopic feature of two major contaminant sources in agricultural farmlands for the manure storage site soil samples exhibited distinctively high áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 values showing isotopic fractionation of áº15nno3 up to 10 relative to fresh manure samples fig 4 at this specific point untreated manures were stacked into piles and directly exposed to the ground soil and therefore water reacting with these manures can easily leak into the surrounding soils progressive denitrification is one of the possible processes to explain observed isotopic fractionation of both áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 gillham and cherry 1978 mariotti et al 1988 mcmahon and bÃ¶hlke 1996 aravena and robertson 1998 ostrom et al 1998 panno et al 2006 rivett et al 2008 hosono et al 2013 osaka et al 2018 however this hypothesis seems unlikely because we did not monitor any anoxic condition occurring in these particular locations and more certainly because these soil waters showed the highest no3 n 60 mg l 1 among all analyzed samples fig 6 an alternative explanation for this strong isotopic fractionation is the occurrence of intensive ammonia volatilization which is typically found in the farmlands affected by the spreading of urea and manures kreitler and jones 1975 wassenaar 1995 hÃ¶gberg 1997 robinson 2001 puig et al 2017 margalef marti et al 2021 urea is one of the major n bearing compounds composited in animal waste it can easily be hydrolyzed to ammonium eq 1 transformed to ammonia eq 2 and finally nitrified to nitrate the hydrolysis of urea increases ph which facilitates the loss of ammonia as gas by volatilization eq 3 kreitler and jones 1975 heaton 1986 1 co nh2 2 2h2o nh4 2co3 2 nh4 2co3 2h 2nh4 co2 h2o 3 nh4 oh nh3 h2o the overall reaction causes a substantial loss of ammonia which is more depleted in 15n relative to the ammonium in the solution phase as a result the ammonium with relatively enriched 15n is later nitrified resulting in 15n enriched nitrate that may have áº15nno3 20 kreitler and jones 1975 heaton 1986 widory et al 2004 puig et al 2017 margalef marti et al 2021 explaining our results we also detected high áº18ono3 values up to 13 from the soil samples near the manure storage sites compared to any other soil samples fig 4 suggesting that an additional process caused observed stable o isotopic fractionation we speculated that the nitrate might have been formed through nitrification by incorporating ambient soil waters that have experienced strong evaporation which causes enrichment of heavier 18o in the residue waters hsieh et al 1998 wingate et al 2008 it has been proposed that one third and two thirds of oxygen in no3 formed during nitrification are derived from atmospheric oxygen and ambient water respectively andersson and hooper 1983 hollocher 1984 yoshinari and wahlen 1985 bÃ¶hlke et al 1997 nejatijahromi et al 2019 here áº18ono3 values can be calculated with the following equation 4 áº18ono3 2 3áº18oh2o 1 3áº18oo2 where áº18oh2o is the water oxygen isotope ratio of the ambient water and áº18oo2 represents the atmospheric oxygen isotope ratio ca 23 bÃ¶hlke et al 1997 wexler et al 2012 nejatijahromi et al 2019 based on equation 4 and assuming that áº18oo2 is 23 the áº18o of hypothesized water in the manure piles can be calculated to be 7 9 showing an isotopic feature that was fractionated by evaporation from ambient water which generally shows áº18oh2o of around 9 to 3 nakasone et al 2021 in general temperature inside manure piles can increase up to 70 c during fermentation reactions mizota et al 2019 and nitrate minerals formed through a similar process have similar elevated áº18ono3 up to 10 mizota et al 2021 2022 okinawa prefecture 2022 these facts allow us to suggest that the elevated áº18ono3 values observed only in soils under the manure piles are due to strong evaporation process through n isotopic comparison between potential nitrogen sources and no3 in soils we have successfully defined the isotopic characteristics of three major source end members as follows nitrogen through the application of chemical fertilizers in particular farmlands áº15nno3 3 1 to 4 7 áº18ono3 4 4 to 0 9 mixed fertilizers in the normal farmlands áº15nno3 6 8 to 9 áº18ono3 0 8 to 2 7 and manure piles in the manure storage sites áº15nno3 18 1 to 20 áº18ono3 10 6 to 13 1 which correspond to general classification kendall 1998 based on the case of our current study setting we propose that this categorization of end members can effectively be used to identify the source of nitrate contamination in aquifer systems in certain conditions that áº15nno3 and áº18ono3 values of all groundwater samples fall within the range of those proposed end members fig 4 and isotopic fractionation due to denitrification in an anoxic environment could be negligible 5 2 source identification of the groundwater nitrate contamination groundwater samples are compared with soil samples that were classified into three different categories on the áº15nno3 versus áº18ono3 diagrams separately shown for komesu fig 6a and giza fig 6b areas in fig 6 most groundwater samples are plotted on the n isotopic ranges between the soils from normal farmlands and soils from manure storage sites this tendency is clearer in komesu than in the giza area therefore it is likely that manure was the major source of contamination besides the chemical fertilizers in the study area at the timing of our investigations a simple source mixing model is usually used for estimating detailed contributions from each contaminant widory et al 2005 norrman et al 2015 cejudo et al 2018 erostate et al 2018 lentz and lehrsch 2019 however this approach was not applicable in this study since all three end members are plotted on a linear array on the áº15nno3 versus áº18ono3 diagrams figs 4 and 6a and b moreover the concentration of no3 in the soils is a varying parameter and thus the mixing model could not be tested on the usual áº15nno3 versus no3 diagrams therefore we first applied a qualitative approach by comparing the Î´15nno3 data of groundwater samples with compositional ranges of each soil type involving all soil samples irrespective of whether it was collected from the komesu or giza area fig 6c f fig 6c f show that the samples with the highest no3 concentrations tend to have Î´15nno3 compositions in a range of soils from normal farmlands where the mixed fertilizers chemical fertilizers crops residue fertilizers and manure were applied fig 6c and d both for spatial sampling and seasonal sampling campaigns these diagrams also show that none of the samples fell on the Î´15nno3 compositions of soils from farmlands treated with chemical fertilizers dominantly fig 6c and d except two groundwater samples from the giza area wells g 4 and g 6 with relatively low no3 n concentrations around 5 mg l 1 fig 6d these results seem to be contradictive to previous reports agata et al 2001 yoshimoto et al 2011 nakano et al 2013 nakaya et al 2018 that concluded the groundwater nitrate contaminations in the study area are mainly caused by the application of chemical fertilizers in the farmlands our results are rather consistent with the recent shift in major sources of nitrogen loads from chemical fertilizers to livestock manures see section 2 4 the highest no3 n concentrations during seasonal sampling campaigns were recorded at well 41 from komesu and well g 5 from giza fig 6e and f the samples from well 41 showed relatively homogeneous isotope ratios and no3 concentrations fig 6e except for a plummet in concentration by dilution during the high water season fig 5 the homogenous isotope ratios suggest that intensive nitrogen loading from normal farmlands contributed to the aquifer constantly affecting well 41 wells 8 24 and g 23 exhibited similar seasonal behaviors in nitrate contamination with moderate concentrations fig 6e and f on the other hand samples from well g 5 showed wider ranges in both Î´15nno3 compositions and no3 concentrations figs 5 and 6d indicating the strong contribution of contaminants from multiple sources with variable intensity nitrate behavior based on the groundwater seasonal pattern implied groundwater from well 41 had diffused flow character while groundwater from well g 5 might be characterized by a faster flow that showed a quick response to the nitrogen loads from the surface in fig 6c f another plot tendency was observed for the groundwater samples that had higher áº15nno3 values 9 with decreased no3 concentrations this isotopic signature can only be explained by additional contribution from soils in the manure storage sites with the highest áº15nno3 values fig 6c and d assuming that it was not caused by isotopic fractionation during denitrification the results from the seasonal monitoring campaign provide additional insights into the mechanism of groundwater contamination in studied aquifers monthly monitoring results from wells 44 and n 15 showed an increasing tendency in áº15nno3 with a gain in no3 concentrations suggesting that the contamination was progressed by receiving an impact of nitrogen loads from soils in the manure storage sites both for komesu and giza areas fig 6e and f well g 7 exhibited a somewhat similar tendency however well 37 showed a reverse trend this can be explained by dilution in the rainy season in april 2013 and may 2014 fig 5 denitrification is not a reasonable explanation for the reverse trend though this groundwater well showed relatively low do throughout the year table s5 this interpretation is more clearly supported by the sample plot s tendency on the áº15nno3 versus no3 cl diagrams fig 7 which are often used for contamination source identification vystavna et al 2017 nejatijahromi et al 2019 yin et al 2020 and allow us to test three components mixing model we hypothesized some representative áº15nno3 and no3 cl molar ratio values of three end members taking distribution of sample plots on fig 7b and c we also understand that these hypothesized end compositions or ratios could be variable to some extents nevertheless at the given condition our mixing model roughly implies that 50 85 of nitrate was derived from manure piles at manure storage sites while mixed fertilizers from normal farmlands shared minimum impact ca 15 30 for four wells 37 44 g 7 and n 15 discussed in previous paragraphs fig 7b and c a similar plot tendency was observed in the results for the spatial sampling campaign for some samples fig 7a and a similar interpretation could be applicable we assume that the pollution from manure storage sites had a point source characteristic since they were distributed at only a few spots over the study area however there were no distinct systematic seasonal patterns on the intensity of this pollution fig 5 therefore we still could not trace particular seasonality in this type of pollution within our dataset tables s5 and s6 nevertheless our results demonstrated that nitrogen load from manure storage sites was an important contributor to groundwater nitrate contamination in the study area in addition to the application of chemical fertilizers application of organic fertilizers including crops residue compost and manure in normal farmlands seem to have the least impact on the groundwater nitrate contamination as it has an advantage from an environmental protection point of view 5 3 comparison of nitrate contamination behavior between the komesu and giza areas we have characterized differences in the hydrogeological systems between komesu and giza subsurface dammed aquifers the giza area has a more dynamic groundwater flow with a steeper hydraulic gradient than the komesu area fig 3 which is placed on relatively flat terrain toward a coast only the giza subsurface dam leads groundwater to keep outflowing throughout the year while the waters are not overflowing from the komesu subsurface dam during low water season we expected those hydrogeological differences might generate contrast in the manner of contaminated water accumulation however a significant difference in frequency distribution on no3 n concentrations were not recognized between the two subsurface dam settings and a slightly higher median value was observed in the komesu area fig 8 a thus the difference in hydrogeological structures might not be a key function that controls the contaminated groundwater behavior some unique patterns in contaminated groundwater behavior were observed on the spatial distributional map fig 3b in which high no3 n concentrations were often seen near the upstream side of the cut off wall and major ne sw faults that were more common in the komesu area it implies that contaminated groundwaters tend to be gathered near structural barriers where waters with dissolved materials keep being held regardless of whether these structures were built by human construction or natural geological events our findings correspond to the results from miyako island in okinawa where the groundwater no3 n concentrations surged after the construction of the sunagawa subsurface dam in 1993 and the highest values were characteristically distributed near the cut off wall in 2000 ishida et al 2011 the groundwater samples from spatial sampling campaigns show komesu area tended to have higher Î´15nno3 values than the giza area fig 8b komesu area had groundwater with Î´15nno3 values more than 10 while none of the groundwater exceeded this value in the giza area according to our isotopic fingerprinting assessment it can be explained that the komesu area received more contaminants from soils in the manure storage sites than the giza area it seems to match our visual observation that these manure storage sites were more often seen in the komesu area than in the giza area some of these manure piles in the manure storage sites were placed directly on the ground or farmlands without any concrete or cover when they were stored we strongly recommend that the local farmers store their manure piles in proper conditions to prevent soil infiltration and seeping water from this high contaminant source into the groundwater to preserve groundwater quality 6 conclusions this study applied stable n and o isotope ratios to assess the cause of groundwater nitrate contamination in subsurface dammed limestone aquifers through isotopic comparison with possible nitrogen source materials these include chemical fertilizers crops residue fertilizers manure fertilizers manure from manure storage sites and soils associated with each fertilization log the results of our study successfully demonstrated the importance of using the isotope ratios of soil samples taken from deeper soil profiles this is because they reflect homogeneous compositions after complex microbiological physical reactions have occurred in on topsoil in accordance with the conventional approach we recommend employing isotope ratios of soil samples as end members for source fingerprinting assessment along with the isotope compositions of potential nitrogen sources as a result of using soil samples as the updated isotopic references our study indicates that nitrogen input from manure piles at the manure storage sites is becoming a major cause of groundwater nitrate pollution in the studied aquifers besides the chemical fertilizers reported by the previous studies we strongly recommend taking proper action to improve conditions at manure storage sites moreover our findings suggest that those contaminated waters tended to gather near the geological structures and the cut off wall of the subsurface dams neither the komesu nor giza areas displayed distinctly different patterns of nitrate behavior although the komesu area was relatively more affected by contamination from the manure piles in the manure storage sites than the giza area anaerobic microbiological attenuation processes should be investigated through a deep study by applying multiple isotopes and genetic analysis in future work credit authorship contribution statement oktanius richard hermawan conceptualization investigation formal analysis writing original draft

2163,although water table recessions associated with seasonal freezing have been widely reported the conditions that groundwater could respond to seasonal freezing are poorly known based on 30 records of winter time water table recessions reported in the literature we find the mean water table recession increases from sand to loam to silt to clay to obtain a quantitative understanding of the conditions of freezing induced groundwater migration and the role of soil texture we construct a one dimensional shaw model with a dynamic water table that could respond to winter time atmospheric conditions by simulating freezing induced groundwater migration under a series of pre freezing water table depths soil textures and freezing indices we find the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration i e the limit water table depth beyond which there is negligible freezing induced groundwater flow increases from coarse to fine soils and increases with freezing index moreover we find there is a good linear relationship between the distance from the freezing front to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration and the distance from the land surface to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth of evaporation induced groundwater migration for different soils to demonstrate the importance of defining extinction depth we also show the overestimation of freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone by the widely used fixed water table condition when the water table depth is shallower than the extinction depth this study has implications for future hydrologic and engineering studies in critical zones with a cold climate keywords cryosuction water table recession soil texture evaporation freezing index shaw data availability supplementary data to this article can be found online 1 introduction the vadose zone spanning from the land surface to the water table is the core element of the critical zone with active physical geochemical and biological processes hopmans and schoups 2005 arora et al 2019 seasonally frozen soils which widely occur in the northern hemisphere are important components of critical zones in cold regions evans et al 2018 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 zhang et al 2003 seasonal freezing and thawing processes not only control critical zone architecture anderson et al 2013 rempel et al 2016 but also affect water and energy cycles in the critical zone ireson et al 2013 rey et al 2021 due to the cryosuction near the freezing front water could be migrated from the underlying unsaturated and saturated zones to the freezing front williams and smith 1989 hohmann 1997 freezing induced groundwater migration and the resulting water table recession have been observed in many countries like the us daniel and staricka 2000 drescher 1955 meyer 1960 schneider 1961 canada ireson et al 2013 pan et al 2017 van der kamp et al 2003 sweden stÃ¤hli et al 1999 russia vinnikov et al 1996 and china lyu et al 2022 yi et al 2014 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 moreover by transporting water and dissolved ions from groundwater to seasonally frozen soils freezing induced groundwater migration would strengthen the possibilities of frost heave chamberlain 1981 bronfenbrener and bronfenbrener 2010 rui et al 2019 and soil salinization qin et al 2021 wang et al 2022 nevertheless there is still limited quantitative understanding of the conditions that groundwater can be migrated to seasonally frozen soils due to the importance of subsurface water to support vegetation in semi arid regions the study of soil water and groundwater migration towards the shallow part of the critical zone which is controlled by the atmospheric evaporative demand has received intensive research flammini et al 2017 federer et al 1996 kemp et al 1997 mastrocicco et al 2010 yu et al 2016 when the water table is shallow evaporation induced groundwater migration termed groundwater evaporation hereafter could result in diurnal or seasonal water table fluctuations white 1932 loheide et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 by comparing the evaporation rates under a series of water table depths gardner and fireman 1958 found that the evaporation rate decreases with deepening water table depth in the following decades field observations also showed the dependence of evaporation induced water table recession on initial water table depth hellwig 1973 xiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 therefore the concept of extinction depth has been widely employed to characterize whether groundwater evaporation is negligible baird and maddock 2005 heuvelmans 2010 liu et al 2015 mughal et al 2015 balugani et al 2017 ma et al 2019 namely when the water table depth is deeper than the extinction depth there is little groundwater evaporation when the water table depth is shallower than the extinction depth the groundwater evaporation rate increases with decreasing water table depth a numerical study revealed that the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation is highly dependent on soil texture shah et al 2007 the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation has become an important control variable in many groundwater models for example in the ets package banta 2000 and the evt package doble et al 2009 embedded in modflow as early as in the 1960 s field observations showed that only a shallow pre freezing water table depth is possible to cause freezing induced water table recession meyer 1960 indicating that pre freezing water table depth is critical for winter time water table recessions in the recent two decades numerical studies on how pre freezing water table depths control freezing induced groundwater migration attracted the interest of some researchers by assuming a fixed water table several studies showed that the flux of freezing induced groundwater migration decreases with deepening water table depth hansson and lundin 2006 alkhaier et al 2012 chen et al 2019 by using a dynamic water table that could respond to freezing some studies also showed that the magnitude of freezing induced water table recession decreases with deepening pre freezing water table depth cui et al 2020 xie et al 2021 following the concept of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation it is desirable to define the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration as a limit water table depth beyond which there is negligible freezing induced groundwater flow such a concept would be useful to decide whether groundwater should be considered in land surface models in cold regions the freezing index which is a measure of the severity of subfreezing temperatures experienced at a site is the most influential climatic factor controlling the frost depth frauenfeld et al 2004 for a specific pre freezing water table depth the freezing index indirectly determines the distance between the frost depth and the water table therefore the freezing index is an important climatic factor controlling interaction between seasonally frozen soils and groundwater by collecting 30 records of field measurements of winter time water table recessions in five countries fig 1 a table s1 the freezing index of which spans from 252 to 1815 days we find the magnitude of water table recession generally increases from sand to loam to silt to clay fig 1b namely the mean magnitude of water table recession equals 28 cm for sand 68 cm for loam 88 cm for silt and 114 cm for clay fig 1 these statistics indicate that soil texture is another important factor controlling freezing induced groundwater migration however the mechanism of how soil texture controls freezing induced groundwater migration and water table recessions is seldom studied in this study we first examine how pre freezing water table depth freezing index and soil texture influence freezing induced groundwater migration in 1d soil columns and then numerically obtain the frost depth and extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration both of which are functions of soil texture and freezing index the numerical results of the study lead to a clear understanding of conditions of interaction between seasonally frozen soils and groundwater 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model in seasonally frozen regions frost depth is controlled by such factors as freezing index e g frauenfeld et al 2004 snow cover e g iwata et al 2010 and soil texture e g hansson and lundin 2006 and winter time water table fluctuations are mainly controlled by lateral groundwater inflow outflow and freezing induced groundwater migration drescher 1955 ireson et al 2013 schneider 1961 xie et al 2021 to identify the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration we follow shah et al s 2007 approach of obtaining extinction depth of groundwater evaporation by using a 1 d model i e considering the response of water migration to atmospheric conditions in the vertical direction and neglecting others factors influencing the water budget or the water table fluctuations to exclude the influence of snow melting on water budget we neglect the occurrence of snowfall and snow cover in our model although the role of groundwater inflow outflow can be considered by setting a source sink in the 1d model e g xie et al 2021 due to the difficulty of determining rates of lateral groundwater inflow outflow we also neglect the budget of lateral groundwater flow by employing such simplifications we concentrate on how pre freezing water table depth freezing index and soil texture control freezing induced groundwater migration in our 1 d model we consider four scenarios of soil texture sand loam silt and clay filled in the soil columns the soil column has an atmospheric boundary condition at the top a no flow boundary condition at the bottom and has a dynamic water table that could respond to freezing and thawing specifically when the water table is shallow the water table in the 1 d column could decline as a result of freezing induced groundwater migration fig 2 a when the water table is deep freezing induced groundwater migration is minimal which results in a negligible water table recession fig 2b to emphasize the advantages of a dynamic water table we also introduce a 1d model with a fixed water table to quantify freezing induced groundwater migration which has been used in some previous studies chen et al 2019 hansson and lundin 2006 2 2 numerical model harlan 1973 developed the first numerical model of coupled heat fluid transport in partially frozen soils in the current study we choose the simultaneous heat and water shaw model flerchinger and saxton 1989 flerchinger 2017 which is a typical harlan type model and has the capability to treat 1 d soil columns with a dynamic water table in a recent study we used the shaw model to couple winter time atmospheric conditions ice formation in the frozen zone and water in the unsaturated and saturated zones which well reproduced the fluctuating liquid water content in the unsaturated zone and the fluctuating water table in a field site xie et al 2021 in the shaw model the advective heat transfer by liquid latent heat of fusion due to solid liquid phase change and latent heat transfer due to vapor liquid phase change are

is reduced linearly with ice content and is assumed to be zero when the available porosity is decreased to 0 13 flerchinger 2017 2 3 model inputs as pointed out in section 2 1 freezing index soil texture and pre freezing water table depth wtd0 are considered as three major factors influencing freezing induced water migration in the current study the upper limit of freezing index is determined based on the freezing indices along the boundaries between regions of perennially and seasonally frozen grounds zhang et al 2005 which equals around 3000 days the physical hydraulic and thermal properties of the four typical soils are shown in table 1 to be consistent with shah et al s 2007 numerical study of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation the van genuchten mualem parameters for the four typical soils are also taken from carsel and parrish 1988 the details on the source of these parameters can be found in carsel and parrish 1988 and are not repeated here fig 3 shows the relationship between matric suction and soil water content because the parameters for clay given in carsel and parrish 1988 were not based on pure clay and many textbooks claim that clay could have very high porosity we also conducted sensitivity analysis by changing Î¸s of clay into 0 50 m3 m 3 the thermal properties of each soil are calculated by using equations 2 and 3 the climate of new brunswick canada kurylyk et al 2014 which was considered as a typical climate for occurrence of seasonally frozen soils evans and ge 2017 is used as the base case climate for illustrating the effects of water table depth and soil texture on freezing induced groundwater migration the climate of moscow russia lokoshchenko et al 2017 with a lower winter time temperature is used for illustrating the control of freezing index on freezing induced groundwater migration the temporal distribution of the average daily air temperatures of the two regions is shown in fig 4 which is characterized by the following sinusoidal function 8 t t t ave t amp sin 2 Ï t 365 25 where t ave is the average of annual air temperature Î¸ t amp is the amplitude of annual air temperature Î¸ note that t 0 does not represent the beginning of a calendar year and t equals t ave at t 0 the freezing index a measure of the combined duration and magnitude of sub freezing temperatures in a given freezing season frauenfeld et al 2007 is calculated by 9 fi t 0 t 1 t d t t 0 where t 0 and t 1 represent the start and end of the cold season t in new brunswick t ave equals 5 and t amp equals 15 evans and ge 2017 kurylyk et al 2014 leading to a freezing index of 928 days in moscow russia t ave approximates to 5 and t amp equals 28 lokoshchenko et al 2017 corresponding to a freezing index of 2393 days fig 4 in the current study a wide range of freezing index ranging from 0 to 3000 days is obtained by fixing t ave to be 5 and adjusting t amp in the shaw model other inputs of atmospheric conditions include daily precipitation solar radiation wind speed and dew point temperature to exclude the effect of snow cover and possible snowmelt infiltration the daily precipitation is assumed to be 0 in all simulations other parameters are selected based on the climate of new brunswick reported in the literature to exclude the effect of time varying climatic conditions on evaporation we use the daily average wind speed the daily average solar radiation and use the daily average relative humidity to calculate the dew point temperature the daily average solar radiation equals 131 w m2 caissie et al 2007 which is within the typical range of solar radiation in regions with seasonally frozen soils the average wind speed equals 1 8 m s benyahya et al 2010 the dew point temperature is calculated based on the hyland wexter equation wexler et al 1983 relating average daily air temperature to vapor pressure of ice and liquid water and a uniform relative humidity equaling 0 45 which is a typical value of relative humidity in the northern hemisphere peterson and krantz 2008 to consider a series of wtd0 the length of the soil column is set to be 10 m and the soil column is uniformly discretized with a resolution of 1 cm the shallowest depth with saturated liquid water content is considered to be the water table in the models for considering freezing induced water table recession the no flow condition at the lower boundary is implemented by setting the hydraulic conductivity of the bottom layer to be 0 flerchinger 2017 the fixed head lower boundary condition is implemented by specifying saturated liquid water content below water table in each time step in all models the temperature at the lower boundary is estimated based on the approach proposed by hirota et al 2002 which is embedded in the shaw model the initial conditions of soil water content in the unsaturated zone are determined by the pre freezing water table depth and the soil water characteristic curves as shown in fig 3 all simulations conduct model spin up before freezing before t 0 in fig 3 to reach a quasi steady state 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of water table depth on freezing induced groundwater migration to illustrate the interactions between seasonally frozen soils and groundwater fig 5 shows the responses of loam columns to seasonal freezing under three different pre freezing water table depths wtd0 in all scenarios the subfreezing air temperature leads to cooling of soil and water accompanying a deepening frost depth and a thinning unsaturated unfrozen zone fig 5a note that we only show the period with increasing frost depth i e the later stage of with thinning frozen zone is not shown when wtd0 equals 400 cm the frost depth equals 104 cm and there is no water table recession implying that there is subtle or no interaction between frozen soil and groundwater when water table is deep when wtd0 is reduced to 300 cm the frost depth is reduced to 95 cm accompanying a water table recession of 1 cm when wtd0 is further reduced to 200 cm the frost depth is reduced to 84 cm but the water table recession is increased to 5 cm therefore a shallow pre freezing water table depth would restrict frost depth and become favorable for freezing induced groundwater migration the increase in water table recession with decreasing pre freezing water table depth under the same climate conditions is supported by the field observations at the wushen site no 26 27 in table s1 the closed well with a wtd0 of 75 cm has a water table recession of 35 cm whereas the one with a wtd0 of 180 cm has a water table recession of only 10 cm we infer that if wtd0 is reduced further the frost depth would decrease further and the water table recession would increase further the freezing induced water table recession is a direct result of the freezing induced water flux as shown in fig 5b soil freezing leads to upward negative in red and yellow water flux not only in the frozen zone but also in the unsaturated unfrozen zone note that in the shallow part of the frozen zone there is downward positive in green vapor flux induced by the downward temperature gradient as a result of solar radiation in the daytime which is not related to groundwater and is beyond the scope of the current study as wtd0 decreases from 400 cm to 200 cm the magnitude of upward total water flux towards the freezing front increases significantly fig 5b because water and ice have lower thermal conductivity and higher heat capacities than soil particles the increased water gain in the frozen zone leads to smaller thermal conductivity and higher heat capacities which is responsible for the decreasing frost depth with decreasing pre freezing water table depth the control of water table depth on freezing induced water flux can be explained by the darcy s law in the vadose zone the upward liquid water flux is determined by the gradient of total potential the sum of matric potential and gravitational potential and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ku both of which are related to soil wetness due to the differences in soil wetness the upper part of the unfrozen unsaturated zone has a low ku and large gradient of total potential whereas the lower part of the unfrozen unsaturated zone has a high ku and small gradient of total potential by comparing the temporal distributions of gradient of total potential fig 5c and ku shown in fig 5d among three wtd0 we find the gradient of total potential below the freezing front changes little with wtd0 but ku is very sensitive to wtd0 at large wtd0 the large zone with low ku is the direct factor restricting freezing induced water migration therefore the distance from the freezing front to the water table which determines soil moisture and ku below the freezing front is the limiting factor of freezing induced water migration 3 2 impact of freezing index on freezing induced groundwater migration frost depth is known to increase with the freezing index frauenfeld et al 2007 when wtd0 is fixed at 300 cm as the freezing index increases from 928 to 2393 days the maximum frost depth increases from 95 cm to 196 cm and the magnitude of freezing induced water table recession increases from 1 cm to 6 cm fig 6 a the increased water table recession is a direct result of the larger freezing induced water flux fig 6b similar to our analysis in fig 5b3 the freezing induced water flux also increases as the frost depth becomes deeper the water table recession starts at t 113 d as a result of the increasingly larger upward flux the temporal distributions of total potential gradient and ku shown in fig 6c and 6d respectively also reveal that the larger water flux is mainly caused by the larger ku below the freezing front as a result of the shorter distance between the water table and the freezing front based on our discussion in 3 1 and 3 2 we find the distance between the freezing front and the water table which controls the soil water content below the freezing front and thus the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is a key factor controlling the magnitude of freezing induced water flux and freezing induced water table recession therefore seasonally frozen soils are more likely to interact with groundwater in regions with shallow water table and low air temperature 3 3 influences of soil texture on freezing induced groundwater migration considering that water flow in the vadose zone is controlled by the soil water characteristic curves we compare freezing induced groundwater migration in four typical soils under the same freezing index and the same pre freezing water table depth fig 7 because the case of loam is already shown in the first column of fig 6 we do not repeat it in fig 7 the three soils have similar patterns of temperature distribution but quite different frost depths fig 7a as we discussed in 3 1 and 3 2 loam has a frost depth equaling 95 cm in fig 7 we find silt has a slightly smaller frost depth equaling 89 cm while clay has a larger frost depth equaling 120 cm and sand has the largest frost depth equaling 219 cm therefore the sequence of frost depth is sand clay loam silt our results are consistent with hansson and lundin 2006 which compared the frost depths of sand loam and silt note that the frost depth is controlled by thermal conductivity and specific heat capacities of the frozen zone calculated by equations 2 and 3 which are dependent on the proportions of ice and water a detailed comparison of thermal conductivity and specific heat capacities among frozen zone in different soils is beyond the scope the current study in the later stage the distances from the freezing front to the water table of sand are less than 1 m and of loam and silt are both slightly larger than 2 m however from sand to loam to silt there is an increasingly larger freezing induced water flux fig 7b indicating that the distance of freezing front away from the water table is not the only influencing factor of freezing induced water migration in fact the trend of increasingly larger flux from sand to loam to silt is a direct result of the increasingly larger gradient of total potential fig 7c and the increasingly larger ku below the freezing front fig 7d both of which are controlled by the soil water characteristics curves or the van genuchten mualem parameters note that although ks decreases from sand to loam to silt ku below the freezing front increases from sand to loam to silt for clay with the lowest ks among all soils although it has the largest gradient of total potential below the freezing front fig 7c3 its lower ku fig 7d3 than silt leads to much smaller upward water fluxes fig 7b3 the lower ku of clay than silt is consistent with burt and williams s 1976 measurements of hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils water transported to the frozen zone i e water gain in the frozen zone would be transformed into segregated ice and cause considerable volumetric expansion thus cause frost heave fu et al 2022 van huissteden 2020 fu et al 2022 simply summarized that fine grained soils generally promote segregated ice formation due to their high unfrozen water content but did not explain how unfrozen water content controls the flux of water transport into the frozen zone here we calculate the sum of water flux across the maximum frost depth which is termed freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone Î´sfz when the pre freezing water table depth wtd0 equals 300 cm Î´sfz equals 0 028 cm for sand 0 695 cm for loam and 1 487 cm for silt when wtd0 equals 200 cm Î´sfz is 0 844 cm for sand 1 798 cm for loam and 2 315 cm for silt figs 5 and 7 table 2 both scenarios show that when water table is shallow silt has the largest water gain in the frozen zone which is consistent with the recognition that silt has the highest likelihood of frost heave carter and bentley 2016 chamberlain 1981 fu et al 2022 among the 30 records of freezing induced water table recession there are 7 records in two sites observed in closed systems isolated from the aquifer in inner mongolia china one site in the hetao district with a freezing index of 680 days and a soil texture of silt has five records of water table recession no 9 13 in table s1 data from wu et al 2016 and the other site in the wushen district with a freezing index of 759 days and a soil texture of sand has 2 records of water table recession no 26 27 in table s1 data from zhang et al 2019 we find the silt site has much larger water table recessions than the sand site which is consistent with our results that silt has larger freezing induced water flux than sand when all other conditions are close enough although clay has a finer particle size than silt we find it has a smaller freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone when wtd0 equals 300 cm Î´sfz equals 0 845 cm when wtd0 equals 200 cm Î´sfz equals 1 105 cm however clay has a much larger freezing induced groundwater loss Î´ssz as well as much larger water table recession Î´wtd as labeled in fig 7a and 7b Î´ssz and Î´wtd for clay are 0 36 cm and 26 cm respectively with a low specific yield equaling 0 014 this is a direct result of its capacity to retain large amounts of water when the matric suction exceeds 100 cm fig 3 therefore although clay has a low likelihood of frost heave from the angle of freezing induced water table recession clay is most likely to be involved in freezing induced groundwater migration due to its lowest specific yield determined by the difference between saturated and actual water content shown on the soil water characteristic curves fig 3 here we find the highest likelihood of frost heave in silt is due to an optimum combination of total potential gradient and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in the unfrozen zone close to the freezing front the former is related to soil suction gradient and the latter is dependent on permeability and soil wetness our conclusion is advantageous over carter and bentley s 2016 recognition that silt has an optimum combination of soil suction and permeability and well explains why a high unfrozen water content in silt is favorable for frost heave therefore our simulations improve underatanding of controlling factors of freezing induced water migration and have implications to the field of frost susceptibility 3 4 the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration for different soils the control of pre freezing water table depth wtd0 on water table recession Î´wtd discussed in 3 1 illustrates that groundwater is involved in freezing induced water migration when the water table is shallow but is not involved when the water table is deep following the definition of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation we define the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration to be the lower limit of water table depth that freezing induced water table recession could not occur in other words when the pre freezing water table depth is shallower than the extinction depth freezing induced groundwater migration occurs and results in water table recession when the pre freezing water table depth is deeper than the extinction depth freezing induced groundwater migration is limited and there is no detectable water table recession based on the influences of freezing index and soil texture on freezing induced groundwater migration as shown in figs 6 and 7 the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration is a function of soil texture and freezing index fig 8 shows the relationship between Î´wtd and wtd0 of the four soils under two freezing indices this shows that within a similar range of wtd0 Î´wtd increases from sand to loam to silt to clay which confirms our statistics shown in fig 1b for each soil under a specific freezing index by modeling the interaction of seasonal freezing and groundwater under a finer resolution of wtd0 the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration can be obtained when the freezing index equals 928 days the extinction depths of sand loam silt and clay are 214 cm 321 cm 495 cm and 685 cm respectively fig 8a when the freezing index equals 2393 days the extinction depths of sand loam silt and clay are 375 cm 488 cm 671 cm and 911 cm respectively fig 8b therefore the extinction depth increases with finer soil texture and increasing freezing index which is consistent with the control of soil texture and freezing index on freezing induced water table recession as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 note that if the Î¸s of clay is changed to 0 5 the specific yield would increase accordingly which would lead to lower water table recessions and smaller extinction depths of freezing induced groundwater migration however this does not change our conclusion that clay has the largest extinction depth among the four soils sensitivity analysis under a series of freezing indices leads to the frost depth and extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration of each soil fig 9 for each soil the frost depth and the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration both increase with freezing index and both can be fitted using a power law function in the form of y y 0 xa where y is the extinction depth or frost depth x is freezing index y 0 is the extinction depth or frost depth when the freezing index approaches to 0 days and a is an exponent indicating the sensitivity of extinction depth frost depth to freezing index among the four equations of extinction depth sand has the largest exponent equaling 0 568 while silt and clay have a low exponent equaling around 0 17 for each soil the distance from the frost depth corresponds to freezing front to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth seldom changes with freezing index fig 9 indicating that the increase in extinction depth with freezing index is mainly caused by the increase in frost depth we also note that soil texture controls the distance from the freezing front to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth the distance is found to be around 35 cm for sand 216 cm for loam 414 cm for silt and 576 cm for clay fig 10 a fig 10a also shows that there is a good linear relationship between the distance from the freezing front to the extinction depth obtained in the current study and the distance from the land surface to the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation obtained by shah et al 2007 indicating that both are controlled by soil texture a schematic plot showing the similarity between the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration and the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation is given in fig 10b because the existence of snow cover would reduce the frost depth iwata et al 2010 and thus increase the distance away from the water table we infer that long term occurrence of snow cover in some regions of the world would reduce the possibility of interaction between seasonally frozen soil and groundwater although we do not simulate the influence of snow cover we believe that the occurrence of snow cover would not change our understanding of the control of soil texture on the distance from the frost depth to the extinction depth 3 5 the importance of extinction depth for simulating freezing induced groundwater migration to show the importance of extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration we compare the water gain in the frozen zone Î´sfz obtained by a dynamic water table that could respond to freezing which is employed in the current study and a fixed water table that does not change with freezing induced groundwater migration which is widely used in many existing studies hansson and lundin 2006 alkhaier et al 2012 chen et al 2019 when wtd0 is close to or deeper than the extinction depth the two groundwater conditions lead to the same results of freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone Î´sfz table 2 when wtd0 is shallower than the extinction depth Î´sfz obtained by the model with a fixed water table is larger than those obtained by the model with a dynamic water table this implies that when water table is deeper than the extinction depth the water table condition does not change the recognition of whether groundwater interacts with frozen soil however when water table is shallower than the extinction depth a fixed water table condition would overestimate freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone thus overestimate the possibility of frost heave and the harmfulness of soil salinization in regions with shallow water table this recognition is consistent with previous studies on the control of water table conditions on groundwater evaporation i e if water table is shallower than the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation a fixed head lower boundary condition would overestimate the amount of groundwater evaporation zhu et al 2009 zhao et al 2021 based on the importance of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation in groundwater modeling anderson et al 2015 we believe that the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration would be an important parameter for determining whether groundwater should be considered in future soil freezing models 4 conclusions by employing the shaw model to couple the winter time climate conditions soil water in the unsaturated zone and groundwater in the saturated zone we quantified the control of pre freezing water table depth freezing index and soil texture on interactions between seasonally frozen soils and groundwater when the freezing front is close to the water table seasonally frozen soils interact with groundwater and result in freezing induced groundwater migration and thus water table recession we defined the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration as the shallowest pre freezing water table depth that would cause a negligible freezing induced water table recession during the freezing stage the extinction depth increases with finer soil texture and increases with the freezing index implying that freezing induced groundwater migration is more likely to be observed in shallow wells drilled in fine textured soils like silt and clay in cold regions modeled results of the control of soil texture on freezing induced groundwater migration are consistent with field observations of 30 records of winter time water table recessions and modeled results of the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration are consistent with previously modeled results of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation obtained by shah et al 2007 which is shown by the good linear correlation between the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation and the distance from the freezing front to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth the importance of extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration is demonstrated by comparing freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone under two different water table conditions when the pre freezing water table depth is deeper than the extinction depth the choice of a fixed water table or a dynamic water table does not influence the results of freezing induced water flux however when the pre freezing water table depth is shallower than the extinction depth a fixed water table would overestimate freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone thus overestimate the possibility of occurrence of freezing induced geo hazard and the harmfulness of freezing induced soil salinization this study enhances understanding of the necessary conditions and influencing factors of freezing induced groundwater migration the defined extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration can be practical to guide where groundwater should be coupled into land surface models for critical zone modeling in cold regions and has implications for future hydrological ecological engineering

2163,although water table recessions associated with seasonal freezing have been widely reported the conditions that groundwater could respond to seasonal freezing are poorly known based on 30 records of winter time water table recessions reported in the literature we find the mean water table recession increases from sand to loam to silt to clay to obtain a quantitative understanding of the conditions of freezing induced groundwater migration and the role of soil texture we construct a one dimensional shaw model with a dynamic water table that could respond to winter time atmospheric conditions by simulating freezing induced groundwater migration under a series of pre freezing water table depths soil textures and freezing indices we find the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration i e the limit water table depth beyond which there is negligible freezing induced groundwater flow increases from coarse to fine soils and increases with freezing index moreover we find there is a good linear relationship between the distance from the freezing front to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration and the distance from the land surface to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth of evaporation induced groundwater migration for different soils to demonstrate the importance of defining extinction depth we also show the overestimation of freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone by the widely used fixed water table condition when the water table depth is shallower than the extinction depth this study has implications for future hydrologic and engineering studies in critical zones with a cold climate keywords cryosuction water table recession soil texture evaporation freezing index shaw data availability supplementary data to this article can be found online 1 introduction the vadose zone spanning from the land surface to the water table is the core element of the critical zone with active physical geochemical and biological processes hopmans and schoups 2005 arora et al 2019 seasonally frozen soils which widely occur in the northern hemisphere are important components of critical zones in cold regions evans et al 2018 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 zhang et al 2003 seasonal freezing and thawing processes not only control critical zone architecture anderson et al 2013 rempel et al 2016 but also affect water and energy cycles in the critical zone ireson et al 2013 rey et al 2021 due to the cryosuction near the freezing front water could be migrated from the underlying unsaturated and saturated zones to the freezing front williams and smith 1989 hohmann 1997 freezing induced groundwater migration and the resulting water table recession have been observed in many countries like the us daniel and staricka 2000 drescher 1955 meyer 1960 schneider 1961 canada ireson et al 2013 pan et al 2017 van der kamp et al 2003 sweden stÃ¤hli et al 1999 russia vinnikov et al 1996 and china lyu et al 2022 yi et al 2014 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 moreover by transporting water and dissolved ions from groundwater to seasonally frozen soils freezing induced groundwater migration would strengthen the possibilities of frost heave chamberlain 1981 bronfenbrener and bronfenbrener 2010 rui et al 2019 and soil salinization qin et al 2021 wang et al 2022 nevertheless there is still limited quantitative understanding of the conditions that groundwater can be migrated to seasonally frozen soils due to the importance of subsurface water to support vegetation in semi arid regions the study of soil water and groundwater migration towards the shallow part of the critical zone which is controlled by the atmospheric evaporative demand has received intensive research flammini et al 2017 federer et al 1996 kemp et al 1997 mastrocicco et al 2010 yu et al 2016 when the water table is shallow evaporation induced groundwater migration termed groundwater evaporation hereafter could result in diurnal or seasonal water table fluctuations white 1932 loheide et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 by comparing the evaporation rates under a series of water table depths gardner and fireman 1958 found that the evaporation rate decreases with deepening water table depth in the following decades field observations also showed the dependence of evaporation induced water table recession on initial water table depth hellwig 1973 xiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 therefore the concept of extinction depth has been widely employed to characterize whether groundwater evaporation is negligible baird and maddock 2005 heuvelmans 2010 liu et al 2015 mughal et al 2015 balugani et al 2017 ma et al 2019 namely when the water table depth is deeper than the extinction depth there is little groundwater evaporation when the water table depth is shallower than the extinction depth the groundwater evaporation rate increases with decreasing water table depth a numerical study revealed that the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation is highly dependent on soil texture shah et al 2007 the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation has become an important control variable in many groundwater models for example in the ets package banta 2000 and the evt package doble et al 2009 embedded in modflow as early as in the 1960 s field observations showed that only a shallow pre freezing water table depth is possible to cause freezing induced water table recession meyer 1960 indicating that pre freezing water table depth is critical for winter time water table recessions in the recent two decades numerical studies on how pre freezing water table depths control freezing induced groundwater migration attracted the interest of some researchers by assuming a fixed water table several studies showed that the flux of freezing induced groundwater migration decreases with deepening water table depth hansson and lundin 2006 alkhaier et al 2012 chen et al 2019 by using a dynamic water table that could respond to freezing some studies also showed that the magnitude of freezing induced water table recession decreases with deepening pre freezing water table depth cui et al 2020 xie et al 2021 following the concept of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation it is desirable to define the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration as a limit water table depth beyond which there is negligible freezing induced groundwater flow such a concept would be useful to decide whether groundwater should be considered in land surface models in cold regions the freezing index which is a measure of the severity of subfreezing temperatures experienced at a site is the most influential climatic factor controlling the frost depth frauenfeld et al 2004 for a specific pre freezing water table depth the freezing index indirectly determines the distance between the frost depth and the water table therefore the freezing index is an important climatic factor controlling interaction between seasonally frozen soils and groundwater by collecting 30 records of field measurements of winter time water table recessions in five countries fig 1 a table s1 the freezing index of which spans from 252 to 1815 days we find the magnitude of water table recession generally increases from sand to loam to silt to clay fig 1b namely the mean magnitude of water table recession equals 28 cm for sand 68 cm for loam 88 cm for silt and 114 cm for clay fig 1 these statistics indicate that soil texture is another important factor controlling freezing induced groundwater migration however the mechanism of how soil texture controls freezing induced groundwater migration and water table recessions is seldom studied in this study we first examine how pre freezing water table depth freezing index and soil texture influence freezing induced groundwater migration in 1d soil columns and then numerically obtain the frost depth and extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration both of which are functions of soil texture and freezing index the numerical results of the study lead to a clear understanding of conditions of interaction between seasonally frozen soils and groundwater 2 methods 2 1 conceptual model in seasonally frozen regions frost depth is

induced groundwater migration we follow shah et al s 2007 approach of obtaining extinction depth of groundwater evaporation by using a 1 d model i e considering the response of water migration to atmospheric conditions in the vertical direction and neglecting others factors influencing the water budget or the water table fluctuations to exclude the influence of snow melting on water budget we neglect the occurrence of snowfall and snow cover in our model although the role of groundwater inflow outflow can be considered by setting a source sink in the 1d model e g xie et al 2021 due to the difficulty of determining rates of lateral groundwater inflow outflow we also neglect the budget of lateral groundwater flow by employing such simplifications we concentrate on how pre freezing water table depth freezing index and soil texture control freezing induced groundwater migration in our 1 d model we consider four scenarios of soil texture sand loam silt and clay filled in the soil columns the soil column has an atmospheric boundary condition at the top a no flow boundary condition at the bottom and has a dynamic water table that could respond to freezing and thawing specifically when the water table is shallow the water table in the 1 d column could decline as a result of freezing induced groundwater migration fig 2 a when the water table is deep freezing induced groundwater migration is minimal which results in a negligible water table recession fig 2b to emphasize the advantages of a dynamic water table we also introduce a 1d model with a fixed water table to quantify freezing induced groundwater migration which has been used in some previous studies chen et al 2019 hansson and lundin 2006 2 2 numerical model harlan 1973 developed the first numerical model of coupled heat fluid transport in partially frozen soils in the current study we choose the simultaneous heat and water shaw model flerchinger and saxton 1989 flerchinger 2017 which is a typical harlan type model and has the capability to treat 1 d soil columns with a dynamic water table in a recent study we used the shaw model to couple winter time atmospheric conditions ice formation in the frozen zone and water in the unsaturated and saturated zones which well reproduced the fluctuating liquid water content in the unsaturated zone and the fluctuating water table in a field site xie et al 2021 in the shaw model the advective heat transfer by liquid latent heat of fusion due to solid liquid phase change and latent heat transfer due to vapor liquid phase change are

is reduced linearly with ice content and is assumed to be zero when the available porosity is decreased to 0 13 flerchinger 2017 2 3 model inputs as pointed out in section 2 1 freezing index soil texture and pre freezing water table depth wtd0 are considered as three major factors influencing freezing induced water migration in the current study the upper limit of freezing index is determined based on the freezing indices along the boundaries between regions of perennially and seasonally frozen grounds zhang et al 2005 which equals around 3000 days the physical hydraulic and thermal properties of the four typical soils are shown in table 1 to be consistent with shah et al s 2007 numerical study of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation the van genuchten mualem parameters for the four typical soils are also taken from carsel and parrish 1988 the details on the source of these parameters can be found in carsel and parrish 1988 and are not repeated here fig 3 shows the relationship between matric suction and soil water content because the parameters for clay given in carsel and parrish 1988 were not based on pure clay and many textbooks claim that clay could have very high porosity we also conducted sensitivity analysis by changing Î¸s of clay into 0 50 m3 m 3 the thermal properties of each soil are calculated by using equations 2 and 3 the climate of new brunswick canada kurylyk et al 2014 which was considered as a typical climate for occurrence of seasonally frozen soils evans and ge 2017 is used as the base case climate for illustrating the effects of water table depth and soil texture on freezing induced groundwater migration the climate of moscow russia lokoshchenko et al 2017 with a lower winter time temperature is used for illustrating the control of freezing index on freezing induced groundwater migration the temporal distribution of the average daily air temperatures of the two regions is shown in fig 4 which is characterized by the following sinusoidal function 8 t t t ave t amp sin 2 Ï t 365 25 where t ave is the average of annual air temperature Î¸ t amp is the amplitude of annual air temperature Î¸ note that t 0 does not represent the beginning of a calendar year and t equals t ave at t 0 the freezing index a measure of the combined duration and magnitude of sub freezing temperatures in a given freezing season frauenfeld et al 2007 is calculated by 9 fi t 0 t 1 t d t t 0 where t 0 and t 1 represent the start and end of the cold season t in new brunswick t ave equals 5 and t amp equals 15 evans and ge 2017 kurylyk et al 2014 leading to a freezing index of 928 days in moscow russia t ave approximates to 5 and t amp equals 28 lokoshchenko et al 2017 corresponding to a freezing index of 2393 days fig 4 in the current study a wide range of freezing index ranging from 0 to 3000 days is obtained by fixing t ave to be 5 and adjusting t amp in the shaw model other inputs of atmospheric conditions include daily precipitation solar radiation wind speed and dew point temperature to exclude the effect of snow cover and possible snowmelt infiltration the daily precipitation is assumed to be 0 in all simulations other parameters are selected based on the climate of new brunswick reported in the literature to exclude the effect of time varying climatic conditions on evaporation we use the daily average wind speed the daily average solar radiation and use the daily average relative humidity to calculate the dew point temperature the daily average solar radiation equals 131 w m2 caissie et al 2007 which is within the typical range of solar radiation in regions with seasonally frozen soils the average wind speed equals 1 8 m s benyahya et al 2010 the dew point temperature is calculated based on the hyland wexter equation wexler et al 1983 relating average daily air temperature to vapor pressure of ice and liquid water and a uniform relative humidity equaling 0 45 which is a typical value of relative humidity in the northern hemisphere peterson and krantz 2008 to consider a series of wtd0 the length of the soil column is set to be 10 m and the soil column is uniformly discretized with a resolution of 1 cm the shallowest depth with saturated liquid water content is considered to be the water table in the models for considering freezing induced water table recession the no flow condition at the lower boundary is implemented by setting the hydraulic conductivity of the bottom layer to be 0 flerchinger 2017 the fixed head lower boundary condition is implemented by specifying saturated liquid water content below water table in each time step in all models the temperature at the lower boundary is estimated based on the approach proposed by hirota et al 2002 which is embedded in the shaw model the initial conditions of soil water content in the unsaturated zone are determined by the pre freezing water table depth and the soil water characteristic curves as shown in fig 3 all simulations conduct model spin up before freezing before t 0 in fig 3 to reach a quasi steady state 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of water table depth on freezing induced groundwater migration to illustrate the interactions between seasonally frozen soils and groundwater fig 5 shows the responses of loam columns to seasonal freezing under three different pre freezing water table depths wtd0 in all scenarios the subfreezing air temperature leads to cooling of soil and water accompanying a deepening frost depth and a thinning unsaturated unfrozen zone fig 5a note that we only show the period with increasing frost depth i e the later stage of with thinning frozen zone is not shown when wtd0 equals 400 cm the frost depth equals 104 cm and there is no water table recession implying that there is subtle or no interaction between frozen soil and groundwater when water table is deep when wtd0 is reduced to 300 cm the frost depth is reduced to 95 cm accompanying a water table recession of 1 cm when wtd0 is further reduced to 200 cm the frost depth is reduced to 84 cm but the water table recession is increased to 5 cm therefore a shallow pre freezing water table depth would restrict frost depth and become favorable for freezing induced groundwater migration the increase in water table recession with decreasing pre freezing water table depth under the same climate conditions is supported by the field observations at the wushen site no 26 27 in table s1 the closed well with a wtd0 of 75 cm has a water table recession of 35 cm whereas the one with a wtd0 of 180 cm has a water table recession of only 10 cm we infer that if wtd0 is reduced further the frost depth would decrease further and the water table recession would increase further the freezing induced water table recession is a direct result of the freezing induced water flux as shown in fig 5b soil freezing leads to upward negative in red and yellow water flux not only in the frozen zone but also in the unsaturated unfrozen zone note that in the shallow part of the frozen zone there is downward positive in green vapor flux induced by the downward temperature gradient as a result of solar radiation in the daytime which is not related to groundwater and is beyond the scope of the current study as wtd0 decreases from 400 cm to 200 cm the magnitude of upward total water flux towards the freezing front increases significantly fig 5b because water and ice have lower thermal conductivity and higher heat capacities than soil particles the increased water gain in the frozen zone leads to smaller thermal conductivity and higher heat capacities which is responsible for the decreasing frost depth with decreasing pre freezing water table depth the control of water table depth on freezing induced water flux can be explained by the darcy s law in the vadose zone the upward liquid water flux is determined by the gradient of total potential the sum of matric potential and gravitational potential and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ku both of which are related to soil wetness due to the differences in soil wetness the upper part of the unfrozen unsaturated zone has a low ku and large gradient of total potential whereas the lower part of the unfrozen unsaturated zone has a high ku and small gradient of total potential by comparing the temporal distributions of gradient of total potential fig 5c and ku shown in fig 5d among three wtd0 we find the gradient of total potential below the freezing front changes little with wtd0 but ku is very sensitive to wtd0 at large wtd0 the large zone with low ku is the direct factor restricting freezing induced water migration therefore the distance from the freezing front to the water table which determines soil moisture and ku below the freezing front is the limiting factor of freezing induced water migration 3 2 impact of freezing index on freezing induced groundwater migration frost depth is known to increase with the freezing index frauenfeld et al 2007 when wtd0 is fixed at 300 cm as the freezing index increases from 928 to 2393 days the maximum frost depth increases from 95 cm to 196 cm and the magnitude of freezing induced water table recession increases from 1 cm to 6 cm fig 6 a the increased water table recession is a direct result of the larger freezing induced water flux fig 6b similar to our analysis in fig 5b3 the freezing induced water flux also increases as the frost depth becomes deeper the water table recession starts at t 113 d as a result of the increasingly larger upward flux the temporal distributions of total potential gradient and ku shown in fig 6c and 6d respectively also reveal that the larger water flux is mainly caused by the larger ku below the freezing front as a result of the shorter distance between the water table and the freezing front based on our discussion in 3 1 and 3 2 we find the distance between the freezing front and the water table which controls the soil water content below the freezing front and thus the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is a key factor controlling the magnitude of freezing induced water flux and freezing induced water table recession therefore seasonally frozen soils are more likely to interact with groundwater in regions with shallow water table and low air temperature 3 3 influences of soil texture on freezing induced groundwater migration considering that water flow in the vadose zone is controlled by the soil water characteristic curves we compare freezing induced groundwater migration in four typical soils under the same freezing index and the same pre freezing water table depth fig 7 because the case of loam is already shown in the first column of fig 6 we do not repeat it in fig 7 the three soils have similar patterns of temperature distribution but quite different frost depths fig 7a as we discussed in 3 1 and 3 2 loam has a frost depth equaling 95 cm in fig 7 we find silt has a slightly smaller frost depth equaling 89 cm while clay has a larger frost depth equaling 120 cm and sand has the largest frost depth equaling 219 cm therefore the sequence of frost depth is sand clay loam silt our results are consistent with hansson and lundin 2006 which compared the frost depths of sand loam and silt note that the frost depth is controlled by thermal conductivity and specific heat capacities of the frozen zone calculated by equations 2 and 3 which are dependent on the proportions of ice and water a detailed comparison of thermal conductivity and specific heat capacities among frozen zone in different soils is beyond the scope the current study in the later stage the distances from the freezing front to the water table of sand are less than 1 m and of loam and silt are both slightly larger than 2 m however from sand to loam to silt there is an increasingly larger freezing induced water flux fig 7b indicating that the distance of freezing front away from the water table is not the only influencing factor of freezing induced water migration in fact the trend of increasingly larger flux from sand to loam to silt is a direct result of the increasingly larger gradient of total potential fig 7c and the increasingly larger ku below the freezing front fig 7d both of which are controlled by the soil water characteristics curves or the van genuchten mualem parameters note that although ks decreases from sand to loam to silt ku below the freezing front increases from sand to loam to silt for clay with the lowest ks among all soils although it has the largest gradient of total potential below the freezing front fig 7c3 its lower ku fig 7d3 than silt leads to much smaller upward water fluxes fig 7b3 the lower ku of clay than silt is consistent with burt and williams s 1976 measurements of hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils water transported to the frozen zone i e water gain in the frozen zone would be transformed into segregated ice and cause considerable volumetric expansion thus cause frost heave fu et al 2022 van huissteden 2020 fu et al 2022 simply summarized that fine grained soils generally promote segregated ice formation due to their high unfrozen water content but did not explain how unfrozen water content controls the flux of water transport into the frozen zone here we calculate the sum of water flux across the maximum frost depth which is termed freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone Î´sfz when the pre freezing water table depth wtd0 equals 300 cm Î´sfz equals 0 028 cm for sand 0 695 cm for loam and 1 487 cm for silt when wtd0 equals 200 cm Î´sfz is 0 844 cm for sand 1 798 cm for loam and 2 315 cm for silt figs 5 and 7 table 2 both scenarios show that when water table is shallow silt has the largest water gain in the frozen zone which is consistent with the recognition that silt has the highest likelihood of frost heave carter and bentley 2016 chamberlain 1981 fu et al 2022 among the 30 records of freezing induced water table recession there are 7 records in two sites observed in closed systems isolated from the aquifer in inner mongolia china one site in the hetao district with a freezing index of 680 days and a soil texture of silt has five records of water table recession no 9 13 in table s1 data from wu et al 2016 and the other site in the wushen district with a freezing index of 759 days and a soil texture of sand has 2 records of water table recession no 26 27 in table s1 data from zhang et al 2019 we find the silt site has much larger water table recessions than the sand site which is consistent with our results that silt has larger freezing induced water flux than sand when all other conditions are close enough although clay has a finer particle size than silt we find it has a smaller freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone when wtd0 equals 300 cm Î´sfz equals 0 845 cm when wtd0 equals 200 cm Î´sfz equals 1 105 cm however clay has a much larger freezing induced groundwater loss Î´ssz as well as much larger water table recession Î´wtd as labeled in fig 7a and 7b Î´ssz and Î´wtd for clay are 0 36 cm and 26 cm respectively with a low specific yield equaling 0 014 this is a direct result of its capacity to retain large amounts of water when the matric suction exceeds 100 cm fig 3 therefore although clay has a low likelihood of frost heave from the angle of freezing induced water table recession clay is most likely to be involved in freezing induced groundwater migration due to its lowest specific yield determined by the difference between saturated and actual water content shown on the soil water characteristic curves fig 3 here we find the highest likelihood of frost heave in silt is due to an optimum combination of total potential gradient and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in the unfrozen zone close to the freezing front the former is related to soil suction gradient and the latter is dependent on permeability and soil wetness our conclusion is advantageous over carter and bentley s 2016 recognition that silt has an optimum combination of soil suction and permeability and well explains why a high unfrozen water content in silt is favorable for frost heave therefore our simulations improve underatanding of controlling factors of freezing induced water migration and have implications to the field of frost susceptibility 3 4 the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration for different soils the control of pre freezing water table depth wtd0 on water table recession Î´wtd discussed in 3 1 illustrates that groundwater is involved in freezing induced water migration when the water table is shallow but is not involved when the water table is deep following the definition of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation we define the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration to be the lower limit of water table depth that freezing induced water table recession could not occur in other words when the pre freezing water table depth is shallower than the extinction depth freezing induced groundwater migration occurs and results in water table recession when the pre freezing water table depth is deeper than the extinction depth freezing induced groundwater migration is limited and there is no detectable water table recession based on the influences of freezing index and soil texture on freezing induced groundwater migration as shown in figs 6 and 7 the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration is a function of soil texture and freezing index fig 8 shows the relationship between Î´wtd and wtd0 of the four soils under two freezing indices this shows that within a similar range of wtd0 Î´wtd increases from sand to loam to silt to clay which confirms our statistics shown in fig 1b for each soil under a specific freezing index by modeling the interaction of seasonal freezing and groundwater under a finer resolution of wtd0 the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration can be obtained when the freezing index equals 928 days the extinction depths of sand loam silt and clay are 214 cm 321 cm 495 cm and 685 cm respectively fig 8a when the freezing index equals 2393 days the extinction depths of sand loam silt and clay are 375 cm 488 cm 671 cm and 911 cm respectively fig 8b therefore the extinction depth increases with finer soil texture and increasing freezing index which is consistent with the control of soil texture and freezing index on freezing induced water table recession as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 note that if the Î¸s of clay is changed to 0 5 the specific yield would increase accordingly which would lead to lower water table recessions and smaller extinction depths of freezing induced groundwater migration however this does not change our conclusion that clay has the largest extinction depth among the four soils sensitivity analysis under a series of freezing indices leads to the frost depth and extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration of each soil fig 9 for each soil the frost depth and the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration both increase with freezing index and both can be fitted using a power law function in the form of y y 0 xa where y is the extinction depth or frost depth x is freezing index y 0 is the extinction depth or frost depth when the freezing index approaches to 0 days and a is an exponent indicating the sensitivity of extinction depth frost depth to freezing index among the four equations of extinction depth sand has the largest exponent equaling 0 568 while silt and clay have a low exponent equaling around 0 17 for each soil the distance from the frost depth corresponds to freezing front to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth seldom changes with freezing index fig 9 indicating that the increase in extinction depth with freezing index is mainly caused by the increase in frost depth we also note that soil texture controls the distance from the freezing front to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth the distance is found to be around 35 cm for sand 216 cm for loam 414 cm for silt and 576 cm for clay fig 10 a fig 10a also shows that there is a good linear relationship between the distance from the freezing front to the extinction depth obtained in the current study and the distance from the land surface to the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation obtained by shah et al 2007 indicating that both are controlled by soil texture a schematic plot showing the similarity between the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration and the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation is given in fig 10b because the existence of snow cover would reduce the frost depth iwata et al 2010 and thus increase the distance away from the water table we infer that long term occurrence of snow cover in some regions of the world would reduce the possibility of interaction between seasonally frozen soil and groundwater although we do not simulate the influence of snow cover we believe that the occurrence of snow cover would not change our understanding of the control of soil texture on the distance from the frost depth to the extinction depth 3 5 the importance of extinction depth for simulating freezing induced groundwater migration to show the importance of extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration we compare the water gain in the frozen zone Î´sfz obtained by a dynamic water table that could respond to freezing which is employed in the current study and a fixed water table that does not change with freezing induced groundwater migration which is widely used in many existing studies hansson and lundin 2006 alkhaier et al 2012 chen et al 2019 when wtd0 is close to or deeper than the extinction depth the two groundwater conditions lead to the same results of freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone Î´sfz table 2 when wtd0 is shallower than the extinction depth Î´sfz obtained by the model with a fixed water table is larger than those obtained by the model with a dynamic water table this implies that when water table is deeper than the extinction depth the water table condition does not change the recognition of whether groundwater interacts with frozen soil however when water table is shallower than the extinction depth a fixed water table condition would overestimate freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone thus overestimate the possibility of frost heave and the harmfulness of soil salinization in regions with shallow water table this recognition is consistent with previous studies on the control of water table conditions on groundwater evaporation i e if water table is shallower than the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation a fixed head lower boundary condition would overestimate the amount of groundwater evaporation zhu et al 2009 zhao et al 2021 based on the importance of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation in groundwater modeling anderson et al 2015 we believe that the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration would be an important parameter for determining whether groundwater should be considered in future soil freezing models 4 conclusions by employing the shaw model to couple the winter time climate conditions soil water in the unsaturated zone and groundwater in the saturated zone we quantified the control of pre freezing water table depth freezing index and soil texture on interactions between seasonally frozen soils and groundwater when the freezing front is close to the water table seasonally frozen soils interact with groundwater and result in freezing induced groundwater migration and thus water table recession we defined the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration as the shallowest pre freezing water table depth that would cause a negligible freezing induced water table recession during the freezing stage the extinction depth increases with finer soil texture and increases with the freezing index implying that freezing induced groundwater migration is more likely to be observed in shallow wells drilled in fine textured soils like silt and clay in cold regions modeled results of the control of soil texture on freezing induced groundwater migration are consistent with field observations of 30 records of winter time water table recessions and modeled results of the extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration are consistent with previously modeled results of extinction depth of groundwater evaporation obtained by shah et al 2007 which is shown by the good linear correlation between the extinction depth of groundwater evaporation and the distance from the freezing front to the water table corresponding to the extinction depth the importance of extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration is demonstrated by comparing freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone under two different water table conditions when the pre freezing water table depth is deeper than the extinction depth the choice of a fixed water table or a dynamic water table does not influence the results of freezing induced water flux however when the pre freezing water table depth is shallower than the extinction depth a fixed water table would overestimate freezing induced water gain in the frozen zone thus overestimate the possibility of occurrence of freezing induced geo hazard and the harmfulness of freezing induced soil salinization this study enhances understanding of the necessary conditions and influencing factors of freezing induced groundwater migration the defined extinction depth of freezing induced groundwater migration can be practical to guide where groundwater should be coupled into land surface models for critical zone modeling in cold regions and has implications for future hydrological ecological engineering

2164,based on the phase field method a fluid solid coupling modeling method was proposed to simulate the reaction transport in porous media at the pore scale and realize the dynamic tracking of the fluid solid interface we skillfully combined the phase field module in comsol with the heaviside function to realize the numerical solution of the model the feasibility and reliability of the model are verified by comparing it with the results of previous studies on the related benchmark problems the dissolution process of a single calcite crystal to further explore the practicability of the model we simulate the dissolution process in two dimensional porous media generated by random circles under different transport conditions and reaction rates the results show that the solute can be transported downstream of the model region under advection dominated transport conditions which are common in engineering applications and the dissolution reaction in the medium takes place synchronously when diffusion is the main transport mode which often occurs in natural conditions and the reaction is relatively fast the solute is difficult to transport downstream of the model region mineral dissolution mainly occurs near the solute inlet and mineral disappearance is carried out in a horizontal push mode the permeability porosity relationship is predicted by the kozeny carman law for different transport conditions and reaction rates the results show that the kozeny carman law is more accurate in predicting permeability over a porosity range of 15 for advection dominated reactive transport considering specific surface area variation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mineral dissolution in porous media plays a key role in many underground transport processes it has been widely studied in many fields such as groundwater pollution control co2 geological storage underground karst cave system etc it is a typical issue of common concern of energy environment and other disciplines sin and corvisier 2019 soulaine et al 2018 steefel and tournassat 2019 for example in the treatment of groundwater pollution sewage will constantly erode and displace groundwater and acid ions in sewage will dissolve with rocks such as calcite and dolomite etc in the formation resulting in significant changes in rock structure and thus affecting fluid flow ma et al 2014 steefel et al 2014 another example in the process of co2 geological sequestration underground injection of co2 to push the water rock system into a far from the equilibrium state and the imbalance driving heterogeneous reactions such as mineral dissolution and precipitation may change the fluid transport characteristics and properties of porous media including transport paths porosity permeability and geochemical reactions in particular the effect of reaction infiltration instability caused by this process on the water rock system molins et al 2017 steefel et al 2013 xu et al 2019 in previous studies people focused on the evolution of these attributes on the darcy scale at this scale the representative elementary volume rev defines the minimum size of a study area where the value of a property such as porosity permeability dispersion specific surface area mineral mass fraction etc remains stable at a particular scale and becomes a representative property of the domain under consideration bear 1972 noiriel and soulaine 2021 however it is an objective fact that geochemical reactions affect local rock microstructure with time some scholars have questioned the concept of rev for example it is now accepted that existing permeability porosity relationships such as the kozeny carman law do not accurately predict pore structure changes due to the inhomogeneity that occurs in pore space due to water rock interactions noiriel and daval 2017 in contrast the pore scale can be defined as the maximum spatial scale capable of distinguishing the different liquid and solid phases that make up natural subsurface materials molins 2015 since pore scale directly reflects pore space structure relevant studies at this scale can help explain the inability to understand or predict geochemical reaction processes by considering smaller or nanoscale or larger scales or field scale water rock interaction during underground reaction migration occurs at the water rock interface and different phases are distinguishable at the pore scale therefore experimental and modeling studies need to consider these interfaces to accurately determine reaction rates and transport paths molins et al 2021 pore scale simulation can be used to understand further the scale dependence of macro scale parameters of the continuum and it can effectively solve transport and reaction processes that cannot be simulated by the darcy scale soulaine et al 2021a there are two main methods to simulate reactive transport problems at pore scale namely pore network modeling pnm and direct numerical simulation dns of pore scale jyoti and haese 2021 pnm abstracts pore space structure into a typical representative network model composed of pores and throats and solves relevant governing equations gostick et al 2016 nogues et al 2013 varloteaux et al 2013 in contrast dns is computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical simulation using unstructured or structured grids generated from actual pore geometry according to the numerical scheme direct pore scale modeling can be roughly divided into the following methods 1 lattice boltzmann method lbm fazeli et al 2020 yoon et al 2015 2 smooth particle hydrodynamics sph tartakovsky et al 2007a tartakovsky et al 2007b vacondio et al 2021 3 cfd based on finite difference finite volume or finite element method it can be called the traditional cfd method molins et al 2012 molins et al 2014 starchenko and ladd 2018 the traditional cfd methods discretize navier stokes equations or stokes equations directly on structured or unstructured grids which can well capture the geometry of complex fluid solid interfaces another advantage of direct numerical simulations using cfd methods is the ease of coupling with existing and widely validated geochemical models the dissolution of minerals leads to the evolution of the fluid solid interface so a very important core issue in direct pore scale simulation is the dynamic tracing of the convective solid interface noiriel and soulaine 2021 to this end different interface tracking methods have been proposed to estimate pore scale reaction migration in cfd simulation of fluid structure interaction the most popular interface tracking methods include arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale oltÃ©an et al 2013 starchenko et al 2016 level set ls li et al 2008 molins et al 2017 molins et al 2014 and volume of solids vos soulaine et al 2021a soulaine et al 2021b soulaine and tchelepi 2016 the ale method is very accurate because no assumptions are made about solid geometry and the governing equations of continuum mechanics are solved with high precision however this approach presents numerical problems in the event of significant changes in pore structure e g complete ablation of mineral particles and blockage of pore throats which are not well addressed by current grid strategies soulaine et al 2017 due to the accuracy of the ale method the ale method can be used as a reference solution to verify other numerical methods when the topological structure of the model does not change the ls method requires solving an additional level set equation that tracks the evolution of interface position and curvature through advection and reinitialization of the level set function molins et al 2012 the solid phase is mapped to an euler grid using the volume fraction of solid minerals in each grid block a technique known as the vos method similar to the volume of fluid method used in cfd to track fluid fluid interfaces brackbill et al 1992 soulaine et al 2018 yang et al 2021 other interfaces tracing methods rely on lbm kang et al 2010 masoudi et al 2021 and sph tartakovsky et al 2007a tartakovsky et al 2007b in addition the phase field method can also be used to simulate the dissolution process of minerals bastidas olivares et al 2021 xu and meakin 2008 different from the above methods the phase field method uses order parameters to simulate the evolution process of the fluid solid interface the order parameters follow a separate differential equation and minimize the fluid solid free energy difference instead of the surface reaction rate equation xu and meakin 2011 furthermore like the level set the phase field method can also track the dynamic evolution of the interface through advective phase field variables the fluid solid interface in the phase field method is represented by diffusion boundary so the phase field method has smoother processing of interface curvature compared with the ls akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 xu et al 2012 although early phase field models of mineral dissolution and precipitation have been developed and coupled with the diffusion equation these methods have two shortcomings bastidas olivares et al 2021 rohde and von wolff 2020 firstly complex chemical surface energy and double well potential functions need to be constructed secondly the reliability of simulation results is not well verified to solve the above problems we proposed an improved phase field model to simulate pore scale reactive transport our phase field method is based on the two phase flow phase field method the dynamic evolution of the fluid solid interface is explicitly traced through advection phase field variables in the main control equation compared with the normal phase field method this avoids the complicated construction of chemical surface energy and double well potential function therefore our phase field method is simpler to use and has higher accuracy meanwhile the reliability and practicability of the phase field method are guaranteed by testing the benchmark problem moreover we use this model to demonstrate kozeny carman law and clarify its applicable conditions and scope in the model we directly construct the heaviside function through the phase field variables to achieve the characterization and dynamic tracking of a fluid solid interface and the mass flux boundary conditions formed by the dissolution reaction of mineral surface also adopt the same method the numerical implementation process of the model is described in detail in section 3 in section 4 we verify the reliability of the model by testing benchmark problems proposed by molins et al 2021 in section 5 we design a relatively complex pore geometry extend the model and discuss the evolving relationship between porosity and permeability 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations due to the low compressibility of water for most underground conditions the incompressible navier stokes equations can be used to accurately

dispersion interface model which is a powerful tool for describing the evolution of complex phase interfaces in non equilibrium states kobayashi 1993 to facilitate understanding we first introduce the phase field model commonly used to simulate gas liquid two phase flow in the next section of numerical implementation details we will discuss how to modify it to be suitable for a single phase flow solid phase field model through reasonable variable substitution and appropriate parameter values the phase field model is rooted in the concept of free energy and the free energy density f mix j m3

field or partial differential equations multi physics field in this paper the phase field model of gas liquid two phase flow is ingeniously combined with the heaviside function to form a phase field

though a lot of tests we think it is reasonable to set the value of Ï as 1e 9 m s kg 4 validation of the model 4 1 description of benchmark problems the benchmark problem describes the dissolution of a circular calcite grain in a simple two dimensional rectangular domain in the center fig 1 an acidic solution of ph 2 h inlet 10 5 mol cm3 is injected at the left inlet as a dirichlet boundary the problem considers a single irreversible chemical reaction 16 c a c o 3 s h c a 2 h c o 3 the dissolution reaction rate of minerals has a first order kinetic dependence on h concentration 17 r k m c h where r is the mineral reaction rate mol cm2 s the dissolution rate depends only on the concentration of h so only the transport of h needs to be considered the benchmark problem doesn t include multicomponent geochemical reactions in aqueous phases and a detailed description of the benchmark problem can be found in the study by molins et al 2021 the values of the various parameters in the benchmark problem are shown in table 1 to verify our model we also used the ale method to simulate the benchmark problem the accuracy and limitations of the method have been demonstrated in soulaine et al 2017 fig 2 shows the differences in mesh generation between the two methods the number of mesh generation in the phase field model is 9 866 with mesh size of 1 75e 2 5 0e 4 mm fig 2a while the number of mesh generation in the ale model is 16 302 with mesh size of 1 4e 2 2 0e 4 mm fig 2b in the ale model the mineral region is not covered by mesh which indicates that solid phase is not involved in calculation in the ale model it realizes the surface reaction of minerals through the flux boundary conditions inside the model and the evolution of the interface is realized through the coordinates of the moving grid which is the main feature of the ale model it should be noted that the value of Îµ of the phase field model is closely related to the division of the grid here we set the value of Îµ as 1e 5 m 4 2 verify the results the simulation process is divided into two parts the first part is the reaction stability stage and the simulation time is 0 5 s the second part is the interface evolution stage which lasts from 0 to 3000 s as shown in fig 3 when the flow velocity reaches stability a fast flow velocity channel is formed on the upper and lower sides of the mineral particles this is because the middle flow velocity is blocked by the middle mineral particles to the upper and lower sides therefore the velocity around the minerals is low on the left and right sides and high on the upper and lower sides the flow field of the phase field model is consistent with the ale model when the body force is increased in the intermediate mineral region the distribution of flow velocity determines the direction and intensity of solute transport here we first ensure the accuracy of flow field simulation which lays a foundation for subsequent simulation due to the consumption of h by the mineral surface dissolution reaction a significant concentration gradient appears near the surface of the calcite grain fig 4 the consumption rate of h is controlled by the surface dissolution reaction rate of calcite eq 17 and the diffusion rate of the h in the liquid phase the distribution of the h concentration is closely related to the simulation results of the flow field which makes the diffusion boundary layer of the h in the downstream mineral grains wider than that in the upstream this difference can be better observed when the ph is plotted fig 5 ph log10 h it should be noted that the concentration of the h in the inner circular region where the mineral particles are located is zero which is not caused by the reaction and its initial value is zero to verify the accuracy of solute field simulation results we set three transversals in the model red line represents horizontal the yellow line represents vertical and the blue line represents diagonal fig 5a and plot h concentration on these transversals in the form of ph which is compared with the simulation results of molins et al 2021 the article five different codes to simulate this benchmark problem the governing equations of these codes were all different but the simulation results showed good consistency which could be used as a reference standard for our simulation results the governing equation of the dissolfoam code is the same as the ale model so the simulation results of the ale model will not be repeated here starchenko 2022 the ph values increased and decreased sharply on the front and back sides of the mineral particles fig 5b as mineral dissolution consumes h ph increases at the grain front and occurs in the region of about 30 um the phase field model for the point closest to the liquid solid interface gives a ph of 3 38 while the ph of this point is 3 01 4 39 according to the other codes at the same point the simulated ph of the phase field model closest to the post grain boundary is 4 15 and the simulated ph of the other codes ranges from 3 47 to 4 35 fig 5b the vertical and horizontal ph transects showed similar patterns fig 5c the ph value of the phase field model at the left side of the axis nearest to the boundary point about 0 015 cm is 3 17 while the ph value of all other codes at the same point is 3 02 4 66 at the diagonal transect the ph values of the points closest to calcite grains predicted by the phase field model are 3 62 and 3 77 respectively which are almost identical to those predicted by other codes fig 5d to further verify the steady state simulation results we will accurately calculate the average concentration of h at the outlet and the average reaction rate of h at the mineral surface and compare them with the simulation results of the other codes the formula for calculating the average outlet concentration is as follows 18 c out s c u d s q where cout is the average concentration of h at the outlet mol cm3 q is the volume flow cm3 s which can be calculated as the integral of the velocity field vector over the cross sectional area q s u d s and s is the cross section of the outlet cm2 the average reaction rate is obtained by calculating the mass balance between the h concentration at the outlet and the inlet 19 r q c out c in a where r is the average reaction rate mol cm 2 s 1 cin is the inlet average concentration of the h mol cm3 and a is the surface area of the calcite grain cm2 fig 6 shows that all code takes roughly the same amount of time to reach a steady state in the stable state the average outlet concentration of the h obtained by the phase field model is 9 53 10 6 mol cm3 fig 6a 0 18 lower than that of chombo crunch 0 14 0 24 and 0 35 higher than that of lattice boltzmann openfoam dbs and dissolfoam respectively the relative differences are all less than 1 which indicates that the phase field model is in good agreement with the simulation results of other codes the average reaction rate calculated by the phase field model in steady state is 4 54 10 8 mol cm2 s fig 6b which is consistent with the steady state rate obtained by other codes the rate obtained in this study is 4 85 1 32 and 4 63 higher than that of chombo crunch openfoam and dissolfoam and 0 66 lower than that of lattice boltzmann in general the steady state dissolution rates obtained from the phase field model match well with other codes compared to the first part of the simulation here the model runs for 3000 s much longer than the previous part the surface area and grain size of the minerals exposed to the fluid decrease over time due to the prolonged dissolution reaction fig 7 b and fig 8 although the shrinkage of the particles reduces the h involved in the reaction the effective reaction rate of the particles increases as the particle area decreases fig 7a this is because as the grains become smaller the diffusion control over the overall reaction rate decreases when the phase field model was simulated to 2700 s the surface area was 0 0334 cm2 while the initial surface area was 0 0628 cm2 this represents a 46 8 change in surface area meanwhile during the same time the surface area changes simulated by dissolfoam vortex openfoam dbs lattice boltzmann and chombo crunch are 45 6 48 1 41 9 46 5 and 43 2 respectively fig 7b the calculated grain volume change at the same time t 2700 s simulated by phase field model was 8 64e 5 cm3 while the initial surface area was 3 14e 4 cm3 this shows that 72 5 of grain dissolved during the simulated time period meanwhile during the same time the grain volume changes simulated by dissolfoam vortex openfoam dbs lattice boltzmann and chombo crunch are 71 1 72 9 67 1 70 9 and 68 7 respectively fig 7c in general the relative error of the phase field model is within 10 compared with all codes for the simulation results of reaction rate and reaction surface area the asymmetry of the concentration field will lead to the uneven contraction of the mineral geometry as the simulation time goes on the dissolved part of the downstream grain is much less than that of the upstream grain and its shape changes from round to pear shaped fig 8 fig 8 shows the evolution of grain shapes calculated by different codes the grain shapes of all codes are similar but there are some significant differences over long periods fig 8c compared with other models the advantages of phase field model are mainly manifested in two points one is that the fluid solid interface is smooth and non jagged fig 8 the other is that it can simulate the complete dissolution of grains this is reflected in section 5 our model can achieve both functions at the same time 5 application of the model here we apply the verified phase field model to a more complex porous medium and discuss the mineral dissolution process under different migration and reaction rates furthermore we demonstrate the limited applicability of this constitutive model by calculating the permeability of porous media during dissolution and comparing the results with the kozeny carman constitutive model commonly used on the rev scale as shown in fig 9 a the porous media is represented by a group of calcite grains with different radii whose radii follow a normal distribution and are randomly placed in the model region 0 1 0 05 cm and these grains do not overlap with each other the number of mesh generation in the model is 177 483 with mesh size of 1 4e 2 2 0e 4 mm fig 9b here two simulation cases are designed different simulation cases correspond to different peclet numbers pe uinw d uin is the normal inflow velocity of the left inlet w is the width of the model area and damkÃ¶hler numbers da kmw d other conditions and parameters of the model are consistent with the benchmark problem table 2 in general the dissolution rate of individual calcite grains depends on the concentration of the solute involved in the reaction in the nearby fluid and the replenishing rate of consumed solutes in case 1 fig 10 a fig 10b and fig 10c advection is the main control factor of the migration process driven by advection solutes can be transported to the downstream region of porous media in the initial stage as can be seen in fig 10b the dissolution of upstream and downstream particles is synchronized but the dissolution rate of upstream grains is faster than that of downstream particles this is because the solute consumed by the dissolution of the upstream grains is preferentially replenished while the concentration of the solute replenished downstream is from the upstream unconsumed solute resulting in a relatively low concentration of the downstream solute in case 2 fig 10a fig 10b and fig 10c diffusion is the main control factor of the transport process and the solute fails to diffuse into the downstream region of the porous medium because the reaction rate in case 2 is much faster than in case 1 the solute is completely consumed upstream resulting in almost no solute diffusion to the downstream region from the point of view of time although the dissolution of grains in case 2 is not synchronized the dissolution rate and diffusion rate of case 2 are fast enough so the complete dissolution time of grains in case 2 is much less than that in case 1 in darcy s law permeability is a constant coefficient related to fluid flow and dielectric material parameters which is calculated by the following formula 20 k q Î¼ l s Î´ p where k is the permeability m2 Î´p is the pressure difference applied around the medium pa and l is the length of the medium in the flow direction m for porous media the kozeny carman law can be used to estimate permeability in terms of porosity and specific surface area of the medium kozeny carman law can be written as bear 1972 li et al 2010 tian and wang 2018 21 k kc n 3 1 n 2 m 2 c where kkc is empirical permeability m2 n is porosity m is the specific surface area of the medium and c is the kozeny constant which is related to the geometry of channels in porous media from eqs 20 and 21 we can derive eqs 22 and 23 22 k k 0 q q 0 Î´ p 0 Î´ p 23 k kc k 0 k c n n 0 3 1 n 0 1 n 2 m 0 m 2 where k0 is the initial permeability m2 Î´ p0 is the initial pressure difference pa k0kc is the initial empirical permeability m2 n0 is the initial porosity and m0 is the initial specific surface area of the medium when eq 23 is applied in practice the change of specific surface area is usually ignored so we can get the following equation 24 k kc k 0 k c n n 0 3 1 n 0 1 n 2 the relative changes of permeability are calculated by eq 22 and the relative changes of empirical permeability are calculated by eqs 23 and 24 since the change of specific surface area is considered in eq 23 for calculating the relative changes of empirical permeability the results obtained in case 1 and case 2 are different when calculating the empirical permeability using the kozeny carman law fig 11 in other words if the change of specific surface area is not considered in eq 23 the empirical permeability of case 1 and case 2 be calculated using kozeny carman law and the results will be the same as can be seen from fig 11a the kozeny carman law is quite accurate in predicting permeability changes in the range of porosity changes less than 15 n n0 1 100 in the reaction transport process dominated by advection but the error increases with further porosity changes in contrast the kozeny carman law predicts a deviation from the actual change in permeability in reaction transport where diffusion dominates fig 11b and this deviation tends to increase further as porosity changes in summary we believe that the kozeny carman law is more suitable for reactive transport problems dominated by convection and the 15 porosity range is sufficient to cover most engineering practical problems in addition it is worth noting that in previous studies changes in specific surface area were ignored when the kozeny carman law was used so we believe that this treatment method will reduce the accuracy of the kozeny carman law 6 summary and conclusion the main work of this paper is to implement a general fluid solid coupling simulation method at the pore scale with the help of the phase field module of multi physical field coupling simulation software comsol and to track the dynamic evolution of the fluid solid interface using the phase field method using this model we systematically study the nonlinear coupling between reactive transport and the structural evolution of porous media due to mineral dissolution the simulation of the dissolution of a single calcite particle in a single microchannel is in good agreement with that of molins et al 2021 which verifies the validity of the phase field method on the pore scale for such problems these good validation results provide us with great confidence in applying the model to larger scale rock dissolution simulation results under different reaction transport conditions show that the phase field method can be used to predict complex fluid solid interface evolution in pore space including topological changes such as the complete dissolution of solids this method can also be used to predict the relationship between permeability and porosity during the evolution of porous media under different migration conditions and reaction rates this permeability porosity relationship is critical for reliability simulations at the rev scale our simulation results partially modify the permeability porosity relationship prediction by kozeny carman law and further clarify the precise applicability of the equation despite a simplified first order dissolution reaction rate model being used in the simulation some useful conclusions can be drawn from the simulation results when advection is the main mode of reactive transport the dissolution of grains in the upstream and downstream regions occurs almost simultaneously in porous media however diffusion is the main mode of solute transport and when the reaction rate is fast dissolution will occur preferentially in the upstream region of porous media in addition when advection dominates the reaction transport process the kozeny carman law is relatively accurate in predicting the permeability porosity relationship provided that changes in the specific surface area of the mineral are considered if the changes in specific surface area are ignored the kozeny carman law becomes much less accurate here we will provide a workflow for improving the accuracy of kozeny carman law meanwhile we also provide a reference method for calculating permeability when the kozeny carman law does not apply using the toughreact simulator as an example the kozeny carman law is used to calculate the porosity permeability relationship for convection dominated reaction migration where the porosity change is within the 15 range taking into account the specific surface area change of all minerals involved in reaction by weighted average when the kozeny carman law is no longer applicable a multi scale micro macro coupling model is suggested to deal with the problems and this is the focus of our next research work the phase field model used in this study is particularly suitable for systematically investigating the nonlinear coupling among mineral dissolution reactions fluid flow and solute transport in pore space the next step is to couple more complex geochemical reactions into the model through external calls such as coupling simulation of phreeqc with comsol which we have

2164,based on the phase field method a fluid solid coupling modeling method was proposed to simulate the reaction transport in porous media at the pore scale and realize the dynamic tracking of the fluid solid interface we skillfully combined the phase field module in comsol with the heaviside function to realize the numerical solution of the model the feasibility and reliability of the model are verified by comparing it with the results of previous studies on the related benchmark problems the dissolution process of a single calcite crystal to further explore the practicability of the model we simulate the dissolution process in two dimensional porous media generated by random circles under different transport conditions and reaction rates the results show that the solute can be transported downstream of the model region under advection dominated transport conditions which are common in engineering applications and the dissolution reaction in the medium takes place synchronously when diffusion is the main transport mode which often occurs in natural conditions and the reaction is relatively fast the solute is difficult to transport downstream of the model region mineral dissolution mainly occurs near the solute inlet and mineral disappearance is carried out in a horizontal push mode the permeability porosity relationship is predicted by the kozeny carman law for different transport conditions and reaction rates the results show that the kozeny carman law is more accurate in predicting permeability over a porosity range of 15 for advection dominated reactive transport considering specific surface area variation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mineral dissolution in porous media plays a key role in many underground transport processes it has been widely studied in many fields such as groundwater pollution control co2 geological storage underground karst cave system etc it is a typical issue of common concern of energy environment and other disciplines sin and corvisier 2019 soulaine et al 2018 steefel and tournassat 2019 for example in the treatment of groundwater pollution sewage will constantly erode and displace groundwater and acid ions in sewage will dissolve with rocks such as calcite and dolomite etc in the formation resulting in significant changes in rock structure and thus affecting fluid flow ma et al 2014 steefel et al 2014 another example in the process of co2 geological sequestration underground injection of co2 to push the water rock system into a far from the equilibrium state and the imbalance driving heterogeneous reactions such as mineral dissolution and precipitation may change the fluid transport characteristics and properties of porous media including transport paths porosity permeability and geochemical reactions in particular the effect of reaction infiltration instability caused by this process on the water rock system molins et al 2017 steefel et al 2013 xu et al 2019 in previous studies people focused on the evolution of these attributes on the darcy scale at this scale the representative elementary volume rev defines the minimum size of a study area where the value of a property such as porosity permeability dispersion specific surface area mineral mass fraction etc remains stable at a particular scale and becomes a representative property of the domain under consideration bear 1972 noiriel and soulaine 2021 however it is an objective fact that geochemical reactions affect local rock microstructure with time some scholars have questioned the concept of rev for example it is now accepted that existing permeability porosity relationships such as the kozeny carman law do not accurately predict pore structure changes due to the inhomogeneity that occurs in pore space due to water rock interactions noiriel and daval 2017 in contrast the pore scale can be defined as the maximum spatial scale capable of distinguishing the different liquid and solid phases that make up natural subsurface materials molins 2015 since pore scale directly reflects pore space structure relevant studies at this scale can help explain the inability to understand or predict geochemical reaction processes by considering smaller or nanoscale or larger scales or field scale water rock interaction during underground reaction migration occurs at the water rock interface and different phases are distinguishable at the pore scale therefore experimental and modeling studies need to consider these interfaces to accurately determine reaction rates and transport paths molins et al 2021 pore scale simulation can be used to understand further the scale dependence of macro scale parameters of the continuum and it can effectively solve transport and reaction processes that cannot be simulated by the darcy scale soulaine et al 2021a there are two main methods to simulate reactive transport problems at pore scale namely pore network modeling pnm and direct numerical simulation dns of pore scale jyoti and haese 2021 pnm abstracts pore space structure into a typical representative network model composed of pores and throats and solves relevant governing equations gostick et al 2016 nogues et al 2013 varloteaux et al 2013 in contrast dns is computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical simulation using unstructured or structured grids generated from actual pore geometry according to the numerical scheme direct pore scale modeling can be roughly divided into the following methods 1 lattice boltzmann method lbm fazeli et al 2020 yoon et al 2015 2 smooth particle hydrodynamics sph tartakovsky et al 2007a tartakovsky et al 2007b vacondio et al 2021 3 cfd based on finite difference finite volume or finite element method it can be called the traditional cfd method molins et al 2012 molins et al 2014 starchenko and ladd 2018 the traditional cfd methods discretize navier stokes equations or stokes equations directly on structured or unstructured grids which can well capture the geometry of complex fluid solid interfaces another advantage of direct numerical simulations using cfd methods is the ease of coupling with existing and widely validated geochemical models the dissolution of minerals leads to the evolution of the fluid solid interface so a very important core issue in direct pore scale simulation is the dynamic tracing of the convective solid interface noiriel and soulaine 2021 to this end different interface tracking methods have been proposed to estimate pore scale reaction migration in cfd simulation of fluid structure interaction the most popular interface tracking methods include arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale oltÃ©an et al 2013 starchenko et al 2016 level set ls li et al 2008 molins et al 2017 molins et al 2014 and volume of solids vos soulaine et al 2021a soulaine et al 2021b soulaine and tchelepi 2016 the ale method is very accurate because no assumptions are made about solid geometry and the governing equations of continuum mechanics are solved with high precision however this approach presents numerical problems in the event of significant changes in pore structure e g complete ablation of mineral particles and blockage of pore throats which are not well addressed by current grid strategies soulaine et al 2017 due to the accuracy of the ale method the ale method can be used as a reference solution to verify other numerical methods when the topological structure of the model does not change the ls method requires solving an additional level set equation that tracks the evolution of interface position and curvature through advection and reinitialization of the level set function molins et al 2012 the solid phase is mapped to an euler grid using the volume fraction of solid minerals in each grid block a technique known as the vos method similar to the volume of fluid method used in cfd to track fluid fluid interfaces brackbill et al 1992 soulaine et al 2018 yang et al 2021 other interfaces tracing methods rely on lbm kang et al 2010 masoudi et al 2021 and sph tartakovsky et al 2007a tartakovsky et al 2007b in addition the phase field method can also be used to simulate the dissolution process of minerals bastidas olivares et al 2021 xu and meakin 2008 different from the above methods the phase field method uses order parameters to simulate the evolution process of the fluid solid interface the order parameters follow a separate differential equation and minimize the fluid solid free energy difference instead of the surface reaction rate equation xu and meakin 2011 furthermore like the level set the phase field method can also track the dynamic evolution of the interface through advective phase field variables the fluid solid interface in the phase field method is represented by diffusion boundary so the phase field method has smoother processing of interface curvature compared with the ls akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2013 xu et al 2012 although early phase field models of mineral dissolution and precipitation have been developed and coupled with the diffusion equation these methods have two shortcomings bastidas olivares et al 2021 rohde and von wolff 2020 firstly complex chemical surface energy and double well potential functions need to be constructed secondly the reliability of simulation results is not well verified to solve the above problems we proposed an improved phase field model to simulate pore scale reactive transport our phase field method is based on the two phase flow phase field method the dynamic evolution of the fluid solid interface is explicitly traced through advection phase field variables in the main control equation compared with the normal phase field method this avoids the complicated construction of chemical surface energy and double well potential function therefore our phase field method is simpler to use and has higher accuracy meanwhile the reliability and practicability of the phase field method are guaranteed by testing the benchmark problem moreover we use this model to demonstrate kozeny carman law and clarify its applicable conditions and scope in the model we directly construct the heaviside function through the phase field variables to achieve the characterization and dynamic tracking of a fluid solid interface and the mass flux boundary conditions formed by the dissolution reaction of mineral surface also adopt the same method the numerical implementation process of the model is described in detail in section 3 in section 4 we verify the reliability of the model by testing benchmark problems proposed by molins et al 2021 in section 5 we design a relatively complex pore geometry extend the model and discuss the evolving relationship between porosity and permeability 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations due to the low compressibility of water for most underground conditions the incompressible navier stokes equations can be used to accurately

dispersion interface model which is a powerful tool for describing the evolution of complex phase interfaces in non equilibrium states kobayashi 1993 to facilitate understanding we first introduce the phase field model commonly used to simulate gas liquid two phase flow in the next section of numerical implementation details we will discuss how to modify it to be suitable for a single phase flow solid phase field model through reasonable variable substitution and appropriate parameter values the phase field model is rooted in the concept of free energy and the free energy density f mix j m3

field or partial differential equations multi physics field in this paper the phase field model of gas liquid two phase flow is ingeniously combined with the heaviside function to form a phase field

though a lot of tests we think it is reasonable to set the value of Ï as 1e 9 m s kg 4 validation of the model 4 1 description of benchmark problems the benchmark problem describes the dissolution of a circular calcite grain in a simple two dimensional rectangular domain in the center fig 1 an acidic solution of ph 2 h inlet 10 5 mol cm3 is injected at the left inlet as a dirichlet boundary the problem considers a single irreversible chemical reaction 16 c a c o 3 s h c a 2 h c o 3 the dissolution reaction rate of minerals has a first order kinetic dependence on h concentration 17 r k m c h where r is the mineral reaction rate mol cm2 s the dissolution rate depends only on the concentration of h so only the transport of h needs to be considered the benchmark problem doesn t include multicomponent geochemical reactions in aqueous phases and a detailed description of the benchmark problem can be found in the study by molins et al 2021 the values of the various parameters in the benchmark problem are shown in table 1 to verify our model we also used the ale method to simulate the benchmark problem the accuracy and limitations of the method have been demonstrated in soulaine et al 2017 fig 2 shows the differences in mesh generation between the two methods the number of mesh generation in the phase field model is 9 866 with mesh size of 1 75e 2 5 0e 4 mm fig 2a while the number of mesh generation in the ale model is 16 302 with mesh size of 1 4e 2 2 0e 4 mm fig 2b in the ale model the mineral region is not covered by mesh which indicates that solid phase is not involved in calculation in the ale model it realizes the surface reaction of minerals through the flux boundary conditions inside the model and the evolution of the interface is realized through the coordinates of the moving grid which is the main feature of the ale model it should be noted that the value of Îµ of the phase field model is closely related to the division of the grid here we set the value of Îµ as 1e 5 m 4 2 verify the results the simulation process is divided into two parts the first part is the reaction stability stage and the simulation time is 0 5 s the second part is the interface evolution stage which lasts from 0 to 3000 s as shown in fig 3 when the flow velocity reaches stability a fast flow velocity channel is formed on the upper and lower sides of the mineral particles this is because the middle flow velocity is blocked by the middle mineral particles to the upper and lower sides therefore the velocity around the minerals is low on the left and right sides and high on the upper and lower sides the flow field of the phase field model is consistent with the ale model when the body force is increased in the intermediate mineral region the distribution of flow velocity determines the direction and intensity of solute transport here we first ensure the accuracy of flow field simulation which lays a foundation for subsequent simulation due to the consumption of h by the mineral surface dissolution reaction a significant concentration gradient appears near the surface of the calcite grain fig 4 the consumption rate of h is controlled by the surface dissolution reaction rate of calcite eq 17 and the diffusion rate of the h in the liquid phase the distribution of the h concentration is closely related to the simulation results of the flow field which makes the diffusion boundary layer of the h in the downstream mineral grains wider than that in the upstream this difference can be better observed when the ph is plotted fig 5 ph log10 h it should be noted that the concentration of the h in the inner circular region where the mineral particles are located is zero which is not caused by the reaction and its initial value is zero to verify the accuracy of solute field simulation results we set three transversals in the model red line represents horizontal the yellow line represents vertical and the blue line represents diagonal fig 5a and plot h concentration on these transversals in the form of ph which is compared with the simulation results of molins et al 2021 the article five different codes to simulate this benchmark problem the governing equations of these codes were all different but the simulation results showed good consistency which could be used as a reference standard for our simulation results the governing equation of the dissolfoam code is the same as the ale model so the simulation results of the ale model will not be repeated here starchenko 2022 the ph values increased and decreased sharply on the front and back sides of the mineral particles fig 5b as mineral dissolution consumes h ph increases at the grain front and occurs in the region of about 30 um the phase field model for the point closest to the liquid solid interface gives a ph of 3 38 while the ph of this point is 3 01 4 39 according to the other codes at the same point the simulated ph of the phase field model closest to the post grain boundary is 4 15 and the simulated ph of the other codes ranges from 3 47 to 4 35 fig 5b the vertical and horizontal ph transects showed similar patterns fig 5c the ph value of the phase field model at the left side of the axis nearest to the boundary point about 0 015 cm is 3 17 while the ph value of all other codes at the same point is 3 02 4 66 at the diagonal transect the ph values of the points closest to calcite grains predicted by the phase field model are 3 62 and 3 77 respectively which are almost identical to those predicted by other codes fig 5d to further verify the steady state simulation results we will accurately calculate the average concentration of h at the outlet and the average reaction rate of h at the mineral surface and compare them with the simulation results of the other codes the formula for calculating the average outlet concentration is as follows 18 c out s c u d s q where cout is the average concentration of h at the outlet mol cm3 q is the volume flow cm3 s which can be calculated as the integral of the velocity field vector over the cross sectional area q s u d s and s is the cross section of the outlet cm2 the average reaction rate is obtained by calculating the mass balance between the h concentration at the outlet and the inlet 19 r q c out c in a where r is the average reaction rate mol cm 2 s 1 cin is the inlet average concentration of the h mol cm3 and a is the surface area of the calcite grain cm2 fig 6 shows that all code takes roughly the same amount of time to reach a steady state in the stable state the average outlet concentration of the h obtained by the phase field model is 9 53 10 6 mol cm3 fig 6a 0 18 lower than that of chombo crunch 0 14 0 24 and 0 35 higher than that of lattice boltzmann openfoam dbs and dissolfoam respectively the relative differences are all less than 1 which indicates that the phase field model is in good agreement with the simulation results of other codes the average reaction rate calculated by the phase field model in steady state is 4 54 10 8 mol cm2 s fig 6b which is consistent with the steady state rate obtained by other codes the rate obtained in this study is 4 85 1 32 and 4 63 higher than that of chombo crunch openfoam and dissolfoam and 0 66 lower than that of lattice boltzmann in general the steady state dissolution rates obtained from the phase field model match well with other codes compared to the first part of the simulation here the model runs for 3000 s much longer than the previous part the surface area and grain size of the minerals exposed to the fluid decrease over time due to the prolonged dissolution reaction fig 7 b and fig 8 although the shrinkage of the particles reduces the h involved in the reaction the effective reaction rate of the particles increases as the particle area decreases fig 7a this is because as the grains become smaller the diffusion control over the overall reaction rate decreases when the phase field model was simulated to 2700 s the surface area was 0 0334 cm2 while the initial surface area was 0 0628 cm2 this represents a 46 8 change in surface area meanwhile during the same time the surface area changes simulated by dissolfoam vortex openfoam dbs lattice boltzmann and chombo crunch are 45 6 48 1 41 9 46 5 and 43 2 respectively fig 7b the calculated grain volume change at the same time t 2700 s simulated by phase field model was 8 64e 5 cm3 while the initial surface area was 3 14e 4 cm3 this shows that 72 5 of grain dissolved during the simulated time period meanwhile during the same time the grain volume changes simulated by dissolfoam vortex openfoam dbs lattice boltzmann and chombo crunch are 71 1 72 9 67 1 70 9 and 68 7 respectively fig 7c in general the relative error of the phase field model is within 10 compared with all codes for the simulation results of reaction rate and reaction surface area the asymmetry of the concentration field will lead to the uneven contraction of the mineral geometry as the simulation time goes on the dissolved part of the downstream grain is much less than that of the upstream grain and its shape changes from round to pear shaped fig 8 fig 8 shows the evolution of grain shapes calculated by different codes the grain shapes of all codes are similar but there are some significant differences over long periods fig 8c compared with other models the advantages of phase field model are mainly manifested in two points one is that the fluid solid interface is smooth and non jagged fig 8 the other is that it can simulate the complete dissolution of grains this is reflected in section 5 our model can achieve both functions at the same time 5 application of the model here we apply the verified phase field model to a more complex porous medium and discuss the mineral dissolution process under different migration and reaction rates furthermore we demonstrate the limited applicability of this constitutive model by calculating the permeability of porous media during dissolution and comparing the results with the kozeny carman constitutive model commonly used on the rev scale as shown in fig 9 a the porous media is represented by a group of calcite grains with different radii whose radii follow a normal distribution and are randomly placed in the model region 0 1 0 05 cm and these grains do not overlap with each other the number of mesh generation in the model is 177 483 with mesh size of 1 4e 2 2 0e 4 mm fig 9b here two simulation cases are designed different simulation cases correspond to different peclet numbers pe uinw d uin is the normal inflow velocity of the left inlet w is the width of the model area and damkÃ¶hler numbers da kmw d other conditions and parameters of the model are consistent with the benchmark problem table 2 in general the dissolution rate of individual calcite grains depends on the concentration of the solute involved in the reaction in the nearby fluid and the replenishing rate of consumed solutes in case 1 fig 10 a fig 10b and fig 10c advection is the main control factor of the migration process driven by advection solutes can be transported to the downstream region of porous media in the initial stage as can be seen in fig 10b the dissolution of upstream and downstream particles is synchronized but the dissolution rate of upstream grains is faster than that of downstream particles this is because the solute consumed by the dissolution of the upstream grains is preferentially replenished while the concentration of the solute replenished downstream is from the upstream unconsumed solute resulting in a relatively low concentration of the downstream solute in case 2 fig 10a fig 10b and fig 10c diffusion is the main control factor of the transport process and the solute fails to diffuse into the downstream region of the porous medium because the reaction rate in case 2 is much faster than in case 1 the solute is completely consumed upstream resulting in almost no solute diffusion to the downstream region from the point of view of time although the dissolution of grains in case 2 is not synchronized the dissolution rate and diffusion rate of case 2 are fast enough so the complete dissolution time of grains in case 2 is much less than that in case 1 in darcy s law permeability is a constant coefficient related to fluid flow and dielectric material parameters which is calculated by the following formula 20 k q Î¼ l s Î´ p where k is the permeability m2 Î´p is the pressure difference applied around the medium pa and l is the length of the medium in the flow direction m for porous media the kozeny carman law can be used to estimate permeability in terms of porosity and specific surface area of the medium kozeny carman law can be written as bear 1972 li et al 2010 tian and wang 2018 21 k kc n 3 1 n 2 m 2 c where kkc is empirical permeability m2 n is porosity m is the specific surface area of the medium and c is the kozeny constant which is related to the geometry of channels in porous media from eqs 20 and 21 we can derive eqs 22 and 23 22 k k 0 q q 0 Î´ p 0 Î´ p 23 k kc k 0 k c n n 0 3 1 n 0 1 n 2 m 0 m 2 where k0 is the initial permeability m2 Î´ p0 is the initial pressure difference pa k0kc is the initial empirical permeability m2 n0 is the initial porosity and m0 is the initial specific surface area of the medium when eq 23 is applied in practice the change of specific surface area is usually ignored so we can get the following equation 24 k kc k 0 k c n n 0 3 1 n 0 1 n 2 the relative changes of permeability are calculated by eq 22 and the relative changes of empirical permeability are calculated by eqs 23 and 24 since the change of specific surface area is considered in eq 23 for calculating the relative changes of empirical permeability the results obtained in case 1 and case 2 are different when calculating the empirical permeability using the kozeny carman law fig 11 in other words if the change of specific surface area is not considered in eq 23 the empirical permeability of case 1 and case 2 be calculated using kozeny carman law and the results will be the same as can be seen from fig 11a the kozeny carman law is quite accurate in predicting permeability changes in the range of porosity changes less than 15 n n0 1 100 in the reaction transport process dominated by advection but the error increases with further porosity changes in contrast the kozeny carman law predicts a deviation from the actual change in permeability in reaction transport where diffusion dominates fig 11b and this deviation tends to increase further as porosity changes in summary we believe that the kozeny carman law is more suitable for reactive transport problems dominated by convection and the 15 porosity range is sufficient to cover most engineering practical problems in addition it is worth noting that in previous studies changes in specific surface area were ignored when the kozeny carman law was used so we believe that this treatment method will reduce the accuracy of the kozeny carman law 6 summary and conclusion the main work of this paper is to implement a general fluid solid coupling simulation method at the pore scale with the help of the phase field module of multi physical field coupling simulation software comsol and to track the dynamic evolution of the fluid solid interface using the phase field method using this model we systematically study the nonlinear coupling between reactive transport and the structural evolution of porous media due to mineral dissolution the simulation of the dissolution of a single calcite particle in a single microchannel is in good agreement with that of molins et al 2021 which verifies the validity of the phase field method on the pore scale for such problems these good validation results provide us with great confidence in applying the model to larger scale rock dissolution simulation results under different reaction transport conditions show that the phase field method can be used to predict complex fluid solid interface evolution in pore space including topological changes such as the complete dissolution of solids this method can also be used to predict the relationship between permeability and porosity during the evolution of porous media under different migration conditions and reaction rates this permeability porosity relationship is critical for reliability simulations at the rev scale our simulation results partially modify the permeability porosity relationship prediction by kozeny carman law and further clarify the precise applicability of the equation despite a simplified first order dissolution reaction rate model being used in the simulation some useful conclusions can be drawn from the simulation results when advection is the main mode of reactive transport the dissolution of grains in the upstream and downstream regions occurs almost simultaneously in porous media however diffusion is the main mode of solute transport and when the reaction rate is fast dissolution will occur preferentially in the upstream region of porous media in addition when advection dominates the reaction transport process the kozeny carman law is relatively accurate in predicting the permeability porosity relationship provided that changes in the specific surface area of the mineral are considered if the changes in specific surface area are ignored the kozeny carman law becomes much less accurate here we will provide a workflow for improving the accuracy of kozeny carman law meanwhile we also provide a reference method for calculating permeability when the kozeny carman law does not apply using the toughreact simulator as an example the kozeny carman law is used to calculate the porosity permeability relationship for convection dominated reaction migration where the porosity change is within the 15 range taking into account the specific surface area change of all minerals involved in reaction by weighted average when the kozeny carman law is no longer applicable a multi scale micro macro coupling model is suggested to deal with the problems and this is the focus of our next research work the phase field model used in this study is particularly suitable for systematically investigating the nonlinear coupling among mineral dissolution reactions fluid flow and solute transport in pore space the next step is to couple more complex geochemical reactions into the model through external calls such as coupling simulation of phreeqc with comsol which we have
