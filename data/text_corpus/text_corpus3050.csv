15250,the rupture of cytoderm and extracellular polymeric substances eps and competitive inhibition of methanogens are the main bottlenecks for medium chain fatty acids mcfas production from waste activated sludge was this study proposes a promising ferrate fe vi based technique to enhance mcfas production from was through accelerating was disintegration and substrates transformation and eliminating competitive inhibition of methanogens simultaneously results shows that the maximal mcfas production attains 8106 3 mg cod l under 85 mg fe g tss being 58 6 times that of without fe vi pretreatment mechanism exploration reveals that fe vi effectively destroys eps and cytoderm through electron transfer reactive oxygen species generation i e oh o2 and 1o2 and elevated alkalinity resulting in the transfer of organics from solid to soluble phase and from macromolecules to intermediates generation and transformation of intermediates analyses illustrate that fe vi facilitates hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation ce but suppresses methanogenesis promoting the targeted conversion of intermediates to mcfas also fe vi pretreatment provides potential electron shuttles for chain elongation microbial community and functional genes encoding key enzymes analysis indicates that fe vi screens key microorganisms and up regulates functional genes expression involved in ce pathways overall this technology avoids methanogens inhibitor addition and stimulates vivianite synthesis during mcfas production from was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords medium chain fatty acids mcfas chain elongation ce extracellular polymeric substances eps ferrate fe vi functional genes waste activated sludge was data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment facilities are rapidly expanding to meet the demands of a growing population and expanding industry resulting in the generation of large volumes of waste activated sludge was li et al 2015a increasing sludge quantity brings strong economic burdens and potential environmental problems however was contains considerable amounts of organic compounds such as proteins lipids and carbohydrates etc making it a preferred and inexpensive biomass resource therefore a sustainable development mode of wastewater treatment would be established if the organic carbons in was were extracted as high value products in subsequent process anaerobic fermentation has been extensively employed for sludge reduction and energy recovery due to its simple operation and moderate conditions wang et al 2022c the organics in was are eventually converted to short chain fatty acids scfas or methane ch4 in the common mode batstone et al 2002 whereas scfas are difficult to isolate and purify from the fermentation liquor due to their high solubility and methane has a low energy density with potent greenhouse effects wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 medium chain fatty acids mcfas as the promising substitutes for scfas and ch4 are saturated carboxylic acids with 6 to 12 carbons ge et al 2015 in the presence of appropriate electron donor ed such as ethanol the scfas produced by sludge fermentation can be upgraded to mcfas via chain elongation ce wu et al 2021 owing to their good separability and high energy density mcfas are more easily recovered from fermentation liquor and can be used as precursors for biofuels production to alleviate increasing energy demands or for biochemicals synthesis such as pharmaceuticals antimicrobial agents and food additives wu et al 2019 additionally the production of mcfas can reduce carbon footprint because the elongators require carbon dioxide co2 to synthesize endocellular proteins roghair et al 2018 thus it is a profitable and preferable approach to utilize was as substrates for mcfas production nonetheless the poor biodegradability restricts sludge hydrolysis and acidification and methanogenesis process leads to rapid scfas consumption as a consequence scfas accumulation is usually at a low level implying that a low quantity of electron acceptors ea i e scfas could be available for ce process therefore mcfas production from was can be enhanced by pretreatments such as the alkaline acid mechanical and heat methods which are commonly devoted to improving anaerobic was fermentation gonzalez et al 2018 thereinto advanced oxidation technology is promising for accelerating was disintegration and hydrolysis due to its high efficiency for example xu et al 2021 indicated that after 0 2 g g tss total suspended solids kmno4 pretreatment the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod attained at 157 5 mg g tss li et al 2015a reported cao2 dosing effectively enhanced scfas production from was through promoting sludge solubilization and inhibiting methanogenesis ferrate fe vi has recently risen to prominence as a versatile and environmentally friendly water treatment reagent with a high oxidizing capacity wang et al 2020 several reactions could be involved in the fe vi triggered oxidation process including i 1 e and 2 e transfer processes to produce fe v and fe iv species ii radical species and h2o2 production from self decompositions iii attacking contaminants by fe v and fe iv iv self decompositions of high valent iron species vi v and iv v reactions of ferrate with reactive oxygen species o 2 and h2o2 sharma et al 2015 briefly fe vi is finally transformed to fe iii in an oxidation reaction and can be simplified as feo4 2 8h 3e fe3 4h2o ni et al 2020 as a strong oxidizing agent fe vi has been employed in bacteria and virus inactivation micropollutants degradation microcystins removal and cytoderm destruction of waste biomass e g microalgae ni et al 2020 rai et al 2018 wang et al 2020 recent investigations indicated that fe vi is a green technology for sludge treatment such as promoting organics solubilization and enhancing the conversion of substrates to scfas or methane hu et al 2020 li et al 2018 these facts inspire us to employ the environmentally friendly fe vi technique to promote mcfas production from anaerobic was fermentation this study was aimed to investigate the feasibility of fe vi pretreatment in enhancing mcfas production from anaerobic sludge fermentation when ethanol severs as a typical electron donor ed example for chain elongation ce the was was pretreated for 24 h with different levels of fe vi followed by serving as substrates for mcfas production the mcfas production and percentage from the pretreated was and the control were specifically compared the impact of fe vi on was solubilization was examined and the integrity of cytoderm and structure of eps were investigated so as to explore the mechanism of soluble organic compounds release also the reactive oxygen species ros during was disintegration with fe vi and the reaction mechanisms of fe vi with was were enclosed by electron spin resonance esr technology besides the effects of fe vi on proteinic structure and degradation were disclosed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis moreover the influences of fe vi on the main bioprocesses i e hydrolysis acidification ce and methanogenesis were individually assessed to further clarify underlying mechanisms for the improvement of mcfas production additionally the impacts of fe vi on microbial community and key metabolic pathways related to ce were specifically analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 primary properties of feedstock and inoculum the was used in this study was taken from a domestic wwtp in tianjin to eliminate impurities the was was filtered by sieves 2 2 mm2 and 1 1 mm2 after that it was concentrated to a usable solid level by removing excess water and stored in a refrigerator 4 c before usage the following are the key characteristics of concentrated sludge tss 18970 150 mg l vss 11383 120 mg l tcod 17700 390 mg l scod 250 30 mg l total proteins 9475 320 mg cod l total polysaccharides 1826 60 mg cod l and ph 6 8 0 1 the inoculum used for fermentation stage was taken from a semi continuous mesophilic anaerobic fermenter using was as substrate 170 mmol l ethanol as ed and 0 05 m 2 bromoethanesulfonate as methanogens inhibitor wu et al 2021 the fermenter was maintained at 35 c with a sludge retention time of 15 days 2 2 was pretreatment with fe vi to disintegrate was and increase substrates release from sludge solid phase the experiment of fe vi pretreatment was carried out in five serum bottles v 600 ml each reactor i e the serum bottle firstly received 300 ml was followed by a certain quantity of fe vi i e 0 17 34 51 and 85 mg fe g tss then the was ferrate mixture was homogenized on magnetic stirrers after 24 h pretreatment 30 ml was was withdrawn from each reactor for further chemical analyses it should be emphasized that the ferrate dosage and pretreatment time were based on previous studies he et al 2018 wang et al 2020 to obtain reliable results the pretreatment experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 experiments for mcfas production from pretreated sludge these experiments were aimed to clarify the feasibility of fe vi pretreatment in improving mcfas production from was a set of serum bottles v 600ml were employed as fermenters in these tests then each bottle contained 270 ml disintegrated was as substrates and 30 ml inoculum wang et al 2020 subsequently 170 mmol l ethanol serving as typical ed for ce was supplemented to each fermenter so as to perform mcfas production wu et al 2021 afterwards the ph was adjusted to 5 5 0 1 with hcl and naoh hence the elongators would be stimulated for mcfas production within the optimal ph range wang et al 2021 finally all the fermenters were flushed with n2 sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and incubated at 35 c with a rotation speed of 120 rpm during fermentation the samples 10 ml were taken out for detection every two days it should be noted that no extra growth medium and methanogens inhibitor were used for microbial metabolism and methane suppression in this work each experiment for mcfas production was carried out in triplicate 2 4 evaluating the impact of fe vi on substrates release and structural integrity of was was solubilization is the rate determining step of anaerobic fermentation the contribution of fe vi oxidation to was solubilization was firstly evaluated by the concentrations of soluble proteins spn soluble carbohydrates sch and scod after pretreatment then the details of how fe vi facilitating organic components solubilization were elucidated by investigating the structural integrity changes of was flocs from the perspectives of cells rupture and eps disintegration the degree of cytoderm cytomembrane damage could be indicated by lactate dehydrogenase ldh release which was quantified by using a ldh assay kit solarbio life sciences based on the instructions supporting information si also the rupture of cytoderm cytomembrane was reflected by the ratio of live dead cells to total cells measured by a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit bbcellprobe n01 pi with analytical procedures described in si besides a modified heating method with little cell lysis and high performance was employed for eps extraction including the loosely bound lb and tightly bound tb eps li and yang 2007 and the extraction method was detailed in si accordingly the intracellular release induced by fe vi could be quantified by the cod difference between dom and eps before and after pretreatment shown in si he et al 2016 wang et al 2022a furthermore the changes in functional groups and composition of the organics in the supernatant and eps were characterized by ftir xps and eem technologies 2 5 identification of reactive oxygen species ros involved in fe vi pretreatment the ros existing in the fe vi based pretreatment system were confirmed using electron spin resonance esr analysis which was accomplished by an esr spectrometer jeol jes fa200 japan briefly after 20 min of reaction a sample of was from the experimental reactor was collected for each ros detection the trapping agent for oh and o 2 was 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo while the 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidine temp was used for 1o2 detection these trapping agents i e dmpo and temp can react with reactive oxygen species to generate detectable adducts that have specific signals in epr spectra li et al 2022 wang et al 2022a 2 6 impact of fe vi on hydrolysis acidification chain elongation ce and methanogenesis substrate degradation and mcfas accumulation through anaerobic fermentation contain several bio processes i e hydrolysis acidification ce and methanogenesis wang et al 2021 the released macromolecular organics firstly undergo hydrolysis driven by extracellular hydrolases and decompose to monomers followed by acidification with scfas production subsequently two diverse pathways are related to scfas transformation i e ce and methanogenesis thereby the impact of fe vi on these processes could be indicated by substrates degradation activities of key enzymes and transformation of metabolic intermediates detailed in si 2 7 microbial community characterization and metagenomic analysis the microbial community and metagenomic analysis were achieved by high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna the samples were respectively collected from the control 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss groups after a long term operation the primers of pcr amplification were chosen as 338f 806r in accord with previous studies wu et al 2020 more information about sequencing and functional gene analysis were detailed in si 2 8 other analyses the conventional procedures were used to measure ts vs tss and vss apha 2005 the hach test kits 20 1500 mg cod l were used to measure scod and tcod a ph meter was used for ph adjustment in this study mettler toledo switzerland the proteins and carbohydrates were measured according to previous study wang et al 2022b the concentrations of total fe and fe2 in soluble phase were determined using orthophenanthroline spectrophotometry li et al 2015b to define the principal functional groups in the eps and soluble compounds the samples from the control and experimental groups were firstly freeze dried at 80 c for drying and then examined using an ftir spectrometer detailed in si the elemental composition and local functioning of the samples derived from the control and experimental groups were determined by xps detailed in si an eem fluorescence spectrometer hitachi f 2710 was used to identify the composition and contents of organic substances in soluble and eps fractions si to detect the crystalline vivianite the fermented sludge was examined by x ray diffractometer d8 advance to generate x ray diffractograms xrd and the methods were detailed in si the morphology of anaerobically fermented was was examined by scanning electron microscopes sem with the sample preparation procedures depicted in si for analyzing the concentration of carboxylates and alcohols a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu equipped with the fid detector and hydrogen generator was employed after each sampling event si the quantities of h2 and ch4 in biogas were determined using a different gc sp 7890 plus lunan si 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of fe vi pretreatment on mcfas production from was fig 1 records the concentrations and distributions of products obviously mcfas production reaches a stationary level after 16 days in the control and 17 mg fe g tss groups mcfas formation i e n caproate occurs at day 14 with respective maximum concentrations being 138 3 mg cod l and 82 7 mg cod l the negligible mcfas production might be attributed to limited was degradation at these conditions and or competitive inhibitions to ce microorganisms induced by some electron consuming microbes such as methanogens wu et al 2019 in comparison with fe vi dosage increasing from 34 to 51 mg fe g tss the maximum of n caproate and n caprylate is enhanced from 2826 7 and 302 2 mg cod l to 4454 3 and 2113 6 mg cod l respectively it was reported that the maximum scfas accumulation reached 343 0 mg cod g vss under the optimal fe vi dose i e 56 mg fe g tss he et al 2018 thus with the presence of ed the generated scfas are effectively upgraded to mcfas by ce microbes nevertheless for the 85 mg fe g tss group n caproate cannot be further elongated to n caprylate due to that ethanol is completely consumed fig s1a resulting in n caproate of 8106 3 mg cod l as the only mcfa which is apparently higher than that of the previous study li et al 2021b that used 170 mm ethanol as ed notably the total contents of carboxylates and alcohols are dose dependent during the initial 4 days of fermentation and the impact of fe vi on lag phase of mcfas production occurs in a similar way such as lower carboxylates and alcohols contents and increased lag phase in the 85 mg fe g tss group these facts indicate that fe vi pretreatment at high levels might cause certain inhibitions to the initial activity of fermentative and ce microorganisms besides fe vi pretreatment also enhances cumulative hydrogen production from was and the maximum value increases from 42 0 ml i e the control to 113 7 ml i e 85 mg g tss group fig s1b interestingly the profile of hydrogen accumulation is consistent with that of mcfas production indicating hydrogen is mainly derived from ce stage the longer lag phase i e 4 days for 85 mg g tss group further reflects the inhibiting effect of fe vi on functional microbial activity some previous studies have also demonstrated that fe vi could cause inhibitions on anaerobic functional microbes such as hydrogen producers acidogens and methanogens with a range of 28 2 140 mg fe g tss he et al 2018 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020a these observations above suggest that fe vi pretreatment significantly enhances mcfas and hydrogen production from was interestingly mcfas are scarcely generated in the ethanol inoculum group i e the blank fig s2 confirming that the presence of ea i e scfa derived from the pretreated was is the precondition of feasible ce furthermore the primary products are n butanol and n iso butyrate in control and 17 mg fe g tss groups accounting for 92 2 and 91 0 of the products respectively fig 1f in contrast fe vi pretreatment with appropriate dose significantly decrease butanol and butyrate proportions while largely increase mcfas percentages specifically mcfas percentage for the 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss is respectively 58 3 and 47 3 it suggests that fe vi efficiently improves mcfas proportion and reduces the electron flows from substrates to by products 3 2 effect and mechanisms of fe vi on was solubilization 3 2 1 was solubilization and substrates release ce process can be seen as a secondary fermentation of was with the primary fermentation products i e scfas as ea and external ethanol as ed wang et al 2021 thus sludge disintegration and substrate release are the precondition for the formation of ea as displayed in fig 2 a fe vi causes conspicuous disintegration on was flocs increasing scod from 370 0 mg l the control to 6060 0 mg l 85 mg fe g tss the optimal dose of fe vi for was dissolution was significantly different in previous studies ranging from 28 2 to 140 mg fe g tss he et al 2018 hu et al 2020 li et al 2018 li et al 2020a generally sludge dissolution was significantly enhanced with the increase of fe vi dose whereas excess fe vi would react with released organics and result in soluble substrates reduction li et al 2018 as the main organic components in was proteins and polysaccharides are markedly transformed from solid phase to the supernatant fig 2a briefly the concentration of spn or sch increases from 78 4 or 29 1 mg cod l to 2264 4 or 700 8 mg cod l after fe vi pretreatment xps analysis characterizes the chemical nature of c on the surface of soluble substances fig 2b the c 1s spectra can be deconvoluted to 3 4 bond peaks in this study li et al 2021a yin et al 2015 peak 1 is due to c c and c h predominantly from hydrocarbon like organics namely polysaccharides lateral chain of lipids or lateral chain of amino acids peak 2 is associated with c o and c n from alcohol ether amine or amide groups in polysaccharides and proteins peak 3 is related to c o and o c o indicating the presence of carboxyl acetal hemiacetal amide or hemiacetal groups peak 4 belongs to coor commonly presented in carboxyl or ester groups compared to the control the sum of area of peak 1 and peak 2 increases from 66 8 to 82 6 indicating the distinct releases of polysaccharides and proteins from solid phase of was after fe vi pretreatment li et al 2021a notably peak 4 only occurs in the experimental sample suggesting that fe vi possibly induces macromolecular organics acidification during pretreatment step liu et al 2020 the differentiation of the functional groups and main compositions in dom is further investigated by ftir fig 2c and eem spectra fig 2d based on the position of specific peaks the functional groups in ftir spectra can be assigned to four main categories i e proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids aromatic amino acids and hydrocarbons table s1 li et al 2021b xu et al 2018 yin et al 2015 fe vi increases the intensity of bond 1657 18 cm 1 which is closely related to the stretching vibrations of c o and c n groups in proteins the wavelengths at 1095 27 cm 1 represents vibration of c oh and c o c in polysaccharides or carbohydrates and its intensity in dom significantly increases due to fe vi pretreatment the transmission spectrum from 3378 31 cm 1 is indicative of o h group stretching in humic substances hs i e humic acids and fulvic acids wang et al 2019 the obvious increase of its intensity implies that fe vi pretreatment promotes the dissolution of solid phase hs accumulated in was the eem spectra can reflect the change of five types of organic compounds in sludge detailed in si li et al 2020c for the fe vi pretreated sludge the fluorescence intensities of biodegradable constituents i e microbial byproduct like increase dramatically fig 2d manifesting that substantial solid phase substrates are converted to dissolved organics and can be readily utilized by fermentative and scfa forming bacteria wang et al 2020 additionally obvious fluorescence responses to hs i e peak 3 and peak 4 appear on eem spectrum after fe vi pretreatment consistent with the analysis of ftir spectra fig 2c hs rich in redox active surface groups could serve as important electron transfer mediators to accept and donate electrons or facilitate microbial energy metabolism such as the production of nad p h and atp li et al 2016 tang et al 2022 specially hs have been widely verified as electron shuttles to promote complex substrates i e proteins and polysaccharides decomposition and dissimilatory fe iii reduction in anaerobic environments roden et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 consequently it would be conducive to sludge hydrolysis through dissimilatory iron reduction of fe iii induced from fe vi more importantly hs might play a role in electrons flow from ed to ea because of its electrons accepting and donating capacities thereby facilitating ce pathways and ea upgrading 3 2 2 underlying mechanisms of fe vi promoting was solubilization in order to clarify the mechanisms of enhanced was solubilization responses of sludge structures to fe vi pretreatment were deeply investigated as shown in fig 3 a and 3b fe vi increases the concentration of cod proteins and carbohydrates in lb eps fraction while decreases the organic constituents in tb eps it indicates that fe vi breaks the stable structure of sludge eps and causes migration and transformation of eps composition from tb fraction to lb fraction and dom li et al 2020c similarly fe vi pretreatment obviously decreases the eem spectral intensity of tb fraction proving the reduction of organic substances in tb fraction fig s3 the prominent decrement of specific peaks intensities in ftir spectra further hints the significant releases of proteins polysaccharides hs and aromatic amino from tb fraction fig 3c the disruption of eps can be further supported by sem images of the fermented was as displayed in fig 3e the microorganisms in the control are mainly wrapped by eps while numerous microorganisms can be found in the experimental was after anaerobic fermentation fig 3f based on the calculation of intracelluar release fe vi pretreatment significantly increases the release and dissolution of intracelluar substances fig s4 implying serious damage to cytoderm cytomembrane he et al 2016 potassium is a typical element inside microbial cells and the integrality of microbial cytoderm can be assessed by potassium content in the supernatant or was surface li et al 2020b li et al 2021a as an intracellular enzyme ldh is an integrity marker of cytoderm cytomembrane wang et al 2020 in fig 3d ldh release in the pretreated was is significantly higher than that of the control suggesting fe vi induces serious cells lysis and significant intracellular substances release supported by the increased potassium content fig s5 interestingly the 85 mg fe g tss of ferrate results in a minor decrease on ldh content it might be attributed to that the strong oxidizing property of ferrate causes damages to ldh activity moreover the living cells represented by fluorescent green decrease while the dead cells represented by fluorescent red increase in the was with the increased fe vi dosage fig s6 the ratio of live to total cells is 92 6 for the control whereas it declines to 57 2 34 mg fe g tss 38 9 51 mg fe g tss and 22 3 85 mg fe g tss after fe vi pretreatment it intuitively reflects the rupture capacities of fe vi on microbial cytoderm cytomembrane 3 2 3 underlying oxidation mechanisms of fe vi for was disintegration according to previous studies fe vi would oxidize was through 1 and 2e transfer leading to numerous reactions and the formation of intermediates i e fe v fe iv h2o2 and oh sharma 2013 sharma et al 2015 fe v and fe iv have been widely confirmed as the intermediates for fe vi based oxidization which could further disintegrate was and be eventually converted to fe iii or fe ii sharma 2013 sharma et al 2015 as shown in fig s7 fe vi largely causes ph elevation after 30 min reaction which is undisputedly conducive to the release and hydrolysis of particulate substrates in was wang et al 2020 besides the formation h2o2 in situ could cause the generation of reactive oxygen species ros playing an important role in was solubilization wang et al 2019 however little information is yet available about the generation of ros in fe vi based oxidization system fig 4 a shows that the dmpo oh dmpo o 2 and temp 1o2 adducts are determined in the fe vi based pretreatment system indicating the production of oh o 2 and 1o2 which possibly be attributed to the generation and activation of h2o2 in situ with strong oxidability these ros can attack eps and penetrate cytoderm into cytoplasm resulting in eps decomposition and cells rupture these observations clarify that fe vi effectively decomposes eps and cytoderm through electron transfer elevated alkalinity and reactive oxygen species generation i e oh o 2 and 1o2 resulting in the significant increase of dom such as spn and scn accordingly the schematic diagram for the oxidation reaction mechanism of fe vi disintegrating was can be obtained and is described in fig 4b 3 3 effect of fe vi pretreatment on intermediates generation and transformation 3 3 1 decomposition and transformation of macromolecular organics generally mcfas production from anaerobic was fermentation mainly includes three successive bio processes i e hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation ce proteins are the main biodegradable substrates accounting for 53 5 of tcod in this study whose stability can be affected by their conformational structure to characterize the alteration of proteinic conformation the amide i band i e located at 1700 1600 cm 1 in ftir spectra of the soluble fraction and tb fraction is subjected to curve fitting analysis fig 5 a after fe vi pretreatment peak 1 i e aggregated strands at 1610 1625 cm 1 of the soluble fraction disappears and the abundance of secondary structures in both soluble and tb fractions changes implying the variation of proteinic natures α helix β sheet and random coil are important factors for determining proteins stability and low α helix β sheet random coil proportion may lead to loose proteinic structure li et al 2020b as outlined in table s2 fe vi increases the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil in dom from 70 2 to 89 2 while decreases that of tb eps from 45 1 to 41 2 it hints that fe vi alters the proteinic conformation making the proteins in dom more stable while looser in tb eps compared to the sludge floc with intact structure soluble organics or loosely structured eps are more easily accessed and hydrolyzed by microbes due to lesser steric hindrance to extracellular hydrolases hence the loose tb eps fraction is conducive to being degraded and providing channels for the secretion of extracellular enzymes such as hydrolases the increase in the α helix β fold random coil ratio in dom might be primarily ascribed to the chemical flocculation of proteins with generated fe iii the presence of fe iii can enrich dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria and facilitate substrates hydrolysis zhan et al 2021 in addition to hydrogen bonds the formation and stability of proteinic structural conformation are also affected by disulfide bond s s functional groups li et al 2021a wu et al 2017 specific evidence for the change of s s is obtained by xps s2p spectra analysis fig 5b it can be found that the area of s s bonds in soluble fraction reduces from 43 3 to 39 5 due to fe vi pretreatment it indicates that fe vi possibly causes the rupture of proteinic s s bonds in was hinting the degradation of proteins released from eps and microbial cells as displayed in the xps spectra of n1s fig 5b the area of protein n in dom decreases from 100 to 76 9 because of fe vi pretreatment accordingly the area of inorganic n increases from 0 to 23 1 implying the transformation and degradation of macromolecular substrates after fe vi pretreatment all the findings above prove that fe vi can induce structural destruction of organic substrates e g proteins in was which are more susceptible to subsequent hydrolysis and acidification bioprocesses 3 3 2 potentials of intermediates generation and transformation after hydrolysis and acidification of organic substrates released from was the produced scfas subsequently serve as ea in the ce process and would be elongated to mcfas consequently scfas are the important intermediates and the potentials of their generation and transformation in the fermentation system have essential influences on mcfas production as shown in fig 5c i the soluble proteins significantly reduce in the sludge pretreated by 51 and 85 mg fe g tss during anaerobic fermentation supported by the obviously increased ammonia nitrogen concentration with ferrate dosage fig 5c ii it hints the rapid hydrolysis and acidification of organic substrates e g proteins released from was disintegration the elevation of protease activity 23 6 152 0 in the pretreated fermented sludge also indicates the enhancement of substrates hydrolysis fig 5c iii nonetheless at the initial stage of anaerobic fermentation 0 2d the content of ammonia nitrogen decreases when ferrate dose reaches 85 mg fe g tss uncovering the inhibition of fe vi on initial microbial activity in accord with the results of fig 1 the fe iii produced from pretreatment stage is gradually reduced to fe ii during anaerobic fermentation and concentration of fe2 is closely to that of total fe in the soluble phase revealing the existence of dissimilatory iron reduction fig s8 the fe iii reducing bacteria can utilize diverse substrates and promote hydrolysis and acidification of complex substrates in was zhan et al 2021 after chemical decomposition biohydrolysis the complex substrates are converted to monomers such as glucose and amino acids which are the precursors of scfas formation wang et al 2021 as intermediates the production of scfas from was cannot be directly quantified because of their consumption by elongators with the presence of ed therefore the activity of scfas producers in the pretreated fermented sludge are characterized by using model substrates i e glutamate and glucose on day 1 or day 3 the scfas production in the control is 478 8 or 1610 4 mg cod l while the value largely increases to 641 1 or 3222 4 mg cod l and 610 7 or 3054 4 mg cod l in the 51 and 85 mg fe g tss reactors fig 5d i respectively the facts suggest that fe vi can enhance the conversion of hydrolysates to scfas which is possibly ascribed to the enrichment of acid producing bacteria by fe vi after 16 days of acclimation the fermented sludge is also used for model substrates i e ethanol and acetate tests to examine the impact of fe vi on ce process as shown in fig 5d ii mcfas production in the control group is negligible on day 4 while in the 51 and 85 mg fe g tss reactors mcfas yield increases to 1361 0 and 882 7 mg cod l respectively it indicates stronger microbial activity for ce process in the pretreated fermented sludge additionally the methanogenesis process is also affected by fe vi fig 5d iii after anaerobic fermentation the cumulative methane production is 46 2 ml for the control whereas it is close to zero for the pretreated fermented sludge i e 51 and 85 mg fe g tss it illustrates that the hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogenesis are seriously inhibited by fe vi pretreatment in turn favoring mcfas production all the results above demonstrate that fe vi pretreatment improves the hydrolysis acidification and ce processes that is promotes the generation and targeted transformation i e mcfas of intermediates 3 4 microbial analysis 3 4 1 impact of fe vi pretreatment on microbial community compositions the results of rarefaction curves reflect the representativeness and reliability of the sequencing depth fig s9a according to the analysis of venn diagram and α diversity metrics fig s9b fe vi pretreatment cuts down the microbial diversity and richness confirming its destructions on microorganisms fig 6 a displays the phylum level distributions of community compositions in the three reactors i e control 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss the predominant microbes are affiliated to actinobacteriota firmicutes and chloroflexi in the three fermenters which commonly exist in anaerobic fermentation system and closely associated with substrate degradation wang et al 2022c yu et al 2019 thereinto actinobacteriota are the most abundant microbes in experimental groups it is increased from 15 7 control to 39 4 51 mg fe g tss and 37 5 85 mg fe g tss exhibiting significant correlations with mcfas production firmicutes are reported to be in relevant to ce process such as mcfas production from liquor making wastewater wu et al 2018 and mcfas generation from was with zerovalent iron zvi addition wang et al 2020 with an increase from 21 8 control to 26 6 51 mg fe g tss and 25 3 85 mg fe g tss in this study further studies at genus level fig 6b illustrate that fe vi pretreatment causes the enrichment of functional microorganisms responsible for hydrolysis acidification and ce processes with the total abundance increased from 17 7 control to 41 7 51 mg fe g tss and 42 4 85 mg fe g tss for instances the abundance of macellibacteroides sp which could degrade peptone cellobiose or ferment glucose into lactate and scfas jabari et al 2012 was 2 7 and 2 1 in the respective 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss fermenters whereas it is only 0 03 in the control fermenter romboutsia sp paraclostridium sp norank f saccharimonadales sp and sedimentibacter sp are generally detected anaerobes related to hydrolysis and acidification of was and fe vi largely enhances their relative abundances clostridium sensu stricto 13 sp clostridium sensu stricto 1 sp and clostridium sensu stricto 10 sp are revealed to be typical ce microorganisms and their total abundance is 3 0 in the 51 mg fe g tss fermenter or 5 5 in the 85 mg fe g tss fermenter apparently higher than that of the control i e 1 2 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2021 nevertheless the top two genera i e norank f ilumatobacteraceae and norank f microtrichales have not been reported to have capacities of performing ce whose abundances are significantly enhanced by fe vi pretreatment from 2 3 and 4 0 in the control group to 11 8 and 7 6 in the 85 mg fe g tss fermenter or 11 3 and 9 4 in the 85 mg fe g tss fermenter receptively the positive correlation of their abundance with mcfas production implies they might be beneficial to ce process furthermore the correlations between was samples community compositions and environmental factors are proved by redundancy analysis rda as displayed in fig 6c the mcfas production is closely associated with spn suggesting that organics solubilization and hydrolysis are the preconditions of acidification and ce it is apparent that most microorganisms exhibit positive correlations with proteins degradation and mcfas production such as macellibacteroides sp sedimentibacter sp norank f ilumatobacteraceae and norank f microtrichales the facts prove that these microbes which are enriched in the experimental groups play vital roles in hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation verifying the findings in fig 6a and 6b all the results above illustrate that fe vi pretreatment causes microbial community shift and hence significantly enriches functional microorganisms involved in ea generation i e microbial hydrolysis and acidification of substrates and transformation i e upgrading to mcfas 3 4 2 impact of fe vi pretreatment on the functional gene expression chain elongation is the critical step for mcfas production which contains two metabolic pathways i e fatty acid biosynthesis fab and reverse β oxidation rbo pathways wu et al 2020 metagenomics analysis is therefore employed to uncover the impact of fe vi on functional genes expression involved in ce process through kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg functional annotations the potential metabolic pathways and impacts of fe vi pretreatment on conventional bioprocesses and ce pathways are illustrated in fig 7 generally it can be found that the functional genes expressions related to fab and rbo pathways determined by kegg are up regulated in the pretreated fermented sludge to different degree compared to those of control for example the abundance of acca2 and echs1 genes involved in rbo pathway are respectively increased by 38 7 and 60 0 in the 51 mg fe g tss reactor or by 27 5 and 46 0 in the 85 mg fe g tss reactor similarly the genes quantities of fabv and fabz related to fab pathway are improved by 22 2 or 16 7 and 25 5 or 19 9 in the 51 mg fe g tss reactor or 85 mg fe g tss reactor as an essential intermediate in ce acetyl coa might be produced from both co2 and ethanol since the relative functional enzymes i e adh and aldh for ethanol oxidation and cdha and cdhd for co2 are detected in the investigated system fig s10 however fe vi results in the increase of adh and aldh and decrease of cdhd and the abundances of the formers are significantly higher than those of the latter suggesting acetyl coa is primarily generated from external ed i e ethanol oxidation and fe vi pretreatment promotes the transformation of ethanol to acetyl coa compared to fab pathway the efficiency of rbo pathway is higher because of shorter steps and less atp requirements wu et al 2020 in this work functional gene abundances associated with rbo pathway and fab pathway are improved by fe vi particularly leading to more significant promotions in rbo pathway these results provide visualized gene level evidence for the enhanced chain elongation by fe vi pretreatment 3 5 fate of ferrate after was disintegration and substrates solubilization fe vi is eventually converted to fe iii feo4 2 8h 3e fe iii 4h2o during the pretreatment stage subsequently the produced fe iii is gradually reduced to fe ii via dissimilatory iron reduction as indicated in fig s8 at the fermentation stage which can promote substrates hydrolysis and acidification zhan et al 2021 since sludge cracking led to abundant phosphate release fe ii can react with phosphate to form vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o resulting in soluble phosphate to a negligible level fig s11 consequently some responses to vivianite can be identified in xrd image fig s12 for the pretreated fermented sludge indicating that fe vi pretreatment promotes the synthesis of crystalline vivianite 3 6 implications mcfas production from was is mainly restricted by cytoderm eps rupture and competitive inhibition by methanogens wang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 this study proposes a promising strategy to improve sludge disintegration and promote substrates hydrolysis results show that mcfas production and percentage are significantly enhanced by fe vi pretreatment meanwhile large amounts of hydrogen are also produced from the fe vi pretreated fermented sludge hs is largely transformed to the supernatant due to was disintegration fig 2 which could play as important electron shuttles to accept and donate electrons or facilitate microbial energy metabolism such as the production of nad p h and atp li et al 2016 tang et al 2022 the significant increment of mcfas percentages in the 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss fermenters might be attributed to the facilitated electron transfer in ce process fig 1 mcfas generation is the upgrading process of scfas performed by anaerobic functional bacteria hence the competition between methanogens and elongators for ea or electrons from ethanol oxidation is one of key bottlenecks of ce process in this work a large amount of methane is produced from the control whereas the corresponding value detected in the fe vi pretreated fermented sludge is negligible fig 5 the mcfas production is almost negligible in the control which is probably ascribed to the competitive inhibition by methanogens although mcfas production from complex substrates i e protein rich wastewater or was could be promoted by conductive materials ramírez montoya et al 2022 it usually requires 10 5 g l 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes as methanogens inhibitor liu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the addition of such a high level of bes inevitably increases the cost of sludge treatment offsetting the values of mcfas production however the selective inhibition of fe vi to microorganisms in the pretreatment stage leads to the complete elimination of methanogens which not only provides substantial substrates for functional microorganisms but also effectively avoids the addition of methanogens inhibitor simultaneously on the other hand fe iii derived from fe vi is gradually reduced to fe ii via dissimilatory iron reduction dir in the fermentation stage fig s8 the dir process can facilitate hydrolysis and acidification of complex substrates released by fe vi oxidation or bound in was also the presence of hs would act as electron transfer mediators for dir roden et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 subsequently the produced fe ii readily reacts with released phosphate to form vivianite wang et al 2022c we find that phosphate concentration is reduced to a negligible level fig s11 and thus the peaks about vivianite pattern appears in the xrd image fig s12 in a continuous system the presence of fe2 can enhance p removal from fermentation liquor increase microbial interactions through re flocculating disintegrated was and improve activity of fe containing functional enzymes zhan et al 2021 the formed vivianite would be recovered from the fermented sludge through magnetic separation achieving p and fe recovery from was wilfert et al 2018 furthermore ferrate supplementation would be beneficial for the post treatment and land spreading of digestate due to the presence of fe ions and salts in fermented sludge inactivated pathogens and inhibited methanogenesis which can provide essential elements i e iron and potassium for plants reduce environmental risk induced by virus propagation and mitigate greenhouse gas emission i e ch4 during its application in farmland however this work is a proof of concept and technical optimization is not performed therefore more investigations should be devoted to improving the action with lower fe vi dosage by improving specificity in the future e g supplying fe vi as nanoparticles or combining fe vi with ligands etc then a comprehensive investigation can be performed to optimize experimental parameters such as ethanol dosage fe vi dosage and ph range by applying a response surface or mathematical model conclusion this work for the first time investigates the impacts of fe vi pretreatment on mcfas production from was results suggest that fe vi pretreatment significantly enhances the mcfas yields and percentages mechanism investigation uncovers that fe vi effectively disrupts the structure of eps and cytoderm through electron transfer reactive oxygen species generation i e oh o 2 and 1o2 and elevated alkalinity thereby promoting the transfer of organics from solid to soluble phase and from macromolecules to intermediates based on the analyses of intermediates generation and bio transformation fe vi facilitates hydrolysis acidification and ce but suppresses methanogenesis which benefits the targeted transformation of intermediates to mcfas moreover fe vi screens key microorganisms and up regulates functional genes expression involved in ce pathways

15250,the rupture of cytoderm and extracellular polymeric substances eps and competitive inhibition of methanogens are the main bottlenecks for medium chain fatty acids mcfas production from waste activated sludge was this study proposes a promising ferrate fe vi based technique to enhance mcfas production from was through accelerating was disintegration and substrates transformation and eliminating competitive inhibition of methanogens simultaneously results shows that the maximal mcfas production attains 8106 3 mg cod l under 85 mg fe g tss being 58 6 times that of without fe vi pretreatment mechanism exploration reveals that fe vi effectively destroys eps and cytoderm through electron transfer reactive oxygen species generation i e oh o2 and 1o2 and elevated alkalinity resulting in the transfer of organics from solid to soluble phase and from macromolecules to intermediates generation and transformation of intermediates analyses illustrate that fe vi facilitates hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation ce but suppresses methanogenesis promoting the targeted conversion of intermediates to mcfas also fe vi pretreatment provides potential electron shuttles for chain elongation microbial community and functional genes encoding key enzymes analysis indicates that fe vi screens key microorganisms and up regulates functional genes expression involved in ce pathways overall this technology avoids methanogens inhibitor addition and stimulates vivianite synthesis during mcfas production from was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords medium chain fatty acids mcfas chain elongation ce extracellular polymeric substances eps ferrate fe vi functional genes waste activated sludge was data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment facilities are rapidly expanding to meet the demands of a growing population and expanding industry resulting in the generation of large volumes of waste activated sludge was li et al 2015a increasing sludge quantity brings strong economic burdens and potential environmental problems however was contains considerable amounts of organic compounds such as proteins lipids and carbohydrates etc making it a preferred and inexpensive biomass resource therefore a sustainable development mode of wastewater treatment would be established if the organic carbons in was were extracted as high value products in subsequent process anaerobic fermentation has been extensively employed for sludge reduction and energy recovery due to its simple operation and moderate conditions wang et al 2022c the organics in was are eventually converted to short chain fatty acids scfas or methane ch4 in the common mode batstone et al 2002 whereas scfas are difficult to isolate and purify from the fermentation liquor due to their high solubility and methane has a low energy density with potent greenhouse effects wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 medium chain fatty acids mcfas as the promising substitutes for scfas and ch4 are saturated carboxylic acids with 6 to 12 carbons ge et al 2015 in the presence of appropriate electron donor ed such as ethanol the scfas produced by sludge fermentation can be upgraded to mcfas via chain elongation ce wu et al 2021 owing to their good separability and high energy density mcfas are more easily recovered from fermentation liquor and can be used as precursors for biofuels production to alleviate increasing energy demands or for biochemicals synthesis such as pharmaceuticals antimicrobial agents and food additives wu et al 2019 additionally the production of mcfas can reduce carbon footprint because the elongators require carbon dioxide co2 to synthesize endocellular proteins roghair et al 2018 thus it is a profitable and preferable approach to utilize was as substrates for mcfas production nonetheless the poor biodegradability restricts sludge hydrolysis and acidification and methanogenesis process leads to rapid scfas consumption as a consequence scfas accumulation is usually at a low level implying that a low quantity of electron acceptors ea i e scfas could be available for ce process therefore mcfas production from was can be enhanced by pretreatments such as the alkaline acid mechanical and heat methods which are commonly devoted to improving anaerobic was fermentation gonzalez et al 2018 thereinto advanced oxidation technology is promising for accelerating was disintegration and hydrolysis due to its high efficiency for example xu et al 2021 indicated that after 0 2 g g tss total suspended solids kmno4 pretreatment the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod attained at 157 5 mg g tss li et al 2015a reported cao2 dosing effectively enhanced scfas production from was through promoting sludge solubilization and inhibiting methanogenesis ferrate fe vi has recently risen to prominence as a versatile and environmentally friendly water treatment reagent with a high oxidizing capacity wang et al 2020 several reactions could be involved in the fe vi triggered oxidation process including i 1 e and 2 e transfer processes to produce fe v and fe iv species ii radical species and h2o2 production from self decompositions iii attacking contaminants by fe v and fe iv iv self decompositions of high valent iron species vi v and iv v reactions of ferrate with reactive oxygen species o 2 and h2o2 sharma et al 2015 briefly fe vi is finally transformed to fe iii in an oxidation reaction and can be simplified as feo4 2 8h 3e fe3 4h2o ni et al 2020 as a strong oxidizing agent fe vi has been employed in bacteria and virus inactivation micropollutants degradation microcystins removal and cytoderm destruction of waste biomass e g microalgae ni et al 2020 rai et al 2018 wang et al 2020 recent investigations indicated that fe vi is a green technology for sludge treatment such as promoting organics solubilization and enhancing the conversion of substrates to scfas or methane hu et al 2020 li et al 2018 these facts inspire us to employ the environmentally friendly fe vi technique to promote mcfas production from anaerobic was fermentation this study was aimed to investigate the feasibility of fe vi pretreatment in enhancing mcfas production from anaerobic sludge fermentation when ethanol severs as a typical electron donor ed example for chain elongation ce the was was pretreated for 24 h with different levels of fe vi followed by serving as substrates for mcfas production the mcfas production and percentage from the pretreated was and the control were specifically compared the impact of fe vi on was solubilization was examined and the integrity of cytoderm and structure of eps were investigated so as to explore the mechanism of soluble organic compounds release also the reactive oxygen species ros during was disintegration with fe vi and the reaction mechanisms of fe vi with was were enclosed by electron spin resonance esr technology besides the effects of fe vi on proteinic structure and degradation were disclosed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis moreover the influences of fe vi on the main bioprocesses i e hydrolysis acidification ce and methanogenesis were individually assessed to further clarify underlying mechanisms for the improvement of mcfas production additionally the impacts of fe vi on microbial community and key metabolic pathways related to ce were specifically analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 primary properties of feedstock and inoculum the was used in this study was taken from a domestic wwtp in tianjin to eliminate impurities the was was filtered by sieves 2 2 mm2 and 1 1 mm2 after that it was concentrated to a usable solid level by removing excess water and stored in a refrigerator 4 c before usage the following are the key characteristics of concentrated sludge tss 18970 150 mg l vss 11383 120 mg l tcod 17700 390 mg l scod 250 30 mg l total proteins 9475 320 mg cod l total polysaccharides 1826 60 mg cod l and ph 6 8 0 1 the inoculum used for fermentation stage was taken from a semi continuous mesophilic anaerobic fermenter using was as substrate 170 mmol l ethanol as ed and 0 05 m 2 bromoethanesulfonate as methanogens inhibitor wu et al 2021 the fermenter was maintained at 35 c with a sludge retention time of 15 days 2 2 was pretreatment with fe vi to disintegrate was and increase substrates release from sludge solid phase the experiment of fe vi pretreatment was carried out in five serum bottles v 600 ml each reactor i e the serum bottle firstly received 300 ml was followed by a certain quantity of fe vi i e 0 17 34 51 and 85 mg fe g tss then the was ferrate mixture was homogenized on magnetic stirrers after 24 h pretreatment 30 ml was was withdrawn from each reactor for further chemical analyses it should be emphasized that the ferrate dosage and pretreatment time were based on previous studies he et al 2018 wang et al 2020 to obtain reliable results the pretreatment experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 experiments for mcfas production from pretreated sludge these experiments were aimed to clarify the feasibility of fe vi pretreatment in improving mcfas production from was a set of serum bottles v 600ml were employed as fermenters in these tests then each bottle contained 270 ml disintegrated was as substrates and 30 ml inoculum wang et al 2020 subsequently 170 mmol l ethanol serving as typical ed for ce was supplemented to each fermenter so as to perform mcfas production wu et al 2021 afterwards the ph was adjusted to 5 5 0 1 with hcl and naoh hence the elongators would be stimulated for mcfas production within the optimal ph range wang et al 2021 finally all the fermenters were flushed with n2 sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and incubated at 35 c with a rotation speed of 120 rpm during fermentation the samples 10 ml were taken out for detection every two days it should be noted that no extra growth medium and methanogens inhibitor were used for microbial metabolism and methane suppression in this work each experiment for mcfas production was carried out in triplicate 2 4 evaluating the impact of fe vi on substrates release and structural integrity of was was solubilization is the rate determining step of anaerobic fermentation the contribution of fe vi oxidation to was solubilization was firstly evaluated by the concentrations of soluble proteins spn soluble carbohydrates sch and scod after pretreatment then the details of how fe vi facilitating organic components solubilization were elucidated by investigating the structural integrity changes of was flocs from the perspectives of cells rupture and eps disintegration the degree of cytoderm cytomembrane damage could be indicated by lactate dehydrogenase ldh release which was quantified by using a ldh assay kit solarbio life sciences based on the instructions supporting information si also the rupture of cytoderm cytomembrane was reflected by the ratio of live dead cells to total cells measured by a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit bbcellprobe n01 pi with analytical procedures described in si besides a modified heating method with little cell lysis and high performance was employed for eps extraction including the loosely bound lb and tightly bound tb eps li and yang 2007 and the extraction method was detailed in si accordingly the intracellular release induced by fe vi could be quantified by the cod difference between dom and eps before and after pretreatment shown in si he et al 2016 wang et al 2022a furthermore the changes in functional groups and composition of the organics in the supernatant and eps were characterized by ftir xps and eem technologies 2 5 identification of reactive oxygen species ros involved in fe vi pretreatment the ros existing in the fe vi based pretreatment system were confirmed using electron spin resonance esr analysis which was accomplished by an esr spectrometer jeol jes fa200 japan briefly after 20 min of reaction a sample of was from the experimental reactor was collected for each ros detection the trapping agent for oh and o 2 was 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo while the 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidine temp was used for 1o2 detection these trapping agents i e dmpo and temp can react with reactive oxygen species to generate detectable adducts that have specific signals in epr spectra li et al 2022 wang et al 2022a 2 6 impact of fe vi on hydrolysis acidification chain elongation ce and methanogenesis substrate degradation and mcfas accumulation through anaerobic fermentation contain several bio processes i e hydrolysis acidification ce and methanogenesis wang et al 2021 the released macromolecular organics firstly undergo hydrolysis driven by extracellular hydrolases and decompose to monomers followed by acidification with scfas production subsequently two diverse pathways are related to scfas transformation i e ce and methanogenesis thereby the impact of fe vi on these processes could be indicated by substrates degradation activities of key enzymes and transformation of metabolic intermediates detailed in si 2 7 microbial community characterization and metagenomic analysis the microbial community and metagenomic analysis were achieved by high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna the samples were respectively collected from the control 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss groups after a long term operation the primers of pcr amplification were chosen as 338f 806r in accord with previous studies wu et al 2020 more information about sequencing and functional gene analysis were detailed in si 2 8 other analyses the conventional procedures were used to measure ts vs tss and vss apha 2005 the hach test kits 20 1500 mg cod l were used to measure scod and tcod a ph meter was used for ph adjustment in this study mettler toledo switzerland the proteins and carbohydrates were measured according to previous study wang et al 2022b the concentrations of total fe and fe2 in soluble phase were determined using orthophenanthroline spectrophotometry li et al 2015b to define the principal functional groups in the eps and soluble compounds the samples from the control and experimental groups were firstly freeze dried at 80 c for drying and then examined using an ftir spectrometer detailed in si the elemental composition and local functioning of the samples derived from the control and experimental groups were determined by xps detailed in si an eem fluorescence spectrometer hitachi f 2710 was used to identify the composition and contents of organic substances in soluble and eps fractions si to detect the crystalline vivianite the fermented sludge was examined by x ray diffractometer d8 advance to generate x ray diffractograms xrd and the methods were detailed in si the morphology of anaerobically fermented was was examined by scanning electron microscopes sem with the sample preparation procedures depicted in si for analyzing the concentration of carboxylates and alcohols a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu equipped with the fid detector and hydrogen generator was employed after each sampling event si the quantities of h2 and ch4 in biogas were determined using a different gc sp 7890 plus lunan si 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of fe vi pretreatment on mcfas production from was fig 1 records the concentrations and distributions of products obviously mcfas production reaches a stationary level after 16 days in the control and 17 mg fe g tss groups mcfas formation i e n caproate occurs at day 14 with respective maximum concentrations being 138 3 mg cod l and 82 7 mg cod l the negligible mcfas production might be attributed to limited was degradation at these conditions and or competitive inhibitions to ce microorganisms induced by some electron consuming microbes such as methanogens wu et al 2019 in comparison with fe vi dosage increasing from 34 to 51 mg fe g tss the maximum of n caproate and n caprylate is enhanced from 2826 7 and 302 2 mg cod l to 4454 3 and 2113 6 mg cod l respectively it was reported that the maximum scfas accumulation reached 343 0 mg cod g vss under the optimal fe vi dose i e 56 mg fe g tss he et al 2018 thus with the presence of ed the generated scfas are effectively upgraded to mcfas by ce microbes nevertheless for the 85 mg fe g tss group n caproate cannot be further elongated to n caprylate due to that ethanol is completely consumed fig s1a resulting in n caproate of 8106 3 mg cod l as the only mcfa which is apparently higher than that of the previous study li et al 2021b that used 170 mm ethanol as ed notably the total contents of carboxylates and alcohols are dose dependent during the initial 4 days of fermentation and the impact of fe vi on lag phase of mcfas production occurs in a similar way such as lower carboxylates and alcohols contents and increased lag phase in the 85 mg fe g tss group these facts indicate that fe vi pretreatment at high levels might cause certain inhibitions to the initial activity of fermentative and ce microorganisms besides fe vi pretreatment also enhances cumulative hydrogen production from was and the maximum value increases from 42 0 ml i e the control to 113 7 ml i e 85 mg g tss group fig s1b interestingly the profile of hydrogen accumulation is consistent with that of mcfas production indicating hydrogen is mainly derived from ce stage the longer lag phase i e 4 days for 85 mg g tss group further reflects the inhibiting effect of fe vi on functional microbial activity some previous studies have also demonstrated that fe vi could cause inhibitions on anaerobic functional microbes such as hydrogen producers acidogens and methanogens with a range of 28 2 140 mg fe g tss he et al 2018 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020a these observations above suggest that fe vi pretreatment significantly enhances mcfas and hydrogen production from was interestingly mcfas are scarcely generated in the ethanol inoculum group i e the blank fig s2 confirming that the presence of ea i e scfa derived from the pretreated was is the precondition of feasible ce furthermore the primary products are n butanol and n iso butyrate in control and 17 mg fe g tss groups accounting for 92 2 and 91 0 of the products respectively fig 1f in contrast fe vi pretreatment with appropriate dose significantly decrease butanol and butyrate proportions while largely increase mcfas percentages specifically mcfas percentage for the 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss is respectively 58 3 and 47 3 it suggests that fe vi efficiently improves mcfas proportion and reduces the electron flows from substrates to by products 3 2 effect and mechanisms of fe vi on was solubilization 3 2 1 was solubilization and substrates release ce process can be seen as a secondary fermentation of was with the primary fermentation products i e scfas as ea and external ethanol as ed wang et al 2021 thus sludge disintegration and substrate release are the precondition for the formation of ea as displayed in fig 2 a fe vi causes conspicuous disintegration on was flocs increasing scod from 370 0 mg l the control to 6060 0 mg l 85 mg fe g tss the optimal dose of fe vi for was dissolution was significantly different in previous studies ranging from 28 2 to 140 mg fe g tss he et al 2018 hu et al 2020 li et al 2018 li et al 2020a generally sludge dissolution was significantly enhanced with the increase of fe vi dose whereas excess fe vi would react with released organics and result in soluble substrates reduction li et al 2018 as the main organic components in was proteins and polysaccharides are markedly transformed from solid phase to the supernatant fig 2a briefly the concentration of spn or sch increases from 78 4 or 29 1 mg cod l to 2264 4 or 700 8 mg cod l after fe vi pretreatment xps analysis characterizes the chemical nature of c on the surface of soluble substances fig 2b the c 1s spectra can be deconvoluted to 3 4 bond peaks in this study li et al 2021a yin et al 2015 peak 1 is due to c c and c h predominantly from hydrocarbon like organics namely polysaccharides lateral chain of lipids or lateral chain of amino acids peak 2 is associated with c o and c n from alcohol ether amine or amide groups in polysaccharides and proteins peak 3 is related to c o and o c o indicating the presence of carboxyl acetal hemiacetal amide or hemiacetal groups peak 4 belongs to coor commonly presented in carboxyl or ester groups compared to the control the sum of area of peak 1 and peak 2 increases from 66 8 to 82 6 indicating the distinct releases of polysaccharides and proteins from solid phase of was after fe vi pretreatment li et al 2021a notably peak 4 only occurs in the experimental sample suggesting that fe vi possibly induces macromolecular organics acidification during pretreatment step liu et al 2020 the differentiation of the functional groups and main compositions in dom is further investigated by ftir fig 2c and eem spectra fig 2d based on the position of specific peaks the functional groups in ftir spectra can be assigned to four main categories i e proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids aromatic amino acids and hydrocarbons table s1 li et al 2021b xu et al 2018 yin et al 2015 fe vi increases the intensity of bond 1657 18 cm 1 which is closely related to the stretching vibrations of c o and c n groups in proteins the wavelengths at 1095 27 cm 1 represents vibration of c oh and c o c in polysaccharides or carbohydrates and its intensity in dom significantly increases due to fe vi pretreatment the transmission spectrum from 3378 31 cm 1 is indicative of o h group stretching in humic substances hs i e humic acids and fulvic acids wang et al 2019 the obvious increase of its intensity implies that fe vi pretreatment promotes the dissolution of solid phase hs accumulated in was the eem spectra can reflect the change of five types of organic compounds in sludge detailed in si li et al 2020c for the fe vi pretreated sludge the fluorescence intensities of biodegradable constituents i e microbial byproduct like increase dramatically fig 2d manifesting that substantial solid phase substrates are converted to dissolved organics and can be readily utilized by fermentative and scfa forming bacteria wang et al 2020 additionally obvious fluorescence responses to hs i e peak 3 and peak 4 appear on eem spectrum after fe vi pretreatment consistent with the analysis of ftir spectra fig 2c hs rich in redox active surface groups could serve as important electron transfer mediators to accept and donate electrons or facilitate microbial energy metabolism such as the production of nad p h and atp li et al 2016 tang et al 2022 specially hs have been widely verified as electron shuttles to promote complex substrates i e proteins and polysaccharides decomposition and dissimilatory fe iii reduction in anaerobic environments roden et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 consequently it would be conducive to sludge hydrolysis through dissimilatory iron reduction of fe iii induced from fe vi more importantly hs might play a role in electrons flow from ed to ea because of its electrons accepting and donating capacities thereby facilitating ce pathways and ea upgrading 3 2 2 underlying mechanisms of fe vi promoting was solubilization in order to clarify the mechanisms of enhanced was solubilization responses of sludge structures to fe vi pretreatment were deeply investigated as shown in fig 3 a and 3b fe vi increases the concentration of cod proteins and carbohydrates in lb eps fraction while decreases the organic constituents in tb eps it indicates that fe vi breaks the stable structure of sludge eps and causes migration and transformation of eps composition from tb fraction to lb fraction and dom li et al 2020c similarly fe vi pretreatment obviously decreases the eem spectral intensity of tb fraction proving the reduction of organic substances in tb fraction fig s3 the prominent decrement of specific peaks intensities in ftir spectra further hints the significant releases of proteins polysaccharides hs and aromatic amino from tb fraction fig 3c the disruption of eps can be further supported by sem images of the fermented was as displayed in fig 3e the microorganisms in the control are mainly wrapped by eps while numerous microorganisms can be found in the experimental was after anaerobic fermentation fig 3f based on the calculation of intracelluar release fe vi pretreatment significantly increases the release and dissolution of intracelluar substances fig s4 implying serious damage to cytoderm cytomembrane he et al 2016 potassium is a typical element inside microbial cells and the integrality of microbial cytoderm can be assessed by potassium content in the supernatant or was surface li et al 2020b li et al 2021a as an intracellular enzyme ldh is an integrity marker of cytoderm cytomembrane wang et al 2020 in fig 3d ldh release in the pretreated was is significantly higher than that of the control suggesting fe vi induces serious cells lysis and significant intracellular substances release supported by the increased potassium content fig s5 interestingly the 85 mg fe g tss of ferrate results in a minor decrease on ldh content it might be attributed to that the strong oxidizing property of ferrate causes damages to ldh activity moreover the living cells represented by fluorescent green decrease while the dead cells represented by fluorescent red increase in the was with the increased fe vi dosage fig s6 the ratio of live to total cells is 92 6 for the control whereas it declines to 57 2 34 mg fe g tss 38 9 51 mg fe g tss and 22 3 85 mg fe g tss after fe vi pretreatment it intuitively reflects the rupture capacities of fe vi on microbial cytoderm cytomembrane 3 2 3 underlying oxidation mechanisms of fe vi for was disintegration according to previous studies fe vi would oxidize was through 1 and 2e transfer leading to numerous reactions and the formation of intermediates i e fe v fe iv h2o2 and oh sharma 2013 sharma et al 2015 fe v and fe iv have been widely confirmed as the intermediates for fe vi based oxidization which could further disintegrate was and be eventually converted to fe iii or fe ii sharma 2013 sharma et al 2015 as shown in fig s7 fe vi largely causes ph elevation after 30 min reaction which is undisputedly conducive to the release and hydrolysis of particulate substrates in was wang et al 2020 besides the formation h2o2 in situ could cause the generation of reactive oxygen species ros playing an important role in was solubilization wang et al 2019 however little information is yet available about the generation of ros in fe vi based oxidization system fig 4 a shows that the dmpo oh dmpo o 2 and temp 1o2 adducts are determined in the fe vi based pretreatment system indicating the production of oh o 2 and 1o2 which possibly be attributed to the generation and activation of h2o2 in situ with strong oxidability these ros can attack eps and penetrate cytoderm into cytoplasm resulting in eps decomposition and cells rupture these observations clarify that fe vi effectively decomposes eps and cytoderm through electron transfer elevated alkalinity and reactive oxygen species generation i e oh o 2 and 1o2 resulting in the significant increase of dom such as spn and scn accordingly the schematic diagram for the oxidation reaction mechanism of fe vi disintegrating was can be obtained and is described in fig 4b 3 3 effect of fe vi pretreatment on intermediates generation and transformation 3 3 1 decomposition and transformation of macromolecular organics generally mcfas production from anaerobic was fermentation mainly includes three successive bio processes i e hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation ce proteins are the main biodegradable substrates accounting for 53 5 of tcod in this study whose stability can be affected by their conformational structure to characterize the alteration of proteinic conformation the amide i band i e located at 1700 1600 cm 1 in ftir spectra of the soluble fraction and tb fraction is subjected to curve fitting analysis fig 5 a after fe vi pretreatment peak 1 i e aggregated strands at 1610 1625 cm 1 of the soluble fraction disappears and the abundance of secondary structures in both soluble and tb fractions changes implying the variation of proteinic natures α helix β sheet and random coil are important factors for determining proteins stability and low α helix β sheet random coil proportion may lead to loose proteinic structure li et al 2020b as outlined in table s2 fe vi increases the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil in dom from 70 2 to 89 2 while decreases that of tb eps from 45 1 to 41 2 it hints that fe vi alters the proteinic conformation making the proteins in dom more stable while looser in tb eps compared to the sludge floc with intact structure soluble organics or loosely structured eps are more easily accessed and hydrolyzed by microbes due to lesser steric hindrance to extracellular hydrolases hence the loose tb eps fraction is conducive to being degraded and providing channels for the secretion of extracellular enzymes such as hydrolases the increase in the α helix β fold random coil ratio in dom might be primarily ascribed to the chemical flocculation of proteins with generated fe iii the presence of fe iii can enrich dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria and facilitate substrates hydrolysis zhan et al 2021 in addition to hydrogen bonds the formation and stability of proteinic structural conformation are also affected by disulfide bond s s functional groups li et al 2021a wu et al 2017 specific evidence for the change of s s is obtained by xps s2p spectra analysis fig 5b it can be found that the area of s s bonds in soluble fraction reduces from 43 3 to 39 5 due to fe vi pretreatment it indicates that fe vi possibly causes the rupture of proteinic s s bonds in was hinting the degradation of proteins released from eps and microbial cells as displayed in the xps spectra of n1s fig 5b the area of protein n in dom decreases from 100 to 76 9 because of fe vi pretreatment accordingly the area of inorganic n increases from 0 to 23 1 implying the transformation and degradation of macromolecular substrates after fe vi pretreatment all the findings above prove that fe vi can induce structural destruction of organic substrates e g proteins in was which are more susceptible to subsequent hydrolysis and acidification bioprocesses 3 3 2 potentials of intermediates generation and transformation after hydrolysis and acidification of organic substrates released from was the produced scfas subsequently serve as ea in the ce process and would be elongated to mcfas consequently scfas are the important intermediates and the potentials of their generation and transformation in the fermentation system have essential influences on mcfas production as shown in fig 5c i the soluble proteins significantly reduce in the sludge pretreated by 51 and 85 mg fe g tss during anaerobic fermentation supported by the obviously increased ammonia nitrogen concentration with ferrate dosage fig 5c ii it hints the rapid hydrolysis and acidification of organic substrates e g proteins released from was disintegration the elevation of protease activity 23 6 152 0 in the pretreated fermented sludge also indicates the enhancement of substrates hydrolysis fig 5c iii nonetheless at the initial stage of anaerobic fermentation 0 2d the content of ammonia nitrogen decreases when ferrate dose reaches 85 mg fe g tss uncovering the inhibition of fe vi on initial microbial activity in accord with the results of fig 1 the fe iii produced from pretreatment stage is gradually reduced to fe ii during anaerobic fermentation and concentration of fe2 is closely to that of total fe in the soluble phase revealing the existence of dissimilatory iron reduction fig s8 the fe iii reducing bacteria can utilize diverse substrates and promote hydrolysis and acidification of complex substrates in was zhan et al 2021 after chemical decomposition biohydrolysis the complex substrates are converted to monomers such as glucose and amino acids which are the precursors of scfas formation wang et al 2021 as intermediates the production of scfas from was cannot be directly quantified because of their consumption by elongators with the presence of ed therefore the activity of scfas producers in the pretreated fermented sludge are characterized by using model substrates i e glutamate and glucose on day 1 or day 3 the scfas production in the control is 478 8 or 1610 4 mg cod l while the value largely increases to 641 1 or 3222 4 mg cod l and 610 7 or 3054 4 mg cod l in the 51 and 85 mg fe g tss reactors fig 5d i respectively the facts suggest that fe vi can enhance the conversion of hydrolysates to scfas which is possibly ascribed to the enrichment of acid producing bacteria by fe vi after 16 days of acclimation the fermented sludge is also used for model substrates i e ethanol and acetate tests to examine the impact of fe vi on ce process as shown in fig 5d ii mcfas production in the control group is negligible on day 4 while in the 51 and 85 mg fe g tss reactors mcfas yield increases to 1361 0 and 882 7 mg cod l respectively it indicates stronger microbial activity for ce process in the pretreated fermented sludge additionally the methanogenesis process is also affected by fe vi fig 5d iii after anaerobic fermentation the cumulative methane production is 46 2 ml for the control whereas it is close to zero for the pretreated fermented sludge i e 51 and 85 mg fe g tss it illustrates that the hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogenesis are seriously inhibited by fe vi pretreatment in turn favoring mcfas production all the results above demonstrate that fe vi pretreatment improves the hydrolysis acidification and ce processes that is promotes the generation and targeted transformation i e mcfas of intermediates 3 4 microbial analysis 3 4 1 impact of fe vi pretreatment on microbial community compositions the results of rarefaction curves reflect the representativeness and reliability of the sequencing depth fig s9a according to the analysis of venn diagram and α diversity metrics fig s9b fe vi pretreatment cuts down the microbial diversity and richness confirming its destructions on microorganisms fig 6 a displays the phylum level distributions of community compositions in the three reactors i e control 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss the predominant microbes are affiliated to actinobacteriota firmicutes and chloroflexi in the three fermenters which commonly exist in anaerobic fermentation system and closely associated with substrate degradation wang et al 2022c yu et al 2019 thereinto actinobacteriota are the most abundant microbes in experimental groups it is increased from 15 7 control to 39 4 51 mg fe g tss and 37 5 85 mg fe g tss exhibiting significant correlations with mcfas production firmicutes are reported to be in relevant to ce process such as mcfas production from liquor making wastewater wu et al 2018 and mcfas generation from was with zerovalent iron zvi addition wang et al 2020 with an increase from 21 8 control to 26 6 51 mg fe g tss and 25 3 85 mg fe g tss in this study further studies at genus level fig 6b illustrate that fe vi pretreatment causes the enrichment of functional microorganisms responsible for hydrolysis acidification and ce processes with the total abundance increased from 17 7 control to 41 7 51 mg fe g tss and 42 4 85 mg fe g tss for instances the abundance of macellibacteroides sp which could degrade peptone cellobiose or ferment glucose into lactate and scfas jabari et al 2012 was 2 7 and 2 1 in the respective 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss fermenters whereas it is only 0 03 in the control fermenter romboutsia sp paraclostridium sp norank f saccharimonadales sp and sedimentibacter sp are generally detected anaerobes related to hydrolysis and acidification of was and fe vi largely enhances their relative abundances clostridium sensu stricto 13 sp clostridium sensu stricto 1 sp and clostridium sensu stricto 10 sp are revealed to be typical ce microorganisms and their total abundance is 3 0 in the 51 mg fe g tss fermenter or 5 5 in the 85 mg fe g tss fermenter apparently higher than that of the control i e 1 2 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2021 nevertheless the top two genera i e norank f ilumatobacteraceae and norank f microtrichales have not been reported to have capacities of performing ce whose abundances are significantly enhanced by fe vi pretreatment from 2 3 and 4 0 in the control group to 11 8 and 7 6 in the 85 mg fe g tss fermenter or 11 3 and 9 4 in the 85 mg fe g tss fermenter receptively the positive correlation of their abundance with mcfas production implies they might be beneficial to ce process furthermore the correlations between was samples community compositions and environmental factors are proved by redundancy analysis rda as displayed in fig 6c the mcfas production is closely associated with spn suggesting that organics solubilization and hydrolysis are the preconditions of acidification and ce it is apparent that most microorganisms exhibit positive correlations with proteins degradation and mcfas production such as macellibacteroides sp sedimentibacter sp norank f ilumatobacteraceae and norank f microtrichales the facts prove that these microbes which are enriched in the experimental groups play vital roles in hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation verifying the findings in fig 6a and 6b all the results above illustrate that fe vi pretreatment causes microbial community shift and hence significantly enriches functional microorganisms involved in ea generation i e microbial hydrolysis and acidification of substrates and transformation i e upgrading to mcfas 3 4 2 impact of fe vi pretreatment on the functional gene expression chain elongation is the critical step for mcfas production which contains two metabolic pathways i e fatty acid biosynthesis fab and reverse β oxidation rbo pathways wu et al 2020 metagenomics analysis is therefore employed to uncover the impact of fe vi on functional genes expression involved in ce process through kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg functional annotations the potential metabolic pathways and impacts of fe vi pretreatment on conventional bioprocesses and ce pathways are illustrated in fig 7 generally it can be found that the functional genes expressions related to fab and rbo pathways determined by kegg are up regulated in the pretreated fermented sludge to different degree compared to those of control for example the abundance of acca2 and echs1 genes involved in rbo pathway are respectively increased by 38 7 and 60 0 in the 51 mg fe g tss reactor or by 27 5 and 46 0 in the 85 mg fe g tss reactor similarly the genes quantities of fabv and fabz related to fab pathway are improved by 22 2 or 16 7 and 25 5 or 19 9 in the 51 mg fe g tss reactor or 85 mg fe g tss reactor as an essential intermediate in ce acetyl coa might be produced from both co2 and ethanol since the relative functional enzymes i e adh and aldh for ethanol oxidation and cdha and cdhd for co2 are detected in the investigated system fig s10 however fe vi results in the increase of adh and aldh and decrease of cdhd and the abundances of the formers are significantly higher than those of the latter suggesting acetyl coa is primarily generated from external ed i e ethanol oxidation and fe vi pretreatment promotes the transformation of ethanol to acetyl coa compared to fab pathway the efficiency of rbo pathway is higher because of shorter steps and less atp requirements wu et al 2020 in this work functional gene abundances associated with rbo pathway and fab pathway are improved by fe vi particularly leading to more significant promotions in rbo pathway these results provide visualized gene level evidence for the enhanced chain elongation by fe vi pretreatment 3 5 fate of ferrate after was disintegration and substrates solubilization fe vi is eventually converted to fe iii feo4 2 8h 3e fe iii 4h2o during the pretreatment stage subsequently the produced fe iii is gradually reduced to fe ii via dissimilatory iron reduction as indicated in fig s8 at the fermentation stage which can promote substrates hydrolysis and acidification zhan et al 2021 since sludge cracking led to abundant phosphate release fe ii can react with phosphate to form vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o resulting in soluble phosphate to a negligible level fig s11 consequently some responses to vivianite can be identified in xrd image fig s12 for the pretreated fermented sludge indicating that fe vi pretreatment promotes the synthesis of crystalline vivianite 3 6 implications mcfas production from was is mainly restricted by cytoderm eps rupture and competitive inhibition by methanogens wang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 this study proposes a promising strategy to improve sludge disintegration and promote substrates hydrolysis results show that mcfas production and percentage are significantly enhanced by fe vi pretreatment meanwhile large amounts of hydrogen are also produced from the fe vi pretreated fermented sludge hs is largely transformed to the supernatant due to was disintegration fig 2 which could play as important electron shuttles to accept and donate electrons or facilitate microbial energy metabolism such as the production of nad p h and atp li et al 2016 tang et al 2022 the significant increment of mcfas percentages in the 51 mg fe g tss and 85 mg fe g tss fermenters might be attributed to the facilitated electron transfer in ce process fig 1 mcfas generation is the upgrading process of scfas performed by anaerobic functional bacteria hence the competition between methanogens and elongators for ea or electrons from ethanol oxidation is one of key bottlenecks of ce process in this work a large amount of methane is produced from the control whereas the corresponding value detected in the fe vi pretreated fermented sludge is negligible fig 5 the mcfas production is almost negligible in the control which is probably ascribed to the competitive inhibition by methanogens although mcfas production from complex substrates i e protein rich wastewater or was could be promoted by conductive materials ramírez montoya et al 2022 it usually requires 10 5 g l 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes as methanogens inhibitor liu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the addition of such a high level of bes inevitably increases the cost of sludge treatment offsetting the values of mcfas production however the selective inhibition of fe vi to microorganisms in the pretreatment stage leads to the complete elimination of methanogens which not only provides substantial substrates for functional microorganisms but also effectively avoids the addition of methanogens inhibitor simultaneously on the other hand fe iii derived from fe vi is gradually reduced to fe ii via dissimilatory iron reduction dir in the fermentation stage fig s8 the dir process can facilitate hydrolysis and acidification of complex substrates released by fe vi oxidation or bound in was also the presence of hs would act as electron transfer mediators for dir roden et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 subsequently the produced fe ii readily reacts with released phosphate to form vivianite wang et al 2022c we find that phosphate concentration is reduced to a negligible level fig s11 and thus the peaks about vivianite pattern appears in the xrd image fig s12 in a continuous system the presence of fe2 can enhance p removal from fermentation liquor increase microbial interactions through re flocculating disintegrated was and improve activity of fe containing functional enzymes zhan et al 2021 the formed vivianite would be recovered from the fermented sludge through magnetic separation achieving p and fe recovery from was wilfert et al 2018 furthermore ferrate supplementation would be beneficial for the post treatment and land spreading of digestate due to the presence of fe ions and salts in fermented sludge inactivated pathogens and inhibited methanogenesis which can provide essential elements i e iron and potassium for plants reduce environmental risk induced by virus propagation and mitigate greenhouse gas emission i e ch4 during its application in farmland however this work is a proof of concept and technical optimization is not performed therefore more investigations should be devoted to improving the action with lower fe vi dosage by improving specificity in the future e g supplying fe vi as nanoparticles or combining fe vi with ligands etc then a comprehensive investigation can be performed to optimize experimental parameters such as ethanol dosage fe vi dosage and ph range by applying a response surface or mathematical model conclusion this work for the first time investigates the impacts of fe vi pretreatment on mcfas production from was results suggest that fe vi pretreatment significantly enhances the mcfas yields and percentages mechanism investigation uncovers that fe vi effectively disrupts the structure of eps and cytoderm through electron transfer reactive oxygen species generation i e oh o 2 and 1o2 and elevated alkalinity thereby promoting the transfer of organics from solid to soluble phase and from macromolecules to intermediates based on the analyses of intermediates generation and bio transformation fe vi facilitates hydrolysis acidification and ce but suppresses methanogenesis which benefits the targeted transformation of intermediates to mcfas moreover fe vi screens key microorganisms and up regulates functional genes expression involved in ce pathways overall this technology avoids methanogens inhibitor addition and stimulates vivianite synthesis during mcfas production from was supporting information additional details about materials and methods

15251,the widespread presence of microplastics mps in the yangtze river the third longest river in the world has drawn increasing attention although numerous studies have been conducted recently to investigate and analyze the mps exposure to the surface water of the river most merely focus on a certain part of the yangtze river and knowledge of mps based on the basin wide is still scattered this article reveals the spatial distribution characteristics of mps in the yangtze river from the whole watershed scale among the five areas in the basin the upstream and the midstream were demonstrated to contain more mps 3598 6 particles m3 and 3226 8 particles m3 the obtained results suggested the mp presented in the entire watersheds was uneven and the hotspots occurred where the mps concentrations were relatively higher than the surrounding the discharging of the wastewater treatment plants along the river the locations of dams and the stability and fragment of mps were demonstrated to be the important driving factors in the spatial distribution of mps and leading to the appearance of the mp hotspots in the yangtze river but were previously overlooked it is the first study to evaluate the ecological risk of mps exposure to the surface water of the yangtze river with multiple assessment methods taking not only abundance but also morphological characteristics polymer composition and toxic effect into account more importantly based on the multiple individual mps risk assessment methods we developed the betamp method which achieves a comprehensive assessment of mp risk in basin wide by taking multiple mp characteristics into account for the first time this is conducive to better understanding the environmental impacts of mps pollution in the different regions of the river graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics yangtze river risk assessment spatial distribution surface water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are of global concerns on plastic debris and especially microplastics mps in the aquatic environment over years mps are defined as plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter which can be derived from the breakdown of larger plastic items or deliberately manufactured for plastics production xu et al 2021 mp has been considered an emerging contaminant due to its recalcitrance ubiquity and potentially adverse effects on the environment and human health zhang et al 2020 recent studies have reported that mps are discovered in the digestive tract of aquatic organisms and accumulated in various plants biginagwa et al 2016 mercogliano et al 2020 mazurais et al 2015 thus showing potential harmful impacts on ecosystems and agricultural sustainability ibrahim et al 2021 sun et al 2020 mps can be also exposed to humans through inhalation or ingestion biginagwa et al 2016 takebira et al 2021 vethaak and legler 2021 and contained in the tissues and organs of the human body which could cause specific toxicity by such as enhancing oxidative stress or further inducing inflammation and diseases liu et al 2021 noventa et al 2021 after entering organisms mps are able to be transferred via the food web leading to their widespread occurrence in ecosystems the marine ecosystem is well documented as the major sink of mps whereas marine mps are mainly discharged via rivers bai et al 2022 the global rivers transport as much as more than 0 8 million metric tons of plastics into oceans each year and an estimated 80 of marine mps can originate from the river source xiong et al 2019 accordingly the river has been viewed as one of the most important pathways for mps and attracts additional concern regarding mps in the freshwater system the occurrence of mps in riverine ecosystems has been reported widely and high concentrations mps have been found in both sediment and surface water of rivers as well as in aquatic organisms biginagwa et al 2016 mercogliano et al 2020 mazurais et al 2015 however most of these studies tend to discuss a certain part of a river such as estuary or downstream which are typical research hotspots and fewer studies are on the source and upstream area of rivers fan et al 2021 knowledge of mps based on the basin wide investigation and analysis is still scattered given the river environments are complex and dynamic mps can be transported and accumulated thus leading to different distribution and characteristics of mps over a spatial scale li et al 2021 yet studying localized areas of rivers merely provides limited insight into the fate and transport of mps therefore further insights into mps spatial distribution at the scale of the entire watershed are required to gain a deeper understanding of their occurrence and characteristics the yangtze river is the third longest river in the world and is recognized as a major contributor to loading mps to the oceans regarding the potential risk to the freshwater systems mps pollution in the yangtze river is of rising concern the yangtze river covers an area of about 1 8 million km2 with roughly one third of the population in china living in its basin cui et al 2021 long distance water transport from the qinghai tibet plateau as its source to the east china sea and the complex influences of anthropogenic activities within the yangtze river basin jointly result in the spatial variation in mps distribution therefore the spatial distribution of mps in the yangtze river can be affected by a variety of driving factors for example municipal studies have demonstrated that the increase of wwtps located nearby rivers and the expend of urban sewer networks significantly affect the occurrence and spatial variability of the aquatic mps du et al 2021a peters and bratton 2016 xu et al 2019 to date a number of hydropower dams have been built on the yangtze river including the three gorges dam tgd which is the largest hydropower project worldwide li and wen 2018 dams located on the river are viewed to affect water flow and possibly cause mps to accumulate or store nearby altering the spatial distribution of mps in the yangtze xu et al 2022 additionally other overlooked but possible important factors such as shipping and freight on rivers and mps stability in the riverine ecosystems du et al 2021b can also have an influence on the spatial variability of mps thereby a systematic assessment of mps contributed by considering various superimposed factors is essential to well understand the abundance and characteristics of mps in the yangtze river or on the other perspective the degree of mps pollution impact however due to the lack of a basin wide estimation the influence mechanism of the possible driving factors on the fate and transportation of the aquatic mps is still unknown moreover the sources and pathways of mps in the yangtze river originate from numerous human activities in the basin while the exposure of mps constitutes a risk to the ecosystems and human health in turn the differences in the spatial distribution of mps across regions are likely to cause a diversity of ecological risks in the yangtze river a comprehensive risk assessment of aquatic mps is able to not only provide insight into the management strategies and solutions to control or reduce the mps pollution in the yangtze river but also give an idea about the influence of river types on mps pollution however conducting a reliable risk assessment of mps is challenging by considering the toxic effects of mps can be influenced by both the morphological characteristics and the physicochemical interactions between mps particles and organisms frère et al 2016 as yet no risk assessment framework that allows for adequately examining mps exposed to the environment by taking into account their abundance together combining with their characteristics including such as sizes shapes color and polymer types accordingly the main objectives of this study were i to systematically characterize the spatial distributions of mps in the surface water on a basin wide scale to improve our understanding of the occurrence and characteristics of mps pollution in the yangtze river ii to determine the relations between mps distributions and anthropogenic impacts as well as mp environmental behaviors in the river and iii to benchmark the current approaches for mp risk assessment and develop a robust and fancy risk assessment framework that takes into account their various morphological characteristics polymer properties and toxic effects as well as the impact of each method for the yangtze river this study is the first attempt to reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of mps throughout the yangtze river basin and contributes to a better understanding of the risk of aquatic mps to the ecosystems and human health providing a baseline for future studies on the fate transport and potential impacts of mps in the riverine ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and extraction a comprehensive literature review was conducted by scientific databases including web of science science direct and springer open and focused on the publications ranging from the first published in 2014 to the most recent on the yangtze river mp relevant articles the keywords used to search relevant publications in the database included microplastic surface water changjiang and yangtze river totally the number of 808 articles were screened and as a result 194 492 sampling sites were collected and used to further analyze fig 1 more detailed information on the methods and processes of data extraction has been provided in the supplement text s1 and fig s1 in supplementary material 1 based on the geographical location the yangtze river basin can be divided into three regions namely the upstream the midstream and the downstream it should be noticed that according to the different antecedent research the region of the river s source and estuary may have particular changes on mps distribution choong et al 2021 zaki et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 thus the yangtze river was finally grouped into five districts i e the source 95 56 33 51 e to the 101 00 00 e the upstream 101 00 00 e to the 110 00 00 e the midstream 110 00 00 e to the 116 00 00 e the downstream 116 e to the 122 00 00 e and the estuary the area around the chongming island 121 54 00 e 2 2 calculation of stability and fragmentation of mps to understand the stability and particle size distribution of mps in the surface water of the yangtze river a model was used to identify the stability and fragmentation of mps and the simplified expression of this model can be defined as follows wang et al 2021 1 f x 1 e λ x α 2 f x 1 e x x 0 α where λ was the size distribution of mps α was the fragmentation pattern λαxα 1 determines the aging rate size threshold depends on the formula eq 2 and the larger or smaller size of mps is relative α was used to identify the probability of mp fragmentation and x 0 λ 1 α is the characteristic particle size i e the probability of mp fragmentation is higher with larger mp sizes for α 1 conversely α 1 means the probability of mp fragmentation is higher for smaller mp sizes wang et al 2021 2 3 risk assessment at present ecological risk assessment of mps based on concentration is widely used in many studies however we hypothesized that it cannot fully reflect the potential impact of mps exposure to the environment since the environmental impact of mp depends not only on the abundance but also on the characteristics thereby to comprehensively assess the potential ecological risk of mps exposure in the surface water of the yangtze river shapes polymers types and toxic effect of mps were all taken into consideration thus four kinds of assessment methods including the approaches of the pollution load index pli hazard scores h scores xu et al 2018 environmental status index esi and species sensitivity distribution ssd were conducted for the different areas of the entire basin specifically pli is to assess the risk of mp based on the concentration of a sampling site or a group of samplings and is described as follows xu et al 2018 3 pl i i c i c 0 4 pl i z o n e n i 1 n p l i i where pl i i and pl i z o n e are the values of a single sampling site and a group of samplings respectively ci is the concentration of mps at a sampling site c0 is defined as the minimal mp concentration at each sampling site the c0 used as the minimum average concentration in this study was 0 01 particles l according to the research of isobe et al 2014 and xu et al 2018 the risk category corresponding to the pli is in five degrees and the risk increases with level table s1 in supplementary material 1 h score of each sampling site or sampling group was calculated to evaluate the risk of mp based on the toxicity of different polymer types of mp grade and percentage xu et al 2018 5 h s c o r e i 1 n p i s i where p i is the percent of mp polymer types presented at each sampling site and s i is the score of various polymer types which has been given in supplementary material 2 table s2 the risk category is classified into five levels and is worse with a higher h score for each sampling site or sampling group table s3 in supplementary material 1 in terms of esi it is the analysis of the shapes of mps for assessing the impacts of mps on the health of organisms esi can be determined by the method developed and optimized by rangel buitrago et al 2021 6 esi i 1 n w i x i i 1 n n i where x i is the classification of mps shapes n is the number of groups of mps shapes w i is the single weight of all mps shape which is determined as w i 1 if the mp typology causes indirect damage but with no direct risk potential or w i 1 5 if the mp typology causes a direct impact esi is in a range of 1 4 indicating good mediocre unsatisfactory and bad respectively table s4 in supplementary material 1 for the approach of ssd the hazardous concentration for protecting 95 of the species hc5 was determined by an ssd model to evaluate the toxic effect of mp at each sampling site or sampling group weather pose ecotoxicological threats to the environment jung et al 2021 liu et al 2022 a total of 329 data points of mp were collected and used for ssd model construction which has been summarized in supplementary material 1 table s5 the results of ssd model and the values of hc5 for the different areas of the yangtze river have been provided in supplementary material 1 fig s1 to evaluate and compare the risk related to the toxic effect of mps exposure an index of ssd was developed and used as follows 7 ssd i 1 150 v a l u e i t n s s 100 where i represents each sampling site and the total number of the sampling sites t n s s is 150 by comparing the concentration of each sampling site c with the hc5 i e the v a l u e i is 1 if c hc5 and the v a l u e i is 0 if c hc5 2 4 method of betamp for risk assessment of mps exposure here to comprehensively assess the potential ecological risk of mps exposure in the surface water of the yangtze river a novel method of mp risk assessment named betamp with taking abundance and various characteristics of mps into account was unprecedentedly developed in this study referring to the method of beta coefficient bmpc which is mainly used to measure the sensitivity or correlation of a security or an investment portfolio to movements in the overall market liu 2013 the risk assessment method of betamp is for the first time applied to the risk assessment of mps exposure in the environment more details about the development of betamp can be found in the supplementary material 1 text s2 to distinguish and comprehensively evaluate the risk of mps in a region as well as the impact of different risk assessment methods in the same region we further subdivide bmpc into bmp c method and bmp c a r e a among them bmp c m e t h o d is used to evaluate the influence weight of different mp characteristics in a certain region on the regional risk index to determine which mp characteristics in this region have a greater impact on the environmental risk of mps bmp c a r e a is used to evaluate the environmental risk of mps in different region in a wide range to determine the harm of mps in different regions to the

normality and equal various variance spss statistics 22 0 the analysis of significant differences was based on the evaluation with p 0 05 and p 0 001 the detailed results of each data are shown in supplementary material 2 meanwhile in order to evaluate the reliability of data a binary matrix was conducted based on the concentration and the basic characteristic of mp data supplementary material 2 in which 0 denotes the absence and 1 denotes the presence of a particular type in piece of data kannankai et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of mps in surface water of the yangtze river the results of mps abundance indicate the uneven distribution of mps in surface water in different yangtze river regions fig 2 the average concentrations of mps for the upstream and midstream were 3598 6 particles m3 and 3226 8 particles m3 respectively which were higher than those for the other three regions meanwhile mps presented in the surface water of the source region were in a significant low concentration 299 4 particles m3 and mps were even not detected at some sampling sites in this region such as s4 and s11 although it is not surprising that the abundance distribution of mps in the yangtze river is varies xiong et al 2019 the concentrations of mps averaged 1049 4 particles m3 for the estuary which is much lower than many antecedent researches for example the concentration of mp in the estuary of the yangtze river was reported as 4137 3 2461 5 particles m3 zhao et al 2014a it reflects that only researching the local situation may cause incorrect results in addition and mistaken people s judgment moreover the concentration of mps does not increase with the increase of longitude as reported in previous studies which can be supposed as the spatial geographical factors yuan et al 2022 noteworthy the results obtained from a variety of mps investigations not only show that there is no obvious regularity but also suggest the complex and uneven mps distribution may lead to the appearance of mp hotspot in the watershed the concentrations of mps averaged 1856 1 and 1049 4 particles m3 for the downstream and the estuary were around twice less than those for the upstream and midstream of the yangtze river the downstream and the estuary of the yangtze river are which are typically viewed as the areas with a higher risk of mps pollution but the results are not showing the regularity of aggregation in the downstream area this may be attributed by that the abundance of mps having a relationship with various distribution driving factors including urbanization rate industrial building and natural elements that always being overlooked for example the concentration of mps in wuhan 2081 63 particles m3 a first tier city in the midstream of the yangtze river is much higher than those of some second tier cities such as jiujiang 1589 particles m3 tongling 2428 particles m3 and zhenjiang 2148 particles m3 located in the downstream of the yangtze river accordingly it is necessary to assess the mps in the yangtze river from a full perspective but not just a part of a region in case brings an inaccurate result 3 2 characteristics and composition of mps in surface water of the yangtze river 3 2 1 sizes of mps predominant aquatic mps for most of the sampling sites in the yangtze river were in a size of less than 0 5 mm fig 3 especially in the source area the proportion of smaller mps 0 5 mm was as high as 66 6 as reported mps presented in the sources of rivers could be related to the mp transportation with atmospheric migration and meanwhile smaller mps are conducive to being transported in the atmosphere allen et al 2019 long et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 it is deduced mps in the source of the yangtze river is likely to associate with atmospheric migration on the contrary most mps in the surface water of the estuary region were larger 0 5 mm 81 9 it is consistent with the fact that due to more frequent human activities like trade and freight in the estuary more primary mps are able to enter the water body interestingly the results of the size distribution of mps in the yangtze river show an obvious trend that the abundance of the larger aquatic mps e g 2 5 mm decreased from upstream to the estuary i e ordering upstream 12 midstream 11 6 downstream 6 8 estuary 3 9 on the one hand larger mps are relatively easier to be intercepted and stay in places such as dams on the other hand mps can be fragmented into small size debris after weathering by such as sunlight irradiation and biological and mechanical degradation therefore artificial buildings such as hydroelectric construction and the fragmentation of mps are possible to influence the fate and transport of mps in the yangtze river which will be discussed in more detail below 3 2 2 morphological characteristics of mps based on colors and shapes mps in this study were classified into nine color categories white transparent green blue red purple black and the rest were categorized grouped as other and four morphological categories particle fragment film and fiber transparent 11 1 29 white 5 7 31 4 and blue 14 1 29 1 were the major colors of mps in the basin wide of the yangtze river followed by black 7 6 15 8 and red 3 1 12 9 while green 1 6 9 6 and purple 0 4 13 5 were rarely detected it is worth noting that blue mps were frequently detected in the yangtze river especially in the midstream and downstream which could be related to the fact that these regions are the gathering areas for rice cultivation in china and the blue film is widely used in cultivating rice seedlings tian et al 2022 fibers were the dominant shape of mps accounting for 29 2 51 6 of the aquatic mps in the yangtze river while fragments particles and films were less detected in all areas of the river fiber has been reported by many studies as the predominant shape of mps in the river ecosystems since a number of fiber mps can enter the water body via various sources for example the wear of clothes during the washing process in daily life can produce a large number of mps and it has been reported that mps that released range from 124 to 308 mg kg during washing are able to be discharged into the river through the municipal sewage systems de falco et al 2019 notable since the outbreak of the covid 19 in 2019 the production and use of personal protective equipment mainly including disposable masks has increased dramatically and these disposable masks are inevitably being exposed to the environment it is estimated that around 129 billion pieces of used masks worldwide each month in 2020 were discharged into the ocean and mask waste could contribute 76 276 items l mps after exposure to the aquatic environment thus leading to the emergence of an increasing number of fibre mps fadare and okoffo 2020 liu et al 2022b nonetheless the morphological characteristics of mps of each sampling site vary greatly and that is caused by specific human activities there for example it was observed that the fragment of mps was dominant which was with a proportion of up to 63 6 at a sampling site near fengdu 107 74e 29 89n rather than fiber mps 36 4 while mass produced plastic packaging at a nearby fertilizer plant may be a major source of fragment mps there generally the results of the mps distribution suggested that there is no obvious trend in the morphological characteristics between the different areas of the yangtze river 3 2 3 polymer compositions of mps the major types of mps polymer included polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polycarbonate pc polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc the dominant polymer types of mps in the yangtze river were pp 35 8 38 7 followed by pe 28 2 31 1 ps 8 2 14 3 pc 3 6 6 pet 1 8 5 7 and pvc 2 9 4 these results suggested that mps in the yangtze river basin were mainly of relatively low density types such as pp pe and ps while the relatively high density mps such as pet and pvc were less detected in the surface water it may be partly explained by that the denser mps tend to settle under the action of gravity and were remained in the sediment making it difficult to migrate with water flow 3 3 factors driving the variability of the spatial distributions of mps in surface water of the yangtze river by means of the spearman correlation analysis fig s3 in supplementary material 1 it is found that the abundance of mps in the yangtze river shows a positive relationship with the real gdp per capita the population density the total regional wastewater effluent discharge the regional waterborne passenger traffic and freight volume among them factors related to the population economy and urbanization have been well documented to drive the spatial distribution of mps in the aquatic environment zhao et al 2015 and can be viewed as the main factors that lead to mp hotspot in the river watershed moreover wwtps discharging as well as dam construction and mps fragmentation mentioned above are also speculated to show a close relationship with the spatial distribution of mps in the river ecosystems while being easily overlooked 3 3 1 effect of wwtps discharging to further study the effect of wwtp discharging on the spatial distribution of mps in the river a total of 12 wwtps were chosen to compare the abundance of mps between their upstream of wwtp wwtp site and downstream of wwtp the location of wwtps along the yangtze river is shown in fig 1 and table s6 supplementary material 1 as the results shown in the fig 4 the concentrations of mps around the wwtps are generally higher than those for their upstream of wwtp and downstream of wwtp suggesting that areas near wwtp can be the hotspots of mps the presence of wwtps along the river results in the appearance of areas with relatively higher mp concentrations than nearby consistent that wwtp can be one of the sources of mps even though as high as 90 mps in sewage can be removed after treatment processes xu et al 2019 due to the huge amount of wastewater produced in cities the mps that are collected through wastewater and discharged by wwtps can cause the concentration of mps in certain areas to be obviously increased additionally wwtps in wastewater treatment processes of the wastewater treatment plant plastic in large size in the grid such as grit and sedimentation processes in physics biochemistry and other structures dealing with broken may break up into the small size and hence increase the mps concentration in the effluent 3 3 2 locations of dams we estimated the abundance distribution of mps near three of the main hydropower stations located on the yangtze river and their upstream and downstream fig 5 a comparison of mps concentrations showed 832 5 2296 7 and 7792 particles m3 were for the surface water near the baihe dam xiangjia dam and gezhou dam which were all significantly higher than that for their upstream i e an average of 374 332 and 3086 1 particles m3 and downstream i e an average of 332 578 and 784 particles m3 it suggested that mps distribution in the yangtze river basin has been obviously altered by the hydroelectric construction that is in the presence of the dams mps tend to accumulate near dams and have been decreased to downstream transport the hydroelectric construction was demonstrated to have a barrier effect throughout the yangtze river li and wen 2018 therefore resulting in the appearance of mps hotspot there this could lead to not only a reduction in the further release of mps into the ocean but also an increase of the ecological risk to the environment near the dams caused by the enhancement of mps accumulation 3 3 3 stability and fragmentation of mps to investigate the influence of the stability of mps the fragmentation of mps was determined for different regions of the yangtze river basin the values of the fragmentation parameter α were in the following order estuary 2 76 upstream 1 12 midstream 1 1 downstream 1 08 source 0 98 table 1 and fig s4 in supplementary material 1 mps presented in the source area showed more stable than other areas of the river and exhibited a lower probability of fragmentation with larger sizes α 1 than that for the other four regions α 1 these results can be attributed to the more fiber and fragment mps detected in the upstream the midstream the downstream and the estuary and fibers and fragments were with high values of α i e 1 63 and 2 34 respectively and thus more possible to downsizing moreover according to the aging rate λαxα 1 of the major polymer types of mps determined by the research of xu et al 2022 pe λαxα 1 60 2 pp λαxα 1 5 5 and pet λαxα 1 1 1 are more susceptible to weathering and fragmenting these were all the main polymer types in upstream to estuary which also suggested mps there were easier to further fragment into smaller debris than those in the source mps in the estuary had the highest degree of fragmentation compared to those presented in the other regions of the yangtze river thus it can be one of the driving factors resulting in the estuary of the river was is widely considered as a typical hotspot of mp consequently the stabilization and fragmentation of mps should be taken into consideration when studying the fate and transport of mps in the river systems 3 4 assessment of potential risks of mps in surface water of the yangtze river as the discussion above due to the uneven spatial distribution and the presence of hotspots of mps in the yangtze river mp pollution in different areas in the basin can be various and have complex environmental impacts accordingly we further evaluated and compared the risk of mps exposure in the different areas of the yangtze river based on the concentrations of mps at the 147 sampling sites the risk index of pli was firstly determined the obtained results showed that 84 4 of sampling sites were with a risk level of v suggesting that the entire watershed from the source to the estuary was at high risk of mp pollution fig 6 the values of pli for the upstream midstream and downstream were even significantly higher than those for the source and estuary which was in consistent with the abundance distribution of mp in the basin as known the estuary area is affected by e g tides that may dilute the concentration of mps in the surface water making its abundance much lower than in other areas malli et al 2022 even if that the pli results suggested that the estuary area was still at an mp risk level of as high as vi indicating that the risk of mp pollution in this area is high enough to pay more attention for example the pli for chongming an island located in the estuary was as high as 161 2 showing chongming was at a risk level of v compared with the nearby downstream areas e g shanghai and nanjing chongming in the estuary area has fewer human activities and industrial production there so the amount of primary mps discharging from the island is relatively small thus it can be speculated that the high abundance of mps occurred is likely to attribute to the effect of mps emitted from surrounding areas liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2014b for example mps discharge into the river from the industrials area of the yangtze river delta via mainstream hydrological processes luo et al 2019 compared to the results of pli based risk assessment the assessment based on esi h score and ssd index were quite various fig 6 for example the esi based assessment evaluated the source as unsatisfactory while the other four areas were only at the level of mediocre it suggested that the source was at relatively high risk of mp exposure from the perspective of the morphology which was not consistent with the results of pli based this may be explained by the high proportion of particle shaped mps in the surface water of the area of the source due to atmospheric deposition being the major source of mps there furthermore the downstream was assessed as an area with the same high level mp exposure risk as the upstream and midstream based on the pli assessment while it was suggested to be a lower risk area by h based assessment this was supported by the fact that the uneven polymer types distribution of mps in the yangtze river and the polymer types of mps with high hazardous score e g pvc were less contained in the downstream than in the upstream and midstream also the midstream and downstream that were considered to have the highest level level v risk of mps exposure based on the pli assessment were viewed to have no toxic risk to the ecosystem in the assessment of the ssd approach therefore the above confirms our hypothesis that evaluating the ecological risk of mps exposure in the yangtze river by single either the abundance or the characteristics and composition of mps tends to make an underestimation or overestimation notably the upstream which has ever been widely regarded as an area with low pollution risk zhang et al 2022 is surprisingly suggested as a high level risk area of mps exposure in the yangtze river by not only pli based assessment but also h and ssd based assessment due to various driving factors including the wwtps discharging and the locations of dams on the river causing the appearance of mp hotspot in the region of upstream of the yangtze river in fact it is reasonable to consider the risk of mps exposure is at a high level in this region additionally it is speculated that the hotspot can be related to not only the high mps concentration but also the high toxic effect of mps unlike other individual risk assessment methods betamp is to provide a quantitative recommendation on the risk level of different areas of the yangtze river from an overall perspective according to the results of betamp shown in fig 6 the comprehensive risk of the different areas of the yangtze river was in order as upstream bmpc 0 34 midstream bmpc 0 28 downstream bmpc 0 19 estuary bmpc 0 12 source bmpc 0 07 noteworthy the obtained results show that the risk level of mp pollution in the areas of upstream and midstream is more serious than the average risk level bmpc 0 2 of the entire river it suggested that for the yangtze river the upstream and midstream which are previously thought to be less polluted by mps should receive more attention on the mps pollution than before furthermore by means of betamp method the influence of each mp risk assessment method on the comprehensive mp risk assessment is also able to be determined as shown in table s7 in supplementary material 1 risk coefficients of each mp risk assessment method are in order as h 0 77 esi 0 16 pli 0 05 ssd 0 02 these obtained results indicate that the method of h index cause the highest effect on the result of the risk assessment suggesting that polymer type may have the highest impact on mps environmental risk in the yangtze river although mp abundance is typically viewed as the most important impact factor on its risk in the river systems abundance related indexes i e pli and ssd show a relatively low impact on the final risk assessment results in this case therefore it can be reasonably deduced that due to the differences in characteristics of mp pollution between different rivers or different areas of the river the main factors that cause risk could be variable however given the mps in the yangtze river have only received attention in the past decade and related research is in its infancy our analysis is certainly not fully representative nonetheless and to the best of our knowledge it represents the most comprehensive study of spatial distribution and risk assessment of mps in the riverine system so far 4 conclusion this study analyzed the distribution of abundance and characteristics of mps and evaluated the ecological risk of mp exposure apply multiple assessment methods in the entire watersheds of the yangtze river the obtained results provided a better understanding of mps pollution in the yangtze river in this study we pointed out the possibility of the appearance of the hotspot of mps in the basin in a full perspective but not just a part of a region wwtp discharging and locations of dams on the rivers as well as the stability and fragment of mp presented in surface water are treated as the important driving factors that affect the spatial distribution and contribute to the hotspot of mps in the yangtze river more importantly based on the multiple individual mps risk assessment methods we developed the betamp method which for the first time achieves a comprehensive assess mp risk in river systems with taking multiple mp characteristics into account this is conducive to making a more

15251,the widespread presence of microplastics mps in the yangtze river the third longest river in the world has drawn increasing attention although numerous studies have been conducted recently to investigate and analyze the mps exposure to the surface water of the river most merely focus on a certain part of the yangtze river and knowledge of mps based on the basin wide is still scattered this article reveals the spatial distribution characteristics of mps in the yangtze river from the whole watershed scale among the five areas in the basin the upstream and the midstream were demonstrated to contain more mps 3598 6 particles m3 and 3226 8 particles m3 the obtained results suggested the mp presented in the entire watersheds was uneven and the hotspots occurred where the mps concentrations were relatively higher than the surrounding the discharging of the wastewater treatment plants along the river the locations of dams and the stability and fragment of mps were demonstrated to be the important driving factors in the spatial distribution of mps and leading to the appearance of the mp hotspots in the yangtze river but were previously overlooked it is the first study to evaluate the ecological risk of mps exposure to the surface water of the yangtze river with multiple assessment methods taking not only abundance but also morphological characteristics polymer composition and toxic effect into account more importantly based on the multiple individual mps risk assessment methods we developed the betamp method which achieves a comprehensive assessment of mp risk in basin wide by taking multiple mp characteristics into account for the first time this is conducive to better understanding the environmental impacts of mps pollution in the different regions of the river graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics yangtze river risk assessment spatial distribution surface water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are of global concerns on plastic debris and especially microplastics mps in the aquatic environment over years mps are defined as plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter which can be derived from the breakdown of larger plastic items or deliberately manufactured for plastics production xu et al 2021 mp has been considered an emerging contaminant due to its recalcitrance ubiquity and potentially adverse effects on the environment and human health zhang et al 2020 recent studies have reported that mps are discovered in the digestive tract of aquatic organisms and accumulated in various plants biginagwa et al 2016 mercogliano et al 2020 mazurais et al 2015 thus showing potential harmful impacts on ecosystems and agricultural sustainability ibrahim et al 2021 sun et al 2020 mps can be also exposed to humans through inhalation or ingestion biginagwa et al 2016 takebira et al 2021 vethaak and legler 2021 and contained in the tissues and organs of the human body which could cause specific toxicity by such as enhancing oxidative stress or further inducing inflammation and diseases liu et al 2021 noventa et al 2021 after entering organisms mps are able to be transferred via the food web leading to their widespread occurrence in ecosystems the marine ecosystem is well documented as the major sink of mps whereas marine mps are mainly discharged via rivers bai et al 2022 the global rivers transport as much as more than 0 8 million metric tons of plastics into oceans each year and an estimated 80 of marine mps can originate from the river source xiong et al 2019 accordingly the river has been viewed as one of the most important pathways for mps and attracts additional concern regarding mps in the freshwater system the occurrence of mps in riverine ecosystems has been reported widely and high concentrations mps have been found in both sediment and surface water of rivers as well as in aquatic organisms biginagwa et al 2016 mercogliano et al 2020 mazurais et al 2015 however most of these studies tend to discuss a certain part of a river such as estuary or downstream which are typical research hotspots and fewer studies are on the source and upstream area of rivers fan et al 2021 knowledge of mps based on the basin wide investigation and analysis is still scattered given the river environments are complex and dynamic mps can be transported and accumulated thus leading to different distribution and characteristics of mps over a spatial scale li et al 2021 yet studying localized areas of rivers merely provides limited insight into the fate and transport of mps therefore further insights into mps spatial distribution at the scale of the entire watershed are required to gain a deeper understanding of their occurrence and characteristics the yangtze river is the third longest river in the world and is recognized as a major contributor to loading mps to the oceans regarding the potential risk to the freshwater systems mps pollution in the yangtze river is of rising concern the yangtze river covers an area of about 1 8 million km2 with roughly one third of the population in china living in its basin cui et al 2021 long distance water transport from the qinghai tibet plateau as its source to the east china sea and the complex influences of anthropogenic activities within the yangtze river basin jointly result in the spatial variation in mps distribution therefore the spatial distribution of mps in the yangtze river can be affected by a variety of driving factors for example municipal studies have demonstrated that the increase of wwtps located nearby rivers and the expend of urban sewer networks significantly affect the occurrence and spatial variability of the aquatic mps du et al 2021a peters and bratton 2016 xu et al 2019 to date a number of hydropower dams have been built on the yangtze river including the three gorges dam tgd which is the largest hydropower project worldwide li and wen 2018 dams located on the river are viewed to affect water flow and possibly cause mps to accumulate or store nearby altering the spatial distribution of mps in the yangtze xu et al 2022 additionally other overlooked but possible important factors such as shipping and freight on rivers and mps stability in the riverine ecosystems du et al 2021b can also have an influence on the spatial variability of mps thereby a systematic assessment of mps contributed by considering various superimposed factors is essential to well understand the abundance and characteristics of mps in the yangtze river or on the other perspective the degree of mps pollution impact however due to the lack of a basin wide estimation the influence mechanism of the possible driving factors on the fate and transportation of the aquatic mps is still unknown moreover the sources and pathways of mps in the yangtze river originate from numerous human activities in the basin while the exposure of mps constitutes a risk to the ecosystems and human health in turn the differences in the spatial distribution of mps across regions are likely to cause a diversity of ecological risks in the yangtze river a comprehensive risk assessment of aquatic mps is able to not only provide insight into the management strategies and solutions to control or reduce the mps pollution in the yangtze river but also give an idea about the influence of river types on mps pollution however conducting a reliable risk assessment of mps is challenging by considering the toxic effects of mps can be influenced by both the morphological characteristics and the physicochemical interactions between mps particles and organisms frère et al 2016 as yet no risk assessment framework that allows for adequately examining mps exposed to the environment by taking into account their abundance together combining with their characteristics including such as sizes shapes color and polymer types accordingly the main objectives of this study were i to systematically characterize the spatial distributions of mps in the surface water on a basin wide scale to improve our understanding of the occurrence and characteristics of mps pollution in the yangtze river ii to determine the relations between mps distributions and anthropogenic impacts as well as mp environmental behaviors in the river and iii to benchmark the current approaches for mp risk assessment and develop a robust and fancy risk assessment framework that takes into account their various morphological characteristics polymer properties and toxic effects as well as the impact of each method for the yangtze river this study is the first attempt to reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of mps throughout the yangtze river basin and contributes to a better understanding of the risk of aquatic mps to the ecosystems and human health providing a baseline for future studies on the fate transport and potential impacts of mps in the riverine ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and extraction a comprehensive literature review was conducted by scientific databases including web of science science direct and springer open and focused on the publications ranging from the first published in 2014 to the most recent on the yangtze river mp relevant articles the keywords used to search relevant publications in the database included microplastic surface water changjiang and yangtze river totally the number of 808 articles were screened and as a result 194 492 sampling sites were collected and used to further analyze fig 1 more detailed information on the methods and processes of data extraction has been provided in the supplement text s1 and fig s1 in supplementary material 1 based on the geographical location the yangtze river basin can be divided into three regions namely the upstream the midstream and the downstream it should be noticed that according to the different antecedent research the region of the river s source and estuary may have particular changes on mps distribution choong et al 2021 zaki et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 thus the yangtze river was finally grouped into five districts i e the source 95 56 33 51 e to the 101 00 00 e the upstream 101 00 00 e to the 110 00 00 e the midstream 110 00 00 e to the 116 00 00 e the downstream 116 e to the 122 00 00 e and the estuary the area around the chongming island 121 54 00 e 2 2 calculation of stability and fragmentation of mps to understand the stability and particle size distribution of mps in the surface water of the yangtze river a model was used to identify the stability and fragmentation of mps and the simplified expression of this model can be defined as follows wang et al 2021 1 f x 1 e λ x α 2 f x 1 e x x 0 α where λ was the size distribution of mps α was the fragmentation pattern λαxα 1 determines the aging rate size threshold depends on the formula eq 2 and the larger or smaller size of mps is relative α was used to identify the probability of mp fragmentation and x 0 λ 1 α is the characteristic particle size i e the probability of mp fragmentation is higher with larger mp sizes for α 1 conversely α 1 means the probability of mp fragmentation is higher for smaller mp sizes wang et al 2021 2 3 risk assessment at present ecological risk assessment of mps based on concentration is widely used in many studies however we hypothesized that it cannot fully reflect the potential impact of mps exposure to the environment since the environmental impact of mp depends not only on the abundance but also on the characteristics thereby to comprehensively assess the potential ecological risk of mps exposure in the surface water of the yangtze river shapes polymers types and toxic effect of mps were all taken into consideration thus four kinds of assessment methods including the approaches of the pollution load index pli hazard scores h scores xu et al 2018 environmental status index esi and species sensitivity distribution ssd were conducted for the different areas of the entire basin specifically pli is to assess the risk of mp based on the concentration of a sampling site or a group of samplings and is described as follows xu et al 2018 3 pl i i c i c 0 4 pl i z o n e n i 1 n p l i i where pl i i and pl i z o n e are the values of a single sampling site and a group of samplings respectively ci is the concentration of mps at a sampling site c0 is defined as the minimal mp concentration at each sampling site the c0 used as the minimum average concentration in this study was 0 01 particles l according to the research of isobe et al 2014 and xu et al 2018 the risk category corresponding to the pli is in five degrees and the risk increases with level table s1 in supplementary material 1 h score of each sampling site or sampling group was calculated to evaluate the risk of mp based on the toxicity of different polymer types of mp grade and percentage xu et al 2018 5 h s c o r e i 1 n p i s i where p i is the percent of mp polymer types presented at each sampling site and s i is the score of various polymer types which has been given in supplementary material 2 table s2 the risk category is classified into five levels and is worse with a higher h score for each sampling site or sampling group table s3 in supplementary material 1 in terms of esi it is the analysis of the shapes of mps for assessing the impacts of mps on the health of organisms esi can be determined by the method developed and optimized by rangel buitrago et al 2021 6 esi i 1 n w i x i i 1 n n i where x i is the classification of mps shapes n is the number of groups of mps shapes w i is the single weight of all mps shape which is determined as w i 1 if the mp typology causes indirect damage but with no direct risk potential or w i 1 5 if the mp typology causes a direct impact esi is in a range of 1 4 indicating good mediocre unsatisfactory and bad respectively table s4 in supplementary material 1 for the approach of ssd the hazardous concentration for protecting 95 of the species hc5 was determined by an ssd model to evaluate the toxic effect of mp at each sampling site or sampling group weather pose ecotoxicological threats to the environment jung et al 2021 liu et al 2022 a total of 329 data points of mp were collected and used for ssd model construction which has been summarized in supplementary material 1 table s5 the results of ssd model and the values of hc5 for the different areas of the yangtze river have been provided in supplementary material 1 fig s1 to evaluate and compare the risk related to the toxic effect of mps exposure an index of ssd was developed and used as follows 7 ssd i 1 150 v a l u e i t n s s 100 where i represents each sampling

4 method of betamp for risk assessment of mps exposure here to comprehensively assess the potential ecological risk of mps exposure in the surface water of the yangtze river a novel method of mp risk assessment named betamp with taking abundance and various characteristics of mps into account was unprecedentedly developed in this study referring to the method of beta coefficient bmpc which is mainly used to measure the sensitivity or correlation of a security or an investment portfolio to movements in the overall market liu 2013 the risk assessment method of betamp is for the first time applied to the risk assessment of mps exposure in the environment more details about the development of betamp can be found in the supplementary material 1 text s2 to distinguish and comprehensively evaluate the risk of mps in a region as well as the impact of different risk assessment methods in the same region we further subdivide bmpc into bmp c method and bmp c a r e a among them bmp c m e t h o d is used to evaluate the influence weight of different mp characteristics in a certain region on the regional risk index to determine which mp characteristics in this region have a greater impact on the environmental risk of mps bmp c a r e a is used to evaluate the environmental risk of mps in different region in a wide range to determine the harm of mps in different regions to the environment based on the formal risks index of pli h ssd and esi the calculation formula is as follows 8 bmp c m e t h o d i 1 m x i j x 0 j i j 1 i m j n x i j j 1 n x 0 j 9 bmp c a r e a j 1 n x i j

normality and equal various variance spss statistics 22 0 the analysis of significant differences was based on the evaluation with p 0 05 and p 0 001 the detailed results of each data are shown in supplementary material 2 meanwhile in order to evaluate the reliability of data a binary matrix was conducted based on the concentration and the basic characteristic of mp data supplementary material 2 in which 0 denotes the absence and 1 denotes the presence of a particular type in piece of data kannankai et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of mps in surface water of the yangtze river the results of mps abundance indicate the uneven distribution of mps in surface water in different yangtze river regions fig 2 the average concentrations of mps for the upstream and midstream were 3598 6 particles m3 and 3226 8 particles m3 respectively which were higher than those for the other three regions meanwhile mps presented in the surface water of the source region were in a significant low concentration 299 4 particles m3 and mps were even not detected at some sampling sites in this region such as s4 and s11 although it is not surprising that the abundance distribution of mps in the yangtze river is varies xiong et al 2019 the concentrations of mps averaged 1049 4 particles m3 for the estuary which is much lower than many antecedent researches for example the concentration of mp in the estuary of the yangtze river was reported as 4137 3 2461 5 particles m3 zhao et al 2014a it reflects that only researching the local situation may cause incorrect results in addition and mistaken people s judgment moreover the concentration of mps does not increase with the increase of longitude as reported in previous studies which can be supposed as the spatial geographical factors yuan et al 2022 noteworthy the results obtained from a variety of mps investigations not only show that there is no obvious regularity but also suggest the complex and uneven mps distribution may lead to the appearance of mp hotspot in the watershed the concentrations of mps averaged 1856 1 and 1049 4 particles m3 for the downstream and the estuary were around twice less than those for the upstream and midstream of the yangtze river the downstream and the estuary of the yangtze river are which are typically viewed as the areas with a higher risk of mps pollution but the results are not showing the regularity of aggregation in the downstream area this may be attributed by that the abundance of mps having a relationship with various distribution driving factors including urbanization rate industrial building and natural elements that always being overlooked for example the concentration of mps in wuhan 2081 63 particles m3 a first tier city in the midstream of the yangtze river is much higher than those of some second tier cities such as jiujiang 1589 particles m3 tongling 2428 particles m3 and zhenjiang 2148 particles m3 located in the downstream of the yangtze river accordingly it is necessary to assess the mps in the yangtze river from a full perspective but not just a part of a region in case brings an inaccurate result 3 2 characteristics and composition of mps in surface water of the yangtze river 3 2 1 sizes of mps predominant aquatic mps for most of the sampling sites in the yangtze river were in a size of less than 0 5 mm fig 3 especially in the source area the proportion of smaller mps 0 5 mm was as high as 66 6 as reported mps presented in the sources of rivers could be related to the mp transportation with atmospheric migration and meanwhile smaller mps are conducive to being transported in the atmosphere allen et al 2019 long et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 it is deduced mps in the source of the yangtze river is likely to associate with atmospheric migration on the contrary most mps in the surface water of the estuary region were larger 0 5 mm 81 9 it is consistent with the fact that due to more frequent human activities like trade and freight in the estuary more primary mps are able to enter the water body interestingly the results of the size distribution of mps in the yangtze river show an obvious trend that the abundance of the larger aquatic mps e g 2 5 mm decreased from upstream to the estuary i e ordering upstream 12 midstream 11 6 downstream 6 8 estuary 3 9 on the one hand larger mps are relatively easier to be intercepted and stay in places such as dams on the other hand mps can be fragmented into small size debris after weathering by such as sunlight irradiation and biological and mechanical degradation therefore artificial buildings such as hydroelectric construction and the fragmentation of mps are possible to influence the fate and transport of mps in the yangtze river which will be discussed in more detail below 3 2 2 morphological characteristics of mps based on colors and shapes mps in this study were classified into nine color categories white transparent green blue red purple black and the rest were categorized grouped as other and four morphological categories particle fragment film and fiber transparent 11 1 29 white 5 7 31 4 and blue 14 1 29 1 were the major colors of mps in the basin wide of the yangtze river followed by black 7 6 15 8 and red 3 1 12 9 while green 1 6 9 6 and purple 0 4 13 5 were rarely detected it is worth noting that blue mps were frequently detected in the yangtze river especially in the midstream and downstream which could be related to the fact that these regions are the gathering areas for rice cultivation in china and the blue film is widely used in cultivating rice seedlings tian et al 2022 fibers were the dominant shape of mps accounting for 29 2 51 6 of the aquatic mps in the yangtze river while fragments particles and films were less detected in all areas of the river fiber has been reported by many studies as the predominant shape of mps in the river ecosystems since a number of fiber mps can enter the water body via various sources for example the wear of clothes during the washing process in daily life can produce a large number of mps and it has been reported that mps that released range from 124 to 308 mg kg during washing are able to be discharged into the river through the municipal sewage systems de falco et al 2019 notable since the outbreak of the covid 19 in 2019 the production and use of personal protective equipment mainly including disposable masks has increased dramatically and these disposable masks are inevitably being exposed to the environment it is estimated that around 129 billion pieces of used masks worldwide each month in 2020 were discharged into the ocean and mask waste could contribute 76 276 items l mps after exposure to the aquatic environment thus leading to the emergence of an increasing number of fibre mps fadare and okoffo 2020 liu et al 2022b nonetheless the morphological characteristics of mps of each sampling site vary greatly and that is caused by specific human activities there for example it was observed that the fragment of mps was dominant which was with a proportion of up to 63 6 at a sampling site near fengdu 107 74e 29 89n rather than fiber mps 36 4 while mass produced plastic packaging at a nearby fertilizer plant may be a major source of fragment mps there generally the results of the mps distribution suggested that there is no obvious trend in the morphological characteristics between the different areas of the yangtze river 3 2 3 polymer compositions of mps the major types of mps polymer included polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polycarbonate pc polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc the dominant polymer types of mps in the yangtze river were pp 35 8 38 7 followed by pe 28 2 31 1 ps 8 2 14 3 pc 3 6 6 pet 1 8 5 7 and pvc 2 9 4 these results suggested that mps in the yangtze river basin were mainly of relatively low density types such as pp pe and ps while the relatively high density mps such as pet and pvc were less detected in the surface water it may be partly explained by that the denser mps tend to settle under the action of gravity and were remained in the sediment making it difficult to migrate with water flow 3 3 factors driving the variability of the spatial distributions of mps in surface water of the yangtze river by means of the spearman correlation analysis fig s3 in supplementary material 1 it is found that the abundance of mps in the yangtze river shows a positive relationship with the real gdp per capita the population density the total regional wastewater effluent discharge the regional waterborne passenger traffic and freight volume among them factors related to the population economy and urbanization have been well documented to drive the spatial distribution of mps in the aquatic environment zhao et al 2015 and can be viewed as the main factors that lead to mp hotspot in the river watershed moreover wwtps discharging as well as dam construction and mps fragmentation mentioned above are also speculated to show a close relationship with the spatial distribution of mps in the river ecosystems while being easily overlooked 3 3 1 effect of wwtps discharging to further study the effect of wwtp discharging on the spatial distribution of mps in the river a total of 12 wwtps were chosen to compare the abundance of mps between their upstream of wwtp wwtp site and downstream of wwtp the location of wwtps along the yangtze river is shown in fig 1 and table s6 supplementary material 1 as the results shown in the fig 4 the concentrations of mps around the wwtps are generally higher than those for their upstream of wwtp and downstream of wwtp suggesting that areas near wwtp can be the hotspots of mps the presence of wwtps along the river results in the appearance of areas with relatively higher mp concentrations than nearby consistent that wwtp can be one of the sources of mps even though as high as 90 mps in sewage can be removed after treatment processes xu et al 2019 due to the huge amount of wastewater produced in cities the mps that are collected through wastewater and discharged by wwtps can cause the concentration of mps in certain areas to be obviously increased additionally wwtps in wastewater treatment processes of the wastewater treatment plant plastic in large size in the grid such as grit and sedimentation processes in physics biochemistry and other structures dealing with broken may break up into the small size and hence increase the mps concentration in the effluent 3 3 2 locations of dams we estimated the abundance distribution of mps near three of the main hydropower stations located on the yangtze river and their upstream and downstream fig 5 a comparison of mps concentrations showed 832 5 2296 7 and 7792 particles m3 were for the surface water near the baihe dam xiangjia dam and gezhou dam which were all significantly higher than that for their upstream i e an average of 374 332 and 3086 1 particles m3 and downstream i e an average of 332 578 and 784 particles m3 it suggested that mps distribution in the yangtze river basin has been obviously altered by the hydroelectric construction that is in the presence of the dams mps tend to accumulate near dams and have been decreased to downstream transport the hydroelectric construction was demonstrated to have a barrier effect throughout the yangtze river li and wen 2018 therefore resulting in the appearance of mps hotspot there this could lead to not only a reduction in the further release of mps into the ocean but also an increase of the ecological risk to the environment near the dams caused by the enhancement of mps accumulation 3 3 3 stability and fragmentation of mps to investigate the influence of the stability of mps the fragmentation of mps was determined for different regions of the yangtze river basin the values of the fragmentation parameter α were in the following order estuary 2 76 upstream 1 12 midstream 1 1 downstream 1 08 source 0 98 table 1 and fig s4 in supplementary material 1 mps presented in the source area showed more stable than other areas of the river and exhibited a lower probability of fragmentation with larger sizes α 1 than that for the other four regions α 1 these results can be attributed to the more fiber and fragment mps detected in the upstream the midstream the downstream and the estuary and fibers and fragments were with high values of α i e 1 63 and 2 34 respectively and thus more possible to downsizing moreover according to the aging rate λαxα 1 of the major polymer types of mps determined by the research of xu et al 2022 pe λαxα 1 60 2 pp λαxα 1 5 5 and pet λαxα 1 1 1 are more susceptible to weathering and fragmenting these were all the main polymer types in upstream to estuary which also suggested mps there were easier to further fragment into smaller debris than those in the source mps in the estuary had the highest degree of fragmentation compared to those presented in the other regions of the yangtze river thus it can be one of the driving factors resulting in the estuary of the river was is widely considered as a typical hotspot of mp consequently the stabilization and fragmentation of mps should be taken into consideration when studying the fate and transport of mps in the river systems 3 4 assessment of potential risks of mps in surface water of the yangtze river as the discussion above due to the uneven spatial distribution and the presence of hotspots of mps in the yangtze river mp pollution in different areas in the basin can be various and have complex environmental impacts accordingly we further evaluated and compared the risk of mps exposure in the different areas of the yangtze river based on the concentrations of mps at the 147 sampling sites the risk index of pli was firstly determined the obtained results showed that 84 4 of sampling sites were with a risk level of v suggesting that the entire watershed from the source to the estuary was at high risk of mp pollution fig 6 the values of pli for the upstream midstream and downstream were even significantly higher than those for the source and estuary which was in consistent with the abundance distribution of mp in the basin as known the estuary area is affected by e g tides that may dilute the concentration of mps in the surface water making its abundance much lower than in other areas malli et al 2022 even if that the pli results suggested that the estuary area was still at an mp risk level of as high as vi indicating that the risk of mp pollution in this area is high enough to pay more attention for example the pli for chongming an island located in the estuary was as high as 161 2 showing chongming was at a risk level of v compared with the nearby downstream areas e g shanghai and nanjing chongming in the estuary area has fewer human activities and industrial production there so the amount of primary mps discharging from the island is relatively small thus it can be speculated that the high abundance of mps occurred is likely to attribute to the effect of mps emitted from surrounding areas liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2014b for example mps discharge into the river from the industrials area of the yangtze river delta via mainstream hydrological processes luo et al 2019 compared to the results of pli based risk assessment the assessment based on esi h score and ssd index were quite various fig 6 for example the esi based assessment evaluated the source as unsatisfactory while the other four areas were only at the level of mediocre it suggested that the source was at relatively high risk of mp exposure from the perspective of the morphology which was not consistent with the results of pli based this may be explained by the high proportion of particle shaped mps in the surface water of the area of the source due to atmospheric deposition being the major source of mps there furthermore the downstream was assessed as an area with the same high level mp exposure risk as the upstream and midstream based on the pli assessment while it was suggested to be a lower risk area by h based assessment this was supported by the fact that the uneven polymer types distribution of mps in the yangtze river and the polymer types of mps with high hazardous score e g pvc were less contained in the downstream than in the upstream and midstream also the midstream and downstream that were considered to have the highest level level v risk of mps exposure based on the pli assessment were viewed to have no toxic risk to the ecosystem in the assessment of the ssd approach therefore the above confirms our hypothesis that evaluating the ecological risk of mps exposure in the yangtze river by single either the abundance or the characteristics and composition of mps tends to make an underestimation or overestimation notably the upstream which has ever been widely regarded as an area with low pollution risk zhang et al 2022 is surprisingly suggested as a high level risk area of mps exposure in the yangtze river by not only pli based assessment but also h and ssd based assessment due to various driving factors including the wwtps discharging and the locations of dams on the river causing the appearance of mp hotspot in the region of upstream of the yangtze river in fact it is reasonable to consider the risk of mps exposure is at a high level in this region additionally it is speculated that the hotspot can be related to not only the high mps concentration but also the high toxic effect of mps unlike other individual risk assessment methods betamp is to provide a quantitative recommendation on the risk level of different areas of the yangtze river from an overall perspective according to the results of betamp shown in fig 6 the comprehensive risk of the different areas of the yangtze river was in order as upstream bmpc 0 34 midstream bmpc 0 28 downstream bmpc 0 19 estuary bmpc 0 12 source bmpc 0 07 noteworthy the obtained results show that the risk level of mp pollution in the areas of upstream and midstream is more serious than the average risk level bmpc 0 2 of the entire river it suggested that for the yangtze river the upstream and midstream which are previously thought to be less polluted by mps should receive more attention on the mps pollution than before furthermore by means of betamp method the influence of each mp risk assessment method on the comprehensive mp risk assessment is also able to be determined as shown in table s7 in supplementary material 1 risk coefficients of each mp risk assessment method are in order as h 0 77 esi 0 16 pli 0 05 ssd 0 02 these obtained results indicate that the method of h index cause the highest effect on the result of the risk assessment suggesting that polymer type may have the highest impact on mps environmental risk in the yangtze river although mp abundance is typically viewed as the most important impact factor on its risk in the river systems abundance related indexes i e pli and ssd show a relatively low impact on the final risk assessment results in this case therefore it can be reasonably deduced that due to the differences in characteristics of mp pollution between different rivers or different areas of the river the main factors that cause risk could be variable however given the mps in the yangtze river have only received attention in the past decade and related research is in its infancy our analysis is certainly not fully representative nonetheless and to the best of our knowledge it represents the most comprehensive study of spatial distribution and risk assessment of mps in the riverine system so far 4 conclusion this study analyzed the distribution of abundance and characteristics of mps and evaluated the ecological risk of mp exposure apply multiple assessment methods in the entire watersheds of the yangtze river the obtained results provided a better understanding of mps pollution in the yangtze river in this study we pointed out the possibility of the appearance of the hotspot of mps in the basin in a full perspective but not just a part of a region wwtp discharging and locations of dams on the rivers as well as the stability and fragment of mp presented in surface water are treated as the important driving factors that affect the spatial distribution and contribute to the hotspot of mps in the yangtze river more importantly based on the multiple individual mps risk assessment methods we developed the betamp method which for the first time achieves a comprehensive assess mp risk in river systems with taking multiple mp characteristics into account this is conducive to making a more standardized and robust framework to assess the risk of mps exposure so as to effectively formulate prevention and control policies and measures for mps pollution supporting information detailed

15252,despite effluent organic matter efom being a major consumer of ozone during wastewater treatment little is known about ozonation byproducts obps produced from efom to unambiguously identify obps heavy ozone was used to ozonate efom resulting in 18o labeled and unlabeled obps labeled obps mostly represent a single 18o transfer and were classified as either direct or indirect obps based on the 18o 16o intensity ratios of the isotopologues of the 929 labeled obps 84 were unequivocally classified as direct obps the remainder suggest a major contribution by indirect hydroxyl radical induced formation of obps in efom overall labelled obps possess a low degree of unsaturation and contributed most to obp peak intensity marking them as potential end products a few direct and indirect obps with high peak intensity containing 18o and heteroatoms n s were fragmented with cid ft icr ms ms and screened for indicative neutral losses carrying heavy oxygen the neutral loss screening was used to detect the 18o location on the obp and indicate the original functional group in efom based on known reaction mechanisms we identified sulfoxide and sulfonic acid functional groups in selected obps

1 introduction the discharge of organic micropollutants omps by wastewater treatment plants has been recognized as a threat to aquatic environments eggen et al 2014 schwarzenbach et al 2006 to

capodaglio 2020 gilca et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 zimmermann et al 2012 ozone is an electrophile that reacts with electron rich functional groups following well understood reaction mechanisms lee and von gunten 2010 2012 von gunten 2003a 2003b often unsaturated chemical bonds are cleaved and oxygen from ozone is added to molecules ozone turns olefins into aldehydes and ketones amines into nitro

secondary oxidant sonntag and gunten 2012 indirect reactions with hydroxyl radicals occur with ozone resistant omps leading to a more diverse and difficult to predict mixture of transformation products while transformation has been well studied for specific model compounds and targeted omps less is known about unintended ozonation byproducts obps from effluent organic matter efom gulde et

wastewater ozonation consuming ozone intended for the degradation of omps gonzales et al 2012 lamsal et al 2011 reungoat et al 2012 van gijn et al 2022 since efom is a major consumer of ozone it is important to understand the obps from efom that subsequently get released into surface waters some work has been done to characterize obps from efom generally finding that efom after ozonation contains molecular formulas that are more hydrophilic oxidized and have higher hydrocarbon saturation jin et al 2016 papageorgiou et al 2017 phungsai et al 2016 2019 shi et al 2021b ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry uhrms is the state of the art technique to study efom at a molecular level kim et al 2022 shi et al 2021a typically relative intensity changes before and after ozonation classify obps from efom which can be hindered by interferences from signals present in the efom before ozonation zhang et al 2021 measurement variability between samples can also be difficult to monitor as a result obps classified using relative intensity changes could instead simply be artifacts caused by data processing strategies this limits our ability to unambiguously identify obps in efom despite the high mass accuracy and resolution of uhrms leaving some obps undetected previous work used chromatography coupled to fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to overcome this detection issue by separating interfering isomers but the approach still requires detection based on relative intensity changes jennings et al 2022 connecting precursors to products in efom is also extremely challenging previously explored based on mass shifts between detected molecular formulas focusing on functional groups associated with ozonation such as o h2o so2 or co2 merel et al 2017 schollée et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the confidence in such connections is limited by the complex samples under investigation and a current inability to unambiguously relate precursor to product in the absence of individual standards stable isotope labeling has been used to study ozone reaction mechanisms and obps focusing on 13c 15n and 2h labeling of parents brunner et al 2019 spahr et al 2017 these studies leverage mass labeling to unambiguously identify obps and reactive sites recent advancements with 18o and ozone have made labeling obps possible through the ozonation process sierra olea et al 2022 during direct oxygen transfer ozone generated with 18o transfers a mass labeled oxygen onto the newly formed obps offering a technique to avoid reliance on relative intensity changes for obp detection in this study an ozone generator incorporating mass labeled oxygen ozonated efom to produce mass labeled obps direct infusion di ft icr ms was used to detect formulas with 18o after ozonation relative abundance of isotopologues differentiates products from direct oxygen transfer direct obps from other reactions with ozone indirect obps once identified high intensity obps containing nitrogen and sulfur were fragmented with ft icr ms ms to detect neutral losses with 18o based on the reaction mechanism of ozone fragmentation provides

element probability rules kind and fiehn 2007 higher o c ratio limit was included to allow for the detection of highly oxygenated molecular formulas remucal et al 2020 to limit false assignments from 18o inclusion and enhance confidence in the formula assignment samples were measured in triplicate including only formulas found in at least 2 out of 3 of the measurements all formulas found in blanks were removed formulas with 18o found in both non ozonated and ozonated efom samples were removed 18o formulas were only included if they were in a continuous series including the monoisotopologue intensity ratio of 18o 16o peaks was limited to 4 the mass difference between the expected and measured mass of the 18o isotope based on the monoisotopologue was also limited to 2 00424 0 00015 da this is discussed further in the results section below and si data filtering and quality control sample parameters were compared with a two sample t test using a significance level α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 unequivocal obp identification with 18o 3 1 1 data filtering and quality control more formulas were detected in the non ozonated sample 6353 compared to 4660 in ozonated efom table 1 a phenomenon seen previously in ozonation studies jennings et al 2022 remucal et al 2020 samples were analyzed at the same doc concentration under the same ft icr ms conditions likely diversification of the efom pool by large numbers of obps led to a distribution of the total intensity to more peaks with abundances closer to the detection limit since ozone can cleave molecules some obps may also fall below the lower limit of the detection range of m z 147 for quality control and evaluation of formula assignments non ozonated efom was compared to ozonated efom incorporation of 18o into formula assignments caused a dramatic increase in false and multiple assignments the combination of conventional molecular formula filtering techniques including blank subtraction triplicate measurements and limiting ppm mass error and 18o specific filtering steps used here were required to decrease the number of 18o formulas detected in the non ozonated control and reduce the number of multiple assignments to less than 1 see si data filtering and quality control for more information series continuity is a key parameter to support correct formula assignments based on the number of 18o additions to a molecular formula the number in a series and the purity of mass labeled oxygen in the ozone generator we can estimate the expected relative abundance of the monoisotopic peak compared to the mass labeled peaks using the detected relative abundance as a filtering criterion the exact mass difference between the 16o and the 18o isotopologue was also used as a filtering criterion with a mass difference higher than 0 15 mda most likely indicating the alternative formulas containing ch2 16o2 not the 18on2 containing formulas see si and figure s4 3 1 2 labeled and unlabeled obps with the addition of mass labeled ozone 929 molecular formulas can be identified as labeled obps nearly one third 282 are undetectable as obps without 18o since the change in relative intensity after ozonation is not high enough to classify the monoisotopologue as an obp fig 1 a the rest of the 18o labeled obps 647 are detectable with the traditional approach based on changes in peak intensity 216 of labeled obps do not have the monoisotopologue present before ozonation marking them as newly formed unique obp formulas previous work with lc ft icr ms has shown that obp detection relying on changes in relative intensity often misses obps since the changes in relative intensity can be variable and obps do not always reach the threshold for classification jennings et al 2022 by using mass labeled ozone obps can be identified without relying on relative intensity differences removing the sample to sample bias inherent in the traditional approach however not all obps generated during ozonation are expected to contain mass labeled oxygen more unlabeled obps were found compared to labeled obps 1338 and 929 respectively the mass label itself comes from direct oxygen transfer from ozone or through hydroxyl radical reactions after ozone initially reacts via a different pathway other obps formed from bond cleavage or other reactions without 18o will not have 18o incorporated into their molecular formula for any obp without 18o detection must still be based on changes in relative intensity it is impossible to determine which or how many of the unlabeled obps are truly formed from ozonation and which are actually an artifact due to data processing just over half of the unlabeled obps are newly detected in ozonated efom 820 unique while the rest were detected as molecular formula prior to ozonation only labeled obps can be unambiguously identified as formulas formed through reactions with ozone labeled obps had significantly different molecular descriptors compared to unlabeled obps with higher peak intensity and intensity weighted averages wa of m z p 0 0001 and lower double bond equivalence minus oxygen dbe owa 1 52 compared to 1 03 for unlabeled obps p 0 003 fig 2 lower dbe owa implies that labeled molecular formulas are missing the double bonded structures typically the target for ozone nominal oxidation state of carbon noscwa an indication of molecular polarity was slightly lower for labeled obps lower signal intensity for unlabeled obps implies detection limits may be responsible for some unlabeled obps missing a labeled counterpart but all unlabeled obps have high enough signal intensity for a corresponding labeled obp to be detectable based on instrument sensitivity when compared to previous studies on obp characterization labeled obps have lower m z wa dbe owa and higher o cwa than previously reported aggregate values phungsai et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 except for highly polar ops detected only without extraction using lc ft icr ms jennings et al 2022 this shows that the labeled ops are the most polar fraction of obps in efom and are likely the main drivers of the observed higher polarity while unlabeled obps represent the fraction of lower polarity opbs previously identified 3 2 differentiating direct and indirect labeled ozonation byproducts 3 2 1 intensity ratios for direct obp detection with the known percentage of 18o in the ozone generator the measured isotopologue distribution can distinguish direct oxygen transfer obps direct obps from obps produced from hydroxyl radical reactions or other side reactions possible during ozonation indirect obps hydroxyl radical reactions do not selectively transfer oxygen to products so the 18o 16o ratio of hydroxyl radicals is not the same as for ozone leading to highly variable 18o 16o ratios von gunten 2003a see si 18o intensity ratio predictions for more details about the calculation of relative abundance for labeled obps by using simple probability assessment and assuming all isotopologues share the same ionization efficiency we can determine which 18o labeled series follow the expected trend for direct oxygen transfer reactions and are most likely direct obps a window of 10 around the expected intensity fraction was used for obp classification only 84 obps were found within this range and were classified as direct obps while the remaining 845 obps were classified as indirect obps since they did not fit the expected intensity pattern fig 3 the vast majority of direct obps were molecular formulas with three nitrogen atoms 69 out of the 84 direct obps see si obp composition in contrast indirect obps mostly contain zero or one nitrogen 840 out of 845 while this could be a reflection of different reaction mechanisms associated with the number of nitrogens it is most likely caused by interferences described below impairing the most accurate detection of all direct obps in other formula classes the variable 16o 18o intensity ratio of indirect obps may be the result of a combination of direct oxygen transfer reactions with expected 18o 16o ratio and hydroxyl radical reactions with unknown 18o 16o ratios moreover these different reactions and corresponding obps leading to the same mass labeled molecular formula might either originate from the same compound having multiple reaction pathways or from different compounds i e isomers or different precursors having different ozone reaction mechanisms however this is impossible to distinguish based on di data alone since isomers cannot be separated the presence of the monoisotopologue before ozonation may indicate which obps have different reaction pathways and which have altered intensity ratios from formulas already present in efom prior to ozonation identified obps where the molecular formula was already present in efom prior ozonation consistently have a lower intensity ratio than expected from direct oxygen transfer indicating that monoisotopologue abundance may be artificially larger due to intrinsic monoisotopologue contribution fig 3a obps that are uniquely found after ozonation but also have a lower intensity ratio may in fact be examples of obps with different reaction mechanisms other than direct oxygen transfer this may explain why no cho and chn1o molecular formulas are classified as direct obps fig 3b si obp composition the vast majority of labeled cho molecular formulas have monoisotopologue present before ozonation and presumably still after ozonation this artificially lowers the intensity ratio below the threshold for classification as direct obps despite cho being the most abundant 18o containing molecular formula class intrinsic monoisotopologues limit our ability to unambiguously identify all the direct oxygen transfer products from efom even with the mass label despite the marked advantage of finding direct obps with far more confidence using the mass labeling approach indirectly labeled obps have higher combined series peak intensity compared to direct obps see si figure s5 and are more abundant in terms of number of detected obps this suggests that indirect reactions produce the majority of obps from efom or at least are the most abundantly detected when isomeric separation is not possible this also implies that direct oxygen transfer reactions with efom do not represent the major reaction pathway for efom during ozonation chemical parameters of efom obps detected in previous work using non labeled ozone more closely resemble the indirect obps defined in this study direct obps have a higher o cwa ratio than indirect obps 0 77 compared to 0 54 lower dbe owa 2 74 compared to 1 49 and much higher noscwa 0 99 than indirect obps and values previously reported in the literature 0 07 for indirect obps and 0 10 reported by zhang et al 2021 all of these findings indicate that direct obps are the most highly oxidized and most polar molecular formulas in ozonated efom even if they are not the most abundant based on our current analytical capabilities 3 2 2 isomeric complexity of obps based on lc ft icr ms direct and indirect obps have different elution profiles in reversed phase liquid chromatography suggesting that isomeric complexity contributes to inhibited direct obp detection typically dom elutes as broad peaks over several minutes during lc reverse phase separation highlighting the isomeric and functional complexity of the dom mixture han et al 2020 hawkes et al 2018 kim et al 2019 direct obps have narrower elution profiles in lc ft icr ms compared to indirect obps 1 7 and 6 5 mins on average respectively the direct obp in fig 4 b elutes over only three mins compared to over seven minutes for the indirect obp fig 4a lower functional diversity of direct obps monoisotopologues may contribute to the direct obp classification with less inhibiting isomers hindering unequivocal classification labeled isotopologues also have narrower elution profiles compared to unlabeled implying less isomeric diversity in labeled obps when chromatographically separated mass labeled products tend to have shorter retention time windows than their unlabeled counterpart with an average of 4 1 and 3 1 min for indirect and direct obps respectively this suggests that the 18o isotopologues may have less isomeric diversity than the monoisotopologues detected with lc even with some isomeric separation co eluting isomers and intrinsic 16o could still impact the apparent relative abundance of isotopologues inhibiting direct obp classification despite the separation provided by lc the relative abundance of the 18o1 isotopologue in each one minute segment is very close to the relative abundance calculated in the di spectrum 0 21 for indirect and 0 43 for direct while intrinsic 16o may still be contributing to this ratio in the indirect obp the consistent ratios across segments imply that this obp is very likely an indirect obp not a direct obp with isomeric interference lc separation offers unique insight into the possible isotopes in efom but still can t fully resolve the ultra complex mixture 3 3 efom transformation during ozonation 3 3 1 oxygen additions to efom mass labeled ozone provides a direct view into oxygen transfer reactions occurring during ozonation the vast majority of labeled obps only contain one 18o meaning the obp was produced by only one oxygen transfer reaction with ozone fig 5 previous work by zhang et al 2021 found most precursor product pairs after ozonation contained the addition of 3 oxygen atoms but our results suggest this is not the case for the ozone does of 0 5 o3 mg doc used here compared to up to 1 21 by zhang et al while a three oxygen mass difference may be common due to the high diversity of the sample in fact only very few obps have 3 oxygens added to their molecular formula based on the detectable addition of 18o instead other transformations are more likely taking place during ozonation such as molecular cleavage or single oxygen transfer reactions the number of isotopologues i e additions of 18o is correlated to both peak intensity and molecular weight the intensity weighted average molecular weight mwwa of obps with two 18o additions 336 4219 da is lower than for just one 18o 374 5174 da which is also lower than unlabeled obps 382 4481 da see si isotopologue series this suggests lower masses are associated with more oxygen transfers and therefore may have more reactive sites or could undergo several reactions with ozone similarly peak intensity significantly increases with the number of isotopologues in a series except for series with 18o3 see si figure s10 this implies that ozone reacts predominantly with the most abundant precursors based on the intensity of the obps this improved understanding of efom transformation can only be achieved by incorporation of mass labeled ozone 3 3 2 sulfoxides and sulfonic acids in efom obps the presence of 18o as part of the neutral loss during fragmentation or the fragment ion formed indicates the location of the mass label and which functional groups are produced through ozonation the direct chos obp and two of the three indirect chos obps fragmented had neutral losses of so2 18o so18o and ch3s18oh indicating the presence of sulfoxides and sulfonic acids produced by ozonation fig 6 bailey 1958 the neutral loss with 18o also confirms the presence of sulfides and thioesters in non ozonated efom the fragmented obps generated neutral losses of so3 so2 and ch3soh without 18o but in lower abundance compared to the 18o containing neutral losses which may be an indication of multiple reaction sites on the original precursors or isomers leading to different 18o functional groups on the obps there is an abundance of sulfonates r so3 and sulfonic acid esters r so4h containing molecules in wastewater due to the high amount of detergents present gonsior et al 2011 organic sulfoxides and sulfonic acids often deprotonated at typical surface water ph leading to higher polarity increased environmental transport and potentially higher toxic effects as anionic surfactants bradley and bérubé 2008 reemtsma et al 2002 zhang et al 2022 here we show oxidized sulfur molecules are formed during the ozonation process as distinguished by the presence of 18o on the oxidized sulfur functional group fragmentation and indicative neutral losses with the incorporation of mass labeled ozone offers unique insight into the functional groups in efom and offers the potential for further structural elucidation of ozonation precursors 3 3 3 nitro groups and n oxides in efom obps tertiary amines in efom can react with ozone to produce n oxides which have been found to be more stable than other transformation products from omps gulde et al 2021 hübner et al 2015 sonntag and gunten 2012 with this additional stability it is important to monitor n oxide formation during ozonation for both omps as well as from efom there are few non target approaches available to detect n oxides formed from efom even though efom typically contains higher amounts of nitrogen compared to other water sources merel et al 2017 one direct chno one direct chnos and three indirect chno obps were selected for fragmentation to screen for indicative neutral losses with 18o see si fragmentation data in order to search for evidence of n oxide formation in efom the neutral losses of no2 and no can indicate the presence of nitro and n oxide groups in obps lim et al 2019 deoxylation has been associated with n oxide fragmentation so the neutral loss of o was also searched for even though this is less specific and may come from other functional groups during fragmentation ibrahim et al 2013 tong et al 2001 neutral losses of no2 and no with or without 18o were not detected in any of the chno obps fragmented here an 18o neutral loss however was detected for two of the three indirect chno obps fragmented possibly indicating n oxide formation it is worth noting that two of the three indirect chos obps no n present also had 18o neutral loss detected emphasizing that a single o loss is not by itself indicative of n oxide presence tertiary amines may also not be present in sufficient amounts for detection with this approach peak intensity ionization polarity and sensitivity of fragment detection may play a role in which functional groups could be detected in efom further research aimed at detection of n oxides in efom is needed to better understand the possible impact of ozone on wastewater effluent 4 conclusions with the mass labeled obps we can unambiguously distinguish obps from the complex efom labeled obps are more certainly formed by ozonation while the traditional detection methods may miss or include molecular formulas as artifacts of data processing which are not true obps the 18o label increases confidence in the obp assignments mass labeled peak ratios can distinguish products of direct oxygen transfer reactions from obps generated from other or multiple reactions showing possible reaction mechanism patterns while the detection of direct obps is still inhibited due to isomeric complexity this advancement still highlights the ability to leverage 18o3 for reaction mechanism investigation in combination with ft icr ms ms 18o containing neutral losses can be found and linked to obp structures and the redox state of efom itself here only few obps were screened with this approach but by scaling up the ms ms data collection and processing more information about the functional groups present in efom and their reaction with ozone can be gained sulfoxides and sulfonic acids produced through ozonation are detectable with neutral loss screening but evidence of n oxide formation in efom has not been found with this approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15252,despite effluent organic matter efom being a major consumer of ozone during wastewater treatment little is known about ozonation byproducts obps produced from efom to unambiguously identify obps heavy ozone was used to ozonate efom resulting in 18o labeled and unlabeled obps labeled obps mostly represent a single 18o transfer and were classified as either direct or indirect obps based on the 18o 16o intensity ratios of the isotopologues of the 929 labeled obps 84 were unequivocally classified as direct obps the remainder suggest a major contribution by indirect hydroxyl radical induced formation of obps in efom overall labelled obps possess a low degree of unsaturation and contributed most to obp peak intensity marking them as potential end products a few direct and indirect obps with high peak intensity containing 18o and heteroatoms n s were fragmented with cid ft icr ms ms and screened for indicative neutral losses carrying heavy oxygen the neutral loss screening was used to detect the 18o location on the obp and indicate the original functional group in efom based on known reaction mechanisms we identified sulfoxide and sulfonic acid functional groups in selected obps

1 introduction the discharge of organic micropollutants omps by wastewater treatment plants has been recognized as a threat to aquatic environments eggen et al 2014 schwarzenbach et al 2006 to mitigate this threat ozonation is already tested and applied for post treatment of effluents in several countries including switzerland germany china and the us bourgin et al 2018 deniere et al 2021 itzel et al 2017 kharel et al 2020 kosek et al 2020 oneby et al 2010 during the treatment process ozone disinfects wastewater and acts as a chemical oxidant to remove contaminants of concern capodaglio 2020 gilca et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 zimmermann et al 2012 ozone is an electrophile that reacts with electron rich functional groups following well understood reaction mechanisms lee and von gunten 2010 2012 von gunten 2003a 2003b often unsaturated chemical bonds are cleaved and oxygen from ozone is added to molecules ozone turns olefins into aldehydes and ketones amines into nitro and n oxide groups and sulfides into sulfonic acids and sulfoxides hübner et al 2015 shen et al 2021 sonntag and gunten 2012 ozone also produces hydroxyl radicals a highly reactive and unselective secondary oxidant sonntag and gunten 2012 indirect reactions with hydroxyl radicals occur with ozone resistant omps leading to a more diverse and difficult to predict mixture of transformation products while transformation has been well studied for specific model compounds and targeted omps less is known about unintended ozonation byproducts obps from effluent organic matter efom gulde et al 2021 huber et al 2003 li et al 2019 snyder et al 2006 these and reemtsma 2005 wang and chen 2020 zhang et al 2017 typically efom has been considered an interfering pool of substances during wastewater ozonation consuming ozone intended for the degradation of omps gonzales et al 2012 lamsal et al 2011 reungoat et al 2012 van gijn et al 2022 since efom is a major consumer of ozone it is important to understand the obps from efom that subsequently get released into surface waters some work has been done to characterize obps from efom generally finding that efom after ozonation contains molecular formulas that are more hydrophilic oxidized and have higher hydrocarbon saturation jin et al 2016 papageorgiou et al 2017 phungsai et al 2016 2019 shi et al 2021b ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry uhrms is the state of the art technique to study efom at a molecular level kim et al 2022 shi et al 2021a typically relative intensity changes before and after ozonation classify obps from efom which can be hindered by interferences from signals present in the efom before ozonation zhang et al 2021 measurement variability between samples can also be difficult to monitor as a result obps classified using relative intensity changes could instead simply be artifacts caused by data processing strategies this limits our ability to unambiguously identify obps in efom despite the high mass accuracy and resolution of uhrms leaving some obps undetected previous work used chromatography coupled to fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms to overcome this detection issue by separating interfering isomers but the approach still requires detection based on relative intensity changes jennings et al 2022 connecting precursors to products in efom is also extremely challenging previously explored based on mass shifts between detected molecular formulas focusing on functional groups associated with ozonation such as o h2o so2 or co2 merel et al 2017 schollée et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the confidence in such connections is limited by the complex samples under investigation and a current inability to unambiguously relate precursor to product in the absence of individual standards stable isotope labeling has been used to study ozone reaction mechanisms and obps focusing on 13c 15n and 2h labeling of parents brunner et al 2019 spahr et al 2017 these studies leverage mass labeling to unambiguously identify obps and reactive sites recent advancements with 18o and ozone have made labeling obps possible through the ozonation process sierra olea et al 2022 during direct oxygen transfer ozone generated with 18o transfers a mass labeled oxygen onto the newly formed obps offering a technique to avoid reliance on relative intensity changes for obp detection in this study an ozone generator incorporating mass labeled oxygen ozonated efom to produce mass labeled obps direct infusion di ft icr ms was used to detect formulas with 18o after ozonation relative abundance of isotopologues differentiates products from direct oxygen transfer direct obps from other reactions with ozone indirect obps once identified high intensity obps containing nitrogen and sulfur were fragmented with ft icr ms ms to detect neutral losses with 18o based on the reaction mechanism of ozone fragmentation provides insight into the functional groups present in non ozonated efom this direct insight into precursor product pairs in complex efom is currently unavailable with alternative methods 2 materials and

to limit sample matrix during ozonation and simplify the composition of sample to be analyzed during di ft icr ms however spe does not recover highly polar components of dom losing some of the most

confirmed with reference compound venlafaxine which primarily reacts with ozone via single oxygen transfer reaction to produce venlafaxine n oxide zucker et al 2017 a venlafaxine solution was ozonated with the same stock solution used for efom experiments and the measured ratio of 16o and 18o containing venlafaxine n oxide determined that approximately 44 of the oxygen in ozone was labeled here we used 51 instead as this better reflected the distribution of isotope ratios for a larger range of detected compounds see si data filtering and quality control 2 4 ft icr ms and ms ms methods an ft icr

each isolation window to optimize fragmentation iat was increased to 2000 ms to improve sensitivity and 32 scans acquired each ms ms spectrum was screened for indicative neutral losses focusing on nitrogen and sulfur containing functional groups 2 5 lc ft icr ms samples were diluted to 10 mg l doc in ultrapure water for lc ft icr ms analysis the online lc method employing a post colum counter

hydroxide to reach ph 3 sfra diluted to 10 mg l carbon was used as quality control injected before and after samples to ensure consistent column performance ft icr ms settings were the same as for di measurements except iat was increased to 400 ms chromatograms were divided into one minute long segments each of which was averaged into one mass spectra this generates binned data based on each minute instead of the seemingly continuous data from other lc systems 2 6 data processing molecular formulas were assigned to peaks in the di full scan spectra using in house software with the following parameters mass error of 0 2 ppm c1 60 h1 122 o0 40 18o0 5 n0 4 s0 2 other limits to formula assignments include 0 3 h c 3 0 o c 1 2 0 n c 1 5 0 dbe double bond equivalent 25 10 dbe o 10 and element probability rules kind and fiehn 2007 higher o c ratio limit was included to allow for the detection of highly oxygenated molecular formulas remucal et al 2020 to limit false assignments from 18o inclusion and enhance confidence in the formula assignment samples were measured in triplicate including only formulas found in at least 2 out of 3 of the measurements all formulas found in blanks were removed formulas with 18o found in both non ozonated and ozonated efom samples were removed 18o formulas were only included if they were in a continuous series including the monoisotopologue intensity ratio of 18o 16o peaks was limited to 4 the mass difference between the expected and measured mass of the 18o isotope based on the monoisotopologue was also limited to 2 00424 0 00015 da this is discussed further in the results section below and si data filtering and quality control sample parameters were compared with a two sample t test using a significance level α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 unequivocal obp identification with 18o 3 1 1 data filtering and quality control more formulas were detected in the non ozonated sample 6353 compared to 4660 in ozonated efom table 1 a phenomenon seen previously in ozonation studies jennings et al 2022 remucal et al 2020 samples were analyzed at the same doc concentration under the same ft icr ms conditions likely diversification of the efom pool by large numbers of obps led to a distribution of the total intensity to more peaks with abundances closer to the detection limit since ozone can cleave molecules some obps may also fall below the lower limit of the detection range of m z 147 for quality control and evaluation of formula assignments non ozonated efom was compared to ozonated efom incorporation of 18o into formula assignments caused a dramatic increase in false and multiple assignments the combination of conventional molecular formula filtering techniques including blank subtraction triplicate measurements and limiting ppm mass error and 18o specific filtering steps used here were required to decrease the number of 18o formulas detected in the non ozonated control and reduce the number of multiple assignments to less than 1 see si data filtering and quality control for more information series continuity is a key parameter to support correct formula assignments based on the number of 18o additions to a molecular formula the number in a series and the purity of mass labeled oxygen in the ozone generator we can estimate the expected relative abundance of the monoisotopic peak compared to the mass labeled peaks using the detected relative abundance as a filtering criterion the exact mass difference between the 16o and the 18o isotopologue was also used as a filtering criterion with a mass difference higher than 0 15 mda most likely indicating the alternative formulas containing ch2 16o2 not the 18on2 containing formulas see si and figure s4 3 1 2 labeled and unlabeled obps with the addition of mass labeled ozone 929 molecular formulas can be identified as labeled obps nearly one third 282 are undetectable as obps without 18o since the change in relative intensity after ozonation is not high enough to classify the monoisotopologue as an obp fig 1 a the rest of the 18o labeled obps 647 are detectable with the traditional approach based on changes in peak intensity 216 of labeled obps do not have the monoisotopologue present before ozonation marking them as newly formed unique obp formulas previous work with lc ft icr ms has shown that obp detection relying on changes in relative intensity often misses obps since the changes in relative intensity can be variable and obps do not always reach the threshold for classification jennings et al 2022 by using mass labeled ozone obps can be identified without relying on relative intensity differences removing the sample to sample bias inherent in the traditional approach however not all obps generated during ozonation are expected to contain mass labeled oxygen more unlabeled obps were found compared to labeled obps 1338 and 929 respectively the mass label itself comes from direct oxygen transfer from ozone or through hydroxyl radical reactions after ozone initially reacts via a different pathway other obps formed from bond cleavage or other reactions without 18o will not have 18o incorporated into their molecular formula for any obp without 18o detection must still be based on changes in relative intensity it is impossible to determine which or how many of the unlabeled obps are truly formed from ozonation and which are actually an artifact due to data processing just over half of the unlabeled obps are newly detected in ozonated efom 820 unique while the rest were detected as molecular formula prior to ozonation only labeled obps can be unambiguously identified as formulas formed through reactions with ozone labeled obps had significantly different molecular descriptors compared to unlabeled obps with higher peak intensity and intensity weighted averages wa of m z p 0 0001 and lower double bond equivalence minus oxygen dbe owa 1 52 compared to 1 03 for unlabeled obps p 0 003 fig 2 lower dbe owa implies that labeled molecular formulas are missing the double bonded structures typically the target for ozone nominal oxidation state of carbon noscwa an indication of molecular polarity was slightly lower for labeled obps lower signal intensity for unlabeled obps implies detection limits may be responsible for some unlabeled obps missing a labeled counterpart but all unlabeled obps have high enough signal intensity for a corresponding labeled obp to be detectable based on instrument sensitivity when compared to previous studies on obp characterization labeled obps have lower m z wa dbe owa and higher o cwa than previously reported aggregate values phungsai et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 except for highly polar ops detected only without extraction using lc ft icr ms jennings et al 2022 this shows that the labeled ops are the most polar fraction of obps in efom and are likely the main drivers of the observed higher polarity while unlabeled obps represent the fraction of lower polarity opbs previously identified 3 2 differentiating direct and indirect labeled ozonation byproducts 3 2 1 intensity ratios for direct obp detection with the known percentage of 18o in the ozone generator the measured isotopologue distribution can distinguish direct oxygen transfer obps direct obps from obps produced from hydroxyl radical reactions or other side reactions possible during ozonation indirect obps hydroxyl radical reactions do not selectively transfer oxygen to products so the 18o 16o ratio of hydroxyl radicals is not the same as for ozone leading to highly variable 18o 16o ratios von gunten 2003a see si 18o intensity ratio predictions for more details about the calculation of relative abundance for labeled obps by using simple probability assessment and assuming all isotopologues share the same ionization efficiency we can determine which 18o labeled series follow the expected trend for direct oxygen transfer reactions and are most likely direct obps a window of 10 around the expected intensity fraction was used for obp classification only 84 obps were found within this range and were classified as direct obps while the remaining 845 obps were classified as indirect obps since they did not fit the expected intensity pattern fig 3 the vast majority of direct obps were molecular formulas with three nitrogen atoms 69 out of the 84 direct obps see si obp composition in contrast indirect obps mostly contain zero or one nitrogen 840 out of 845 while this could be a reflection of different reaction mechanisms associated with the number of nitrogens it is most likely caused by interferences described below impairing the most accurate detection of all direct obps in other formula classes the variable 16o 18o intensity ratio of indirect obps may be the result of a combination of direct oxygen transfer reactions with expected 18o 16o ratio and hydroxyl radical reactions with unknown 18o 16o ratios moreover these different reactions and corresponding obps leading to the same mass labeled molecular formula might either originate from the same compound having multiple reaction pathways or from different compounds i e isomers or different precursors having different ozone reaction mechanisms however this is impossible to distinguish based on di data alone since isomers cannot be separated the presence of the monoisotopologue before ozonation may indicate which obps have different reaction pathways and which have altered intensity ratios from formulas already present in efom prior to ozonation identified obps where the molecular formula was already present in efom prior ozonation consistently have a lower intensity ratio than expected from direct oxygen transfer indicating that monoisotopologue abundance may be artificially larger due to intrinsic monoisotopologue contribution fig 3a obps that are uniquely found after ozonation but also have a lower intensity ratio may in fact be examples of obps with different reaction mechanisms other than direct oxygen transfer this may explain why no cho and chn1o molecular formulas are classified as direct obps fig 3b si obp composition the vast majority of labeled cho molecular formulas have monoisotopologue present before ozonation and presumably still after ozonation this artificially lowers the intensity ratio below the threshold for classification as direct obps despite cho being the most abundant 18o containing molecular formula class intrinsic monoisotopologues limit our ability to unambiguously identify all the direct oxygen transfer products from efom even with the mass label despite the marked advantage of finding direct obps with far more confidence using the mass labeling approach indirectly labeled obps have higher combined series peak intensity compared to direct obps see si figure s5 and are more abundant in terms of number of detected obps this suggests that indirect reactions produce the majority of obps from efom or at least are the most abundantly detected when isomeric separation is not possible this also implies that direct oxygen transfer reactions with efom do not represent the major reaction pathway for efom during ozonation chemical parameters of efom obps detected in previous work using non labeled ozone more closely resemble the indirect obps defined in this study direct obps have a higher o cwa ratio than indirect obps 0 77 compared to 0 54 lower dbe owa 2 74 compared to 1 49 and much higher noscwa 0 99 than indirect obps and values previously reported in the literature 0 07 for indirect obps and 0 10 reported by zhang et al 2021 all of these findings indicate that direct obps are the most highly oxidized and most polar molecular formulas in ozonated efom even if they are not the most abundant based on our current analytical capabilities 3 2 2 isomeric complexity of obps based on lc ft icr ms direct and indirect obps have different elution profiles in reversed phase liquid chromatography suggesting that isomeric complexity contributes to inhibited direct obp detection typically dom elutes as broad peaks over several minutes during lc reverse phase separation highlighting the isomeric and functional complexity of the dom mixture han et al 2020 hawkes et al 2018 kim et al 2019 direct obps have narrower elution profiles in lc ft icr ms compared to indirect obps 1 7 and 6 5 mins on average respectively the direct obp in fig 4 b elutes over only three mins compared to over seven minutes for the indirect obp fig 4a lower functional diversity of direct obps monoisotopologues may contribute to the direct obp classification with less inhibiting isomers hindering unequivocal classification labeled isotopologues also have narrower elution profiles compared to unlabeled implying less isomeric diversity in labeled obps when chromatographically separated mass labeled products tend to have shorter retention time windows than their unlabeled counterpart with an average of 4 1 and 3 1 min for indirect and direct obps respectively this suggests that the 18o isotopologues may have less isomeric diversity than the monoisotopologues detected with lc even with some isomeric separation co eluting isomers and intrinsic 16o could still impact the apparent relative abundance of isotopologues inhibiting direct obp classification despite the separation provided by lc the relative abundance of the 18o1 isotopologue in each one minute segment is very close to the relative abundance calculated in the di spectrum 0 21 for indirect and 0 43 for direct while intrinsic 16o may still be contributing to this ratio in the indirect obp the consistent ratios across segments imply that this obp is very likely an indirect obp not a direct obp with isomeric interference lc separation offers unique insight into the possible isotopes in efom but still can t fully resolve the ultra complex mixture 3 3 efom transformation during ozonation 3 3 1 oxygen additions to efom mass labeled ozone provides a direct view into oxygen transfer reactions occurring during ozonation the vast majority of labeled obps only contain one 18o meaning the obp was produced by only one oxygen transfer reaction with ozone fig 5 previous work by zhang et al 2021 found most precursor product pairs after ozonation contained the addition of 3 oxygen atoms but our results suggest this is not the case for the ozone does of 0 5 o3 mg doc used here compared to up to 1 21 by zhang et al while a three oxygen mass difference may be common due to the high diversity of the sample in fact only very few obps have 3 oxygens added to their molecular formula based on the detectable addition of 18o instead other transformations are more likely taking place during ozonation such as molecular cleavage or single oxygen transfer reactions the number of isotopologues i e additions of 18o is correlated to both peak intensity and molecular weight the intensity weighted average molecular weight mwwa of obps with two 18o additions 336 4219 da is lower than for just one 18o 374 5174 da which is also lower than unlabeled obps 382 4481 da see si isotopologue series this suggests lower masses are associated with more oxygen transfers and therefore may have more reactive sites or could undergo several reactions with ozone similarly peak intensity significantly increases with the number of isotopologues in a series except for series with 18o3 see si figure s10 this implies that ozone reacts predominantly with the most abundant precursors based on the intensity of the obps this improved understanding of efom transformation can only be achieved by incorporation of mass labeled ozone 3 3 2 sulfoxides and sulfonic acids in efom obps the presence of 18o as part of the neutral loss during fragmentation or the fragment ion formed indicates the location of the mass label and which functional groups are produced through ozonation the direct chos obp and two of the three indirect chos obps fragmented had neutral losses of so2 18o so18o and ch3s18oh indicating the presence of sulfoxides and sulfonic acids produced by ozonation fig 6 bailey 1958 the neutral loss with 18o also confirms the presence of sulfides and thioesters in non ozonated efom the fragmented obps generated neutral losses of so3 so2 and ch3soh without 18o but in lower abundance compared to the 18o containing neutral losses which may be an indication of multiple reaction sites on the original precursors or isomers leading to different 18o functional groups on the obps there is an abundance of sulfonates r so3 and sulfonic acid esters r so4h containing molecules in wastewater due to the high amount of detergents present gonsior et al 2011 organic sulfoxides and sulfonic acids often deprotonated at typical surface water ph leading to higher polarity increased environmental transport and potentially higher toxic effects as anionic surfactants bradley and bérubé 2008 reemtsma et al 2002 zhang et al 2022 here we show oxidized sulfur molecules are formed during the ozonation process as distinguished by the presence of 18o on the oxidized sulfur functional group fragmentation and indicative neutral losses with the incorporation of mass labeled ozone offers unique insight into the functional groups in efom and offers the potential for further structural elucidation of ozonation precursors 3 3 3 nitro groups and n oxides in efom obps tertiary amines in efom can react with ozone to produce n oxides which have been found to be more stable than other transformation products from omps gulde et al 2021 hübner et al 2015 sonntag and gunten 2012 with this additional stability it is important to monitor n oxide formation during ozonation for both omps as well as from efom there are few non target approaches available to detect n oxides formed from efom even though efom typically contains higher amounts of nitrogen compared to other water sources merel et al 2017 one direct chno one direct chnos and three indirect chno obps were selected for fragmentation to screen for indicative neutral losses with 18o see si fragmentation data in order to search for evidence of n oxide formation in efom the neutral losses of no2 and no can indicate the presence of nitro and n oxide groups in obps lim et al 2019 deoxylation has been associated with n oxide fragmentation so the neutral loss of o was also searched for even though this is less specific and may come from other functional groups during fragmentation ibrahim et al 2013 tong et al 2001 neutral losses of no2 and no with or without 18o were not detected in any of the chno obps fragmented here an 18o neutral loss however was detected for two of the three indirect chno obps fragmented possibly indicating n oxide formation it is worth noting that two of the three indirect chos obps no n present also had 18o neutral loss detected emphasizing that a single o loss is not by itself indicative of n oxide presence tertiary amines may also not be present in sufficient amounts for detection with this approach peak intensity ionization polarity and sensitivity of fragment detection may play a role in which functional groups could be detected in efom further research aimed at detection of n oxides in efom is needed to better understand the possible impact of ozone on wastewater effluent 4 conclusions with the mass labeled obps we can unambiguously distinguish obps from the complex efom labeled obps are more certainly formed by ozonation while the traditional detection methods may miss or include molecular formulas as artifacts of data processing which are not true obps the 18o label increases confidence in the obp assignments mass labeled peak ratios can distinguish products of direct oxygen transfer reactions from obps generated from other or multiple reactions showing possible reaction mechanism patterns while the detection of direct obps is still inhibited due to isomeric complexity this advancement still highlights the ability to leverage 18o3 for reaction mechanism investigation in combination with ft icr ms ms 18o containing neutral losses can be found and linked to obp structures and the redox state of efom itself here only few obps were screened with this approach but by scaling up the ms ms data collection and processing more information about the functional groups present in efom and their reaction with ozone can be gained sulfoxides and sulfonic acids produced through ozonation are detectable with neutral loss screening but evidence of n oxide formation in efom has not been found with this approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

byproducts dbps in this study cdom was extracted from aerobic incineration ox and anoxic pyrolysis py of three kinds of straw wheat corn and rice and the emerging dbps from them were deciphered the cdom with molecular weight 1 kda in the ox and py groups accounted for 53 87 and it was higher in the py group a total 1343 2107 of cho and 641 1761 of chno formulas were detected in the cdom derived from the ox group among which 74 83 contained aromatic structures rich in oxygen containing groups 1919 3289 of cho and 785 1954 of chno formulas were observed in the py group and 77 86 of them were lignins cram like compounds surprisingly 765 2158 and 895 1648 of emerging dbps were identified in the ox and py groups and the proportions of n dbps were 20 3 54 8 and 2 8 4 8 respectively based on hocl addition and cl substitution mechanisms the h c ratios of the dbp precursors in the ox and py groups were in the range of 0 2 1 5 and 0 6 2 0 respectively the dbps derived from the ox group exhibited higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity due to the higher aromaticity and more n dbps thus returning agricultural biomass carbon particularly that produced by direct combustion to farmland

et al 2015a li et al 2020 thus contributing to carbon neutrality goal proposed by the united nations noticeably these direct incineration products and or biochar in soils inevitably release some carbon derived dissolved organic matter cdom through surface runoff and soil leaching and eventually flow into surface water yang et al 2022 cdom is widely present in natural water sources such as

jaffe et al 2013 which is characterized by high aromatic properties and abundant oxygen containing functional groups wang et al 2015a uzun et al 2020a b in addition cdom is difficult to be effectively removed in the coagulation process the removal efficiency is only 20 chen et al 2022b therefore during the disinfection process of drinking water cdom may react with disinfectants and produce more carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps cawley et al 2017 tsai et al 2019 the chemical compositions of biomass derived carbon materials are closely related to their raw materials chen et al 2022a as well as pyrolysis conditions lin et al 2012 due to the various biomass materials and pyrolysis conditions the structures and compositions of cdom are distinct from each other and consequently result in dbps exhibiting different toxicological effects yang et al 2015 pyrolysis and direct incineration are two commonly methods to prepare agricultural biomass derived carbon materials incineration is generally exothermic while pyrolysis is predominantly endothermic thus the resulted cdom may differ greatly in compositions chen et al 2022a cdom derived from incineration exhibited high reactivity with chlorine in the catchment thus posing a potential threat to drinking water safety wang et al 2015a previous study reported that oxygen availability affected the optical properties of dom and formation of quantifiable dbps wang et al 2015b which only constituted 12 of the total organic halogens li et al 2022b these findings suggested that a large number of unknown cl dbps might have been overlooked in previous studies epidemiological studies indicated that some newly discovered polar halogenated aromatic dbps exhibited stronger toxicities yang and zhang 2013 jiang et al 2020 implying that the unknown cl dbps derived from cdom might pose unexpected risks cdom is a highly complex mixture with different functional groups and molecular weights bioavailability and reactivity dittmar et

spectrometry ft icr ms provides a powerful solution to obtain molecular formulas of thousands of dom allowing to understand dom properties in details stubbins et al 2014 harris et al 2015 he et al 2022 zhang et al 2012 identified 1007 of dbps derived from natural organic matters nom using ft icr ms which were different from quantifiable dbps our recent study identified 1984 of emerging n dbps such as c18hnnmozclx and 2486 of c dbps such as c11hnomclx due to chlorination of algal derived organic matters were identified using ft icr ms wang et al 2022 however up to now information regarding the chemical diversities of cdom from agricultural biomass derived carbon materials and subsequent formation of emerging dbps more than 6 carbon atoms is still lacking let alone the links of the cdom chemical diversity and dbps toxicity thus the chemical diversities of cdom extracted from straw derived carbon materials prepared by direct incineration and anoxic pyrolysis were deciphered as well as the formation of unknown emerging dbps firstly six kinds of straw derived carbon materials were prepared and the spectral properties and molecular diversities of the obtained cdom were analyzed using a size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detector uv detector and ft icr ms then the emerging dbps derived from the six kinds of cdom were identified by ft icr ms subsequently the properties of the precursors of these emerging dbps were analyzed finally the toxicities of the emerging dbps produced by six types of cdom were diagnosed and correlations between cdom chemical diversity and dbps toxicity were established 2 materials and methods 2 1 carbon materials and other reagents three kinds of agricultural biomass raw straw wheat corn and rice were collected from local farms in yangling city shaanxi china these three kinds of straw were cut into 1 3 cm pieces and cleaned and then dried at 70 c referring to the methods in a previous study carbon materials were prepared under two conditions of aerobic incineration and hypoxic pyrolysis wang et al 2015a the preparation temperature was determined as 400 c according to the generally accepted method chen et al 2022a li et al 2022a the straw powder was calcined in a muffle furnace at 400 c for 3 h under the condition of ventilation and the obtained carbon material was called as thermal oxidation product simulating aerobic incineration defined as ox group another portion of straw powder was calcined at 400 c for 3 h under the atmosphere of nitrogen flow and the obtained carbon material was called as pyrolysis biochar defined as py group the six carbon materials were screened by 200 mesh to obtain powder for use other reagents are introduced in the supplementary material in text s1 2 2 cdom extraction and analysis

the spray shield voltage capillary column introduced voltage and capillary column end voltage were 4 0 kv 4 5 kv and 320 v respectively the details are introduced in texts s4 s6 connections between emerging dbps and their precursors were analyzed using network computation by gephi software wang et al 2022 which was introduced in text s7 2 5 toxicity evaluation for quantifiable dbps the theoretical genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were calculated in text s8 in addition m aeruginosa fachb 905 was selected to evaluate the cytotoxicity of cdom after chlorination yang and zhang 2013 liu and

pearson correlation analysis for parameters related to the optical and molecular composition of cdom the differences were considered significantly at p 0 05 all data were presented as the mean standard error 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectral properties of the cdom table 1 reflects the average parameters of spectral characteristics of different kinds of the as prepared cdom there were significant differences on the leaching doc concentrations among these three kinds of straw which indicated that the amount of cdom derived from carbon materials depended on the types of raw materials the average amounts of the extracted cdom in all py groups were significantly higher than those in the ox groups corn rice wheat the much lower doc content in the ox groups indicated that aerobic incineration prompted extensive degradation of the organic matters knicker et al 2007 chen et al 2022a the fi and s r of the two groups were similar in all parameters other parameters such as bix and β α values in the py group were 1 71 4 55 times higher than those in the ox group respectively while those of suva254 and hix of the ox cdom were much higher than in the py groups thus the chemical structure and composition of cdom are greatly affected by the cracking conditions helms et al 2008 the higher suva254 and hix values of cdom in the ox group indicated aerobic thermal oxidation favored formation of aromatic components with a higher degree of humification weishaar et al 2003 figure s1 shows the structural characteristics of the cdom using eem parafac and a total of four fluorescence substances were determined the c1 ex em 275 225 310 nm c2 ex em 295 410 nm c3 ex em 315 494 and c4 ex em 300 378 nm substances could be interpreted as tyrosine like fluorophore polycyclic aromatic like components terrestrial humic like substances and microbial humic like fluorophore li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the c1 component was not detected in the ox group of three kinds of straw carbon materials indicating that the tyrosine like fluorophore of straw was destroyed by oxidation under aerobic conditions dittmar et al 2012 the c2 and c3 components in the ox group were higher than those in the py group increased by 10 8 11 9 and 23 1 29 9 respectively anaerobic pyrolysis promoted the decomposition of humus like substances lin et al 2012 tyrosinoid like substances are considered biodegradable while polycyclic aromatic like and humic like organic matter are relatively resistant to biodegradation the increased aromatics and humus degree of cdom derived from aerobic combustion may lead to a decrease in biodegradability compared with the anaerobic pyrolysis chen et al 2022a thus the fluorescence characteristics of cdom were strongly dependent on the oxygen utilization rate during pyrolysis fig 1 a depicts the molecular weight mw distribution of cdom from three kinds of straw cdom with mw 1 kda accounted for 26 47 in the ox group and only 16 30 in the py group the cdom with mw 1 kda in the ox and py groups accounted for 53 83 fig 1b shows the composition and molecular weight distribution of the six cdom samples conventionally sec chromatograms of cdom can be classified into biopolymers bp humic substances hs building blocks bb low molecular weight acids lmwa and low molecular weight neutral compounds lmwn on the basis of either retention time or apparent molecular weight amw in descending order of amw park et al 2020 trimodal distributions of amw indicated that the sec column separated three major size fractions of cdom bp amw 30 kda hs 1 kda amw 30 kda bb lmwa and lmwn amw 1 kda park et al 2020 du et al 2021 overall the proportion of cdom with amw 1 kda was higher in the ox group 21 42 of the total than in the py group 9 33 of the total table s1 the proportion of cdom with amw 1 kda in the ox group was relatively lower 53 76 of the total while it was 67 87 in the py group the proportion of cdom from wheat and rice straw in the ox and py groups with amw 1 kda accounted for 68 87 of the total the proportion of cdom from corn straw in the ox and py groups with amw 1 kda was approximately 53 67 in addition the results of sec uvd showed that the suva254 value of cdom in the ox group was higher than that in the py group which was consistent with the results obtained by the eem spectra figure s2 these results further confirmed that cdom in the ox group contained more aromatic compounds than in the py group du et al 2022 3 2 molecular diversity of the cdom the diverse molecular formulas in the six cdom samples are shown in figure s3 a total of 2244 3868 and 3140 5243 molecular formulas s n 6 were identified in the ox and py groups respectively including cho chno chos and chnos among them chos 1 03 2 40 of the total and chnos 0 17 0 75 of the total formulas made minor contributions and were similar between both types of cdom figure s4 the number of cho molecules in the ox group was significantly lower than that in the py group figure s3a c and figure s3g i which was line with the lower doc content of the ox group chen et al 2022a it was reported that the lignocellulosic components promoted the formation of dom during anaerobic pyrolysis due to breakage and dehydration of aryl alkyl ether bonds harvey et al 2012 norwood et al 2013 thus contributing to the more cho molecules in the py cdom in contrast a larger number of chno molecules were detected in the ox group figure s3d f and figure s3j l suggesting that aerobic incineration promoted formation of dom containing nitrogen atom on the basis of the classification boundary range seven regions were divided in the van krevelen diagram table s2 harris et al 2015 cdom formulas of the ox group were mainly located in regions 6 7 corresponding to aromatic structures tannins and lignins cram like components differently the cdom formulas of the py group were mainly distributed in region 5 figure s3 the detailed contributions of the relative abundances of major subclasses in the six cdom samples are compared in fig 1c the ox group cdom mainly consisted of aromatic structures accounting for 74 83 while that of py group was dominantly contributed by lignins cram like components 77 86 previous studies reported that proteins and lignin components in biomass were degraded during aerobic combustion leading to the formation of condensed aromatics rich in hydrophilic oxygen containing groups such as carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl dittmar et al 2012 wang et al 2015a fig 2 illustrates the species containing m z distribution and oxygen ox of the cdom the m z of the ox cdom was mainly distributed between 200 450 da which was lower than that of py group mainly in the range of 250 550 da fig 2a c podgorski et al 2012 also found that the dom generated by aerobic thermal oxidation of carbon materials had lower molecular weights the ox species in the ox group mainly contained 6 12 o atoms relative abundance 5 while that of py group was distributed in a wider range 4 14 o atoms fig 2d f additionally the relative abundance of ox species in the ox group was significantly higher than that in the py group further demonstrated that aerobic combustion favored formation of more aromatic and oxygen containing cdom zhu et al 2019 compared with the py group the molecular formulas of the ox group had higher o cwa and lower h cwa table s3 which was in accordance with the higher aromaticity of ox cdom wang et al 2015a fig 3 reflects the molecular formula characteristics of ft icr ms related parameters between the ox and py derived cdom the cdom formula characteristics of the three different straw materials in the ox and py groups were basically the same previous study reported that the hydrogen saturation was higher if the h c of the molecular formula was greater and it was similar for o c and the oxidation degree roth et al 2013 the relative abundance of the cdom formula in the ox group at o c 0 6 was greater than that in the py group indicating that the oxidation degree of the straw was higher under aerobic combustion thus cdom in the ox group contained more oxidizing compounds resulting in the increase in the relative abundance of o c fig 3a c at h c 0 8 the relative abundance of the ox group was significantly higher than that of the py group which proved that the ox group contained more unsaturated and aromatic compounds chen et al 2022a fig 3d f similarly the relative abundances of molecular formulas with dbe 16 and aimod 0 8 in the ox group were significantly higher than those in the py group which further proved that the cdom derived from aerobic combustion contained more unsaturated and aromatic compounds fig 3g l from the molecular characteristics of the cdom we observed that the weighted average wa abundance of n c wa o c wa cos wa nosc wa and aimod wa were higher in the ox group while the abundance of h cwa was lower table s3 this further proved that the molecular formula of the ox group was rich in n atom number and had higher aromatic structure harris et al 2015 kaplan et al 2016 figure s5 shows the function of dbe o c double bond equivalent oxygen carbon and nominal oxidation state of carbon values nosc the larger positive value of dbe o c double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon suggested higher unsaturated degree the larger positive value of nosc carbon oxidation state indicated higher oxidation state zhang et al 2021 the dbe o c values of most molecular formulas in the ox group were positive figure s5a c thus the molecular formulas with a low nosc value in the straw were decomposed under aerobic thermal oxidation phungsai et al 2019 compared with the ox group the py group had more negative dbe o c and nosc characteristic molecular formulas figure s5d f this might be due to the higher aliphatic proteins and lignins cram like substances jutaporn et al 2022 overall compared with the py group the ox group had less cho molecular formulas but more chno molecular formulas lower molecular weight higher unsaturated and aromatic structural characteristics 3 3 quantifiable and emerging dbps formation aromatic and lignins cram like components are difficult to biodegrade thus these components in cdom may pose great risks to the safe supply of drinking water during chlorination zhu et al 2019 cdom with different properties may lead to generation of various dbps chen et al 2022a fig 4 reflects the formation potentials of the quantifiable dbps containing only 1 2 c atoms including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans halogenated ketone hkts and chloral hydrate ch in the two types of cdom compared with the ox group the generation potentials of thms hkts and ch in the py group increased by 30 3 44 7 24 8 38 6 and 26 5 42 6 respectively for haas and hans the formation potentials were higher in the ox group this may be directly related to the higher content of n element and the higher cl2 demand in the ox group the values of haas in the ox group were 64 8 91 3 μg mg doc which were comparable to the formation potential of forest fuel derived haas uzun et al 2020a chen et al 2022a however the values of hans in the ox group were 22 3 25 1 μg mg doc which were much larger than those 0 1 0 4 μg mg doc reported previously chen et al 2022a these differences may be related to the properties of carbon materials and the amount of chlorine added compounds with more aromatic rings hydroxyl and sulfhydryl groups on their side chains generally had higher electron providing capacity edc values because these functional groups could act as electron donors edc had a positive correlation with cl2 demand and more amounts of chlorine was consumed and thus more dbps were produced wang et al 2020 particularly the formation potential of hans in the ox group was 6 2 7 1 times that of the py group nitrogenous aromatic compounds and humus had high chlorine reactivity in the formation of hans chen et al 2022a these differences indicated that combustion and pyrolysis played different roles in changing the reactivity of cdom with chlorine in the formation of dbps wang et al 2015b theoretical genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of these quantifiable dbps were calculated and the results are illustrated in figure s6 the theoretical genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of these quantifiable dbps in the ox group were 7 2 13 6 and 4 4 6 9 times higher than those in the py group respectively and the relative contribution of dichloroacetonitrile dcan to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was the largest it should be noted that the production of quantifiable dbps measured above only accounted for about 18 24 of tocl figure s7 implying that a large portion of unknown dbps were not detected by the traditional method li et al 2022a as shown in fig 5 and figures s8 s10 a total of 765 1873 and 1305 1648 unknown emerging cl dbps cl atom number 3 were found by ft icr ms in the ox and py groups respectively the number of c dbps was relatively higher while the number of n dbps was relatively lower in the py group which was in line with the quantities of cho and chno in the respective cdom among them there were 257 765 common emerging c dbps and 5 9 n dbps shared by the three groups while the remaining molecular formulas were different figure s8 in the ox group 190 892 and 354 c dbps contained one cl atom 236 535 and 552 c dbps contained two cl atoms 184 142 and 378 c dbps contained three cl atoms and the most relative abundance c dbps were c14hnomcl1 3 n and m are the number of atoms same below for the py group 483 475 and 459 emerging c dbps contained one cl atom 551 644 and 538 c dbps contained two cl atoms 393 450 and 272 c dbps contained three cl atoms and the most relative abundance c dbps were c14hnomcl1 3 while for n dbps c13hnnmozcl1 3 was the most relative abundance in the ox group and c22hnnmozcl1 3 was dominant in the py group in general the proportion of n dbps in the ox group 20 3 54 8 was significantly higher than that in the py group 2 8 4 8 3 4 precursors of emerging cl dbps links between precursors and emerging cl dbps in cdom was established using quality network computation gonsior et al 2019 and fig 6 and figures s11 s12 illustrate the results using c14hnomclx and c13hnnmozclx as examples because of their highest abundances edges and nodes represented quality differences and m z values respectively tziotis et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 for the ox group 47 c14hnomclx and 83 c14hnom molecular formulas were found after considering the quality differences of clh 1 hocl h2 and o 45 c14hnomclx and 79 c16hnom molecular formulas were linked tables s5 s6 similarly for the py group 117 c14hnomclx and 104 c16hnom molecular formulas were connected these results suggested that most of the emerging cl dbps were derived with the corresponding cdoms in addition for c13hnnmozclx a poor quality network was only constructed in the ox group but was not find in the py group which may also confirm the reason for less n dbps generation due to the lower nitrogen content in the py group figure s12 the number of h atom in the molecular formulas of dbps in the ox group was in the range of 6 h 10 while it was in the range of 10 h 24 in the py group which was in accordance with the higher aromaticity of the ox cdom in addition chlorination reaction occurred within the range of 4 o 11 in the c14hnomclx and c13hnnmozclx formulas but rarely occurred with o 4 or o 12 which was supported by previous studies xiang et al 2020 wang et al 2022 therefore ft icr ms can be used to determine the o c and h c ranges of the molecular formulas of emerging cl dbp precursors to verify this hypothesis the elemental compositions of all emerging cl dbps precursors were comprehensively analyzed and represented by van krevelen diagram as shown in fig 7 and figure s13 s14 86 91 and 81 89 of emerging cl dbps in the ox and py groups matched their precursors via chlorine substitution table s7 taking the wheat straw derived cdom as an example the corresponding cdom precursors elliptic region in fig 7a c and e in the ox group were mainly in the range of 0 2 h c 0 8 and 0 2 o c 0 9 while in the py group they fell in the range of 0 6 h c 1 5 and 0 2 o c 0 8 elliptic region in fig 7b d and f similar results could also be obtained for the regions of the dbps precursor of corn and rice straw derived cdom figures s12 13 in conclusion the h c range of the dbps precursors was significantly higher in the py group than in the ox group table s8 wang et al 2017 found that the h c and o c of precursors of traditional dbps i e haas and thms were 0 5 h c 1 0 and 0 4 o c 0 8 the h c and o c of precursors of emerging cl dbps were previously reported to be 0 5 h c 1 2 and 0 5 o c 0 8 xiang et al 2020 in our previous study on algal organic matter the emerging cl dbps precursors were about 0 4 o c 0 9 and 1 0 h c 1 6 wang et al 2022 these results indicated that there were certain differences in molecular characteristics of dbps precursors in different land based dom which may lead to differences in dbps toxicity in addition n c was also a significant feature of dbps precursors in different types of dom molecules kurek et al 2020 which was also an important factor leading to the difference in n dbps generated by the two types of cdom table s7 in general this study enriches the characteristics of emerging cl dbps precursors derived from land based dom 3 5 correlation between cdom chemical parameters and dbps toxicity the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of two different cdom after chlorination were studied as shown in figure s15 after chlorination both cdom in the ox and py groups significantly inhibited the growth of algal cells with inhibition rates of 33 6 56 2 and 21 5 45 2 respectively these indicated that the dbps produced by them were cytotoxic to m aeruginosa and the dbps generated in the ox group were more toxic to cyanobacteria cells zhao et al 2019 this may be due to that more aromatic dbps were produced in the ox group resulting in higher toxicity liu and zhang 2014 found that new halogenated phenol dbps in chlorine containing wastewater were generally more cytotoxic to algae t marina than ordinary aliphatic dbps in addition the s typhimurium sos umu test showed that the genotoxicity of dbps in the ox group was 1 2 1 8 times higher than that in py group p 0 01 in order to further understand the relationship among cdom chemical characteristics dbps formation and toxicity the correlations among the structural properties and toxic effects were inspected as shown in fig 8 positive correlations p 0 01 were observed between cytotoxicity and humification index hix fluorescence component humus c2 and c3 and ft icr ms related parameters coswa noscwa and n cwa there was a negative correlation between cytotoxicity and h cwa a previous study also reported that the aromatic components of the generated emerging dbps induced greater cytotoxicity li et al 2022b which supported our findings in addition there was a significantly positive correlation between genotoxicity and n cwa the relatively higher content chno in the ox group led to production of more n dbps which were reported to have stronger cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than c dbps muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 this might also contribute to the greater genotoxicity of dbps in the ox group all the results suggested that dbps produced in the ox group had stronger cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than in the py group thus cdom derived from aerobic thermal oxidation is more harmful to drinking water treatment and should be paid attention to in engineering application it is important to note that some cdom and dbp data were missing in this study as the spe was unable to collect these hydrophilic components and small molecular components generated after chlorination in addition high molecular weight compounds 1 kda were rarely detected in esi ft icr ms which may be due to the difficulty of ionizing large molecular compounds at esi sources thus only the cdom compounds with molecular weight less than 1 kda were analyzed in this study since ft icr ms is unable to analyze non extractable dom it is necessary to further determine the compositions of non extractable cdom components in the future 4 conclusions chemical diversity of cdom from straw derived carbon materials prepared under direct incineration ox group and anoxic pyrolysis py group was deciphered and the formation of emerging dbps was also identified 1 secocd uvd analysis showed that the cdom were divided into biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight acids and low molecular weight neutral compounds cdom with molecular weight 1 kda in the ox and py groups accounted for 53 87 and it was higher in the py group 2 direct incineration resulted in more thorough mineralization of organic carbons leading to lower content of doc in the residual carbon anoxic pyrolysis promoted the formation of doc through decomposition of humus like substances as a result 74 83 of cho and chno formulas were aromatic structures in the ox group while 77 86 of them were lignins cram like in the py group 3 higher generation potentials of thms hkts and ch occurred in the py group but inversely for haas and hans these quantifiable dbps accounted for 18 24 of total dbps 4 the proportion of n dbps in the ox group 20 3 54 8 was significantly higher than those in the py group 2 8 4 8 the h c of the emerging dbps precursors in the ox group was 0 2 h c 1 5 while it was 0 6 h c 2 0 in the py group 5 due to higher aromatic structures and less protein and lignin components in direct incineration derived cdom the generated dbps had higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in general more serious threat to drinking water safety was observed in the direct incineration derived cdom than the anoxic pyrolysis derived

15253,carbon derived dissolved organic matter cdom are inevitably released to surface water during returning agricultural biomass carbon to farmland which are potential precursors of disinfection byproducts dbps in this study cdom was extracted from aerobic incineration ox and anoxic pyrolysis py of three kinds of straw wheat corn and rice and the emerging dbps from them were deciphered the cdom with molecular weight 1 kda in the ox and py groups accounted for 53 87 and it was higher in the py group a total 1343 2107 of cho and 641 1761 of chno formulas were detected in the cdom derived from the ox group among which 74 83 contained aromatic structures rich in oxygen containing groups 1919 3289 of cho and 785 1954 of chno formulas were observed in the py group and 77 86 of them were lignins cram like compounds surprisingly 765 2158 and 895 1648 of emerging dbps were identified in the ox and py groups and the proportions of n dbps were 20 3 54 8 and 2 8 4 8 respectively based on hocl addition and cl substitution mechanisms the h c ratios of the dbp precursors in the ox and py groups were in the range of 0 2 1 5 and 0 6 2 0 respectively the dbps derived from the ox group exhibited higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity due to the higher aromaticity and more n dbps thus returning agricultural biomass carbon particularly that produced by direct combustion to farmland brought potential threat to drinking water safety graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter disinfection byproducts ft icr ms biochar agricultural biomass data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction currently increasing carbon dioxide emission climate change and soil degradation have become severe environmental problems in the world smith et al 2013 to cope with climate change and improve soil quality there is a growing need to increase soil organic matter content in agricultural systems doumer et al 2015 a huge amount of biomass is produced in the world each year for example the annual production volume of crop straw is approximate 1 66 1011 kg in china nbs 2020 field burning of biomass is a traditional agricultural practice of returning organic matters and nutrients to soil in many remote areas and about 60 of the crop straw is burned directly bhattacharyya et al 2020 nguyen 2020 biochar made from agricultural biomass is considered as another sustainable solution for soil degradation li et al 2022a due to the unique characteristics of large specific surface area high porosity large cation exchange capacity and stability cai et al 2020 returning biochar to farmland can improve soil fertility alleviate and repair soil pollution and slow down greenhouse gas emission downie et al 2011 wang et al 2015a li et al 2020 thus contributing to carbon neutrality goal proposed by the united nations noticeably these direct incineration products and or biochar in soils inevitably release some carbon derived dissolved organic matter cdom through surface runoff and soil leaching and eventually flow into surface water yang et al 2022 cdom is widely present in natural water sources such as rivers lakes canals and reservoirs 60 270 μg l 1 chen et al 2022b as an important component of terrestrial dissolved organic matter cdom accounts for about 10 of the total dissolved organic matter jaffe et al 2013 which is characterized by high aromatic properties and abundant oxygen containing functional groups wang et al 2015a uzun et al 2020a b in addition cdom is difficult to be effectively removed in the coagulation process the removal efficiency is only 20 chen et al 2022b therefore during the disinfection process of drinking water cdom may react with disinfectants and produce more carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps cawley et al 2017 tsai et al 2019 the chemical compositions of biomass derived carbon materials are closely related to their raw materials chen et al 2022a as well as pyrolysis conditions lin et al 2012 due to the various biomass materials and pyrolysis conditions the structures and compositions of cdom are distinct from each other and consequently result in dbps exhibiting different toxicological effects yang et al 2015 pyrolysis and direct incineration are two commonly methods to prepare agricultural biomass derived carbon materials incineration is generally exothermic while pyrolysis is predominantly endothermic thus the resulted cdom may differ greatly in compositions chen et al 2022a cdom derived from incineration exhibited high reactivity with chlorine in the catchment thus posing a potential threat to drinking water safety wang et al 2015a previous study reported that oxygen availability affected the optical properties of dom and formation of quantifiable dbps wang et al 2015b which only constituted 12 of the total organic halogens li et al 2022b these findings suggested that a large number of unknown cl dbps might have been overlooked in previous studies epidemiological studies indicated that some newly discovered polar halogenated aromatic dbps exhibited stronger toxicities yang and zhang 2013 jiang et al 2020 implying that the unknown cl dbps derived from cdom might pose unexpected risks cdom is a highly complex mixture with different functional groups and molecular weights bioavailability and reactivity dittmar et al 2012 smith et al 2013 uv vis spectrum and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac are commonly used to characterize the source and properties of cdom li et al 2020 lee et al 2018 however they can not identify the molecular information and compositions of organic matters chen et al 2022a fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms provides a powerful solution to obtain molecular formulas of thousands of dom allowing to understand dom properties in details stubbins et al 2014 harris et al 2015 he et al 2022 zhang et al 2012 identified 1007 of dbps derived from natural organic matters nom using ft icr ms which were different from quantifiable dbps our recent study identified 1984 of emerging n dbps such as c18hnnmozclx and 2486 of c dbps such as c11hnomclx due to chlorination of algal derived organic matters were identified using ft icr ms wang et al 2022 however up to now information regarding the chemical diversities of cdom from agricultural biomass derived carbon materials and subsequent formation of emerging dbps more than 6 carbon atoms is still lacking let alone the links of the cdom chemical diversity and dbps toxicity thus the chemical diversities of cdom extracted from straw derived carbon materials prepared by direct incineration and anoxic pyrolysis were deciphered as well as the formation of unknown emerging dbps firstly six kinds of straw derived carbon materials were prepared and the spectral properties and molecular diversities of the obtained cdom were analyzed using a size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detector uv detector and ft icr ms then the emerging dbps derived from the six kinds of cdom were identified by ft icr ms subsequently the properties of the precursors of these emerging dbps were analyzed finally the toxicities of the emerging dbps produced by six types of cdom were diagnosed and correlations between cdom chemical diversity and dbps toxicity were established 2 materials and methods 2 1 carbon materials and other reagents three kinds of agricultural biomass raw straw wheat corn and rice were collected from local farms in yangling city shaanxi china these three kinds of straw were cut into 1 3 cm pieces and cleaned and then dried at 70 c referring to the methods in a previous study carbon materials were prepared under two conditions of aerobic incineration and hypoxic pyrolysis wang et al 2015a the preparation temperature was determined as 400 c according to the generally accepted method chen et al 2022a li et al 2022a the straw powder was calcined in a muffle furnace at 400 c for 3 h under the condition of ventilation and the obtained carbon material was called as thermal oxidation product simulating aerobic incineration defined as ox group another portion of straw powder was calcined at 400 c for 3 h under the atmosphere of nitrogen flow and the obtained carbon material was called as pyrolysis biochar defined as py group the six carbon materials were screened by 200 mesh to obtain powder for use other reagents are introduced in the supplementary material in text s1 2 2 cdom extraction and analysis for cdom extraction 10 g of the as prepared carbon materials were mixed with 300 ml mili q water in a glass erlenmeyer flask on a reciprocating oscillator for 24 h after filtration the collected filtrate was cdom li et al 2019 the extraction experiments for cdom were conducted in triplicates for each sample dissolved organic carbon content in the cdom solution was measured using total organic carbon analyzer b3500c hach some optical indices including slope ratio s r and suva254 the absorbance at 254 nm divided by doc were measured based on the uv vis spectrophotometer li et al 2019 fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectra were obtained by fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan and analyzed using matlab r2018a mathworks usa and domfluor1 7 toolkit wang et al 2022 several important eems optical signature indices were used including humification index hix biological index bix freshness index β α and fluorescence index fi ohno 2002 fellman et al 2008 the composition and molecular weight mw distribution of cdom were analyzed using the nitrogen pressurized ultrafiltration method with millipore ultrafiltration membranes billerica usa and the size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detector uv detector secocd uvd doc labor germany du et al 2022 the detailed methods are shown in text s2 2 3 chlorination experiment and detection of traditional dbps in the chlorination process the cdom concentration was 5 mg l 1 labeled with doc concentration and the effective chlorine concentration was 15 mg l 1 li et al 2022a the chlorination reaction was conducted at 25 c for 24 h under light protection and the free residual chlorine was quenched by ascorbic acid the dbps and total organic chlorine tocl were analyzed as previously reported xiang et al 2020 and the detailed information is provided in text s3 cdom chlorination from ox and py groups were defined as ox cl2 and py cl2 groups respectively 2 4 ft icr ms detection prior to ft icr ms detection de mineralization of cdom samples was performed by an agilent bond elut ppl resin gonsior et al 2019 a 15 t ultra ft icr ms bruker daltonics germany was used to analyze the cdom and electrospray ionization esi with negative ion mode was the ion source zhang et al 2021 cdom solution was concentrated to 100 mg l 1 and sampled at 250 μl h 1 for the operation procedure the spray shield voltage capillary column introduced voltage and capillary column end voltage were 4 0 kv 4 5 kv and 320 v respectively the details are introduced in texts s4 s6 connections between emerging dbps and their precursors were analyzed using network computation by gephi software wang et al 2022 which was introduced in text s7 2 5 toxicity evaluation for quantifiable dbps the theoretical genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were calculated in text s8 in addition m aeruginosa fachb 905 was selected to evaluate the cytotoxicity of cdom after chlorination yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 according to international standard method iso13829 2000 salmonella typhimurium cells ta1535 psk1002 were used to detect the genotoxicity oda et al 1985 specific details can be found in text s9 and text s10 2 6 statistics analysis all tests were repeated at least in triplicates for each sample spss 22 0 software package ibm armonk new york was used to conduct t test one way anova and pearson correlation analysis for parameters related to the optical and molecular composition of cdom the differences were considered significantly at p 0 05 all data were presented as the mean standard error 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectral properties of the cdom table 1 reflects the average parameters of spectral characteristics of different kinds of the as prepared cdom there were significant differences on the leaching doc concentrations among these three kinds of straw which indicated that the amount of cdom derived from carbon materials depended on the types of raw materials the average amounts of the extracted cdom in all py groups were significantly higher than those in the ox groups corn rice wheat the much lower doc content in the ox groups indicated that aerobic incineration prompted extensive degradation of the organic matters knicker et al 2007 chen et al 2022a the fi and s r of the two groups were similar in all parameters other parameters such as bix and β α values in the py group were 1 71 4 55 times higher than those in the ox group respectively while those of suva254 and hix of the ox cdom were much higher than in the py groups thus the chemical structure and composition of cdom are greatly affected by the cracking conditions helms et al 2008 the higher suva254 and hix values of cdom in the ox group indicated aerobic thermal oxidation favored formation of aromatic components with a higher degree of humification weishaar et al 2003 figure s1 shows the structural characteristics of the cdom using eem parafac and a total of four fluorescence substances were determined the c1 ex em 275 225 310 nm c2 ex em 295 410 nm c3 ex em 315 494 and c4 ex em 300 378 nm substances could be interpreted as tyrosine like fluorophore polycyclic aromatic like components terrestrial humic like substances and microbial humic like fluorophore li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the c1 component was not detected in the ox group of three kinds of straw carbon materials indicating that the tyrosine like fluorophore of straw was destroyed by oxidation under aerobic conditions dittmar et al 2012 the c2 and c3 components in the ox group were higher than those in the py group increased by 10 8 11 9 and 23 1 29 9 respectively anaerobic pyrolysis promoted the decomposition of humus like substances lin et al 2012 tyrosinoid like substances are considered biodegradable while polycyclic aromatic like and humic like organic matter are relatively resistant to biodegradation the increased aromatics and humus degree of cdom derived from aerobic combustion may lead to a decrease in biodegradability compared with the anaerobic pyrolysis chen et al 2022a thus the fluorescence characteristics of cdom were strongly dependent on the oxygen utilization rate during pyrolysis fig 1 a depicts the molecular weight mw distribution of cdom from three kinds of straw cdom with mw 1 kda accounted for 26 47 in the ox group and only 16 30 in the py group the cdom with mw 1 kda in the ox and py groups accounted for 53 83 fig 1b shows the composition and molecular weight distribution of the six cdom samples conventionally sec chromatograms of cdom can be classified into biopolymers bp humic substances hs building blocks bb low molecular weight acids lmwa and low molecular weight neutral compounds lmwn on the basis of either retention time or apparent molecular weight amw in descending order of amw park et al 2020 trimodal distributions of amw indicated that the sec column separated three major size fractions of cdom bp amw 30 kda hs 1 kda amw 30 kda bb lmwa and lmwn amw 1 kda park et al 2020 du et al 2021 overall the proportion of cdom with amw 1 kda was higher in the ox group 21 42 of the total than in the py group 9 33 of the total table s1 the proportion of cdom with amw 1 kda in the ox group was relatively lower 53 76 of the total while it was 67 87 in the py group the proportion of cdom from wheat and rice straw in the ox and py groups with amw 1 kda accounted for 68 87 of the total the proportion of cdom from corn straw in the ox and py groups with amw 1 kda was approximately 53 67 in addition the results of sec uvd showed that the suva254 value of cdom in the ox group was higher than that in the py group which was consistent with the results obtained by the eem spectra figure s2 these results further confirmed that cdom in the ox group contained more aromatic compounds than in the py group du et al 2022 3 2 molecular diversity of the cdom the diverse molecular formulas in the six cdom samples are shown in figure s3 a total of 2244 3868 and 3140 5243 molecular formulas s n 6 were identified in the ox and py groups respectively including cho chno chos and chnos among them chos 1 03 2 40 of the total and chnos 0 17 0 75 of the total formulas made minor contributions and were similar between both types of cdom figure s4 the number of cho molecules in the ox group was significantly lower than that in the py group figure s3a c and figure s3g i which was line with the lower doc content of the ox group chen et al 2022a it was reported that the lignocellulosic components promoted the formation of dom during anaerobic pyrolysis due to breakage and dehydration of aryl alkyl ether bonds harvey et al 2012 norwood et al 2013 thus contributing to the more cho molecules in the py cdom in contrast a larger number of chno molecules were detected in the ox group figure s3d f and figure s3j l suggesting that aerobic incineration promoted formation of dom containing nitrogen atom on the basis of the classification boundary range seven regions were divided in the van krevelen diagram table s2 harris et al 2015 cdom formulas of the ox group were mainly located in regions 6 7 corresponding to aromatic structures tannins and lignins cram like components differently the cdom formulas of the py group were mainly distributed in region 5 figure s3 the detailed contributions of the relative abundances of major subclasses in the six cdom samples are compared in fig 1c the ox group cdom mainly consisted of aromatic structures accounting for 74 83 while that of py group was dominantly contributed by lignins cram like components 77 86 previous studies reported that proteins and lignin components in biomass were degraded during aerobic combustion leading to the formation of condensed aromatics rich in hydrophilic oxygen containing groups such as carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl dittmar et al 2012 wang et al 2015a fig 2 illustrates the species containing m z distribution and oxygen ox of the cdom the m z of the ox cdom was mainly distributed between 200 450 da which was lower than that of py group mainly in the range of 250 550 da fig 2a c podgorski et al 2012 also found that the dom generated by aerobic thermal oxidation of carbon materials had lower molecular weights the ox species in the ox group mainly contained 6 12 o atoms relative abundance 5 while that of py group was distributed in a wider range 4 14 o atoms fig 2d f additionally the relative abundance of ox species in the ox group was significantly higher than that in the py group further demonstrated that aerobic combustion favored formation of more aromatic and oxygen containing cdom zhu et al 2019 compared with the py group the molecular formulas of the ox group had higher o cwa and lower h cwa table s3 which was in accordance with the higher aromaticity of ox cdom wang et al 2015a fig 3 reflects the molecular formula characteristics of ft icr ms related parameters between the ox and py derived cdom the cdom formula characteristics of the three different straw materials in the ox and py groups were basically the same previous study reported that the hydrogen saturation was higher if the h c of the molecular formula was greater and it was similar for o c and the oxidation degree roth et al 2013 the relative abundance of the cdom formula in the ox group at o c 0 6 was greater than that in the py group indicating that the oxidation degree of the straw was higher under aerobic combustion thus cdom in the ox group contained more oxidizing compounds resulting in the increase in the relative abundance of o c fig 3a c at h c 0 8 the relative abundance of the ox group was significantly higher than that of the py group which proved that the ox group contained more unsaturated and aromatic compounds chen et al 2022a fig 3d f similarly the relative abundances of molecular formulas with dbe 16 and aimod 0 8 in the ox group were significantly higher than those in the py group which further proved that the cdom derived from aerobic combustion contained more unsaturated and aromatic compounds fig 3g l from the molecular characteristics of the cdom we observed that the weighted average wa abundance of n c wa o c wa cos wa nosc wa and aimod wa were higher in the ox group while the abundance of h cwa was lower table s3 this further proved that the molecular formula of the ox group was rich in n atom number and had higher aromatic structure harris et al 2015 kaplan et al 2016 figure s5 shows the function of dbe o c double bond equivalent oxygen carbon and nominal oxidation state of carbon values nosc the larger positive value of dbe o c double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon suggested higher unsaturated degree the larger positive value of nosc carbon oxidation state indicated higher oxidation state zhang et al 2021 the dbe o c values of most molecular formulas in the ox group were positive figure s5a c thus the molecular formulas with a low nosc value in the straw were decomposed under aerobic thermal oxidation phungsai et al 2019 compared with the ox group the py group had more negative dbe o c and nosc characteristic molecular formulas figure s5d f this might be due to the higher aliphatic proteins and lignins cram like substances jutaporn et al 2022 overall compared with the py group the ox group had less cho molecular formulas but more chno molecular formulas lower molecular weight higher unsaturated and aromatic structural characteristics 3 3 quantifiable and emerging dbps formation aromatic and lignins cram like components are difficult to biodegrade thus these components in cdom may pose great risks to the safe supply of drinking water during chlorination zhu et al 2019 cdom with different properties may lead to generation of various dbps chen et al 2022a fig 4 reflects the formation potentials of the quantifiable dbps containing only 1 2 c atoms including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans halogenated ketone hkts and chloral hydrate ch in the two types of cdom compared with the ox group the generation potentials of thms hkts and ch in the py group increased by 30 3 44 7 24 8 38 6 and 26 5 42 6 respectively for haas and hans the formation potentials were higher in the ox group this may be directly related to the higher content of n element and the higher cl2 demand in the ox group the values of haas in the ox group were 64 8 91 3 μg mg doc which were comparable to the formation potential of forest fuel derived haas uzun et al 2020a chen et al 2022a however the values of hans in the ox group were 22 3 25 1 μg mg doc which were much larger than those 0 1 0 4 μg mg doc reported previously chen et al 2022a these differences may be related to the properties of carbon materials and the amount of chlorine added compounds with more aromatic rings hydroxyl and sulfhydryl groups on their side chains generally had higher electron providing capacity edc values because these functional groups could act as electron donors edc had a positive correlation with cl2 demand and more amounts of chlorine was consumed and thus more dbps were produced wang et al 2020 particularly the formation potential of hans in the ox group was 6 2 7 1 times that of the py group nitrogenous aromatic compounds and humus had high chlorine reactivity in the formation of hans chen et al 2022a these differences indicated that combustion and pyrolysis played different roles in changing the reactivity of cdom with chlorine in the formation of dbps wang et al 2015b theoretical genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of these quantifiable dbps were calculated and the results are illustrated in figure s6 the theoretical genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of these quantifiable dbps in the ox group were 7 2 13 6 and 4 4 6 9 times higher than those in the py group respectively and the relative contribution of dichloroacetonitrile dcan to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was the largest it should be noted that the production of quantifiable dbps measured above only accounted for about 18 24 of tocl figure s7 implying that a large portion of unknown dbps were not detected by the traditional method li et al 2022a as shown in fig 5 and figures s8 s10 a total of 765 1873 and 1305 1648 unknown emerging cl dbps cl atom number 3 were found by ft icr ms in the ox and py groups respectively the number of c dbps was relatively higher while the number of n dbps was relatively lower in the py group which was in line with the quantities of cho and chno in the respective cdom among them there were 257 765 common emerging c dbps and 5 9 n dbps shared by the three groups while the remaining molecular formulas were different figure s8 in the ox group 190 892 and 354 c dbps contained one cl atom 236 535 and 552 c dbps contained two cl atoms 184 142 and 378 c dbps contained three cl atoms and the most relative abundance c dbps were c14hnomcl1 3 n and m are the number of atoms same below for the py group 483 475 and 459 emerging c dbps contained one cl atom 551 644 and 538 c dbps contained two cl atoms 393 450 and 272 c dbps contained three cl atoms and the most relative abundance c dbps were c14hnomcl1 3 while for n dbps c13hnnmozcl1 3 was the most relative abundance in the ox group and c22hnnmozcl1 3 was dominant in the py group in general the proportion of n dbps in the ox group 20 3 54 8 was significantly higher than that in the py group 2 8 4 8 3 4 precursors of emerging cl dbps links between precursors and emerging cl dbps in cdom was established using quality network computation gonsior et al 2019 and fig 6 and figures s11 s12 illustrate the results using c14hnomclx and c13hnnmozclx as examples because of their highest abundances edges and nodes represented quality differences and m z values respectively tziotis et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 for the ox group 47 c14hnomclx and 83 c14hnom molecular formulas were found after considering the quality differences of clh 1 hocl h2 and o 45 c14hnomclx and 79 c16hnom molecular formulas were linked tables s5 s6 similarly for the py group 117 c14hnomclx and 104 c16hnom molecular formulas were connected these results suggested that most of the emerging cl dbps were derived with the corresponding cdoms in addition for c13hnnmozclx a poor quality network was only constructed in the ox group but was not find in the py group which may also confirm the reason for less n dbps generation due to the lower nitrogen content in the py group figure s12 the number of h atom in the molecular formulas of dbps in the ox group was in the range of 6 h 10 while it was in the range of 10 h 24 in the py group which was in accordance with the higher aromaticity of the ox cdom in addition chlorination reaction occurred within the range of 4 o 11 in the c14hnomclx and c13hnnmozclx formulas but rarely occurred with o 4 or o 12 which was supported by previous studies xiang et al 2020 wang et al 2022 therefore ft icr ms can be used to determine the o c and h c ranges of the molecular formulas of emerging cl dbp precursors to verify this hypothesis the elemental compositions of all emerging cl dbps precursors were comprehensively analyzed and represented by van krevelen diagram as shown in fig 7 and figure s13 s14 86 91 and 81 89 of emerging cl dbps in the ox and py groups matched their precursors via chlorine substitution table s7 taking the wheat straw derived cdom as an example the corresponding cdom precursors elliptic region in fig 7a c and e in the ox group were mainly in the range of 0 2 h c 0 8 and 0 2 o c 0 9 while in the py group they fell in the range of 0 6 h c 1 5 and 0 2 o c 0 8 elliptic region in fig 7b d and f similar results could also be obtained for the regions of the dbps precursor of corn and rice straw derived cdom figures s12 13 in conclusion the h c range of the dbps precursors was significantly higher in the py group than in the ox group table s8 wang et al 2017 found that the h c and o c of precursors of traditional dbps i e haas and thms were 0 5 h c 1 0 and 0 4 o c 0 8 the h c and o c of precursors of emerging cl dbps were previously reported to be 0 5 h c 1 2 and 0 5 o c 0 8 xiang et al 2020 in our previous study on algal organic matter the emerging cl dbps precursors were about 0 4 o c 0 9 and 1 0 h c 1 6 wang et al 2022 these results indicated that there were certain differences in molecular characteristics of dbps precursors in different land based dom which may lead to differences in dbps toxicity in addition n c was also a significant feature of dbps precursors in different types of dom molecules kurek et al 2020 which was also an important factor leading to the difference in n dbps generated by the two types of cdom table s7 in general this study enriches the characteristics of emerging cl dbps precursors derived from land based dom 3 5 correlation between cdom chemical parameters and dbps toxicity the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of two different cdom after chlorination were studied as shown in figure s15 after chlorination both cdom in the ox and py groups significantly inhibited the growth of algal cells with inhibition rates of 33 6 56 2 and 21 5 45 2 respectively these indicated that the dbps produced by them were cytotoxic to m aeruginosa and the dbps generated in the ox group were more toxic to cyanobacteria cells zhao et al 2019 this may be due to that more aromatic dbps were produced in the ox group resulting in higher toxicity liu and zhang 2014 found that new halogenated phenol dbps in chlorine containing wastewater were generally more cytotoxic to algae t marina than ordinary aliphatic dbps in addition the s typhimurium sos umu test showed that the genotoxicity of dbps in the ox group was 1 2 1 8 times higher than that in py group p 0 01 in order to further understand the relationship among cdom chemical characteristics dbps formation and toxicity the correlations among the structural properties and toxic effects were inspected as shown in fig 8 positive correlations p 0 01 were observed between cytotoxicity and humification index hix fluorescence component humus c2 and c3 and ft icr ms related parameters coswa noscwa and n cwa there was a negative correlation between cytotoxicity and h cwa a previous study also reported that the aromatic components of the generated emerging dbps induced greater cytotoxicity li et al 2022b which supported our findings in addition there was a significantly positive correlation between genotoxicity and n cwa the relatively higher content chno in the ox group led to production of more n dbps which were reported to have stronger cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than c dbps muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 this might also contribute to the greater genotoxicity of dbps in the ox group all the results suggested that dbps produced in the ox group had stronger cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than in the py group thus cdom derived from aerobic thermal oxidation is more harmful to drinking water treatment and should be paid attention to in engineering application it is important to note that some cdom and dbp data were missing in this study as the spe was unable to collect these hydrophilic components and small molecular components generated after chlorination in addition high molecular weight compounds 1 kda were rarely detected in esi ft icr ms which may be due to the difficulty of ionizing large molecular compounds at esi sources thus only the cdom compounds with molecular weight less than 1 kda were analyzed in this study since ft icr ms is unable to analyze non extractable dom it is necessary to further determine the compositions of non extractable cdom components in the future 4 conclusions chemical diversity of cdom from straw derived carbon materials prepared under direct incineration ox group and anoxic pyrolysis py group was deciphered and the formation of emerging dbps was also identified 1 secocd uvd analysis showed that the cdom were divided into biopolymers humic substances building blocks low molecular weight acids and low molecular weight neutral compounds cdom with molecular weight 1 kda in the ox and py groups accounted for 53 87 and it was higher in the py group 2 direct incineration resulted in more thorough mineralization of organic carbons leading to lower content of doc in the residual carbon anoxic pyrolysis promoted the formation of doc through decomposition of humus like substances as a result 74 83 of cho and chno formulas were aromatic structures in the ox group while 77 86 of them were lignins cram like in the py group 3 higher generation potentials of thms hkts and ch occurred in the py group but inversely for haas and hans these quantifiable dbps accounted for 18 24 of total dbps 4 the proportion of n dbps in the ox group 20 3 54 8 was significantly higher than those in the py group 2 8 4 8 the h c of the emerging dbps precursors in the ox group was 0 2 h c 1 5 while it was 0 6 h c 2 0 in the py group 5 due to higher aromatic structures and less protein and lignin components in direct incineration derived cdom the generated dbps had higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in general more serious threat to drinking water safety was observed in the direct incineration derived cdom than the anoxic pyrolysis derived

15254,monitoring the long term dynamics of lake phytoplankton can help understand their natural temporal variability as well as assess potential impacts of interventions aimed at improving lake ecological condition however investigating long term changes in lake ecosystems has received scant attention in the present study we analyzed a long term dataset of phytoplankton communities collected from 1990 to 2013 from eleven of the 12 rotorua te arawa lakes in new zealand to explore their responses to changing abiotic conditions we used a sequential algorithm to examine the likelihood of regime shifts in abiotic and biotic factors during the study period that could be attributable to lake interventions our analysis suggests that lake interventions have improved the abiotic factors whereas the response of biotic factors was less clear total phosphorus levels were implicated in the decline in lake condition including in two lakes subject to lake interventions and in four control lakes both abiotic and biotic factors showed diverse trends e g increase decrease or no change and abiotic factors had more regime shifts than biotic factors shifts in biotic indices also displayed time lags to shifts in abiotic factors long term responses of abiotic and biotic factors were also influenced by lake morphological characteristics and climatic variables this latter finding underscores the importance of considering lake morphological characteristics and climate changes when planning management practices a sound understanding of resilience and threshold of phytoplankton shifts to environmental changes are needed to assess the effectiveness of previous management strategies and prioritize the future conservation efforts toward water quality goals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords long term data trend lake intervention ecological condition rotorua te arawa lakes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction covering only a small part 1 8 of earth s land area messager et al 2016 lake ecosystems provide considerable services to human society including drinking water supply transportation recreation freshwater fisheries as well as supporting cultural values however lake water quality degradation has become a global problem especially following rapid post world war ii economic development and population expansion conley et al 2009 hering et al 2015 michalak et al 2013 stone 2011 ulrich et al 2016 water quality deterioration associated with nutrient enrichment in lakes is manifested in many ways including toxic cyanobacterial blooms prolonged hypoxia of bottom waters and excessive macrophyte growth all of which can collectively undermine the integrity of biotic communities and ultimately lead to reduction in biodiversity and other lake values dudgeon et al 2006 smith and schindler 2009 other large scale environmental pressures such as climate change can also exert pressure on lake ecosystem processes kundzewicz et al 2009 paerl and huisman 2009 vincent 2009 as well as phytoplankton paul et al 2012 wentzky et al 2018 wu et al 2022 macroinvertebrate durance and ormerod 2009 floury et al 2013 and fish communities buisson et al 2008 against this backdrop of lake deterioration driven by stressors such as climate change and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment arising from land use intensification many countries have implemented intervention strategies to prevent further ecological deterioration e g lürling and mucci 2020 wentzky et al 2018 however it is often hard to disentangle the effects of interventions against potential overarching effects of climate change understanding potential impacts of climate change on lake ecosystems is important in assessing the effectiveness of management strategies designed to mitigate nutrient enrichment by doing so any observed ecological changes can be attributed to either large scale climatic changes or to the smaller scale restoration activities such an understanding will lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of lake restoration activities which should lead towards future management actions to achieve desired water quality objectives within target lakes there is consequently a critical need for long term ecological data that has been collected against a back drop of climate change to help assess the effectiveness of lake interventions durance and ormerod 2009 for example several studies have demonstrated clear consistent correlations between climate change induced abiotic variations such as reductions in river flow climatic warming extreme weather events and resultant temporal shifts of aquatic organisms chessman 2009 durance and ormerod 2009 floury et al 2013 unfortunately such datasets are often scarce and poorly documented despite their obvious value in assessing ecological trends floury et al 2013 changes in watershed management have also been documented as responsible for water quality changes in rivers murphy and sprague 2019 and in lakes nielsen et al 2012 however close links between ecological communities such as phytoplankton and reductions in nutrients as a result of lake intervention activities are not always observed wentzky et al 2018 highlighting the complexity of ecosystem responses to interventions phytoplankton are a diverse group of microscopic organisms comprising several functional groups including diatoms cyanobacteria and flagellates their growth is limited by a combination of temperature and availability of light and inorganic nutrients nitrogen phosphate silicate and iron which in turn are controlled by catchment physical processes such as land use intensification and climate change murphy and sprague 2019 wu et al 2019 wijewardene et al 2021 worldwide there are many examples where excessive nutrient enrichment has led to development of major phytoplankton blooms including cyanobacteria ho et al 2019 the potential effects of environmental change on phytoplankton communities and the consequences for aquatic food webs and ecosystem function are thus considerable yet these remain largely unknown especially over long time frames to properly identify the biological consequences of human induced environmental change it is necessary to collect and analyze long term datasets to describe the underlying patterns due to natural seasonal and inter annual variability such long term monitoring datasets of lakes where management interventions have been implemented will aid in partitioning out the effects of human induced changes e g lake interventions from natural variability phytoplankton communities are particularly useful in this regard as they show high sensitivity to changes in the biotic e g grazer physical e g temperature flow regime and nutrient e g phosphorus structure of aquatic environments guo et al 2019 qu et al 2019 they also have other advantages such as being easy to sample and identify and have well known autecology features that make them appropriate indicators to detect community responses to environmental changes in fact they have been widely employed as an ideal bio indicator for water quality assessment in many water bodies particularly lakes and reservoirs guo et al 2019 wentzky et al 2018 and even lowland rivers sun et al 2018 sun et al 2022 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2022 in this study we compiled a 23 year 1990 2013 dataset containing 8834 samples from 11 of the 12 rotorua te arawa lakes in the north island of new zealand to describe the long term trends and regime shifts of water quality parameters and phytoplankton community and to explore their main driving forces this dataset was particularly useful in that several intervention programmes have been initiated as a result of public concerns of declining water quality in some lakes due to excessive eutrophication from human activities within their catchments while other geographically close lakes have had no interventions reflecting their more natural catchment land cover this gave us the chance to contrast regime shifts in phytoplankton communities arising from climatic effects alone to those arising from both climatic and intervention effects since human activities may induce strong multiple environmental filters understanding long term trends in these lakes under differing degrees of human pressure and studying the potential shifts in community assembly mechanisms are of particular relevance for biodiversity conservation and future watershed management policies guo et al 2019 isabwe et al 2018 we consequently tested the following hypotheses 1 abiotic and biotic factors in lakes where interventions had been implemented would change more than those lakes without intervention 2 there will be a time lag between changes to abiotic factors and resultant shifts in phytoplankton community composition as regime shifts in the phytoplankton community respond slower than regime shifts in abiotic factors 3 responses in the context of abiotic factors and phytoplankton community vary among the lakes due to lake specific morphological and climatic characteristics the reasons behind these hypotheses are 1 interventions e g alum dosing designed to reduce a lake s trophic state would likely act in synergy to natural climatic factors operating in the more natural lakes without interventions 2 biological communities have a certain resilience to environmental changes and therefore regime shifts in abiotic factors do not always cause biotic shifts 3 lake morphological and climatic characteristics are associated with in lake processes and many other environmental variables such as eutrophication dissolved oxygen light availability aquatic vegetation kolada 2014 qin et al 2020 which are key factors in phytoplankton development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the rotorua te arawa lakes are found within a 20 km radius of each other in the rotorua region central north island new zealand fig 1 due to their proximity to each other these lakes have similar climatic regimes but vary widely in their morphometry trophic state and catchment land use table 1 the rotorua te arawa lakes were formed between 200 000 years ago lake rotorua to only about 130 years ago lake rotomahana following the tarawera eruption as part of a series of volcanic eruptions that characterize the taupo volcanic zone tvz pearson et al 2010 trolle et al 2008 the terrain is hilly with steeper catchments covered by native or plantation pine forest mostly pinus radiata while less steep catchments have been developed into sheep beef or dairy pasture burns et al 2005 the geological area in and around the rotorua district is still geothermically active with lakes rotorua rotoiti tarawera rotomahana and rotoehu influenced by geothermally heated surface and subsurface inflows which contribute significant amounts of phosphorus and a range of metals such as arsenic to these lakes the rotorua te arawa lakes are considered taonga or treasure by the te arawa iwi tribe and are an important tourist destination in new zealand reflecting their interesting geothermal features their natural beauty and their world renowned and brown trout fishery the area also supports a significant amount of productive farming and plantation forestry areas as well as the urban center of rotorua following european settlement from the early 1900s water quality of the rotorua lakes has degraded due to the urban expansion and gradual conversion of forested land to pasture over the past 100 years burns et al 2005 2009 algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria have been common in some of these lakes as a result of eutrophication with a subsequent loss of recreational and cultural values to help

the 11 lakes studied five have had no specific interventions three of these lakes were in relatively undeveloped catchments table 1 while lakes rerewhakaaitu and rotomahana were in catchments dominated by agriculture land use in lakes where interventions were applied was variable and with the exception of lake rotoma was dominated by either agriculture or plantation forest in their catchments 2 2 water sampling and abiotic factors a routine water quality and phytoplankton monitoring program has been undertaken in these lakes since 1991 here monthly water quality samples have been collected and analysed for chlorophyll a chla secchi depth sd total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn this monthly water quality data was used to calculate the trophic level index tli for each lake annually based on the average of the normalized values of chla sd tp and tn burns et al 2009 1999 high sd values and low chla tp and tn result in low tli scores 2 0 2 9 and suggest a low trophic state oligotrophic condition while high tli scores 4 0 4 9 indicate an increase in trophic state eutrophic condition lake morphological characteristics including maximum water depth max depth mean

discharge av dishcarge residence time res time soil erosion soil erosion and average water temperature av wtemp were obtained for each lake see appendix s9 for details all climatic data air temperature c total monthly rainfall mm wind velocity m s and total monthly sunshine hours h were obtained from the rotorua airport and we assumed that these large scale climatic data influenced all lakes in a similar manner we calculated 15 climate indices appendix s8 such as the average maximum monthly temperature av tmax the maximum of the monthly maximum temperature max tmax the average minimum monthly temperature av tmin from this data to represent the climate component of abiotic variables water quality and climatic factors were based on annual data of the hydrological year 1 july 30 june that include the austral summer within the same year the use of annual average data is also consistent with the overall rotorua te arawa lakes management strategy that sets tli targets based on annual data which simplifies both assessment of plan effectiveness and communication 2 3 phytoplankton and lab processing all phytoplankton samples were collected using an integrated tube sampler at the mid lake station in each lake from the surface to a depth 1 m above the thermocline in lakes that stratify okaro okareka okataina rotoiti rotoma rotomahana rotorua tarawera and tikitapu or down to 1 m above the bottom sediment in frequently mixed lakes rerewhakaaitu and rotoehu a sub sample was collected and preserved with lugol s iodine for phytoplankton enumeration all samples were kept in the dark until examination prior to processing all samples were thoroughly homogenized and a 10 ml subsample was taken and settled in an utermöhl chambers utermöhl 1958 phytoplankton were originally identified to genera using an inverted microscope olympus ix71 and relative abundance was determined for each genera enumeration of phytoplankton to calculate densities cells ml 1 followed methods adapted from hötzel croome 1999 and us environmental protection agency 2007 here phytoplankton were counted at 400 or 200 magnification in at least three transects including at least 100 planktonic units cells colonies and filaments of the dominant species the whole chamber was counted for cyanoprokaryota except when they were dominant relative abundance of algal cells was used as this represented the composition of the phytoplankton community which may vary with productivity which determines total cell abundance relative abundance is a proportional measure and complementary to reporting of total cell counts and is simply a variable used to compare empirically with catchment indices although phytoplankton were originally identified to genera all analysis was done on data grouped to phylum as paul et al 2012 found that this classification level was sufficient to distinguish between lakes of different trophic state using only this higher level of classification would also have minimised potential bias in the data caused by for example mis identification of some genera over time furthermore from a lake management perspective we were more interested to see if lake interventions had reduced the incidence of cyanobacterial blooms which have major detrimental effects on recreational cultural and ecological values than we were on detecting potential changes to the phytoplankton composition of other phyla at the genus level the timing of phytoplankton monitoring was also not consistent within the lakes over time for example phytoplankton samples were initially collected at a single site every 3 months from all lakes except lakes rotoiti and rotorua which were sampled monthly from three or ten sites respectively however from july 1993 all samples were combined into a single composite sample for each lake to represent the austral summer from the july to june period i e july 1993 june 1994 july 1994 june 1995 monitoring has continued seasonally at most lakes from 1997 onwards a total of 8834 samples have thus been collected between 1991 and 2013 appendix s1 s2 for ease of analysis all samples were pooled to the appropriate austral hydrological year july 1 to june 30 and the average annual percentage community composition of the different phytoplankton phyla calculated use of this annual data was consistent with the use of the average annual tli data that was central to the rotorua te arawa lakes management strategy 2 4 statistical analyses five biotic indices were used to summarize the phytoplankton community shannon wiener biodiversity index sh taxonomic richness tr based on phyla the ratio of cyanoprokaryota to other phytoplankton phyla cr and chla nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to reduce the phytoplankton community matrix to the first nmds axis scores for each sample i e mds1 which represented the overall condition of the phytoplankton community at the phyla level the nmds was done to reduce the dimensionality of the phytoplankton composition data and the first axis explained the most variability in the data stress 0 193 this analysis was done as the multiple linear regression models mlr used in the analysis can only handle one dimensional variables the analysis was done using the metamds function in the vegan package of r oksanen et al 2019 to reveal time trends in environmental factors and biotic indices in the 11 lakes over the study period we used the mann kendall trend test called mk trend test hereafter function mk test in r package trend the mk trend test is a nonparametric rank based test and does not depend on any assumptions regarding the distribution between dependent and independent variables and is robust for abnormally distributed data the test is designed to detect significant temporal trends after removing autocorrelations by spearman rank correlations it gives a z statistic to judge whether the observed time series variables are statistically significant positive or negative values of the z statistic suggests an increasing and decreasing trend respectively while z 0 occurs when there is no detectable trend this approach has been used for distinct abiotic variables and various aquatic communities abonyi et al 2018 floury et al 2013 guo et al 2018 wentzky et al 2018 a sequential algorithm proposed by rodionov 2004 was used to identify regime shifts in the time series of different abiotic factors e g tp tn sd and tli and the phytoplankton community as indicated by nmds axis1 chla or the biotic indices sr sh and cr regime shifts are large abrupt persistent changes in the structure and function of a system such as a shift in the dominant phyla making up the phytoplankton community however in reality we need a quantitative value to detect it thus we used a sequential algorithm which used a pre whitening procedure to remove the red noise component from time series data rodionov 2006 regime shifts were identified using a student s t test and regime shift index rsi rodionov 2004 this technique has been extensively applied to time series analysis of a range of variables e g climate hydrology variables e g serinaldi and kilsby 2015 two parameters cut off length and probability level were set as 10 and 0 1 i e default setup respectively in comparison with other regime shift detection tools this method has the advantage of detecting an ecological regime shift earlier and then monitors how its magnitude changes over time andersen et al 2009 huang et al 2019 this advantage is mainly due to the use of exploratory analysis that does not require an a priori hypothesis on the timing of regime shifts rodionov 2004 phytoplankton sampling had been undertaken from between 15 and 19 years starting in 1991 during this time specific interventions were implemented in several of the lakes while other lakes had no such interventions this long term dataset thus represented an ideal opportunity to assess the relative effect of the lake interventions using the baci before after and control impact approach underwood 1992 for this lakes were assigned to either control no intervention or impact intervention applied irrespective of its type and to a time either before the intervention or after it must be emphasized that the control lakes still often had significant land use pressure within their catchment that may have continued to cause water quality degradation but no management interventions were implemented any temporal changes to abiotic or biotic factors in these catchments were thus due to a combination of climatic and human activities without the benefit of lake interventions for control lakes the after terms was taken as the year where the earliest interventions were implemented in any of the other lakes unlike the control lakes any observed temporal changes in the impact lakes represents changes due to climatic effects as well as human activities including any effects of lake interventions two way anova was used to evaluate the effect of both location i e control and impact and date i e before and after as well as their interactions on response variables using aov function in r multiple linear regression models mlr function lm in r were used to explore the combined effects of abiotic factors water quality climate lake physiographic features and dominant catchment land use on biotic factors i e mds1 tr sh cr and chla prior to mlrs the collinearity effects among all predictors were identified by inspecting the variance inflation factors vifs using a stepwise procedure until all predictors of vif s were 5 this was done using the vifstep function in the r package usdm naimi et al 2014 based on minimizing the corrected akaike information criterion aicc we performed a model simplification with the stepaicc function in r package mass venables and ripley 2002 to select the best abiotic predictors for the five biotic indices all abiotic variables and biotic indices were transformed using the z score before mlr analyses so that the standardized coefficients were comparable in magnitude within and between models schielzeth 2010 all the data analyses and graphics were performed in the r software r version 3 5 3 r core team 2021 3 results the lake morphological characteristics varied considerably among the 11 lakes table 1 for example maximum depths ranged from 13 5 m lake rotoehu to 125 m lake rotomahana with an average and median value of 59 3 and 44 8 m respectively mean depths ranged from 7 m lake rerewhakaaitu to 60 m lake rotomahana lake surface area and lake catchment areas varied greatly 0 3 80 8 and 3 9 508 0 km2 respectively length of shoreline averaged 23 39 km ranging from 2 1 km lake okaro to 51 59 km lake rotoiti however average lake elevation was 340 m with only a relatively small range of 279 to 435 m calculated mean tli values derived from concentrations of tp tn sd and chla ranged from 2 4 the oligotrophic lake rotoma to 5 4 the hypertrophic lake okaro for the study period 1990 2017 table 3 these five factors showed strong significant correlations among each other appendix s3 p 0 001 lakes okataina rotoma tarawera and tikitapu had tlis 3 which placed them in the oligotrophic category burns et al 2009 1999 while lakes okaro rotoehu and rotorua had tlis 4 which placed them in the eutrophic to hypertrophic category lakes okareka rerewhakaaitu rotoiti and rotomahana were mesotrophic with tlis between 3 and 4 table 3 the lakes had two predominant mixing regimes monomictic e g rotoma tarawera okaro and polymictic e g rerewhakaaitu rotohu and rotorua table 1 climate indices also demonstrated a large range during the 23 years for instance average maximum monthly temperature av tmax ranged from 19 46 to 21 70 c while the maximum monthly rainfall in each year max rain varied from 131 40 to 423 80 mm appendix s8 3 1 environmental trends over the study period the long term trends of environmental and biotic variables i e chla sd tp tn and tli were lake dependent table 4 fig 2 except for three lakes rerewhakaaitu rotomahana and tikitapu chla demonstrated decreasing trends although these were non significant for sd two lakes okareka and tikitapu showed a declining but not significant trend while the other lakes demonstrated increasing trends which were significant p 0 001 at lakes okaro and rotoiti declining trends of tn were found at all lakes although these trends were significant in only six lakes conversely concentrations of tp showed increasing trends except for 3 lakes okaro rotoehu and rotorua a significant increase was detected for tp at lakes okareka okataina rerewhakaaitu rotoma rotomahana and tarawera while a significant decrease was found at lakes okaro and rotorua mk trend test p 0 001 this decrease in these latter two lakes may reflect the continuous alum dosing interventions of their inflowing streams 0 22 mg al l 1 and 2 62 µg al l 1 respectively although no such reductions were observed in either lake rotoehu where the inflowing stream was continuously dosed with 6 72 µg al l 1 tempero 2015 or in lake rotoiti which was subject to alum dosing directly into the lake when cyanobacterial blooms occurred calculated tlis of three lakes okaro rotoiti and rotorua with interventions showed a significant decreasing trend mk trend test p 0 05 indicating a water quality improvement which was the anticipated result of interventions this contrasts with the tlis of two lakes rotomahana and tarawera without interventions which significantly increased during the study period table 4 fig 2 suggesting degrading water quality in general lake interventions appeared to have improved the abiotic conditions of at least some of the water quality parameters in the lakes with interventions with the exception of lake rotoehu which showed no improvements for example tn and tp significantly declined in 4 and 2 lakes with interventions respectively while sd increased in 2 lakes in contrast tn declined in only 2 of the control lakes while tp increased in 4 of the 5 control lakes table 4 two way anova showed significant treatment control impact effects p 0 001 on all water quality variables while date before after effects were not significant table 4 the interaction between location and date was significant on only tp f 4 35 p 0 05 this implied that the behavior of all abiotic variables but tp was broadly similar between control and treatment lakes the significant interaction term for tp most likely reflected the consistent increases of tp in 4 of the 5 control lakes compared to the inconsistent responses in treatment lakes table 2 here tp increased in okareka where phosloc has been applied and rotoma where land use interventions have been applied and declined in okaro and rotorua both of which have had alum dosing 3 2 phytoplankton community trends over the study period a total of 31 phytoplankton genera were identified in 24 families from 16 orders representing six phyla the most abundant taxa encountered were the diatoms ochrophyta fragilaria aulacoseira and cyclotella the cyanobacteria anabaena and microcystis and the charophyte staurastrum all of which had a relative abundance of more than 5 the most widespread taxa found in more than two thirds of the samples included the chlorophyta oocystis the charophyta closterium and staurastrum the cryptophyta cryptomonas the cyanobacteria anabaena and the diatoms aulacoseira and fragilaria the results of the mk trend test of the phytoplankton community indicated by mds1 sh tr and cr table 5 were lake dependent significant positive trends in cr were observed in one control lake tarawera and 2 impact lakes rotoiti and rotoma table 5 fig 3 but no significant trends were detected in the other lakes significant trends in sh diversity were evident in two impact lakes but showed contrasting trends declining in lake okareka but increasing in lake rotoiti table 5 fig 4 no significant trends p 0 05 in sh were detected in any of the rest 9 lakes correlations of nmds scores showed significant positive correlations with nmds scores for cyanobacteria 0 709 and euglenoids 0 462 while a significant negative correlation was found for charophyta 0 520 nmds scores increased significantly in four of both the control and impact lakes table 5 suggesting an increased relative abundance of cyanobacteria or euglenoids in these lakes indeterminant trends to nmds scores were found in the two of the other impact lakes okaro rotorua and in a control lake tikitapu appendix s6 this trend analysis showed that apart from what appeared to be consistent changes in community composition in terms of increasing nmds scores the other biotic metrics displayed fewer consistent changes than the water quality metrics two way anova indicated that there were significant location and date effects on cr tr and mds1 p 0 001 for example lakes okaro rotoehu and rotoiti had the highest nmds scores and highest crs while lakes rotomahana and tikitapu had the lowest nmds scores and crs similar patterns were also found with changes in nmds and cr between samples collect before and after interventions for instance nmds scores were higher in 5 treatment lakes after interventions than before and in three control lakes there were significant interaction effects between location and date only for cr and nmds scores table 5 overall trends in biotic metrics in the 11 lakes appeared more similar between lakes than the abiotic conditions with little differences in the number of either control or impact lakes showing trends for example we observed increases in both nmds scores and cr in both control and impact lakes although the impact lakes appeared to change more 3 3 regime shifts of tli and community indices regime shift analysis indicated that annual tlis of most lakes showed multiple shifts e g lakes okareka 5 rerewhakaaitu 4 rotoehu 5 and rotorua 3 fig 2 generally the control lakes without interventions had fewer regime shifts for the tli than those impact lakes mean regime shifts 2 2 vs 3 0 in comparison phytoplankton indices including tr cr sh mds1 and chla showed fewer shifts regardless of lake interventions e g cr and sh of control and impacted lakes are 0 vs 0 83 and 0 6 vs 0 33 respectively fig 3 fig 4 appendix s5 s6 and s7 these fewer regime shifts for the biotic indices suggests some form of biotic resilience to environmental changes 3 4 driving forces for phytoplankton community trends to explore the main driving forces of phytoplankton community indices we conducted mlrs to examine the potential correlations between the five biotic factors i e mds1 tr sh cr and chla and the measured abiotic factors fig 5 both climate e g av tmin av wind mean max wind mean lake morphological characteristics e g shore dev vol total anthropogenic factors e g soil erosion and water chemistry e g tn were identified as important drivers to the five biotic indices tn had always strong positive relationship with these five indices av sun had significant positive relationships with mds1 tr and cr whereas max wind mean i e the average of the maximum monthly wind speed in each year had negative correlations with sh and tr shore dev was identified as important driver for sh tr and chla while population density i e population den was positively correlated to mds1 and tr fig 5 4 discussion our results clearly showed that long term abiotic factors e g tli in the 11 rotorua te arawa lakes showed diverse trends e g increase decrease and no change and displayed more regime shifts in impact lakes than control lakes this finding broadly supported at least part of our first hypothesis that abiotic factors changed more in lakes with interventions than without however despite these shifts in abiotic factors fewer changes were observed in biotic factors even in the impact lakes suggesting a degree of resistance of the phytoplankton community to interventions interventions were implemented in response to public and community concern for the water quality status of the rotorua te arawa lakes e g scholes and mcintosh 2010 it was expected that interventions would have reduced nutrient inputs into the lakes where these were applied although some time lag was expected between implementation and being able to detect the results of the 6 lakes where interventions were used expected water quality improvements occurred at 4 lakes for tn and three lakes for tli tp and sd also improved at 2 control lakes although somewhat paradoxically tp also increased at 2 lakes between 1991 and 2013 of interest was the finding that the control lakes often displayed opposite trends to the impact lakes with increases in tli at 2 lakes and increases in tp at four these changes in water quality parameters are broadly consistent with the expected results of the interventions at least between the years covered in this analysis 1991 2013 potential changes in lake water quality conditions in control lakes without interventions most likely reflects inherent nutrient input dynamics in these catchments such dynamics could include normal farming practices lakes rerewhakaaitu and rotomahana or unexpected and increased loss of topsoil in lakes dominated by native forest okataina from erosion due to overgrazing by introduced mammals mainly wallaby despite the clear evidence of the benefit of interventions on abiotic factors there was less evidence that phytoplankton communities were changing over time in response to lake interventions although a number of discrete regime shifts were detected the number of regime shifts was much lower than observed for the abiotic factors these observations gave tentative support to our second hypothesis in demonstrating a potential time lag between changes to abiotic conditions and resultant shifts in phytoplankton community composition we also found that 8 of the 11 lakes displayed a significant increase to their nmds scores indicating a slow shift in the communities to ones dominated by cyanobacteria and euglenoids and a potential reduction in chlorophyta the fact that these changes appeared to occur in all lakes irrespective of whether they were subject to interventions may reflect potential over arching climatic effects associated with climate change although we assumed that climatic conditions were likely to have been relatively constant across all 11 lakes we concede that effects of climatic variables on both water quality and phytoplankton communities were likely to differ between larger deeper lakes than smaller shallower lakes especially given the effect of wind in affecting mixing layers deng et al 2016 the mlrs identified the importance of the average minimum temperature average of the mean monthly wind speed and average of the monthly solar radiation for many of the biotic indices and these climatic factors could affect phytoplankton communities through direct processes temperature or indirect processes via increased lake mixing that could mobilise bed sediments more and consequently increase nutrient concentrations furthermore windy conditions may also increase the survivability of some cyanobacteria as these are often more shade tolerant and can grow even in highly turbid constantly mixed environments reynolds et al 2002 besides suspension of organic matters in water as a result of wind and turbulence can greatly promote euglenoids due to its diverse physiological processes of such as movement photosynthesis and orientation kottuparambil 2022 therefore such warmer nutrient rich conditions may consequently have favoured cyanobacteria and euglenoids in these lakes the importance of climate change in enhancing cyanobacterial dominance in lake phytoplankton was also observed in long term monitoring data from lake pyhäjärvi in finland where climate variables were positively correlated to increases in cyanobacteria deng et al 2016 furthermore a 22 year study by rolighed et al 2016 in a shallow eutrophic danish lake showed that the proportion of cyanobacteria increased rolighed et al 2016 with a warming climate they found that in a 6 c warming scenario a nutrient load reduction of as much as 60 would be required to achieve summer chla levels similar to those of the baseline scenario with present temperatures jeppesen et al 2017 rolighed et al 2016 these results may have significant implications for the long term benefits of the mitigation measures currently being used in the rotorua te arawa lakes while these are focused primarily on attaining desired tli levels and are thus water quality focused one of the main drivers for the need to reduce nutrient loadings was driven by the desire to reduce cyanobacterial blooms scholes and mcintosh 2010 it may be that despite the observed reductions in nutrients such as tn increases in tp temperature and wind may in fact lead to an unexpected increase in cyanobacterial blooms this may mean that any short term improvements to water quality variables such as the tli might be confounded by large scale environmental changes associated with climate change which may somewhat dampen any potential reduction in the frequency and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in the future another interesting finding in our study was that abiotic factors displayed more regime shifts than biotic factors which also appeared to display a time lag to changes in abiotic factors changes in community structure and composition are considered to integrate all the potential ecological responses to environmental changes floury et al 2013 hughes 2000 such links between abiotic and biotic factors are one reason why phytoplankton communities change as resource availability and disturbances change wentzky et al 2018 however there are situations where such tight links are not observed for example jeppesen et al 2015 found that 25 of their studied lakes did not show an expected reduction in phytoplankton biomass following a reduction in nutrients another complicating factor is that mechanisms such as mixotrophy allow bacterially derived phosphorus to be available for phytoplankton which consequently allows phytoplankton to adapt to lower nutrient levels without a loss of total biomass wentzky et al 2018 all these findings reflect a relatively large degree of resilience to phytoplankton community against changes in water quality such resilience may have critical implications for ongoing restoration measures in lake ecosystems our third hypothesis was that responses of abiotic and biotic variables would vary among the different lakes due to lake specific morphological and climatic characteristics the mlrs supported this hypothesis and showed that phytoplankton community indices were related to lake morphological characteristics such as lake volume and catchment conditions shore development and plantation forest fig 5 this result mirrors those of paul et al 2012 who showed that catchment land use was a strong predictor in lake phytoplankton composition with cyanobacteria being positively correlated with the amount of developed land particularly pasture and trophic state ryan et al 2006 also found that lake trophic state and mixing regime were important predictors of phytoplankton composition in a study of 40 lakes in new zealand s north island our results suggested that long term trends in biotic factors and regime shifts were also highly lake dependent this observation is consistent with many previous studies for example ecosystem size indicated by lake volume was not only a determinant of phytoplankton diversity but was also shown to mediate the influence of anthropogenic effects on biodiversity baho et al 2017 lake morphological characteristics such as depth also affected in lake biogeochemical processes which in turn can underpin the relative roles and fates of nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes through sediment release dynamics qin et al 2020 the implication of these findings is that developing lake specific best management practices bmps are of great importance and necessity before embarking on any management plan aimed at improving lake conditions such lake specific bmps have been used in the rotorua te arawa lakes such as the construction of the diversion channel to divert nutrient rich water from lake rotorua from entering lake rotoiti scholes and mcintosh 2010 this allows for a more efficient use of time and often limited financial resources lake managers should thus recognize that there is no one size fits all in lake management even for adjacent lakes as the case in the present study as each lake is unique what works on one lake may not be effective in another lake this was one reason why bmps may have had the desired effect in reducing tp in some lakes lakes okaro and rotoma but not in other lakes lakes okareka and rotoiti 5 conclusions our findings highlighted the importance of long term monitoring data for evaluating environmental change induced ecological shifts in lakes the long term variations of lake conditions in the context of abiotic and biotic factors varied among the lakes and demonstrated diverse trends a profound understanding of the resilience and mechanisms of phytoplankton community to environmental stressors upon the species traits and ecosystem functions should be addressed in future studies since this is essential for restoration and management strategies in addition given the fact that long term trends and regime shifts of phytoplankton assemblage were highly lake dependent and affected by climate indices development of lake specific

15254,monitoring the long term dynamics of lake phytoplankton can help understand their natural temporal variability as well as assess potential impacts of interventions aimed at improving lake ecological condition however investigating long term changes in lake ecosystems has received scant attention in the present study we analyzed a long term dataset of phytoplankton communities collected from 1990 to 2013 from eleven of the 12 rotorua te arawa lakes in new zealand to explore their responses to changing abiotic conditions we used a sequential algorithm to examine the likelihood of regime shifts in abiotic and biotic factors during the study period that could be attributable to lake interventions our analysis suggests that lake interventions have improved the abiotic factors whereas the response of biotic factors was less clear total phosphorus levels were implicated in the decline in lake condition including in two lakes subject to lake interventions and in four control lakes both abiotic and biotic factors showed diverse trends e g increase decrease or no change and abiotic factors had more regime shifts than biotic factors shifts in biotic indices also displayed time lags to shifts in abiotic factors long term responses of abiotic and biotic factors were also influenced by lake morphological characteristics and climatic variables this latter finding underscores the importance of considering lake morphological characteristics and climate changes when planning management practices a sound understanding of resilience and threshold of phytoplankton shifts to environmental changes are needed to assess the effectiveness of previous management strategies and prioritize the future conservation efforts toward water quality goals graphical abstract

only a small part 1 8 of earth s land area messager et al 2016 lake ecosystems provide considerable services to human society including drinking water supply transportation recreation freshwater fisheries as well as supporting cultural values however lake water quality degradation has become a global problem especially following rapid post world war ii economic development and population expansion conley et al 2009 hering et al 2015 michalak et al 2013 stone 2011 ulrich et al 2016 water quality deterioration associated with nutrient enrichment in lakes is manifested in many ways including toxic cyanobacterial blooms prolonged hypoxia of bottom waters and excessive macrophyte growth all of which can collectively undermine the integrity of biotic communities and ultimately lead to reduction in biodiversity and other lake values dudgeon et al 2006 smith and schindler 2009 other large scale environmental pressures such as climate change can also exert pressure on lake ecosystem processes kundzewicz et al 2009 paerl and huisman 2009 vincent 2009 as well as phytoplankton paul et al 2012 wentzky et al 2018 wu et al 2022 macroinvertebrate durance and ormerod 2009 floury et al 2013 and fish communities buisson et al 2008 against this backdrop of lake deterioration driven by stressors such as climate change and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment arising from land use intensification many countries have implemented intervention strategies to prevent further ecological deterioration e g lürling and mucci 2020 wentzky et al 2018 however it is often hard to disentangle the effects of interventions against potential overarching effects of climate change understanding potential impacts of climate change on lake ecosystems is important in assessing the effectiveness of management strategies designed to mitigate nutrient enrichment by doing so any observed ecological changes can be attributed to either large scale climatic changes or to the smaller scale restoration activities such an understanding will lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of lake restoration activities which should lead towards future management actions to achieve desired water quality objectives within target lakes there is consequently a critical need for long term ecological data that has been collected against a back drop of climate change to help assess the effectiveness of lake interventions durance and ormerod 2009 for example several studies have demonstrated clear consistent correlations between climate change induced abiotic variations such as reductions in river flow climatic warming extreme weather events and resultant temporal shifts of aquatic organisms chessman 2009 durance and ormerod 2009 floury et al 2013 unfortunately such datasets are often scarce and poorly documented despite their obvious value in assessing ecological trends floury et al 2013 changes in watershed management have also been documented as responsible for water quality changes in rivers murphy and sprague 2019 and in lakes nielsen et al 2012 however close links between ecological communities such as phytoplankton and reductions in nutrients as a result of lake intervention activities are not always observed wentzky et al 2018 highlighting the complexity of ecosystem responses to interventions phytoplankton are a diverse group of microscopic organisms comprising several functional groups including diatoms cyanobacteria and flagellates their growth is limited by a combination of temperature and availability of light and inorganic nutrients nitrogen phosphate silicate and iron which in turn are controlled by catchment physical processes such as land use intensification and climate change murphy and sprague 2019 wu et al 2019 wijewardene et al 2021 worldwide there are many examples where excessive nutrient enrichment has led to development of major phytoplankton blooms including cyanobacteria ho et al 2019 the potential effects of environmental change on phytoplankton communities and the consequences for aquatic food webs and ecosystem function are thus considerable yet these remain largely unknown especially over long time frames to properly identify the biological consequences of human induced environmental change it is necessary to collect and analyze long term datasets to describe the underlying patterns due to natural seasonal and inter annual variability such long term monitoring datasets of lakes where management interventions have been implemented will aid in partitioning out the effects of human induced changes e g lake interventions from natural variability phytoplankton communities are particularly useful in this regard as they show high sensitivity to changes in the biotic e g grazer physical e g temperature flow regime and nutrient e g phosphorus structure of aquatic environments guo et al 2019 qu et al 2019 they also have other advantages such as being easy to sample and identify and have well known autecology features that make them appropriate indicators to detect community responses to environmental changes in fact they have been widely employed as an ideal bio indicator for water quality assessment in many water bodies particularly lakes and reservoirs guo et al 2019 wentzky et al 2018 and even lowland rivers sun et al 2018 sun et al 2022 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2022 in this study we compiled a 23 year 1990 2013 dataset containing 8834 samples from 11 of the 12 rotorua te arawa lakes in the north island of new zealand to describe the long term trends and regime shifts of water quality parameters and phytoplankton community and to explore their main driving forces this dataset was particularly useful in that several intervention programmes have been initiated as a result of public concerns of declining water quality in some lakes due to excessive eutrophication from human activities within their catchments while other geographically close lakes have had no interventions reflecting their more natural catchment land cover this gave us the chance to contrast regime shifts in phytoplankton communities arising from climatic effects alone to those arising from both climatic and intervention effects since human activities may induce strong multiple environmental filters understanding long term trends in these lakes under differing degrees of human pressure and studying the potential shifts in community assembly mechanisms are of particular relevance for biodiversity conservation and future watershed management policies guo et al 2019 isabwe et al 2018 we consequently tested the following hypotheses 1 abiotic and biotic factors in lakes where interventions had been implemented would change more than those lakes without intervention 2 there will be a time lag between changes to abiotic factors and resultant shifts in phytoplankton community composition as regime shifts in the phytoplankton community respond slower than regime shifts in abiotic factors 3 responses in the context of abiotic factors and phytoplankton community vary among the lakes due to lake specific morphological and climatic characteristics the reasons behind these hypotheses are 1 interventions e g alum dosing designed to reduce a lake s trophic state would likely act in synergy to natural climatic factors operating in the more natural lakes without interventions 2 biological communities have a certain resilience to environmental changes and therefore regime shifts in abiotic factors do not always cause biotic shifts 3 lake morphological and climatic characteristics are associated with in lake processes and many other environmental variables such as eutrophication dissolved oxygen light availability aquatic vegetation kolada 2014 qin et al 2020 which are key factors in phytoplankton development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the rotorua te arawa lakes are found within a 20 km radius of each other in the rotorua region central north island new zealand fig 1 due to their proximity to each other these lakes have similar climatic regimes but vary widely in their morphometry trophic state and catchment land use table 1 the rotorua te arawa lakes were formed between 200 000 years ago lake rotorua to only about 130 years ago lake rotomahana following the tarawera eruption as part of a series of volcanic eruptions that characterize the taupo volcanic zone tvz pearson et al 2010 trolle et al 2008 the terrain is hilly with steeper catchments covered by native or plantation pine forest mostly pinus radiata while less steep catchments have been developed into sheep beef or dairy pasture burns et al 2005 the geological area in and around the rotorua district is still geothermically active with lakes rotorua rotoiti tarawera rotomahana and rotoehu influenced by geothermally heated surface and subsurface inflows which contribute significant amounts of phosphorus and a range of metals such as arsenic to these lakes the rotorua te arawa lakes are considered taonga or treasure by the te arawa iwi tribe and are an important tourist destination in new zealand reflecting their interesting geothermal features their natural beauty and their world renowned and brown trout fishery the area also supports a significant amount of productive farming and plantation forestry areas as well as the urban center of rotorua following european settlement from the early 1900s water quality of the rotorua lakes has degraded due to the urban expansion and gradual conversion of forested land to pasture over the past 100 years burns et al 2005 2009 algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria have been common in some of these lakes as a result of eutrophication with a subsequent loss of recreational and cultural values to help improve water quality conditions in the rotorua te arawa lakes local government and the te arawa lakes trust have formed a partnership to help protect and restore water quality in the 12 rotorua te arawa lakes for the enjoyment of present and future generations burns et al 2009 scholes and mcintosh 2010 many statutory management documents have subsequently been prepared to promote the sustainable management of water resources in the region sustain the life supporting capacity of water maintain or enhance ecological maori cultural recreational and natural character values of water and address adverse environmental effects of the use of land on water see https www rotorualakes co nz strategy for the lake a number of activities have been implemented to help halt the deterioration of the rotorua te arawa lakes with a major focus on reducing nutrient inputs or capping sediments these activities were undertaken as part of specific action plans developed with input from stake holders including local iwi community and local government table 2 such interventions included a mix of stronger regulation towards best management practices in agricultural or forestry land 4 lakes in lake activities such as riparian planting wetland creation or weed harvesting 4 lakes chemical treatment with either alum 4 lakes or phosloc 2 lakes and large infrastructure developments such as reticulation of the rotorua waste water treatment plant to land irrigation in the redwoods whakarewarewa forests and construction of a diversion channel the ohau canal between lake rotorua and lake rotoiti to minimize eutrophic water from lake rotorua mixing with less enriched water in lake rotoiti before it flowed downstream into the kaituna rive hamilton et al 2009 scholes and mcintosh 2010 of the 11 lakes studied five have had no specific interventions three of these lakes were in relatively undeveloped catchments table 1 while lakes rerewhakaaitu and rotomahana were in catchments dominated by agriculture land use in lakes where interventions were applied was variable and with the exception of lake rotoma was dominated by either agriculture or plantation forest in their catchments 2 2 water sampling and abiotic factors a routine water quality and phytoplankton monitoring program has been undertaken in these lakes since 1991 here monthly water quality samples have been collected and analysed for chlorophyll a chla secchi depth sd total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn this monthly water quality data was used to calculate the trophic level index tli for each lake annually based on the average of the normalized values of chla sd tp and tn burns et al 2009 1999 high sd values and low chla tp and tn result in low tli scores 2 0 2 9 and suggest a low trophic state oligotrophic condition while high tli scores 4 0 4 9 indicate an increase in trophic state eutrophic condition lake morphological characteristics including maximum water depth max depth mean water depth mean depth surface area surface area catchment area catchment area elevation elevation length of shoreline shore len shoreline development shore dev total lake volume vol total average discharge av dishcarge residence time res time soil erosion soil erosion and average water temperature av wtemp were obtained for each lake see appendix s9 for details all climatic data air temperature c total monthly rainfall mm wind velocity m s and total monthly sunshine hours h were obtained from the rotorua airport and we assumed that these large scale climatic data influenced all lakes in a similar manner we calculated 15 climate indices appendix s8 such as the average maximum monthly temperature av tmax the maximum of the monthly maximum temperature max tmax the average minimum monthly temperature av tmin from this data to represent the climate component of abiotic variables water quality and climatic factors were based on annual data of the hydrological year 1 july 30 june that include the austral summer within the same year the use of annual average data is also consistent with the overall rotorua te arawa lakes management strategy that sets tli targets based on annual data which simplifies both assessment of plan effectiveness and communication 2 3 phytoplankton and lab processing all phytoplankton samples were collected using an integrated tube sampler at the mid lake station in each lake from the surface to a depth 1 m above the thermocline in lakes that stratify okaro okareka okataina rotoiti rotoma rotomahana rotorua tarawera and tikitapu or down to 1 m above the bottom sediment in frequently mixed lakes rerewhakaaitu and rotoehu a sub sample was collected and preserved with lugol s iodine for phytoplankton enumeration all samples were kept in the dark until examination prior to processing all samples were thoroughly homogenized and a 10 ml subsample was taken and settled in an utermöhl chambers utermöhl 1958 phytoplankton were originally identified to genera using an inverted microscope olympus ix71 and relative abundance was determined for each genera enumeration of phytoplankton to calculate densities cells ml 1 followed methods adapted from hötzel croome 1999 and us environmental protection agency 2007 here phytoplankton were counted at 400 or 200 magnification in at least three transects including at least 100 planktonic units cells colonies and filaments of the dominant species the whole chamber was counted for cyanoprokaryota except when they were dominant relative abundance of algal cells was used as this represented the composition of the phytoplankton community which may vary with productivity which determines total cell abundance relative abundance is a proportional measure and complementary to reporting of total cell counts and is simply a variable used to compare empirically with catchment indices although phytoplankton were originally identified to genera all analysis was done on data grouped to phylum as paul et al 2012 found that this classification level was sufficient to distinguish between lakes of different trophic state using only this higher level of classification would also have minimised potential bias in the data caused by for example mis identification of some genera over time furthermore from a lake management perspective we were more interested to see if lake interventions had reduced the incidence of cyanobacterial blooms which have major detrimental effects on recreational cultural and ecological values than we were on detecting potential changes to the phytoplankton composition of other phyla at the genus level the timing of phytoplankton monitoring was also not consistent within the lakes over time for example phytoplankton samples were initially collected at a single site every 3 months from all lakes except lakes rotoiti and rotorua which were sampled monthly from three or ten sites respectively however from july 1993 all samples were combined into a single composite sample for each lake to represent the austral summer from the july to june period i e july 1993 june 1994 july 1994 june 1995 monitoring has continued seasonally at most lakes from 1997 onwards a total of 8834 samples have thus been collected between 1991 and 2013 appendix s1 s2 for ease of analysis all samples were pooled to the appropriate austral hydrological year july 1 to june 30 and the average annual percentage community composition of the different phytoplankton phyla calculated use of this annual data was consistent with the use of the average annual tli data that was central to the rotorua te arawa lakes management strategy 2 4 statistical analyses five biotic indices were used to summarize the phytoplankton community shannon wiener biodiversity index sh taxonomic richness tr based on phyla the ratio of cyanoprokaryota to other phytoplankton phyla cr and chla nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to reduce the phytoplankton community matrix to the first nmds axis scores for each sample i e mds1 which represented the overall condition of the phytoplankton community at the phyla level the nmds was done to reduce the dimensionality of the phytoplankton composition data and the first axis explained the most variability in the data stress 0 193 this analysis was done as the multiple linear regression models mlr used in the analysis can only handle one dimensional variables the analysis was done using the metamds function in the vegan package of r oksanen et al 2019 to reveal time trends in environmental factors and biotic indices in the 11 lakes over the study period we used the mann kendall trend test called mk trend test hereafter function mk test in r package trend the mk trend test is a nonparametric rank based test and does not depend on any assumptions regarding the distribution between dependent and independent variables and is robust for abnormally distributed data the test is designed to detect significant temporal trends after removing autocorrelations by spearman rank correlations it gives a z statistic to judge whether the observed time series variables are statistically significant positive or negative values of the z statistic suggests an increasing and decreasing trend respectively while z 0 occurs when there is no detectable trend this approach has been used for distinct abiotic variables and various aquatic communities abonyi et al 2018 floury et al 2013 guo et al 2018 wentzky et al 2018 a sequential algorithm proposed by rodionov 2004 was used to identify regime shifts in the time series of different abiotic factors e g tp tn sd and tli and the phytoplankton community as indicated by nmds axis1 chla or the biotic indices sr sh and cr regime shifts are large abrupt persistent changes in the structure and function of a system such as a shift in the dominant phyla making up the phytoplankton community however in reality we need a quantitative value to detect it thus we used a sequential algorithm which used a pre whitening procedure to remove the red noise component from time series data rodionov 2006 regime shifts were identified using a student s t test and regime shift index rsi rodionov 2004 this technique has been extensively applied to time series analysis of a range of variables e g climate hydrology variables e g serinaldi and kilsby 2015 two parameters cut off length and probability level were set as 10 and 0 1 i e default setup respectively in comparison with other regime shift detection tools this method has the advantage of detecting an ecological regime shift earlier and then monitors how its magnitude changes over time andersen et al 2009 huang et al 2019 this advantage is mainly due to the use of exploratory analysis that does not require an a priori hypothesis on the timing of regime shifts rodionov 2004 phytoplankton sampling had been undertaken from between 15 and 19 years starting in 1991 during this time specific interventions were implemented in several of the lakes while other lakes had no such interventions this long term dataset thus represented an ideal opportunity to assess the relative effect of the lake interventions using the baci before after and control impact approach underwood 1992 for this lakes were assigned to either control no intervention or impact intervention applied irrespective of its type and to a time either before the intervention or after it must be emphasized that the control lakes still often had significant land use pressure within their catchment that may have continued to cause water quality degradation but no management interventions were implemented any temporal changes to abiotic or biotic factors in these catchments were thus due to a combination of climatic and human activities without the benefit of lake interventions for control lakes the after terms was taken as the year where the earliest interventions were implemented in any of the other lakes unlike the control lakes any observed temporal changes in the impact lakes represents changes due to climatic effects as well as human activities including any effects of lake interventions two way anova was used to evaluate the effect of both location i e control and impact and date i e before and after as well as their interactions on response variables using aov function in r multiple linear regression models mlr function lm in r were used to explore the combined effects of abiotic factors water quality climate lake physiographic features and dominant catchment land use on biotic factors i e mds1 tr sh cr and chla prior to mlrs the collinearity effects among all predictors were identified by inspecting the variance inflation factors vifs using a stepwise procedure until all predictors of vif s were 5 this was done using the vifstep function in the r package usdm naimi et al 2014 based on minimizing the corrected akaike information criterion aicc we performed a model simplification with the stepaicc function in r package mass venables and ripley 2002 to select the best abiotic predictors for the five biotic indices all abiotic variables and biotic indices were transformed using the z score before mlr analyses so that the standardized coefficients were comparable in magnitude within and between models schielzeth 2010 all the data analyses and graphics were performed in the r software r version 3 5 3 r core team 2021 3 results the lake morphological characteristics varied considerably among the 11 lakes table 1 for example maximum depths ranged from 13 5 m lake rotoehu to 125 m lake rotomahana with an average and median value of 59 3 and 44 8 m respectively mean depths ranged from 7 m lake rerewhakaaitu to 60 m lake rotomahana lake surface area and lake catchment areas varied greatly 0 3 80 8 and 3 9 508 0 km2 respectively length of shoreline averaged 23 39 km ranging from 2 1 km lake okaro to 51 59 km lake rotoiti however average lake elevation was 340 m with only a relatively small range of 279 to 435 m calculated mean tli values derived from concentrations of tp tn sd and chla ranged from 2 4 the oligotrophic lake rotoma to 5 4 the hypertrophic lake okaro for the study period 1990 2017 table 3 these five factors showed strong significant correlations among each other appendix s3 p 0 001 lakes okataina rotoma tarawera and tikitapu had tlis 3 which placed them in the oligotrophic category burns et al 2009 1999 while lakes okaro rotoehu and rotorua had tlis 4 which placed them in the eutrophic to hypertrophic category lakes okareka rerewhakaaitu rotoiti and rotomahana were mesotrophic with tlis between 3 and 4 table 3 the lakes had two predominant mixing regimes monomictic e g rotoma tarawera okaro and polymictic e g rerewhakaaitu rotohu and rotorua table 1 climate indices also demonstrated a large range during the 23 years for instance average maximum monthly temperature av tmax ranged from 19 46 to 21 70 c while the maximum monthly rainfall in each year max rain varied from 131 40 to 423 80 mm appendix s8 3 1 environmental trends over the study period the long term trends of environmental and biotic variables i e chla sd tp tn and tli were lake dependent table 4 fig 2 except for three lakes rerewhakaaitu rotomahana and tikitapu chla demonstrated decreasing trends although these were non significant for sd two lakes okareka and tikitapu showed a declining but not significant trend while the other lakes demonstrated increasing trends which were significant p 0 001 at lakes okaro and rotoiti declining trends of tn were found at all lakes although these trends were significant in only six lakes conversely concentrations of tp showed increasing trends except for 3 lakes okaro rotoehu and rotorua a significant increase was detected for tp at lakes okareka okataina rerewhakaaitu rotoma rotomahana and tarawera while a significant decrease was found at lakes okaro and rotorua mk trend test p 0 001 this decrease in these latter two lakes may reflect the continuous alum dosing interventions of their inflowing streams 0 22 mg al l 1 and 2 62 µg al l 1 respectively although no such reductions were observed in either lake rotoehu where the inflowing stream was continuously dosed with 6 72 µg al l 1 tempero 2015 or in lake rotoiti which was subject to alum dosing directly into the lake when cyanobacterial blooms occurred calculated tlis of three lakes okaro rotoiti and rotorua with interventions showed a significant decreasing trend mk trend test p 0 05 indicating a water quality improvement which was the anticipated result of interventions this contrasts with the tlis of two lakes rotomahana and tarawera without interventions which significantly increased during the study period table 4 fig 2 suggesting degrading water quality in general lake interventions appeared to have improved the abiotic conditions of at least some of the water quality parameters in the lakes with interventions with the exception of lake rotoehu which showed no improvements for example tn and tp significantly declined in 4 and 2 lakes with interventions respectively while sd increased in 2 lakes in contrast tn declined in only 2 of the control lakes while tp increased in 4 of the 5 control lakes table 4 two way anova showed significant treatment control impact effects p 0 001 on all water quality variables while date before after effects were not significant table 4 the interaction between location and date was significant on only tp f 4 35 p 0 05 this implied that the behavior of all abiotic variables but tp was broadly similar between control and treatment lakes the significant interaction term for tp most likely reflected the consistent increases of tp in 4 of the 5 control lakes compared to the inconsistent responses in treatment lakes table 2 here tp increased in okareka where phosloc has been applied and rotoma where land use interventions have been applied and declined in okaro and rotorua both of which have had alum dosing 3 2 phytoplankton community trends over the study period a total of 31 phytoplankton genera were identified in 24 families from 16 orders representing six phyla the most abundant taxa encountered were the diatoms ochrophyta fragilaria aulacoseira and cyclotella the cyanobacteria anabaena and microcystis and the charophyte staurastrum all of which had a relative abundance of more than 5 the most widespread taxa found in more than two thirds of the samples included the chlorophyta oocystis the charophyta closterium and staurastrum the cryptophyta cryptomonas the cyanobacteria anabaena and the diatoms aulacoseira and fragilaria the results of the mk trend test of the phytoplankton community indicated by mds1 sh tr and cr table 5 were lake dependent significant positive trends in cr were observed in one control lake tarawera and 2 impact lakes rotoiti and rotoma table 5 fig 3 but no significant trends were detected in the other lakes significant trends in sh diversity were evident in two impact lakes but showed contrasting trends declining in lake okareka but increasing in lake rotoiti table 5 fig 4 no significant trends p 0 05 in sh were detected in any of the rest 9 lakes correlations of nmds scores showed significant positive correlations with nmds scores for cyanobacteria 0 709 and euglenoids 0 462 while a significant negative correlation was found for charophyta 0 520 nmds scores increased significantly in four of both the control and impact lakes table 5 suggesting an increased relative abundance of cyanobacteria or euglenoids in these lakes indeterminant trends to nmds scores were found in the two of the other impact lakes okaro rotorua and in a control lake tikitapu appendix s6 this trend analysis showed that apart from what appeared to be consistent changes in community composition in terms of increasing nmds scores the other biotic metrics displayed fewer consistent changes than the water quality metrics two way anova indicated that there were significant location and date effects on cr tr and mds1 p 0 001 for example lakes okaro rotoehu and rotoiti had the highest nmds scores and highest crs while lakes rotomahana and tikitapu had the lowest nmds scores and crs similar patterns were also found with changes in nmds and cr between samples collect before and after interventions for instance nmds scores were higher in 5 treatment lakes after interventions than before and in three control lakes there were significant interaction effects between location and date only for cr and nmds scores table 5 overall trends in biotic metrics in the 11 lakes appeared more similar between lakes than the abiotic conditions with little differences in the number of either control or impact lakes showing trends for example we observed increases in both nmds scores and cr in both control and impact lakes although the impact lakes appeared to change more 3 3 regime shifts of tli and community indices regime shift analysis indicated that annual tlis of most lakes showed multiple shifts e g lakes okareka 5 rerewhakaaitu 4 rotoehu 5 and rotorua 3 fig 2 generally the control lakes without interventions had fewer regime shifts for the tli than those impact lakes mean regime shifts 2 2 vs 3 0 in comparison phytoplankton indices including tr cr sh mds1 and chla showed fewer shifts regardless of lake interventions e g cr and sh of control and impacted lakes are 0 vs 0 83 and 0 6 vs 0 33 respectively fig 3 fig 4 appendix s5 s6 and s7 these fewer regime shifts for the biotic indices suggests some form of biotic resilience to environmental changes 3 4 driving forces for phytoplankton community trends to explore the main driving forces of phytoplankton community indices we conducted mlrs to examine the potential correlations between the five biotic factors i e mds1 tr sh cr and chla and the measured abiotic factors fig 5 both climate e g av tmin av wind mean max wind mean lake morphological characteristics e g shore dev vol total anthropogenic factors e g soil erosion and water chemistry e g tn were identified as important drivers to the five biotic indices tn had always strong positive relationship with these five indices av sun had significant positive relationships with mds1 tr and cr whereas max wind mean i e the average of the maximum monthly wind speed in each year had negative correlations with sh and tr shore dev was identified as important driver for sh tr and chla while population density i e population den was positively correlated to mds1 and tr fig 5 4 discussion our results clearly showed that long term abiotic factors e g tli in the 11 rotorua te arawa lakes showed diverse trends e g increase decrease and no change and displayed more regime shifts in impact lakes than control lakes this finding broadly supported at least part of our first hypothesis that abiotic factors changed more in lakes with interventions than without however despite these shifts in abiotic factors fewer changes were observed in biotic factors even in the impact lakes suggesting a degree of resistance of the phytoplankton community to interventions interventions were implemented in response to public and community concern for the water quality status of the rotorua te arawa lakes e g scholes and mcintosh 2010 it was expected that interventions would have reduced nutrient inputs into the lakes where these were applied although some time lag was expected between implementation and being able to detect the results of the 6 lakes where interventions were used expected water quality improvements occurred at 4 lakes for tn and three lakes for tli tp and sd also improved at 2 control lakes although somewhat paradoxically tp also increased at 2 lakes between 1991 and 2013 of interest was the finding that the control lakes often displayed opposite trends to the impact lakes with increases in tli at 2 lakes and increases in tp at four these changes in water quality parameters are broadly consistent with the expected results of the interventions at least between the years covered in this analysis 1991 2013 potential changes in lake water quality conditions in control lakes without interventions most likely reflects inherent nutrient input dynamics in these catchments such dynamics could include normal farming practices lakes rerewhakaaitu and rotomahana or unexpected and increased loss of topsoil in lakes dominated by native forest okataina from erosion due to overgrazing by introduced mammals mainly wallaby despite the clear evidence of the benefit of interventions on abiotic factors there was less evidence that phytoplankton communities were changing over time in response to lake interventions although a number of discrete regime shifts were detected the number of regime shifts was much lower than observed for the abiotic factors these observations gave tentative support to our second hypothesis in demonstrating a potential time lag between changes to abiotic conditions and resultant shifts in phytoplankton community composition we also found that 8 of the 11 lakes displayed a significant increase to their nmds scores indicating a slow shift in the communities to ones dominated by cyanobacteria and euglenoids and a potential reduction in chlorophyta the fact that these changes appeared to occur in all lakes irrespective of whether they were subject to interventions may reflect potential over arching climatic effects associated with climate change although we assumed that climatic conditions were likely to have been relatively constant across all 11 lakes we concede that effects of climatic variables on both water quality and phytoplankton communities were likely to differ between larger deeper lakes than smaller shallower lakes especially given the effect of wind in affecting mixing layers deng et al 2016 the mlrs identified the importance of the average minimum temperature average of the mean monthly wind speed and average of the monthly solar radiation for many of the biotic indices and these climatic factors could affect phytoplankton communities through direct processes temperature or indirect processes via increased lake mixing that could mobilise bed sediments more and consequently increase nutrient concentrations furthermore windy conditions may also increase the survivability of some cyanobacteria as these are often more shade tolerant and can grow even in highly turbid constantly mixed environments reynolds et al 2002 besides suspension of organic matters in water as a result of wind and turbulence can greatly promote euglenoids due to its diverse physiological processes of such as movement photosynthesis and orientation kottuparambil 2022 therefore such warmer nutrient rich conditions may consequently have favoured cyanobacteria and euglenoids in these lakes the importance of climate change in enhancing cyanobacterial dominance in lake phytoplankton was also observed in long term monitoring data from lake pyhäjärvi in finland where climate variables were positively correlated to increases in cyanobacteria deng et al 2016 furthermore a 22 year study by rolighed et al 2016 in a shallow eutrophic danish lake showed that the proportion of cyanobacteria increased rolighed et al 2016 with a warming climate they found that in a 6 c warming scenario a nutrient load reduction of as much as 60 would be required to achieve summer chla levels similar to those of the baseline scenario with present temperatures jeppesen et al 2017 rolighed et al 2016 these results may have significant implications for the long term benefits of the mitigation measures currently being used in the rotorua te arawa lakes while these are focused primarily on attaining desired tli levels and are thus water quality focused one of the main drivers for the need to reduce nutrient loadings was driven by the desire to reduce cyanobacterial blooms scholes and mcintosh 2010 it may be that despite the observed reductions in nutrients such as tn increases in tp temperature and wind may in fact lead to an unexpected increase in cyanobacterial blooms this may mean that any short term improvements to water quality variables such as the tli might be confounded by large scale environmental changes associated with climate change which may somewhat dampen any potential reduction in the frequency and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in the future another interesting finding in our study was that abiotic factors displayed more regime shifts than biotic factors which also appeared to display a time lag to changes in abiotic factors changes in community structure and composition are considered to integrate all the potential ecological responses to environmental changes floury et al 2013 hughes 2000 such links between abiotic and biotic factors are one reason why phytoplankton communities change as resource availability and disturbances change wentzky et al 2018 however there are situations where such tight links are not observed for example jeppesen et al 2015 found that 25 of their studied lakes did not show an expected reduction in phytoplankton biomass following a reduction in nutrients another complicating factor is that mechanisms such as mixotrophy allow bacterially derived phosphorus to be available for phytoplankton which consequently allows phytoplankton to adapt to lower nutrient levels without a loss of total biomass wentzky et al 2018 all these findings reflect a relatively large degree of resilience to phytoplankton community against changes in water quality such resilience may have critical implications for ongoing restoration measures in lake ecosystems our third hypothesis was that responses of abiotic and biotic variables would vary among the different lakes due to lake specific morphological and climatic characteristics the mlrs supported this hypothesis and showed that phytoplankton community indices were related to lake morphological characteristics such as lake volume and catchment conditions shore development and plantation forest fig 5 this result mirrors those of paul et al 2012 who showed that catchment land use was a strong predictor in lake phytoplankton composition with cyanobacteria being positively correlated with the amount of developed land particularly pasture and trophic state ryan et al 2006 also found that lake trophic state and mixing regime were important predictors of phytoplankton composition in a study of 40 lakes in new zealand s north island our results suggested that long term trends in biotic factors and regime shifts were also highly lake dependent this observation is consistent with many previous studies for example ecosystem size indicated by lake volume was not only a determinant of phytoplankton diversity but was also shown to mediate the influence of anthropogenic effects on biodiversity baho et al 2017 lake morphological characteristics such as depth also affected in lake biogeochemical processes which in turn can underpin the relative roles and fates of nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes through sediment release dynamics qin et al 2020 the implication of these findings is that developing lake specific best management practices bmps are of great importance and necessity before embarking on any management plan aimed at improving lake conditions such lake specific bmps have been used in the rotorua te arawa lakes such as the construction of the diversion channel to divert nutrient rich water from lake rotorua from entering lake rotoiti scholes and mcintosh 2010 this allows for a more efficient use of time and often limited financial resources lake managers should thus recognize that there is no one size fits all in lake management even for adjacent lakes as the case in the present study as each lake is unique what works on one lake may not be effective in another lake this was one reason why bmps may have had the desired effect in reducing tp in some lakes lakes okaro and rotoma but not in other lakes lakes okareka and rotoiti 5 conclusions our findings highlighted the importance of long term monitoring data for evaluating environmental change induced ecological shifts in lakes the long term variations of lake conditions in the context of abiotic and biotic factors varied among the lakes and demonstrated diverse trends a profound understanding of the resilience and mechanisms of phytoplankton community to environmental stressors upon the species traits and ecosystem functions should be addressed in future studies since this is essential for restoration and management strategies in addition given the fact that long term trends and regime shifts of phytoplankton assemblage were highly lake dependent and affected by climate indices development of lake specific restoration and protection strategies should be a priority in sustaining lake ecosystems under future global changes data availability data will be made available on request declaration of competing
