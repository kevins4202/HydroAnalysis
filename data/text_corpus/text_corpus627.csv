3135,the impact of wildfire on water availability is a critical issue in the western united states because actual evapotranspiration eta constitutes the largest loss in the terrestrial water budget it has been suggested that fire induced eta reduction is a primary driver of elevated post fire discharge ten gaged watersheds with burns exceeding 5 of their total contributing drainage area were selected from california oregon montana utah new mexico and colorado continuous daily stream gage data were compiled and 30 meter eta estimates were calculated with the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model fire induced eta shifts were quantified with statistical tests that compared pre and post fire monthly eta in burned and unburned pixels the dampening effect of scale was also evaluated by repeating tests on all pixels from the entire basin as streamflow data are point measurements that aggregate a large spatial area additional statistical methods were required to isolate the effect of fire from climate on baseflow and runoff key findings include a significant fire induced eta reductions were only distinguishable in basin scale monthly datasets when at least 73 of the basin burned b the effect of wildfire disturbance on streamflow magnitude was seasonably variable c streamflow was modified in basins with as little as 6 burned drainage area however shifts only persisted beyond the fifth post fire year where more than three quarters of the basin was fire impacted and d surplus water from eta reduction was sufficient to account for boosted fire induced streamflow where fire induced streamflow increases were not significantly correlated with eta anomaly other fire impacted landscape processes may have contributed to modified runoff generation and routing where fire reduced eta but streamflow shifts were not detected compensatory eta pathways may have consumed the excess water before it reached the gage findings suggest that water providers with small source water collection areas have higher relative risk for fire induced hydromodification than providers with larger or more diversified supply portfolios results also illustrate the

item 628e58f9d34ef70cdba3feda 1 introduction severe and erratic wildfire behavior has become more common since at least the mid 1980 s and is causing concern in the western united states bladon et al 2014 chow et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 martin 2016 murphy et al 2018 substantial effort is being spent to identify short and long term fire wildfire trends crawford et al 2015 parks and abatzoglou 2020 fire s role in landscape ecology david et al 2018 lake et al 2017 and geomorphology keller et al 2019 shakesby and doerr 2006 and the risks posed by wildfire to built and natural environments martin et al 2016 despite progress in identifying and understanding critical processes the location specific effects of wildfire related forest disturbance on downstream water supplies remain unclear additional uncertainty is introduced by the confounding pressures of climate aridification overpeck and udall 2020 and increasing climate variability van der wiel and bintanja 2021 zhuang et al 2021 as they often co occur with wildfire activity in forested watersheds reports of increased flooding hillslope erosion debris flows landslides reservoir sedimentation and water quality degradation following wildfire are common in the american west and elsewhere burke et al 2013 emelko et al 2016 moody and martin 2009 nunes et al 2018 nyman et al 2020 rust et al 2018 santi and morandi 2013 saxe et al 2018 concurrently the mechanistic linkage between actual evapotranspiration eta and streamflow has been demonstrated goeking and tarboton 2020 goulden and bales 2014 kirchner et al 2020 kirchner and allen 2020 suggesting a physical connection between eta and the aforementioned fire exacerbated hydrogeomorphic hazards such a linkage would be sensible as a eta is the most sensitive hydrologic component to vegetation changes and b it is often the largest loss in terrestrial water budgets making it a principal arbiter of precipitation partitioning neary et al 2005 however the direction and magnitude of post fire eta and streamflow shifts are often variable especially where topographic climatic and ecologic gradients are steep blount et al 2020 collar et al 2021 goeking and tarboton 2020 kinoshita and hogue 2015 ma et al 2020 saxe et al 2018 eta is a spatially and temporally varying process because the systems that control it are themselves fluctuating over space and time at a single location the eta rate may be a function of surface energy fluxes and states e g net radiation sensible and latent heat exchange reflective properties of a body surface meteorology e g precipitation wind speed relative humidity surface aerodynamic skin temperature biophysical controls e g soil moisture holding capacity stomatal conductance rooting structure aerodynamic resistance of the plant canopy and landscape characteristics e g topography additional sources of roughness chang 2012 lettenmaier et al 2015 maidment 1993 neary et al 2005 the timescales at which the states or rates of eta s drivers range are considerable precipitation for example has variable intensity during a single storm event as well as in accordance with multi year cycles e g decadal oscillations longer term trends e g anthropogenic climate change and hydroclimatic processes e g glaciation beyene et al 2021 eskridge et al 1997 xu et al 2014 even at the same location the eta flux can be energy or water limited depending on seasons and over interannual timescales budyko 1974 ryu et al 2008 xu et al 2014 as an added layer of complexity many of the variables that control eta rates are vulnerable to abrupt modification from acute landscape disturbance jin et al 2012 sexstone et al 2018 slinski et al 2016 downstream quantifying the effect of landscape disturbance on streamflow is challenging as prevailing climate precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration etp or pet can drive a majority of observed streamflow variability in undeveloped watersheds bart et al 2016 bart and tague 2017 jaramillo and destouni 2014 this is especially the case where the percentage of disturbed contributing drainage area is relatively small because the explanatory power of the overarching climate signal can easily mask or exaggerate the apparent effects of the disturbance at the gage hallema et al 2018 readily available remotely sensed data and reanalysis products bring this challenge to the forefront because they enable before after control impact evaluations to be conducted via observation of the same location through time where a paired reference watershed approach may have been used otherwise conner et al 2016 downes et al 2002 eberhardt 1976 the need to identify and monitor a reference basin is removed as pre fire observations from the disturbed area can be used as a control however climate signals can no longer be accounted for by comparing the disturbed and reference basins beyene et al 2021 goulden and bales 2014 hallema et al 2017 numerous studies have proposed statistical and process based methods for separating the effects of landscape drivers from climate drivers on catchment runoff and baseflow bart and tague 2017 beyene et al 2021 cong et al 2009 hallema et al 2018 kurzweil et al 2021 wine et al 2018 xu et al 2014 thus providing an analytical framework for quantifying linked fire effects on eta and streamflow most have reported results at the annual timestep natural resource managers need to understand the scale s at which fire induced hydrologic shifts become meaningful for source water hydrology the current study seeks to address that need by evaluating statistical linkages between fire induced eta modification and streamflow at varying spatiotemporal scales we examine two primary research questions a how does wildfire modify monthly eta baseflow and runoff at basins in the western united states and b to what degree are fire induced streamflow shifts explained by the eta shifts previously proposed procedures for separating the effects of landscape from climate drivers are implemented for annual time series evaluation and improved upon for sub annual time series evaluation 2 methods 2 1 overview monthly 30 meter m eta data were calculated at ten burned basins in the western united states with the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay 2018 senay et al 2013 daily streamflow data and static basin attributes were acquired at basin scale resolution additional meteorologic and landscape variables were extracted at 30 m pixel scale resolution fire induced eta shifts were quantified with statistical tests that compared pre and post fire monthly and yearly eta in burned and unburned pixels timing of significant eta shifts were also identified with change point detection tests and compared to fire event dates because pixel scale data were not available for streamflow additional statistical methods were used to disentangle the effect of fire from climate on post fire baseflow and runoff at both monthly and annual time steps relationships between fire induced streamflow shifts eta and precipitation anomalies annual water demand and basin characteristics were explored a conceptual overview of the study s input data data processing steps statistical tests applied statistical models constructed and results is provided in fig 1 2 2 basin selection study basins were selected using the following criteria a the basin was in the western united states west of the 100th meridian b more than 5 of the basin was burned by a wildfire in a single water year october 1 through september 30 according to the monitoring trends in burn severity mtbs dataset eidenshink et al 2007 c no additional burns comprising more than 2 of the basin s total drainage area occurred in the ten years before or after the water year of interest d daily united states geological survey usgs stream gage data were available at the basin outlet for the entire study period one exception made and e the basin did not contain manmade hydraulic control structures capable of modifying the timing rate and or volume of streamflow at the gage only eleven basins were identified in the western united states that met all five study criteria ten of them were included in the current study figs 2a and 2b table 1 while southern california s devil canyon was excluded due to its inclusion in a similar study kinoshita and hogue 2015 the other basin studied in kinoshita and hogue 2015 city creek was excluded from the current study because the majority of it burned twice in six years 2003 old fire 1997 hemlock fire the authors acknowledge that the relatively small number of study basins included in the current study limits the reach and applicability of our results to the entire western united states in general watershed boundaries were delineated in streamstats https www usgs gov mission areas water resources science streamstats streamflow statistics and spatial analysis tools burn perimeters were obtained from mtbs and clipped to basin extents where necessary the percentage of burned contributing drainage area was calculated in arcpro version 2 9 and ranged from 6 to 88 in all but one watershed only one burn event defined by mtbs event id was responsible for the total burned area in the basin during the water year of interest the exception occurred in oregon s south umpqua river basin during water year 2002 where five mtbs mapped fires occurred to comprise 23 of the basin s total drainage area 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 ssebop evapotranspiration monthly 30 m eta was

with ts et fractions using pre defined seasonally dynamic boundary conditions unique to each pixel for cold wet and hot dry reference points bastiaanssen et al 1998 senay 2018 the ssebop model was

utah s porcupine fire basin https waterdata usgs gov nwis uv site no 09182400 the lyne hollick digital recursive filter was applied to separate baseflow from daily mean streamflow with the hydrostats r package and the alpha filtering parameter set to the default 0 975 value bond 2021 ladson et al 2013 runoff was calculated as the residual of the native daily mean flow rate and the calculated mean daily baseflow rate generated in the previous step the daily baseflow and runoff time series were converted from flow rates feet3 second cfs to depths millimeters mm using the drainage area of each basin and aggregated to monthly and yearly totals 2 3 3 additional meteorologic and landscape variables additional pixel scale meteorologic and landscape variables were extracted at each study basin

appendix a 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 quantifying the effect of fire on eta and streamflow since pixel scale eta flux was estimable from remotely sensed observations the effect of fire could be distinguished from climate in the eta data by running separate statistical tests on burned and unburned pixels from the same basin and comparing results for basins that experienced burns in only a portion of their drainage area the dampening effect of scale in terms of both overall basin size and the muting effect of unburned contributing drainage area on basin scale data summaries was also evaluated by repeating the same statistical tests on all pixels from the entire basin conversely stream gage data were only available at main basin outlets as there were no nested monitoring stations in upgradient subbasins thus the comparison procedures used to parse the effects of fire from climate and scale in eta data were not applicable to avoid the need for comparative analyses of streamflow data from nearby control unburned basins two additional analyses were conducted on the streamflow time series that involved the removal of the climate signal from the streamflow record altogether fig 1 2 4 1 1 eta at each basin monthly eta data were separated into groups of burned pixels unburned pixels and all pixels in the entire basin and the monthly average of each group was calculated mann kendall tests were applied with the kendall r package mcleod 2011 to test for the presence of underlying trends in the eta of the unburned pixels and in the climate variables following attempts were made to make the data stationary i e mean variance and autocorrelation structure are time invariant hyndman and athanasopoulos 2018 milly et al 2008 shumway and stoffer 2016 data were log transformed to stabilize fluctuations in variance and a seasonal first difference was taken to remove seasonal patterns i e deseason the data annual and monthly fluxes provided in si figure a and si figure b example of deseasoning procedure provided in si figure c to determine if outputs from the deseasoning procedure were seasonally stationary autocorrelation plots acfs were visually inspected and augmented dickey fuller tests adf were applied with the base cran tseries r package trapletti et al 2021 the adf is a unit root test where a unit root is a non stationary feature of a stochastic process that can interfere with the ability to make statistical inferences from a time series model inability to reject the null hypothesis p α α 0 05 indicated the series remained seasonally non stationary presence of a unit root shumway and stoffer 2016 the deseasoned eta data were indexed by period ten year pre fire period post fire years one through five and post fire years six through ten non parametric wilcoxon rank sum tests were run on each of the eta groups burned pixels unburned pixels all pixels to identify statistically significant shifts in either of the post fire periods relative to the pre fire period α 0 05 non parametric pettitt s change point detection tests were also applied to each time series with the trend r package pohlert 2020 to independently check the timing of major behavioral shifts dates of significant shifts α 0 05 were compared to fire event dates pettitt s based on mann whitney two sample rank based tests detects a single change at an unknown point in time it is among the most widely used change point detection methods in hydroclimatological studies mallakpour and villarini 2016 zhou et al 2019 results for each pixel group burned unburned all pixels were compared at each basin 2 4 1 2 streamflow the same procedures and tests applied to the eta data were applied to climate unadjusted monthly meteorologic precipitation air temperature etp spi and streamflow baseflow runoff data for continuity center of volume analysis was also conducted on the raw streamflow data daily mean discharge depth to test for post fire shifts in streamflow timing for each water year the flowscreen r package dierauer and whitfield 2019 was used to identify the calendar day that 25 50 and 75 of the total annual streamflow volume occurred pre and post fire results were compared with wilcoxon rank sum tests α 0 05 in addition fire induced shifts in monthly and annual climate adjusted baseflow and runoff data were quantified regression models were fit to annual meteorologic and discharge data and model residuals in the pre and post fire periods were compared separately monthly data were evaluated by fitting lagged linear regression models to monthly meteorologic and discharge data with a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average s arima modeled error term model residuals in the pre and post fire periods were again compared 3 multivariate regressions on annual time series linear regression models were constructed to estimate annual pre fire baseflow and runoff from meteorological predictor variables total annual precipitation maximum annual daily air temperature total annual etp mean annual spi ranking to select the most robust model regressions for all possible combinations of the four predictor variables were fitted to each response variable baseflow runoff to ensure models made physical sense any model with a negative precipitation regression coefficient was removed the model with the lowest cumulative akaike information criteria aic and bayesian information criteria bic score was selected and model validity and accuracy were recorded with model adjusted r2 because each annual regression model was constructed with relatively few data points model residuals for the training data period pre fire were visually inspected to determine if linear regression modeling assumptions were met including with residuals vs fitted plots for checking linear relationship assumptions normal q q plots for examining the distribution of residuals scale location plots for checking the homogeneity of variance of the residuals homoscedasticity and residuals vs leverage plots for identifying extreme values that may be influencing regression results si figure e si figure f sthda 2018 no model was constructed for baseflow at porcupine ranch because no statistically significant regression model was rendered during the model selection process linear annual ordinary least squares regression models were of the general form 1 y a r β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n e where y ax denotes the predicted response variable annual baseflow or runoff β are regression coefficients x are input features predictor variables and e are model residuals models were then applied to the entire pre and post fire baseflow and runoff datasets assuming the influence of weather was now removed from each model s residuals the final output e was considered to represent the portion of the streamflow signal that land disturbance was accountable for comparisons of the residuals in the pre and post fire periods were made with wilcoxon rank sum tests when a wilcoxon rank sum test indicated a significant difference in post fire residuals the authors ensured that the magnitude of the post fire residual exceeded the magnitude of the predictive model s rmse 4 multivariate lagged regressions on monthly time series a similar procedure was used to construct regressions on monthly data same predictor and response variables to account for seasonal lag between meteorologic predictors and discharge lagged predictor variables were allowed inclusion in the monthly regression models this decision was based on the high percentage of precipitation that falls as snow in numerous study basins table 1 and the obvious lag between when the majority of precipitation falls and peak runoff occurs in most study basins si figure d when a predictor variable was significantly correlated with a response variable at multiple lag steps each lagged version of the predictor was evaluated during the model selection procedure s arimas were then fit to the residuals of the lagged linear regression models to remove the explanatory power of any remaining internal autocorrelation box and jenkins 1976 no models were constructed for baseflow or runoff at unnamed because no statistically significant regression models were rendered during the linear model selection process lagged linear monthly regression models were of the general form 2 y

conceptual understanding si figure g assuming the influence of weather and any remaining internal autocorrelation was now removed from each model s residuals the final output e was considered to represent the portion of the streamflow signal that land disturbance was accountable for to simplify interpretation baseflow and runoff residuals were grouped by season winter december january february spring march april may summer june july august fall september october november pre and post fire comparisons were made with wilcoxon rank sum tests when a wilcoxon rank sum test indicated a significant difference in post fire residuals the authors ensured that the magnitude of the post fire residual exceeded the magnitude of the predictive model s rmse 4 0 1 linking fire attributed streamflow shifts to eta residuals from the annual linear regression models were used to explore statistical relationships between fire induced streamflow shift and eta first precipitation and eta anomalies were calculated for precipitation the mean of the total annual precipitation for the entire 21 year study period was subtracted from each year for eta the mean of the total annual eta in the unburned pixels was subtracted from the mean yearly eta depth of all the pixels in the basin to normalize the baseflow and runoff residuals residual anomalies were also calculated by subtracting the mean of the pre fire period residual from the 21 year residual time series baseflow and quickflow residuals were then summed to determine the magnitude of the total landscape driven streamflow each year pearson s correlations between annual precipitation eta and streamflow residual anomalies were calculated at each basin the anomaly with the stronger correlation was considered the dominant driver of the landscape driven baseflow or streamflow shift at a glance qualitative volume comparisons were also made by plotting the total mean annual fire induced streamflow with the total mean annual precipitation and eta anomalies for each of the five year post fire periods 4 0 2 relationships between basin characteristics and fire attributed streamflow shifts the annual baseflow and runoff residuals were also used to explore statistical relationships between fire induced streamflow shifts and various basin characteristics this was the only analysis that considered data from all ten of the study basins together to normalize data across basins the percent difference in the mean post fire baseflow and runoff residuals in the first five post fire years was calculated for each basin data from post fire years six through ten were excluded under the assumption that watershed rehabilitation or recovery would be actively underway by the sixth post fire year pearson s correlation was calculated between the basin attributes e g the percent of each basin burned percent of basin burned at high severity total drainage area and others and the fire induced streamflow

in pet ponil complex three in spi cannon ponil complex waterfall and two in the eta of the unburned pixels unnamed waterfall according to mann kendal trend tests si table a however every time series had visually obvious seasonal patterns si figure b si figure c and failed adf tests p α where α 0 05 when adf tests were run on raw datasets prior to the deseasoning procedure adf tests indicated that a deseasoning procedure rendered all datasets stationary si table b the burned pixel and aggregate basin scale eta baseflow and runoff datasets were similarly deseasoned and only the deseasoned baseflow data at cannon ponil complex porcupine ranch and unnamed basins failed the adf stationarity tests fig 2a and 2b precipitation during the first five post fire years was only significantly different lower from the pre fire period at waterfall according to wilcoxon rank sum tests fig 3 however eta was significantly reduced within most burn scars burned pixels in the first five post fire years percent annual reductions between approximately ten to 50 and in a smaller fraction of burn scars during post fire years six through ten likely due to vegetation recovery the unnamed fire was the only basin to experience no significant change in post fire eta at the burned pixels this was also the only fire with grassland herbaceous cover as its dominant pre fire vegetation type table 1 post fire eta residuals eta of burned and unburned pixels differenced were significantly reduced in every basin during both post fire periods except at unnamed differencing was not performed for chippy mill due to its relatively small number of unburned pixels fig 3c fig 4 statistically significant post fire shifts also occurred in baseflow and runoff at numerous basins fig 5 however the shifts could not be specifically attributed to fire because the influence of climate could not be removed from the gage data according to the center of volume analysis the only basin to experience a significant shift in streamflow timing was chippy thomas 25 of the annual total streamflow volume occurred 21 days later in the first post fire period it is not clear whether the shift was caused by land disturbance or post fire weather as the center of volume analysis was conducted on climate unadjusted data no shifts were detected p α in the climate variables si table c or the eta of the unburned pixels fig 3b within six months of a fire origin date according to pettitt s change point detection tests conversely pettitt s identified significant shifts in the eta of the burned pixels within two months of fire origin dates in four of the ten basins chippy thomas chippy mill porcupine ranch santiago and within five months of fire origin dates for three additional basins cannon jungle waterfall significant shifts occurred in the eta residuals of those same seven basins within two months of fire origin dates fig 3c si table c comparison of the burned pixel and all pixel eta pettitt s results provides insight into the effect of scale significant shifts in the eta of all basin pixels were only identified within two months of fire origin dates at the two basins with the highest percentages of burned drainage area chippy mill 88 santiago 73 fig 3b chippy mill was the only basin to experience significant baseflow and runoff shifts during the water year following the fire fig 5 5 2 fire induced streamflow shifts 5 2 1 annual shifts based on comparisons of pre and post fire residuals from the annual regression models statistically significant fire induced increases in baseflow were identified at chippy mill 68 increase from pre fire annual baseflow or approximately 30 mm year and unnamed 53 increase approximately 5 mm year fig 6 a during the first five post fire years detailed model metrics provided in si table d of the three basins with statistically significant increases in baseflow during post fire years one through five significant increases only persisted into post fire years six through ten at chippy mill fig 6b statistically significant immediate increases in annual runoff were identified at cannon 8 increase approximately 25 mm year and chippy mill 99 increase approximately 95 mm year that increase only persisted at chippy mill 92 increase during the second post fire period fig 6b during the first five post fire years wildfire increased average annual flow by 6 cannon 43 at chippy mill 2 at jungle 23 at ponil complex and 8 at waterfall red text in fig 6 wildfire decreased flows by 1 at boulder 87 at santiago and 9 at unnamed these changes are likely within the range of pre fire interannual streamflow variability where comparisons of pre and post fire model residuals were insignificant absence of a yellow dot in fig 6 5 2 2 seasonal shifts analysis of annual hydrologic data did not capture the most dramatic and seasonally acute fire induced streamflow shifts nearly every basin experienced increased mean and median baseflow and runoff in some seasons and decreases in others fig 7 detailed model metrics provided in si table e we observe that the seasonal timing of fire induced baseflow increases and decreases did not have a consistent temporal relationship with seasonal precipitation across basins for example at chippy mill and cannon which receive 43 and 72 of their annual average precipitation as snow respectively table 1 fire increased baseflow during wet months mean monthly hydrologic fluxes provided in si figure d the opposite occurred at oregon s boulder fire 20 of annual precipitation falls as snow where baseflow increased during the dry summer and fall months and decreased during the wetter winter and spring months the oregon results were in agreement with bart and tague 2017 s observations of burn scars in central and southern california where similarly low to no persistent winter snow accumulates where lower post fire groundwater eta losses likely caused baseflow to increase during the dry months while the effect of forest disturbance on snowpack is influenced by numerous factors vegetation removal and fire induced radiative forcing have generally been shown to advance the date of snow disappearance by increasing snowmelt rates gleason et al 2013 gleason and nolin 2016 pomeroy et al 2012 pugh and gordon 2013 skiles and painter 2015 earlier post fire snowmelt may have contributed to decreased baseflows during the drier summer months at chippy mill and cannon only chippy mill experienced statistically significant seasonally opposed baseflow shifts increases in some seasons decreases in others during the first five post fire years 49 increase in spring or approximately 3 mm month 17 decrease during fall approximately 2 mm month this may be because fire induced baseflow increases overlapped with the peak precipitation season in most basins when precipitation likely varies the most during any given water year this is further supported by the observation that at many basins wet season precipitation variability was high between water years si figure a which increased the variability of the landscape driven baseflow residuals for the wetter months during the pre fire period therefore at most basins fire driven baseflow increases typically occurring in the wetter months were less likely to be statistically insignificant compared to baseflow reductions which often occurred during the drier months when interannual precipitation variability was lower the same pattern was observed in the runoff results only chippy mill experienced statistically significant seasonally opposed runoff shifts during the first five post fire years numerous additional basins experienced statistically significant shifts in runoff during the first five post fire years in at least one season boulder reductions in winter and summer cannon increases in fall chippy thomas decreases in winter jungle increases in winter ponil complex increases in winter and spring santiago decreases in summer fig 7b only chippy mill 88 burned and santiago 73 burned experienced significant runoff shifts during the second post fire period fig 7c and d 5 3 linking fire attributed streamflow shifts to eta chippy mill was the only basin whose fire induced streamflow shifts were well explained by eta r2 0 79 fig 8 shifts were also significantly correlated with the precipitation anomaly but to a lesser extent r2 0 14 also at chippy mill qualitative comparisons of total annual fire induced streamflow depth turquoise boxplots to the depth of water expected from basin scale eta anomaly green boxplots and precipitation anomaly blue boxplots shows that the eta anomaly was nearly equivalent opposite in magnitude to the fire induced annual streamflow depth during each of the post fire periods fig 6 conversely the depth of excess water provided by the precipitation anomaly was insufficient to account for the total annual fire induced streamflow depth this further supports our hypothesis that much of chippy mill s post fire boosted streamflow was surplus water generated by fire induced eta reduction although eta reductions occurred at most of the other burn scars figs 3 and 6 landscape driven streamflow could not be statistically linked to the eta or precipitation signal this may indicate that where fire caused streamflow to increase other fire modified landscape processes also contributed to increased precipitation runoff partitioning e g reduced infiltration debano et al 1998 further explanation may be provided by plots of annual evaporation ratios and aridity indices si figure h every watershed was water limited during most years except oregon s boulder basin meaning some or all of the excess water generated from eta reduction could have been consumed by various compensation pathways such as through compensatory transpiration losses by intact hillslope and riparian vegetation within and downstream of the burn scar tague et al 2019 this hypothesis highlights the potential importance of unburned drainage area positioned between the disturbance footprint and the basin outlet discussed below or unburned riparian vegetation within the burn scar in addition our data show that some basins had evaporation ratios greater than 1 0 during multiple years suggesting that eta fluxes may be supported by additional inputs of water beyond precipitation e g deep groundwater reserves sun et al 2019 vourlitis et al 2008 we also note that many basins have lower interannual eta variability than precipitation variability indicating that eta water sources are appreciably distinct in space and time from streamflow water sources i e hydraulically disconnected at timescales relevant to interannual eta flux si figure a further studies are needed to determine how wildfire modifies runoff generation processes in different lithologic typologies 5 4 relationships between basin characteristics and fire attributed streamflow shifts numerous pearson s correlations greater than 0 20 were calculated between fire induced baseflow and runoff shifts and select basin attributes table 2 likely due to small sample size only correlations greater than or equal to 0 58 were statistically significant greater amounts of burned area area burned at high severity and the percent of a basin impacted by beetles prior to fire significantly correlated with fire induced runoff increases the percent of total precipitation that falls as snow slope and depth to a restrictive layer also correlated positively with fire induced increases in runoff although not statistically significantly the average annual aridity index was significantly positively correlated with fire induced baseflow increases slope was significantly negatively correlated with fire induced baseflow increases 6 discussion 6 1 identifying eta induced streamflow modification following wildfire disturbance at the gage only when at least 73 of a basin burned in a single water year was moderate evidence present of fire induced eta shifts p less than 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum tests in basin scale eta data summaries fig 3 downstream only where basin scale eta was significantly altered within two months of the fire were fire induced streamflow shifts distinguishable at the gage without prior removal of the climate signal according to pettitt s tests chippy mill 88 burned fig 5 these findings highlight the importance of disturbance scale and are further bolstered by strong correlations between the magnitude of fire induced runoff shifts and the percentage of total burned contributing drainage area table 2 previous work confirms the sensitivity of streamflow to the fraction of drainage area disturbed hallema et al 2018 saxe et al 2018 williams et al 2022 wine et al 2018 we show that the amount of fire induced runoff generated from the chippy mill burn scar the basin with the highest percentage of disturbed contributing drainage area was proportionate to the depth of water made available by fire induced eta reduction fig 6 this suggests that where the majority of a basin is disturbed inferences can be made about post fire runoff response from pixel scale eta data however mixed results from the other nine basins suggest the following five points be considered when using basin scale data in change detection analysis first if basin scale data e g stream gage data are expected to relay the story of landscape disturbance the tendency for post fire climate to mask or artificially exaggerate the effect of landscape disturbance in the basin scale dataset should be accounted for only where nearly the entire basin burned chippy mill were fire induced streamflow shifts extreme enough to be identified with climate unadjusted statistical methods pettitt s tests on deseasoned monthly data in the other basins included in this study climate unadjusted streamflow followed the declining precipitation pattern figs 3a 5 this supports jaramillo and destouni 2014 s observation that landscape drivers often cause hydrologic processes to shift in a direction opposite to those imposed by atmospheric climate drivers hallema et al 2018 confirmed it when they observed a net decline in post fire streamflow following reduced post fire precipitation in southern and central california blöschl et al 2007 tied this concept back to total basin size when they observed that large scale climatic patterns dominate the hydrologic response of large watersheds more so than in small watersheds thus the effects of wildfire disturbance are more likely undetectable in comparatively large basins blöschl et al 2007 second because fire induced streamflow shifts were seasonally variable fig 7 even climate adjusted procedures are liable to miss the most acute effects of fire when data are aggregated to the annual timestep because the effects of the disturbance may be averaged out our finding supports aredo et al 2021 process based modeling study of the effects of land use land cover change on seasonal discharge in ethiopia mean monthly streamflow decreased during dry months and increased during wet months following conversion of forested and bushland areas to urban and agricultural land uses aredo et al 2021 third our lagged monthly regression residuals still loosely tracked meteorology in the post fire period this may partially explain why post fire shifts were frequently insignificant when results were aggregated into five year blocks the magnitude and for some basins the direction of the fire induced streamflow shifts varied from year to year figs 6 and 7 the chippy thomas basin 15 burned by a fire in 2007 illustrates the point well annual fire attributed streamflow shifts were plotted with precipitation anomaly eta anomaly and the status of each year s annual spi ranking above within or below the 95 confidence interval ci of the entire 21 year spi median score fig 9 at the annual timestep the direction of fire induced baseflow and runoff shifts still generally followed the direction of the precipitation anomaly it was not until the fourth post fire year 2011 that the fire induced portion of the total annual streamflow depth became substantially elevated the same year the basin received above average precipitation for the first time since the fire year per spi rank overall this suggests that even if a robust statistical method is used to remove climate from the streamflow record the nuanced effects of multi year drought or wetness on runoff generation processes are not well accounted for there may be a catchment memory of drought for example it has been shown that drought history is more important than real time antecedent soil moisture status for infiltration and water repellency behavior in forested areas gimbel et al 2016 fourth the assumption that our procedures isolated fire induced streamflow shifts specifically introduced uncertainty numerous additional landscape drivers are capable of modifying watershed hydrology such as insect infestation disease drought induced vegetation mortality and anthropogenic activities such as land cover conversion and water extraction from surface or groundwater reservoirs jaramillo and destouni 2014 xu et al 2014 we attempted to limit that uncertainty by selecting relatively unpopulated basins with natural flow regimes wine and cadol 2016 regarding our attempt to link fire induced streamflow shifts to eta reduction specifically we acknowledge that combustion modifies myriad hydrogeomorphological processes only some of them participatory in eta regulation for example some studies have observed fire induced soil infiltration impedance to be a dominant driver of post fire runoff generation at plot and hillslope scales balfour et al 2014 ebel et al 2012 event specific storm characteristics and initial soil water saturation deficit have also been shown to modulate peak runoff rates in fire affected soils moody and ebel 2014 fire exacerbated geomorphological processes debris flows dry raveling etc also likely alter runoff routing parameters e g hillslope floodplain and channel surface roughness side channel storage de haas et al 2014 florsheim et al 2016 we verified that fire reduced eta before assuming eta played a role in what occurred at the gage but admit that some or all aforementioned processes also likely contributed to the expression of landscape disturbance in the streamflow record see also kirchner et al 2020 for further discussion of eta s controlling role in streamflow response following forest density reduction finally our results suggest that the period length streamflow data are aggregated to may partially determine the disturbance percentage threshold necessary to confer a detectable shift in gage data perhaps in part due to our consideration of all seasons the current work identified significant fire induced streamflow shifts in basins with as little as 6 burned contributing drainage area in contrast hallema et al 2018 and wine and cadol 2016 procedures detected fire induced annual or monsoonal runoff increases in basins with at least 19 burned drainage area future work could explicitly quantify streamflow s elasticity to fire induced eta modification hallema et al 2018 kurzweil et al 2021 6 2 watershed factors promoting fire induced streamflow shifts results from the current study support prior observations that the percentage of total burned and high burn severity drainage area controls the magnitude and direction of the streamflow modification blöschl et al 2007 neary et al 2005 saxe et al 2018 williams et al 2022 wine and cadol 2016 for one high burn severity has been shown to reduce eta more dramatically and for longer durations collar et al 2021 ma et al 2020 nolan et al 2014 poon and kinoshita 2018 more high burn severity area also decreases the chances for compensatory increases in transpiration or evaporation from the soil the understory or neighboring or downgradient vegetation tague et al 2019 similarly less unburned drainage area reduces the opportunities for intact downgradient vegetation to consume excess water generated by the upslope eta reduction goeking and tarboton 2020 tague et al 2019 the fraction of burned drainage area may have also been a proxy for watershed size in our data as larger watersheds are at decreased risk of experiencing synchronous basin wide stand replacing disturbance and due to rainfall s inherent spatial variability the percentage of a watershed s area that is likely to generate runoff at any given time is inversely related to its size brunkal and santi 2017 finally the specific effect of any one particular perturbance is difficult to verify at large spatial scales because of the long time lag between cause and effect blöschl et al 2007 the lateral distance from the gaging station to the closest burn perimeter was not significantly correlated with fire induced baseflow or quickflow table 2 these results do not support the prior observation that the position of a disturbance in the landscape matters blöschl et al 2007 as longer channel lengths increase the opportunity for peak flow attenuation brunkal and santi 2017 ffolliott et al 2013 mueller et al 2010 however our results do not deliver strong evidence to the contrary given the relatively small sample size and annual timestep of our data and the variability in disturbance severity across the ten study basins it is also reasonable to assume that opportunities for downgradient compensatory eta losses are fewer as the area between the disturbance and the basin outlet gets smaller tague et al 2019 6 3 implications for surface water resources we studied a range of spatiotemporal scales to determine when fire induced hydromodification becomes relevant to source water hydrology however we appreciate bloschl et al 2007 s cogent reminder that the spatial scale at which land cover change can impact overall basin hydrology depends on the hydrologic setting our paucity of replicates and the relatively sparse number of hydrologic settings evaluated limits our ability to issue broad general statements about the western united states from the current work future efforts could increase the number or study basins by installing temporary pressure transducers where data are desired but no usgs gaging stations exist for example see lundquist et al 2005 s nested monitoring approach in the tuolumne river basin in basins with unburned adjacent or downgradient drainage area our results suggest that compensation pathways may have consumed some or all of the excess water generated by eta reductions literature suggests that the seasonal droughts typical of semi arid and mediterranean climate regimes where eta is often water versus energy limited during peak eta months are likely to enhance the conditions that support these compensation pathways tague et al 2019 the authors acknowledge that we were unable to compare our results with energy limited basins as our study areas were generally water limited si figure h for now previous publications can be visited for regional scale statements about the effects of wildfire on streamflow beyene et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 saxe et al 2018 williams et al 2022 for example hallema et al 2018 found that wildfire boosted annual discharge at study sites in the pacific northwest texas gulf and lower colorado regions while the southeastern united states and areas treated with prescribed fire were relatively unaffected we do show that where the majority of the drainage area was unburned the magnitude of fire induced hydromodification was often within the range of pre fire interannual streamflow variability figs 6 and 7 or was relatively transient this may suggest that water providers with large diverse water supply portfolios are insulated from post fire water budget modification conversely water providers with small source water collection areas are at greater risk because they are more likely to experience disturbance in a larger fraction of their collection area thus pre fire management strategies that reduce the risk of moderate to high burn severity expand source water area or diversify water supply portfolios may be most important for small scale water providers in addition where climatic and fuel conditions favor fire and multiple ignition sources are present land managers should consider the additive effect of multiple fire events wine and cadol 2016 7 conclusions we evaluated whether fire induced streamflow shifts were caused by changes in burn scar eta at ten basins in the western united states fine resolution eta was estimated with the ssebop model at burned and unburned 30 m pixels which allowed for the effects of climate to be easily separated from landscape disturbance in eta time series fire reduced eta through the tenth post fire year at 80 of the studied burn scars fig 3 however those reductions were only propagated up to the basin scale when at least 73 of the basin s drainage area burned in a single water year only then were fire induced streamflow shifts detected in climate unadjusted streamflow data fig 5 to remove the influence of climate from the streamflow data previously proposed methods were used to process annual data and improved upon for monthly data fire induced baseflow and runoff shifts were detected at a basin with as little as 6 burned drainage area fig 7 representing a substantial improvement in the sensitivity of statistical methods to detect landscape driven streamflow shifts than what was previously available in the literature a potential explanation may be the fact that most change detection work is conducted on annual time series yet the effect of fire disturbance on streamflow magnitude is seasonally variable fig 7 this suggests that the effects of land disturbance on watershed hydrology may be partially averaged out in annual datasets however even in the climate adjusted streamflow data fire induced streamflow shifts were generally insignificant or short lived did not persist past the fifth post fire year fig 7c and d where burn scar eta reductions were not propagated up to the basin scale despite fire induced eta reductions at most burn scars post fire eta anomalies were only significantly correlated with fire induced streamflow shifts at the basin with the highest percentage of disturbed drainage area chippy mill 88 fig 8 this may indicate that other fire modified physical processes contributed to the increased post fire streamflow observed elsewhere fig 6 where fire reduced burn scar eta but did not increase streamflow our results support prior findings that in water limited systems compensation pathways may develop in adjacent or downgradient undisturbed or low burn severity areas that consume the excess water yielded from eta reduction overall findings suggest that water providers with large source water collection areas are fairly immune to disturbance induced shifts in basin water yield because they are less likely to experience disturbance in substantial portions of their collection area for the same reason providers with relatively small source water areas are at higher risk and should therefore consider management strategies that reduce the likelihood of high severity disturbances or that expand or diversify water supply portfolios results from this study would be bolstered by in situ field observations and process based modeling studies of the mechanics behind fire modified precipitation partitioning and runoff routing the need for additional research into the role of groundwater

3135,the impact of wildfire on water availability is a critical issue in the western united states because actual evapotranspiration eta constitutes the largest loss in the terrestrial water budget it has been suggested that fire induced eta reduction is a primary driver of elevated post fire discharge ten gaged watersheds with burns exceeding 5 of their total contributing drainage area were selected from california oregon montana utah new mexico and colorado continuous daily stream gage data were compiled and 30 meter eta estimates were calculated with the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model fire induced eta shifts were quantified with statistical tests that compared pre and post fire monthly eta in burned and unburned pixels the dampening effect of scale was also evaluated by repeating tests on all pixels from the entire basin as streamflow data are point measurements that aggregate a large spatial area additional statistical methods were required to isolate the effect of fire from climate on baseflow and runoff key findings include a significant fire induced eta reductions were only distinguishable in basin scale monthly datasets when at least 73 of the basin burned b the effect of wildfire disturbance on streamflow magnitude was seasonably variable c streamflow was modified in basins with as little as 6 burned drainage area however shifts only persisted beyond the fifth post fire year where more than three quarters of the basin was fire impacted and d surplus water from eta reduction was sufficient to account for boosted fire induced streamflow where fire induced streamflow increases were not significantly correlated with eta anomaly other fire impacted landscape processes may have contributed to modified runoff generation and routing where fire reduced eta but streamflow shifts were not detected compensatory eta pathways may have consumed the excess water before it reached the gage findings suggest that water providers with small source water collection areas have higher relative risk for fire induced hydromodification than providers with larger or more diversified supply portfolios results also illustrate the

2014 chow et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 martin 2016 murphy et al 2018 substantial effort is being spent to identify short and long term fire wildfire trends crawford et al 2015 parks and abatzoglou 2020 fire s role in landscape ecology david et al 2018 lake et al 2017 and geomorphology keller et al 2019 shakesby and doerr 2006 and the risks posed by wildfire to built and natural environments martin et al 2016 despite progress in identifying and understanding critical processes the location specific effects of wildfire related forest disturbance on downstream water supplies remain unclear additional uncertainty is introduced by the confounding pressures of climate aridification overpeck and udall 2020 and increasing climate variability van der wiel and bintanja 2021 zhuang et al 2021 as they often co occur with wildfire activity in forested watersheds reports of increased flooding hillslope erosion debris flows landslides reservoir sedimentation and water quality degradation following wildfire are common in the american west and elsewhere burke et al 2013 emelko et al 2016 moody and martin 2009 nunes et al 2018 nyman et al 2020 rust et al 2018 santi and morandi 2013 saxe et al 2018 concurrently the mechanistic linkage between actual evapotranspiration eta and streamflow has been demonstrated goeking and tarboton 2020 goulden and bales 2014 kirchner et al 2020 kirchner and allen 2020 suggesting a physical connection between eta and the aforementioned fire exacerbated hydrogeomorphic hazards such a linkage would be sensible as a eta is the most sensitive hydrologic component to vegetation changes and b it is often the largest loss in terrestrial water budgets making it a principal arbiter of precipitation partitioning neary et al 2005 however the direction and magnitude of post fire eta and streamflow shifts are often variable especially where topographic climatic and ecologic gradients are steep blount et al 2020 collar et al 2021 goeking and tarboton 2020 kinoshita and hogue 2015 ma et al 2020 saxe et al 2018 eta is a spatially and temporally varying process because the systems that control it are themselves fluctuating over space and time at a single location the eta rate may be a function of surface energy fluxes and states e g net radiation sensible and latent heat exchange reflective properties of a body surface meteorology e g precipitation wind speed relative humidity surface aerodynamic skin temperature biophysical controls e g soil moisture holding capacity stomatal conductance rooting structure aerodynamic resistance of the plant canopy and landscape characteristics e g topography additional sources of roughness chang 2012 lettenmaier et al 2015 maidment 1993 neary et al 2005 the timescales at which the states or rates of eta s drivers range are considerable precipitation for example has variable intensity during a single storm event as well as in accordance with multi year cycles e g decadal oscillations longer term trends e g anthropogenic climate change and hydroclimatic processes e g glaciation beyene et al 2021 eskridge et al 1997 xu et al 2014 even at the same location the eta flux can be energy or water limited depending on seasons and over interannual timescales budyko 1974 ryu et al 2008 xu et al 2014 as an added layer of complexity many of the variables that control eta rates are vulnerable to abrupt modification from acute landscape disturbance jin et al 2012 sexstone et al 2018 slinski et al 2016 downstream quantifying the effect of landscape disturbance on streamflow is challenging as prevailing climate precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration etp or pet can drive a majority of observed streamflow variability in undeveloped watersheds bart et al 2016 bart and tague 2017 jaramillo and destouni 2014 this is especially the case where the percentage of disturbed contributing drainage area is relatively small because the explanatory power of the overarching climate signal can easily mask or exaggerate the apparent effects of the disturbance at the gage hallema et al 2018 readily available remotely sensed data and reanalysis products bring this challenge to the forefront because they enable before after control impact evaluations to be conducted via observation of the same location through time where a paired reference watershed approach may have been used otherwise conner et al 2016 downes et al 2002 eberhardt 1976 the need to identify and monitor a reference basin is removed as pre fire observations from the disturbed area can be used as a control however climate signals can no longer be accounted for by comparing the disturbed and reference basins beyene et al 2021 goulden and bales 2014 hallema et al 2017 numerous studies have proposed statistical and process based methods for separating the effects of landscape drivers from climate drivers on catchment runoff and baseflow bart and tague 2017 beyene et al 2021 cong et al 2009 hallema et al 2018 kurzweil et al 2021 wine et al 2018 xu et al 2014 thus providing an analytical framework for quantifying linked fire effects on eta and streamflow most have reported results at the annual timestep natural resource managers need to understand the scale s at which fire induced hydrologic shifts become meaningful for source water hydrology the current study seeks to address that need by evaluating statistical linkages between fire induced eta modification and streamflow at varying spatiotemporal scales we examine two primary research questions a how does wildfire modify monthly eta baseflow and runoff at basins in the western united states and b to what degree are fire induced streamflow shifts explained by the eta shifts previously proposed procedures for separating the effects of landscape from climate drivers are implemented for annual time series evaluation and improved upon for sub annual time series evaluation 2 methods 2 1 overview monthly 30 meter m eta data were calculated at ten burned basins in the western united states with the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay 2018 senay et al 2013 daily streamflow data and static basin attributes were acquired at basin scale resolution additional meteorologic and landscape variables were extracted at 30 m pixel scale resolution fire induced eta shifts were quantified with statistical tests that compared pre and post fire monthly and yearly eta in burned and unburned pixels timing of significant eta shifts were also identified with change point detection tests and compared to fire event dates because pixel scale data were not available for streamflow additional statistical methods were used to disentangle the effect of fire from climate on post fire baseflow and runoff at both monthly and annual time steps relationships between fire induced streamflow shifts eta and precipitation anomalies annual water demand and basin characteristics were explored a conceptual overview of the study s input data data processing steps statistical tests applied statistical models constructed and results is provided in fig 1 2 2 basin selection study basins were selected using the following criteria a the basin was in the western united states west of the 100th meridian b more than 5 of the basin was burned by a wildfire in a single water year october 1

the ten years before or after the water year of interest d daily united states geological survey usgs stream gage data were available at the basin outlet for the entire study period one exception made and e the basin did not contain manmade hydraulic control structures capable of modifying the timing rate and or volume of streamflow at the gage only eleven basins were identified in the western united states that met all five study criteria ten of them were included in the current study figs 2a and 2b table 1 while southern california s devil canyon was excluded due to its inclusion in a similar study kinoshita and hogue 2015 the other basin studied in kinoshita and hogue 2015 city creek was excluded from the current study because the majority of it burned twice in six years 2003 old fire 1997 hemlock fire the authors acknowledge that the relatively small number of study basins included in the current study limits the reach and applicability of our results to the entire western united states in general watershed boundaries were delineated in streamstats https www usgs gov mission areas water resources science streamstats streamflow statistics and spatial analysis tools burn perimeters were obtained from mtbs and clipped to basin extents where necessary the percentage of burned contributing drainage area was calculated in arcpro version 2 9 and ranged from 6 to 88 in all but one watershed only one burn event defined by mtbs event id was responsible for the total burned area in the basin during the water year of interest the exception occurred in oregon s south umpqua river basin during water year 2002 where five mtbs mapped fires occurred to comprise 23 of the basin s total drainage area 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 ssebop evapotranspiration monthly 30 m eta was

appendix a 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 quantifying the effect of fire on eta and streamflow since pixel scale eta flux was estimable from remotely sensed observations the effect of fire could be distinguished from climate in the eta data by running separate statistical tests on burned and unburned pixels from the same basin and comparing results for basins that experienced burns in only a portion of their drainage area the dampening effect of scale in terms of both overall basin size and the muting effect of unburned contributing drainage area on basin scale data summaries was also evaluated by repeating the same statistical tests on all pixels from the entire basin conversely stream gage data were only available at main basin outlets as there were no nested monitoring stations in upgradient subbasins thus the comparison procedures used to parse the effects of fire from climate and scale in eta data were not applicable to avoid the need for comparative analyses of streamflow data from nearby control unburned basins two additional analyses were conducted on the streamflow time series that involved the removal of the climate signal from the streamflow record altogether fig 1 2 4 1 1 eta at each basin monthly eta data were separated into groups of burned pixels unburned pixels and all pixels in the entire basin and the monthly average of each group was calculated mann kendall tests were applied with the kendall r package mcleod 2011 to test for the presence of underlying trends in the eta of the unburned pixels and in the climate variables following attempts were made to make the data stationary i e mean variance and autocorrelation structure are time invariant hyndman and athanasopoulos 2018 milly et al 2008 shumway and stoffer 2016 data were log transformed

augmented dickey fuller tests adf were applied with the base cran tseries r package trapletti et al 2021 the adf is a unit root test where a unit root is a non stationary feature of a stochastic

stationary presence of a unit root shumway and stoffer 2016 the deseasoned eta data were indexed by period ten year pre fire period post fire years one through five and post fire years six through ten non parametric wilcoxon rank sum tests were run on each of the eta groups burned pixels unburned pixels all pixels to identify statistically significant shifts in either of the post fire periods relative to the pre fire period α 0 05 non parametric pettitt s change point detection tests were also applied to each time series with the trend r package pohlert 2020 to independently check the timing of major behavioral shifts dates of significant shifts α 0 05 were compared to fire event dates pettitt s based on mann whitney two sample rank based tests detects a single change at an unknown point in time it is among the most widely used change point detection methods in hydroclimatological studies mallakpour and villarini 2016 zhou et al 2019 results for each pixel group burned unburned all pixels were compared at each basin 2 4 1 2 streamflow the same procedures and tests applied to the eta data were applied to climate unadjusted monthly meteorologic precipitation air temperature etp spi and streamflow baseflow runoff data for continuity center of volume analysis was also conducted on the raw streamflow data daily mean discharge depth to test for post fire shifts in streamflow

account for seasonal lag between meteorologic predictors and discharge lagged predictor variables were allowed inclusion in the monthly regression models this decision was based on the high percentage

streamflow shifts to eta residuals from the annual linear regression models were used to explore statistical relationships between fire induced streamflow shift and eta first precipitation and eta anomalies were calculated for precipitation the mean of the total annual precipitation for the entire 21 year study period was subtracted from each year for eta the mean of the total annual eta in the unburned pixels was subtracted from the mean yearly eta depth of all the pixels in the basin to normalize the baseflow and runoff residuals residual anomalies were also calculated by subtracting the mean of the pre fire period residual from the 21 year residual time series baseflow and quickflow residuals were then summed to determine the magnitude of the total landscape driven streamflow each year pearson s correlations between annual precipitation eta and streamflow residual anomalies were calculated at each basin the anomaly with the stronger correlation was considered the dominant driver of the landscape driven baseflow or streamflow shift at a glance qualitative volume comparisons were also made by plotting the total mean annual fire induced streamflow with the total mean annual precipitation and eta anomalies for each of the five year post fire periods 4 0 2 relationships between basin characteristics and fire attributed streamflow shifts the annual baseflow and

baseflow data at cannon ponil complex porcupine ranch and unnamed basins failed the adf stationarity tests fig 2a and 2b precipitation during the first five post fire years was only significantly different lower from the pre fire period at waterfall according to wilcoxon rank sum tests fig 3 however eta was significantly reduced within most burn scars burned pixels in the first five post fire years percent annual reductions between approximately ten to 50 and in a smaller fraction of burn scars during post fire years six through ten likely due to vegetation recovery the unnamed fire was the only basin to experience no significant change in post fire eta at the burned pixels this was also the only fire with grassland herbaceous cover as its dominant pre fire vegetation type table 1 post fire eta residuals eta of burned and unburned pixels differenced were significantly reduced in every basin during both post fire periods except at unnamed differencing was not performed for chippy mill due to its relatively small number of unburned pixels fig 3c fig 4 statistically significant post fire shifts also occurred in baseflow and runoff at numerous basins fig 5 however the shifts could not be specifically attributed to fire because the influence of climate could not be removed from the gage data according to the center of volume analysis the only basin to experience a significant shift in streamflow timing was chippy thomas 25 of the annual total streamflow volume occurred 21 days later in the first post fire period it is not clear whether the shift was caused by land disturbance or post fire weather as the center of volume analysis was conducted on climate unadjusted data no shifts were detected p α in the climate variables si table c or the eta of the unburned pixels fig 3b within six months of a fire origin date according to pettitt s change point detection tests conversely pettitt s identified significant shifts in the eta of the burned pixels within two months of fire origin dates in four of the ten basins chippy thomas chippy mill porcupine ranch santiago and within five months of fire origin dates for three additional basins cannon jungle waterfall significant shifts occurred in the eta residuals of those same seven basins within two months of fire origin dates fig 3c si table c comparison of the burned pixel and all pixel eta pettitt s results provides insight into the effect of scale significant shifts in the eta of all basin pixels were only identified within two months of fire origin dates at the two basins with the highest percentages of burned drainage area chippy mill 88 santiago 73 fig 3b chippy mill was the only basin to experience significant baseflow and runoff shifts during the water year following the fire fig 5 5 2 fire induced streamflow shifts 5 2 1 annual shifts based on comparisons of pre and post fire residuals from the annual regression models statistically significant fire induced increases in baseflow were identified at chippy mill 68 increase from pre fire annual baseflow or approximately 30 mm year and unnamed 53 increase approximately 5 mm year fig 6 a during the first five post fire years detailed model metrics provided in si table d of the three basins with statistically significant increases in baseflow during post fire years one through five significant increases only persisted into post fire years six through ten at chippy mill fig 6b statistically significant immediate increases in annual runoff were identified at cannon 8 increase approximately 25 mm year and chippy mill 99 increase approximately 95 mm year that increase only persisted at chippy mill 92 increase during the second post fire period fig 6b during the first five post fire years wildfire increased average annual flow by 6 cannon 43 at chippy mill 2 at jungle 23 at ponil complex and 8 at waterfall red text in fig 6 wildfire decreased flows by 1 at boulder 87 at santiago and 9 at unnamed these changes are likely within the range of pre fire interannual streamflow variability where comparisons of pre and post fire model residuals were insignificant absence of a yellow dot in fig 6 5 2 2 seasonal shifts analysis of annual hydrologic data did not capture the most dramatic and seasonally acute fire induced streamflow shifts nearly every basin experienced increased mean and median baseflow and runoff in some seasons and decreases in others fig 7 detailed model metrics provided in si table e we observe that the seasonal timing of fire induced baseflow increases and decreases did not have a consistent temporal relationship with seasonal precipitation across basins for example at chippy mill and cannon which receive 43 and 72 of their annual average precipitation as snow respectively table 1 fire increased baseflow during wet months mean monthly hydrologic fluxes provided in si figure d the opposite occurred at oregon s boulder fire 20 of annual precipitation falls as snow where baseflow increased during the dry summer and fall months and decreased during the wetter winter and spring months the oregon results were in agreement with bart and tague 2017 s observations of burn scars in central and southern california where similarly low to no persistent winter snow accumulates where lower post fire groundwater eta losses likely caused baseflow to increase during the dry months while the effect of forest disturbance on snowpack is influenced by numerous factors vegetation removal and fire induced radiative forcing have generally been shown to advance the date of snow disappearance by increasing snowmelt rates gleason et al 2013 gleason and nolin 2016 pomeroy et al 2012 pugh and gordon 2013 skiles and painter 2015 earlier post fire snowmelt may have contributed to decreased baseflows during the drier summer months at chippy mill and cannon only chippy mill experienced statistically significant seasonally opposed baseflow shifts increases in some seasons decreases in others during the first five post fire years 49 increase in spring or approximately 3 mm month 17 decrease during fall approximately 2 mm month this may be because fire induced baseflow increases overlapped with the peak precipitation season in most basins when precipitation likely varies the most during any given water year this is further supported by the observation that at many basins wet season precipitation variability was high between water years si figure a which increased the variability of the landscape driven baseflow residuals for the wetter months during the pre fire period therefore at most basins fire driven baseflow increases typically occurring in the wetter months were less likely to be statistically insignificant compared to baseflow reductions which often occurred during the drier months when interannual precipitation variability was lower the same pattern was observed in the runoff results only chippy mill experienced statistically significant seasonally opposed runoff shifts during the first five post fire years numerous additional basins experienced statistically significant shifts in runoff during the first five post fire years in at least one season boulder reductions in winter and summer cannon increases in fall chippy thomas decreases in winter jungle increases in winter ponil complex increases in winter and spring santiago decreases in summer fig 7b only chippy mill 88 burned and santiago 73 burned experienced significant runoff shifts during the second post fire period fig 7c and d 5 3 linking fire attributed streamflow shifts to eta chippy mill was the only basin whose fire induced streamflow shifts were well explained by eta r2 0 79 fig 8 shifts were also significantly correlated with the precipitation anomaly but to a lesser extent r2 0 14 also at chippy mill qualitative comparisons of total annual fire induced streamflow depth turquoise boxplots to the depth of water expected from basin scale eta anomaly green boxplots and precipitation anomaly blue boxplots shows that the eta anomaly was nearly equivalent opposite in magnitude to the fire induced annual streamflow depth during each of the post fire periods fig 6 conversely the depth of excess water provided by the precipitation anomaly was insufficient to account for the total annual fire induced streamflow depth this further supports our hypothesis that much of chippy mill s post fire boosted streamflow was surplus water generated by fire induced eta reduction although eta reductions occurred at most of the other burn scars figs 3 and 6 landscape driven streamflow could not be statistically linked to the eta or precipitation signal this may indicate that where fire caused streamflow to increase other fire modified landscape processes also contributed to increased precipitation runoff partitioning e g reduced infiltration debano et al 1998 further explanation may be provided by plots of annual evaporation ratios and aridity indices si figure h every watershed was water limited during most years except oregon s boulder basin meaning some or all of the excess water generated from eta reduction could have been consumed by various compensation pathways such as through compensatory transpiration losses by intact hillslope and riparian vegetation within and downstream of the burn scar tague et al 2019 this hypothesis highlights the potential importance of unburned drainage area positioned between the disturbance footprint and the basin outlet discussed below or unburned riparian vegetation within the burn scar in addition our data show that some basins had evaporation ratios greater than 1 0 during multiple years suggesting that eta fluxes may be supported by additional inputs of water beyond precipitation e g deep groundwater reserves sun et al 2019 vourlitis et al 2008 we also note that many basins have lower interannual eta variability than precipitation variability indicating that eta water sources are appreciably distinct in space and time from streamflow water sources i e hydraulically disconnected at timescales relevant to interannual eta flux si figure a further studies are needed to determine how wildfire modifies runoff generation processes in different lithologic typologies 5 4 relationships between basin characteristics and fire attributed streamflow shifts numerous pearson s correlations greater than 0 20 were calculated between fire induced baseflow and runoff shifts and select basin attributes table 2 likely due to small sample size only correlations greater than or equal to 0 58 were statistically significant greater amounts of burned area area burned at high severity and the percent of a basin impacted by beetles prior to fire significantly correlated with fire induced runoff increases the percent of total precipitation that falls as snow slope and depth to a restrictive layer also correlated positively with fire induced increases in runoff although not statistically significantly the average annual aridity index was significantly positively correlated with fire induced baseflow increases slope was significantly negatively correlated with fire induced baseflow increases 6 discussion 6 1 identifying eta induced streamflow modification following wildfire disturbance at the gage only when at least 73 of a basin burned in a single water year was moderate evidence present of fire induced eta shifts p less than 0 05 wilcoxon rank sum tests in basin scale eta data summaries fig 3 downstream only where basin scale eta was significantly altered within two months of the fire were fire induced streamflow shifts distinguishable at the gage without prior removal of the climate signal according to pettitt s tests chippy mill 88 burned fig 5 these findings highlight the importance of disturbance scale and are further bolstered by strong correlations between the magnitude of fire induced runoff shifts and the percentage of total burned contributing drainage area table 2 previous work confirms the sensitivity of streamflow to the fraction of drainage area disturbed hallema et al 2018 saxe et al 2018 williams et al 2022 wine et al 2018 we show that the amount of fire induced runoff generated from the chippy mill burn scar the basin with the highest percentage of disturbed contributing drainage area was proportionate to the depth of water made available by fire induced eta reduction fig 6 this suggests that where the majority of a basin is disturbed inferences can be made about post fire runoff response from pixel scale eta data however mixed results from the other nine basins suggest the following five points be considered when using basin scale data in change detection analysis first if basin scale data e g stream gage data are expected to relay the story of landscape disturbance the tendency for post fire climate to mask or artificially exaggerate the effect of landscape disturbance in the basin scale dataset should be accounted for only where nearly the entire basin burned chippy mill were fire induced streamflow shifts extreme enough to be identified with climate unadjusted statistical methods pettitt s tests on deseasoned monthly data in the other basins included in this study climate unadjusted streamflow followed the declining precipitation pattern figs 3a 5 this supports jaramillo and destouni 2014 s observation that landscape drivers often cause hydrologic processes to shift in a direction opposite to those imposed by atmospheric climate drivers hallema et al 2018 confirmed it when they observed a net decline in post fire streamflow following reduced post fire precipitation in southern and central california blöschl et al 2007 tied this concept back to total basin size when they observed that large scale climatic patterns dominate the hydrologic response of large watersheds more so than in small watersheds thus the effects of wildfire disturbance are more likely undetectable in comparatively large basins blöschl et al 2007 second because fire induced streamflow shifts were seasonally variable fig 7 even climate adjusted procedures are liable to miss the most acute effects of fire when data are aggregated to the annual timestep because the effects of the disturbance may be averaged out our finding supports aredo et al 2021 process based modeling study of the effects of land use land cover change on seasonal discharge in ethiopia mean monthly streamflow decreased during dry months and increased during wet months following conversion of forested and bushland areas to urban and agricultural land uses aredo et al 2021 third our lagged monthly regression residuals still loosely tracked meteorology in the post fire period this may partially explain why post fire shifts were frequently insignificant when results were aggregated into five year blocks the magnitude and for some basins the direction of the fire induced streamflow shifts varied from year to year figs 6 and 7 the chippy thomas basin 15 burned by a fire in 2007 illustrates the point well annual fire attributed streamflow shifts were plotted with precipitation anomaly eta anomaly and the status of each year s annual spi ranking above within or below the 95 confidence interval ci of the entire 21 year spi median score fig 9 at the annual timestep the direction of fire induced baseflow and runoff shifts still generally followed the direction of the precipitation anomaly it was not until the fourth post fire year 2011 that the fire induced portion of the total annual streamflow depth became substantially elevated the same year the basin received above average precipitation for the first time since the fire year per spi rank overall this suggests that even if a robust statistical method is used to remove climate from the streamflow record the nuanced effects of multi year drought or wetness on runoff generation processes are not well accounted for there may be a catchment memory of drought for example it has been shown that drought history is more important than real time antecedent soil moisture status for infiltration and water repellency behavior in forested areas gimbel et al 2016 fourth the assumption that our procedures isolated fire induced streamflow shifts specifically introduced uncertainty numerous additional landscape drivers are capable of modifying watershed hydrology such as insect infestation disease drought induced vegetation mortality and anthropogenic activities such as land cover conversion and water extraction from surface or groundwater reservoirs jaramillo and destouni 2014 xu et al 2014 we attempted to limit that uncertainty by selecting relatively unpopulated basins with natural flow regimes wine and cadol 2016 regarding our attempt to link fire induced streamflow shifts to eta reduction specifically we acknowledge that combustion modifies myriad hydrogeomorphological processes only some of them participatory in eta regulation for example some studies have observed fire induced soil infiltration impedance to be a dominant driver of post fire runoff generation at plot and hillslope scales balfour et al 2014 ebel et al 2012 event specific storm characteristics and initial soil water saturation deficit have also been shown to modulate peak runoff rates in fire affected soils moody and ebel 2014 fire exacerbated geomorphological processes debris flows dry raveling etc also likely alter runoff routing parameters e g hillslope floodplain and channel surface roughness side channel storage de haas et al 2014 florsheim et al 2016 we verified that fire reduced eta before assuming eta played a role in what occurred at the gage but admit that some or all aforementioned processes also likely contributed to the expression of landscape disturbance in the streamflow record see also kirchner et al 2020 for further discussion of eta s controlling role in streamflow response following forest density reduction finally our results suggest that the period length streamflow data are aggregated to may partially determine the disturbance percentage threshold necessary to confer a detectable shift in gage data perhaps in part due to our consideration of all seasons the current work identified significant fire induced streamflow shifts in basins with as little as 6 burned contributing drainage area in contrast hallema et al 2018 and wine and cadol 2016 procedures detected fire induced annual or monsoonal runoff increases in basins with at least 19 burned drainage area future work could explicitly quantify streamflow s elasticity to fire induced eta modification hallema et al 2018 kurzweil et al 2021 6 2 watershed factors promoting fire induced streamflow shifts results from the current study support prior observations that the percentage of total burned and high burn severity drainage area controls the magnitude and direction of the streamflow modification blöschl et al 2007 neary et al 2005 saxe et al 2018 williams et al 2022 wine and cadol 2016 for one high burn severity has been shown to reduce eta more dramatically and for longer durations collar et al 2021 ma et al 2020 nolan et al 2014 poon and kinoshita 2018 more high burn severity area also decreases the chances for compensatory increases in transpiration or evaporation from the soil the understory or neighboring or downgradient vegetation tague et al 2019 similarly less unburned drainage area reduces the opportunities for intact downgradient vegetation to consume excess water generated by the upslope eta reduction goeking and tarboton 2020 tague et al 2019 the fraction of burned drainage area may have also been a proxy for watershed size in our data as larger watersheds are at decreased risk of experiencing synchronous basin wide stand replacing disturbance and due to rainfall s inherent spatial variability the percentage of a watershed s area that is likely to generate runoff at any given time is inversely related to its size brunkal and santi 2017 finally the specific effect of any one particular perturbance is difficult to verify at large spatial scales because of the long time lag between cause and effect blöschl et al 2007 the lateral distance from the gaging station to the closest burn perimeter was not significantly correlated with fire induced baseflow or quickflow table 2 these results do not support the prior observation that the position of a disturbance in the landscape matters blöschl et al 2007 as longer channel lengths increase the opportunity for peak flow attenuation brunkal and santi 2017 ffolliott et al 2013 mueller et al 2010 however our results do not deliver strong evidence to the contrary given the relatively small sample size and annual timestep of our data and the variability in disturbance severity across the ten study basins it is also reasonable to assume that opportunities for downgradient compensatory eta losses are fewer as the area between the disturbance and the basin outlet gets smaller tague et al 2019 6 3 implications for surface water resources we studied a range of spatiotemporal scales to determine when fire induced hydromodification becomes relevant to source water hydrology however we appreciate bloschl et al 2007 s cogent reminder that the spatial scale at which land cover change can impact overall basin hydrology depends on the hydrologic setting our paucity of replicates and the relatively sparse number of hydrologic settings evaluated limits our ability to issue broad general statements about the western united states from the current work future efforts could increase the number or study basins by installing temporary pressure transducers where data are desired but no usgs gaging stations exist for example see lundquist et al 2005 s nested monitoring approach in the tuolumne river basin in basins with unburned adjacent or downgradient drainage area our results suggest that compensation pathways may have consumed some or all of the excess water generated by eta reductions literature suggests that the seasonal droughts typical of semi arid and mediterranean climate regimes where eta is often water versus energy limited during peak eta months are likely to enhance the conditions that support these compensation pathways tague et al 2019 the authors acknowledge that we were unable to compare our results with energy limited basins as our study areas were generally water limited si figure h for now previous publications can be visited for regional scale statements about the effects of wildfire on streamflow beyene et al 2021 hallema et al 2018 saxe et al 2018 williams et al 2022 for example hallema et al 2018 found that wildfire boosted annual discharge at study sites in the pacific northwest texas gulf and lower colorado regions while the southeastern united states and areas treated with prescribed fire were relatively unaffected we do show that where the majority of the drainage area was unburned the magnitude of fire induced hydromodification was often within the range of pre fire interannual streamflow variability figs 6 and 7 or was relatively transient this may suggest that water providers with large diverse water supply portfolios are insulated from post fire water budget modification conversely water providers with small source water collection areas are at greater risk because they are more likely to experience disturbance in a larger fraction of their collection area thus pre fire management strategies that reduce the risk of moderate to high burn severity expand source water area or diversify water supply portfolios may be most important for small scale water providers in addition where climatic and fuel conditions favor fire and multiple ignition sources are present land managers should consider the additive effect of multiple fire events wine and cadol 2016 7 conclusions we evaluated whether fire induced streamflow shifts were caused by changes in burn scar eta at ten basins in the western united states fine resolution eta was estimated with the ssebop model at burned and unburned 30 m pixels which allowed for the effects of climate to be easily separated from landscape disturbance in eta time series fire reduced eta through the tenth post fire year at 80 of the studied burn scars fig 3 however those reductions were only propagated up to the basin scale when at least 73 of the basin s drainage area burned in a single water year only then were fire induced streamflow shifts detected in climate unadjusted streamflow data fig 5 to remove the influence of climate from the streamflow data previously proposed methods were used to process annual data and improved upon for monthly data fire induced baseflow and runoff shifts were detected at a basin with as little as 6 burned drainage area fig 7 representing a substantial improvement in the sensitivity of statistical methods to detect landscape driven streamflow shifts than what was previously available in the literature a potential explanation may be the fact that most change detection work is conducted on annual time series yet the effect of fire disturbance on streamflow magnitude is seasonally variable fig 7 this suggests that the effects of land disturbance on watershed hydrology may be partially averaged out in annual datasets however even in the climate adjusted streamflow data fire induced streamflow shifts were generally insignificant or short lived did not persist past the fifth post fire year fig 7c and d where burn scar eta reductions were not propagated up to the basin scale despite fire induced eta reductions at most burn scars post fire eta anomalies were only significantly correlated with fire induced streamflow shifts at the basin with the highest percentage of disturbed drainage area chippy mill 88 fig 8 this may indicate that other fire modified physical processes contributed to the increased post fire streamflow observed elsewhere fig 6 where fire reduced burn scar eta but did not increase streamflow our results support prior findings that in water limited systems compensation pathways may develop in adjacent or downgradient undisturbed or low burn severity areas that consume the excess water yielded from eta reduction overall findings suggest that water providers with large source water collection areas are fairly immune to disturbance induced shifts in basin water yield because they are less likely to experience disturbance in substantial portions of their collection area for the same reason providers with relatively small source water areas are at higher risk and should therefore consider management strategies that reduce the likelihood of high severity disturbances or that expand or diversify water supply portfolios results from this study would be bolstered by in situ field observations and process based modeling studies of the mechanics behind fire modified precipitation partitioning and runoff routing the need for additional research into the role of groundwater

department of geography and atmospheric science university of kansas lawrence 66045 usa department of geography and atmospheric science university of kansas lawrence 66045 usa terrestrial water storage tws and its change twsc are extremely sensitive to climate change and are good indicators of the response of the hydrological system to climate change in the tibetan plateau tp however long term variation in tws and its components as well as contributions of these component changes to twsc are still not well documented in this study we extended monthly tws anomaly twsa and twsc from 1989 to 2019 using the random forest rf method analyzed the long term contribution rates of each component change to twsc using a mass balance approach and compared them with the rates estimated by the rf method our major findings are 1 the warming and wetting trend in the entire analysis period pa and in the pre mutation period p1 was slowed down or even reversed in the post mutation period p2 which was caused mainly by the decrease in temperature and precipitation in the north eastern inner basin ib and southern qaidam basin qb 2 the rf method is capable of estimating monthly twsa and twsc 0 872 r2 0 957 in training data 0 528 r2 0 860 in test data variable selection has an important impact on the method and twsc can be used as an alternative when twsa estimate is poor 3 significant annual twsa increase 2 20 mm a p 0 05 in the ib during pa comes from a higher increase during p2 3 62 mm a p 0 05 and a small variation during p1 0 65 m a p 0 1 spatially the increase is attributed to the higher increase trends 4 50 mm a p 0 05 in north eastern ib during pa and p2 and slight decrease in western and southern ib during pa the spatial and temporal heterogeneity was mainly caused by the differences in precipitation amount glacier proportions and permafrost types 4 during pa twsc in the ib was mainly determined by lake water storage change lwsc with a contribution rate of 62 while in the qb it was mainly determined by soil water change 43 and lwsc had a contribution rate of 27 lwsc impact on twsc was more significant in the ib especially in the southeastern sub regions with regional water storage surplus twsc 0 the overall increase in water storages and fluxes and exchanges imply an intensified hydrologic cycle in the region keywords grace mass balance random forest contribution rate terrestrial water storage change 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is a fundamental state variable of the terrestrial hydrological cycle deng et al 2020 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a it provides an overall status of a hydrological system deng et al 2018 watkins et al 2015 xiang et al 2016 which includes soil water sw snow water equivalent swe surface water in lakes lws permafrost pm glacial ice ice and groundwater gws wang et al 2020a xiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 and is especially useful for endorheic basins without surface stream inflow and outflow i e the main flux of hydrological systems due to the harsh environment low air temperature high elevation strong radiation and low air pressure human activities have little impact on the alpine hydrological system in the endorheic tibetan plateau tp li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a as such tws as well as its components and its change are good indicators that reflect the impacts of climate change jing et al 2019 wang et al 2020a xie et al 2019b yeh et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 additionally water storage and its change are closely related to flow conditions bibi et al 2019 deng et al 2018 high soil water storage may produce large and quick runoff with the same amount of precipitation and flow variability can be adjusted and buffered by water storage abiy and melesse 2017 bibi et al 2019 kuriqi et al 2020 so understanding water storage can also promote our understanding of streamflow processes and their variability li et al 2016 xie et al 2019a since april 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites and the successor grace follow on mission from june 2018 to the present began providing direct measurements of global tws and its anomaly twsa the products of grace and grace follow on grace fo have been used in the estimation of groundwater storage xiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 glacier loss zhang et al 2013 lake water storage change zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 and total basin discharge xie et al 2019a however its short time span limits its application in the analysis of the impacts of climate change usually no 30 years in climatology analysis this lack of long term data leads to some apparently conflicting phenomena in the region for example in the inner basin ib of the endorheic tp fig 1 an increase trend in precipitation began slowing down or even reversing in the 2000s but twsa showed a significant increasing trend during the period of 2002 2016 wang et al 2020a and in the southern ib precipitation continued an increasing trend after 2000 but twsa showed a decreasing trend wang et al 2020a to solve these puzzles it is necessary to explore the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the changes in the hydrological cycle and to analyze the effects of different storage components on twsa changes twsc using long term hydrological and climatic time series data however such studies in the endorheic tp are few and far between meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2013 machine learning methods have been more and more applied in various fields of the geosciences and have shown promising results jing et al 2019 jing et al 2020 xie et al 2019a xie et al 2019b however a key issue and challenge is the interpretability of these methods schmidt et al 2020 shortridge et al 2016 machine learning models are still black boxes similar to traditional statistical methods as they do not model the mechanisms of physical processes involved the random forest rf method is a popular and effective machine learning method jing et al 2019 jing et al 2020 xie et al 2019b which has a certain degree of interpretability compared with other methods such as artificial neural networks ann and support vector machines svm xie et al 2019b ostad ali askari et al 2017 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 because of its tree based model structure rf can evaluate variables importance by quantifying their contributions to trees nodes breiman 2001 jing et al 2020 strobl et al 2009 the contributions however only indicate the importance of different variables or features in the classification or regression without knowing their real physical meanings jing et al 2019 based on the water balance we can also estimate the contribution rates of different storage components to twsc which have clear physical meanings by comparing the rates from the two approaches it helps us understand the feasibility and interpretability of the rates estimated by the rf method with climate warming and wetting in the region there have been numerous studies on the changes in one or several components in the endorheic tibetan plateau tp including terrestrial water storage deng et al 2018 soil water wang et al 2020a glaciers zhang et al 2013 snow pulliainen et al 2020 lakes zhang et al 2020a evapotranspiration et yin et al 2013 and groundwater bibi et al 2019 however there are few comprehensive explorations about whether the hydrological cycle is accelerating or decelerating li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b which is an unsolved key issue in hydrology bloschl et al 2019 for example the rapid expansion of lakes in recent years has attracted great attention lei et al 2013 qiao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a but existing studies mostly focus on a few lakes or basins biskop et al 2016 ding et al 2018 lei et al 2013 and there is a lack of study on the long term effects of lws change in regional hydrological cycles yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 for example zhang et al 2017 studied the effects of lake water storage change on total water storage in the ib for a very limited time period 2003 2009 simultaneously the climate hydro geomorphology and cryosphere in the region are quite complex fig 1 and lake water storage variation in different parts of the region and time periods has been reported qiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b so the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of lake water storage change and its impacts on regional water storage variation as well as other storage components need further exploration in this study we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the spatial and temporal variation in tws and its different components in response to climate change in the endorheic tp the main objectives of the study are 1 to identify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of long term 1989 2019 variation in tws and its components 2 to determine whether the regional hydrological cycle intensified or weakened 3 to test the feasibility and interpretability of the random forest method in estimating twsa and twsc and 4 to detect the effects of different storage components to twsc particularly the effects of lakes in the endorheic tp the novelties of this study are mainly in three aspects 1 we compared for the first time the contribution rates of water storage components estimated from the rf model with those from the traditional mass balance approach and we evaluated the rf method on estimating both twsa and twsc while most of the existing studies only focused on twsa jing et al 2020 landerer et al 2020 li et al 2021 2 we analyzed the lake effect on tws change for the first time using newly developed long term 1989 2019 comprehensive lake volume data all lakes 1 km2 wang et al 2021a https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5543615 and 3 we analyzed the contribution rates under different hydrological conditions i e storage surplus vs deficit with finer sub regions while previous studies mainly focused on either the trend of entire study period or in the pre and post mutation periods with coarse sub regions deng et al 2018 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 the study can provide useful information for water resource management and rational water utilization under the changing environment in the tp 2 materials and datasets 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the endorheic region of the tibetan plateau tp 29 38 39 21 n 78 38 99 17 e with a total area of approximately 14 22 105 km2 fig 1a accounting for about 32 of the entire tp the region consists of the inner basin ib and the qaidam basin qb zhang et al 2013 and both of them have many endorheic sub basins of different sizes fig 2 controlled by local topography there are no large rivers but numerous lakes with varying sizes in this region according to zhang et al 2019 total lake area in this region accounted for 73 87 of the total lake area in the tp in 2018 the region has a vast number of glaciers and a large area of snow coverage in the high mountains especially in the ib fig 1a continuous permafrost is perennial in the northern ib and in the high mountains at the south edge of the qb while seasonal frozen ground is widely distributed across the qb and intertwined with island permafrost in southern ib fig 1b about 69 of lakes in the tp lie in the permafrost region liu et al 2020 glaciers snow permafrost and lakes form a unique alpine cryospheric hydrological system in the region according to the köppen geiger climate classification beck et al 2018 the climate gradually transitions from arid desert cold bwk to arid steppe cold bsk and then to polar tundra pt along the west east direction in the ib and along the north south direction in the qb fig 1c the defining criteria of these climate types can be found in table s1 and more details can be found in beck et al 2018 and peel et al 2007 the ib is dominated by the indian monsoon in summer and westerlies in winter yang et al 2017 and its annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 650 mm with 60 90 of it falling between june and september the mean annual air temperature in the ib is 4 956 c 1989 2019 table 1 the qb is influenced by the indian and east asian monsoons during summer yao et al 2012 annual mean air temperature is 4 8 c in the plain area and is 1 5 c in the periphery mountains areas annual precipitation in the qb ranges from 25 to 485 mm and mainly falls from april to november bibi et al 2019 2 2 sub region demarcation due to the complex climate hydro geomorphology and cryosphere we divide the endorheic tp into eight sub regions based on an aridity index watershed lake distribution permafrost type and climate type of its constituent catchments the sub region demarcation was conducted separately in the two large inner basins ib and qb fig 1a similar to zhang et al 2013 specifically we first calculated the mean aridity index for each of 477 catchments fig 2 in the ib and qb based on the hydrosheds watershed data lehner et al 2008 http www worldwildlife org hydrosheds and aridity index data from trabucco and zomer 2018 https cgiarcsi community then we divided the ib into western and eastern parts based on an aridity index threshold of 0 2 the division between arid and semi arid unep and thomas 1992 in the eastern ib catchments with continuous permafrost fig 1b are grouped as sub region s03 and other catchments with island permafrost and seasonally frozen ground are grouped as sub region s04 fig 1b in the western ib catchments with an aridity index 0 1 are grouped as sub region s02 catchments with an aridity index ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 and dominated by island permafrost and seasonally frozen ground are grouped as sub region s06 and other catchments 0 1 aridity index 0 2 are further grouped as sub regions s05 bsk and s01 bwk based on their dominate climate types fig 1c in the qb catchments with aridity index 0 1 are grouped as sub region s07 and catchments with aridity index 0 1 are grouped as sub region s08 these sub regions are shown in fig 2 and their details are listed in table 1 2 3 data sources and processing data from different sources table 2 are jointly used to provide more reliable estimates on meteorological and hydrological variables due to the coarse spatial resolution of these data regional means are calculated and used in the analysis 2 3 1 meteorological data annual and monthly mean air temperatures temp c of the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 yang et al 2010 were used in the study the cmfd data is a set of near surface meteorological reanalysis data yang et al 2010 which was developed based on several existing remote sensing reanalysis and observation datasets the cmfd temp data are only available from 1989 to 2018 a linear regression model for each sub region was constructed based on monthly cmfd temp and global land data assimilation system gldas temp for the period of 1989 2018 the model was then used to estimate monthly temp in 2019 based on gldas data for that year three sets of reanalysis precipitation prec mm data the cmfd global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 and era 5 hersbach et al 2020 were combined using a simple weighting scheme see section 3 1 for the study since the cmfd dataset has assimilated the gldas data the gldas prec is not used in the weighted combination to reduce data redundancy but is only used for estimating cmfd prec in 2019 using the same process as for estimating cmfd temp in 2019 monthly cmfd prec was then used for weighting with era 5 prec 2 3 2 hydrological data in this study variables including soil water content sw snow water equivalent swe and evapotranspiration et from gldas rodell et al 2004 and era 5 hersbach et al 2020 were combined and used in the mass balance calculation for consistency in spatial resolution and continuity in time periods monthly data of gldas noah lsms gldas noah v2 0 from 1989 to 2010 and v2 1 from 2000 to 2019 were used since gldas noah v2 0 and v2 1 were forced with different meteorological datasets but the same land surface parameters hiroko and rodell 2020 rodell et al 2004 the ratio of those two versions during the period of overlap 2000 2010 was calculated the ratio was then used to adjust the gldas noah v2 0 data from 1989 to 2000 to produce consistent gldas data wang et al 2020a the volumetric soil water content m3 m3 in era 5 was converted to water thickness mm of water equivalent based on layer depths the total sw and swe of gldas noah and era 5 were then used for a simple weighted combination see section 3 1 in addition to the gldas noah et and era 5 et a remote sensing based et data from the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 3a gleam martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2010 was also used in this study the gleam et is computed as a function of potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture stress according to bai and liu 2018 the gleam et data shows good consistency with ground flux tower observations in china because the gleam et is available through 2018 the three datasets were used for calculating weighted monthly et from 1989 to 2018 while only gldas noah and era 5 data were used in 2019 2 3 3 lake volume change glacier and permafrost data annual lake volume change of 977 lakes area 1 km2 in 1989 2019 in the endorheic tp was used in this study which was provided from our previous study wang et al 2021a lake volume change was estimated based on the lake area extracted from landsat imagery from jun to nov and lake surface elevation from digital elevation models dem which tends to be the maximum in a year more details on lake area and volume change can be found in wang et al 2021a since there are no detailed reports on the annual or monthly glacier and permafrost storage in the endorheic tp data from relevant literatures were used table 2 area and spatial distribution of glacier and permafrost are from the second glacier inventory dataset of china guo et al 2015 https data tpdc ac cn and the map of permafrost on the tibetan plateau 1 3 000 000 cheng et al 2012 https data tpdc ac cn respectively 2 3 4 grace and grace follow on twsa data two monthly grace fo twsa datasets grace fo rl06 mascon solutions from the center for space research csr of the university of texas save et al 2016 and grace fo rl06 global mascon from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl of nasa landerer et al 2020 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 were used to analyze storage variation in the study the difference in these two twsa datasets is mainly induced by different parameter settings and solution methods xie et al 2019a due to battery management issues of the grace satellite there are a few missing months in the twsa data landerer et al 2020 save et al 2016 xie et al 2019a these missing values are filled using a linear interpolation method based on the twsa of previous and following months wang et al 2020a xie et al 2019a it is worth noting that the linear filling was not conducted for the missing data between the two missions i e grace and grace follow on between july 2017 and may 2018 3 methods the overall workflow and major methods are illustrated in fig 3 and their details are discussed below 3 1 simple weighting method a simple weighting method i e ensemble mean which can provide a plausible optimal estimation based on available data aires 2014 pellet et al 2020 is used to calculate the monthly means of precipitation prec evapotranspiration et soil water anomaly swa snow water equivalent anomaly swea and terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa taking prec as an example its ensemble mean can be estimated as follows 1 prec sw 1 p 1 i 1 p k i σ k 2 k 1 p σ k 2 prec i where precsw is the simple weighted mean of prec mm p is the number of prec sources used for weighting σ i is the standard deviation of the preci and preci is the ith prec while this approach can reduce the uncertainty to a certain extent overall improvement in these data still depends on the supplement and improvement of ground observations 3 2 estimating tws change and its components the mass balance in the endorheic tp can be expressed as follows wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 2 tws s w s w e l w s p m i c e g w s where tws sw swe lws pm ice and gws are total water storage soil water storage snow water equivalent lake water storage permafrost water storage glacier ice water storage and groundwater storage respectively since the grace fo tws is actually the anomaly with respect to its mean baseline 2004 2009 i e twsa the anomaly of each component on the right side of equation 2 over the same period should be used the mass balance thus should be transformed as follows 3 twsa s w a s w e a l w s a p m a i c e a g w s a where twsa swa swea lwsa pma icea and gwsa are the anomalies of those components relative to their means in the period of 2004 2009 there are no annual or monthly ice and pm data in the endorheic tp and gws data are also not available in the reanalysis data i e gldas noah and era 5 in the study period in addition there are some inconsistence between the maximum lake water storage lws we calculated and the annual means of other components in a year so equation 4 bibi et al 2019 long et al 2017 seoane et al 2013 yeh et al 2006 was used to deduce the total storage of groundwater lake water glacier and permafrost glpia from twsa in the endorheic tp 4 glpia t w s a s w a s w e a where glpia is the anomaly of the total storage of groundwater lake water glacier and permafrost based on equation 3 terrestrial water storage change twsc and its components can also be expressed as follows 5 twsc s w c s w e c l w s c p m c i c e c g w s c where swc swec lwsc pmc icec and gwsc are the monthly or annual change in sw swe lws pm ice and gws respectively at the monthly time scale according to previous studies li et al 2016 pellet et al 2020 ramillien et al 2006 xie et al 2019a twsc for a month should be estimated by the double difference time derivative of twsa as the grace fo twsa is the mean value of a month rather than the instantaneous value so monthly twsc can be estimated as follows 6 twsc t t w s a t 1 t w s a t 1 2 δ t where twsc t is terrestrial water storage change for month t twsa t 1 and twsa t 1 are twsa for month t 1 and t 1 respectively the time period t is taken as one month in the study at the annual scale we assumed that lake volume reaches its maximum in august each year in the endorheic tp biskop et al 2016 qiao et al 2019 to be consistent with the change in lakes twsc during a hydrological year from august in previous year to july in this year for this study can be calculated as follows xie et al 2020 zeng et al 2012 7 twsc t t w s a t 8 t w s a t 1 8 where twsc t is the change of total terrestrial water storage in hydrological year t twsa t 8 and twsa t 1 8 are august value of twsa in years t and t 1 annual swc swec and lwsc are calculated using the same procedure as twsc equation 7 based on equation 5 annul total storage change in gws pm and ice for hydrological year t i e gpic t can be estimated as follows 8 g p i c t t w s c t l w s c t s w c t s w e c t where gpic t twsc t lwsc t swc t and swec t are the change of total storage in gws pm and ice total water storage lake water storage soil water storage and snow water storage for hydrological year t respectively the relative contribution rate of lakes as well as swc swec and gpic to the variation of total terrestrial water storage at an annual scale can be calculated as follows wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 9 rate lwsc lwsc s w c s w e c g p i c l w s c where rate lwsc is the contribution rate of lwsc to the change of total terrestrial water storage 3 3 random forest for extending twsa and twsc we used the random forest rf method to extend the grace data based on two widely used reanalysis datasets while the rf method is still a black box low interpretability and complexity compared with physical models high interpretability and complexity it has high flexibility ability to integrate different data without scaling and certain interpretability jing et al 2019 jing et al 2020 which may achieve a balance between interpretability and complexity xie et al 2019a found that different variable combinations produce large differences in twsa estimates in the tp in our early data exploration we also found that twsa and twsc estimates in different regions are quite different in their accuracy see section 4 2 twsc is critical to the analysis of changes in terrestrial water storage and contribution rates calculations and monthly twsa can be obtained through recursion by using existing grace fo and twsc based on equation 6 therefore in this study we use the rf method with different variable combinations table 3 to train april 2002 june 2017 and june 2018 nov 2019 and estimate jan 1989 mar 2002 and jul 2017 may 2018 monthly twsa and twsc for each sub region the 198 monthly grace fo twsa and twsc observations are randomly divided into training sets and test sets at a ratio of 7 3 for the rf model to reduce the risk of overfitting the training sets are used to determine the optimal parameters of the rf model according to the simulation results of 5 fold cross validation evaluation criteria including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and relative bias bias are chosen to evaluate model performance and to select the optimal model and variable combination scheme moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 xie et al 2019a these metrics are defined as follows 10a r 2 1 i 1 n y i f i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 10b rmse 1 n i 1 n y i f i 2 10c bias i 1 n y i f i i n y i where n is the number of months for the training sets n 138 or test sets n 60 yi and fi are observed i e grace fo and predicted monthly twsa or twsc respectively y i is the mean of simulated monthly twsa or twsc the optimal model with its variable combinations of each region was used to extend the time span of the grace fo twsa and twsc data from 2002 back to 1989 3 4 statistical method for trend test and change point detection for each sub region the slope of a linear regression model is used to indicate the change rate of each variable i e twsa swa swea and prec during the time period from 1989 to 2019 a positive slope indicates an upward trend while a negative slope indicates a downward trend daneshvar et al 2016 wang et al 2020b the non parametric pettitt statistic method is used to detect the mutation point of annual twsa which appears when the shift in the central tendency of a time series has been detected pettitt 1979 verstraeten et al 2006 this method is less sensitive to outliers and skewed data compared to other tests pettitt 1979 verstraeten et al 2006 and has been used for detecting the mutation point of water storage in the tp zhang et al 2017 the rank r 1 r n of a time series x 1 x n is used in the method 11 u k 2 i 1 k r i k n 1 where u k is the pettitt statistic n is the length of time series k 1 n r i is the rank of x i the probable mutation point is located where u k has its maximum absolute value pettitt 1979 verstraeten et al 2006 3 5 uncertainty analysis at a monthly time scale glpia is calculated as the residual of twsa swa and swea based on equation 4 therefore the uncertainty of glpia σ glpia can be computed as follows xie et al 2019a 12 σ glpia σ twsa 2 σ swa 2 σ swea 2 where σ twsa σ swa and σ swea are the uncertainty of monthly twsa swa and swea mm respectively as the ensemble mean see equation 1 of each variable was used taking twsa as an example its uncertainty can be estimated as follows pellet et al 2020 13 σ twsa 1 p 1 2 i 1 p k i σ k 2 k σ k 2 2 σ i 2 where p is the number of twsa data sources used in the weighting p 2 as twsa from grace fo csr and jpl were used in this study i e grace fo csr and jpl σ i is the standard deviation of the ith twsa the uncertainty of monthly swa swea prec and et are calculated following the similar approach for twsa 4 results 4 1 spatial and temporal variation of hydro climate variables during the period of 1989 2019 annual temperature temp precipitation prec and evapotranspiration et all show increasing trends i e slope 0 in both regions fig 4 g i the slope of prec in ib 3 995 mm a p 0 05 was higher than that in qb 2 20 mm a p 0 05 while the slopes of temp and et were lower than that in qb based on the mutation analysis of twsa in each region see section 4 3 1 the period from 1989 to 2019 pa is divided into two parts the pre mutation period p1 and the post mutation period p2 temp in both the ib and qb showed an increasing trend in p1 and p2 but the slope in p2 0 01 c a p 0 10 was smaller than that in p1 0 03 c a p 0 10 in ib and the slopes in the qb in the two periods were almost the same 0 09 c a p 0 05 the rapid increasing trend in prec in p1 was completely reversed in p2 in both regions both regions showed increasing trends of et over p1 and p2 after mutation however while the trend in the ib slowed down it increased further in the qb mean annual temp prec and et for each sub region during p1 p2 and pa are illustrated in fig 4 a c the hinterland of qb s07 has the highest mean temp 2 62 c and the lowest prec 78 54 mm and et 65 50 mm from p1 to p2 positive temp p 2 p 1 where p 1 and p 2 are the mean of selected variables in p1 and p2 respectively was found in all the sub regions except for s01 and s02 for prec the only negative prec was found in s04 prec was 80 mm in s02 and s06 in the western ib as for et the only negative et was found in s05 in pa all variables showed increasing trends except for the insignificant decreasing trend of temp in s01 slope 0 02 c a p 0 10 and et in s05 slope 0 55 mm a p 0 10 fig 4d f the increasing trend of prec in p1 was higher than that in p2 and the trend in s01 s03 s05 and s08 was completely reversed during p2 indicating that the overall increase of prec in pa mainly came from the increase in p1 in most sub regions 4 2 estimates of twsa and twsc the rf model was used to estimate and extend twsa and twsc in each region input variables were based on the mass balance equations 3 and 5 three performance metrics including r2 rmse and bias were used and their values under different variable combinations for the training sets and test sets in each region are illustrated in fig 5 rf models with a rmse and bias value closer to 0 and an r2 value closer to 1 indicates better performance because twsa tends to have a larger range than twsc does twsa s rmse is also larger than that of twsc fig 5 as such rmse is mainly used for comparing models for the same predictor while the comparison between twsa and twsc is mainly based on r2 and bias based on the performance higher r2 and lower rmse and bias of the test sets the optimal rf model with its variable combination for each region was selected and listed in table 4 the estimates for the training sets and the test sets under the optimal variable combination are shown in fig 6 which indicates that with appropriate variable selection the rf model can achieve high accuracy estimates for twsa and twsc in all regions with a minimum r2 of 0 5 figs 6 7 and fig s1 on the whole the rf models can reproduce the seasonal and annual variations of twsa and twsc well fig 7 and fig s1 though there are some underestimates and overestimates of the high value and low value in all the regions the optimal models were then used to extend the data records of twsa or twsc in each region for regions using twsa i e qb s02 s04 s06 s07 and s08 monthly twsc values were calculated according to equation 6 monthly twsa values in other regions were obtained through recursion using the grace fo observations and rf estimated twsc with equation 6 the extended before the grace period and estimated during the grace period twsa time series were used for further analysis we also compared the recursively obtained twsa with grace observations fig 7a c e and g and found that although the biases are still large for some regions e g s05 fig 7g or specific periods e g aug 2018 to dec 2019 in the ib fig 7a its accuracy was greatly improved compared with the direct estimation of twsa in the regions 4 3 variation in annual twsa and its components 4 3 1 years of twsa mutation the pettitt non parametric test was used to find the twsa mutation year in each region and the results are listed in table 5 to better understand tws response to climate change the time period from 1989 to 2019 pa was divided into two stages p1 before mutation and p2 after mutation including the mutation year for each region because the two mutation years are very close in s05 and s06 the first mutation year is regarded as the end year of p1 i e p1 of s05 is 1989 2003 p1 of s06 is 1989 1995 this time period division is also used in the analysis of other variables such as prec temp et see section 4 1 swa and so on see section 4 3 3 4 3 2 variation in annual twsa annual twsa for each region and their trend slopes are illustrated in fig 8 both the ib 2 20 mm a and qb 0 26 mm a have a positive trend slope in annual twsa during pa indicating an overall increase in twsa for the sub regions in the ib annual twsa showed decreasing trends in the western and southern ib 0 62 0 14 mm a and increasing trends in the other sub regions 4 76 10 83 mm a there are varying temporal patterns in annual twsa in different regions and time periods annual twsa decreased during p1 in both the ib 0 65 mm a and qb 3 51 mm a but increased during p2 fig 7a and b for the sub regions in the ib s01 s03 and s05 showed similar temporal patterns although their mutation years and trend slopes were different the temporal pattern in s08 was basically similar to that in the qb it is also worth noting that annual twsa decreased around 2015 in all regions with decreased prec at the same time fig 4 indicating that prec may play a driving role in inter annual variation of twsa 4 3 3 variations in swa swea and glpia annual swa 0 33 mm a and swea 0 11 mm a showed a significantly p 0 05 decreasing trend in the ib fig 9 g and 9 h while a significantly increasing trend was found in glpia slope 2 64 mm a p 0 05 during pa fig 9i annual swa in the ib first increased in p1 and then decreased in p2 but the opposite occurred in the qb glpia in both regions decreased first in p1 and then increased in p2 the mean and trend slope of annual swa swea and glpia for each sub region during the period of p1 p2 and pa are illustrated in fig 9 a f from p1 to p2 negative swa was found in the eastern ib s01 s03 s04 and s05 while positive swa was found in western ib s02 and s06 indicating that swa decrease in the ib mainly occurred in the eastern ib and the increase of swa in the qb was mainly occurred in the high mountain area i e s08 glpia trend in pa showed just the opposite of swa in each sub region in the ib fig 9f glpia was positive in most sub regions in the ib except for s04 so the increase of glpia in the ib was mainly from the eastern ib as the degradation of permafrost and glaciers in the tp increases with climate warming yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2013 the rapid increase of glpia during p2 may come from groundwater and or lakes 4 3 4 changes of lake water storage the trend slopes of annual lws for each of the 977 lakes area 1 km2 during the periods of p1 p2 and pa are illustrated in fig 10 a c for comparison between regions annual total lws in each region was converted into water depth in mm fig 10d during pa most lakes 907 977 showed increasing trends and lakes with higher increasing trends slope 0 15 km3 were mostly located in the eastern ib fig 10c with s03 slope 1 68 mm a p 0 05 and s04 slope 1 14 mm a p 0 05 showing the highest increasing rates fig 10e s07 is the only region showing a minor decreasing trend slope 0 002 mm a p 0 1 fig 10e the total lws in the ib slope 5 23 mm a and qb slope 0 05 mm a both showed significant increasing trends p 0 05 during pa from p1 to p2 the rapidly increasing trend slope 3 23 mm a p 0 05 in the ib further increased slope 5 22 mm a p 0 05 while the decreasing trend slope 0 03 mm a p 0 1 in the qb changed to an increasing trend slope 0 02 mm a p 0 1 fig 10e the number of lakes with a decreasing trend during p1 200 977 was comparable to that of p2 228 977 but the spatial distribution of these lakes was somewhat different fig 10a and b in the ib shrinking lakes were mainly located in the periphery areas of s02 southern s04 eastern s01 and s06 during p1 fig 10a in p2 shrinking lakes were mainly located in western s02 central s03 and s05 and southeastern s04 fig 10b rapidly expanding lakes slope 0 15 km3 a were mainly located in s04 during p1 fig 10a but in s03 during p2 fig 10b resulting in the highest slope 2 01 mm a p 0 05 in s03 during p2 among all eight sub regions fig 10e 4 4 component contributions to twsc to better recognize the variation in twsc its mean value under different scenarios i e twsc 0 and twsc 0 over different periods was calculated table 6 scenario p1 p2 and pa refer to component contributions during the pre mutation post mutation and entire study period in addition years with negative twsc i e storage deficit and referred to as p1 p2 and pa and years with positive twsc i e storage surplus referred to as p1 p2 and pa within the three periods were also selected as scenarios the contribution rate of swc swec lwsc and gpic to twsc under these scenarios for each region was calculated as illustrated in fig 11 during pa the twsc of the ib was mainly determined by lwsc rate 0 624 followed by gpic rate 0 327 and the contribution rate of swc and swec was minor fig 11a the twsc of the qb on the other hand was mainly determined by swc rate 0 426 followed by gpic rate 0 298 and lwsc rate 0 274 fig 11b for the sub regions of the ib and qb the dominate component of twsc during pa was gpic in s01 s02 s03 s05 s07 and s08 swc in s06 and both gpic and lwsc in s04 it is interesting that the contribution rate of lwsc was relatively small 0 05 during both p1 and p2 in the qb but the rate during pa was moderate rate 0 274 which may be caused by the offset of the positive and negative gpic in the two periods fig 11b the surplus during p2 in the ib was mainly caused by the greater positive effect of lwsc and the transformation of the effect of gwsc from negative to positive fig 11a while the surplus in the qb was mainly because the negative contributions of gpic and swc both turned positive and with minor variation in the absolute value of their contribution rate fig 11b similar transformation patterns and component contributions in the qb were also found in its two sub regions i e s07 and s08 fig 11i and j higher lwsc contribution rates were found in the ib fig 11a and its two southeastern sub regions s03 and s04 fig 11e and f and a higher lws increasing rate was also found in these regions see fig 10d which indicates higher effects of lws in the regional hydrological cycle in these regions the magnitude of lwsc contribution rate under storage surplus scenarios i e p1 p2 and pa was mostly higher than that under storage deficit scenarios i e p1 p2 and pa fig 11a e and f indicating that lwsc has a more significant effect on the increase of regional water storage in the ib twsc under storage surplus scenarios was mainly determined by lwsc while the dominant component under storage deficit scenarios was more complicated fig 11a for the qb twsc under both surplus and deficit scenarios was determined by gpic fig 11b 5 discussions 5 1 uncertainties and limitations the uncertainties of monthly prec et swa swea twsa and glpia were calculated based on equations 12 and 13 for each region table s3 there are large uncertainties in these variables and the uncertainties differ in regions according to previous studies xie et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 noah sw has the lowest error among all gldas products and it was used in the study a scaling factor was calculated and applied to make consistent the two versions of gldas noah data which also inevitably brings some uncertainty we combined era 5 and gldas noah reanalysis datasets to estimate different hydrological variables using the simple weighting method pellet et al 2020 this approach can reduce the uncertainty to a certain extent but the overall improvement in these data still depends on the supplement and improvement of ground observations which is still very urgent for the region grace fo satellite observations i e twsa also have some uncertainty as shown in table s3 and the comparison between prec et and twsc i e water balance analysis fig s2 and supplementary text s2 further illustrates the uncertainty in prec et and twsc similar to many previous studies jing et al 2020 wang et al 2020a xie et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 we used two different data sources to reduce the uncertainty of twsa in addition due to the coarse spatial resolution of the data its uncertainty increases as study area decreases abiy and melesse 2017 in this study we resampled the data to a finer spatial resolution to reduce the error when clipping the data to the sub regions abiy and melesse 2017 xie et al 2019a both the regional approach and the resampling method can reduce uncertainty and error to some extent but it still has a great risk using the data in small sub regions due to the original coarse spatial resolution many researchers have adopted spatial downscaling methods to improve the spatial resolution of twsa abiy and melesse 2017 seyoum and milewski 2017 and we will consider this approach in future research due to the short time span of grace fo data rf models were built to extend twsa in this study the results indicate that this approach can obtain accurate estimates of twsa or twsc and is very effective for extending grace fo observations however there are still some underestimation or overestimation on extreme values and for some regions the estimated twsa still has a large bias e g s05 which could affect analysis accuracy in addition the extended twsa i e before the grace period has not been validated by other independent data limited by data availability we treated groundwater glaciers permafrost i e gpic as a whole however under climate change their change characteristics e g magnitude variability and duration are quite different individual component changes and the exchange and feedback among them need further study in the future when data is available 5 2 feasibility and interpretability of random forest models in this study the feasibility of the rf method mainly refers to whether the method can be used to estimate and reconstruct twsa time series similar to other related studies chakraborty et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 it was validated by comparing model estimates with available grace twsa and twsc observations which indicates that the calibrated rf models with optimal forcing variables and parameters can provide reasonable estimates moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 therefore the rf method is feasible in reconstructing twsa and twsc time series in the region we also found that the rf models performed differently in estimating twsa and twsc in different regions there are two possible reasons for this difference based on the temporal variation characteristics e g significant trend or fluctuation of twsa in these regions we speculate that one possible reason is that the rf method might be better at capturing fluctuations for example significant trends p 0 05 were found in regions with better model estimates of twsc such as ib s01 and s03 while not significant trends were found in regions with better model estimates of twsa another possible reason is forcing variable selection although the rf model can provide good estimation of twsa and twsc there are still some problems with forcing variable selection in this study for example due to the lack of data groundwater storage is not available as a forcing variable which may have a greater impact on model performance in some regions xie et al 2019a as confirmed by the contribution rate of glpic table 7 region s01 and most of the forcing variables do not reflect the memory effect of twsa xu et al 2018 except for swa and swea with minor possibility the interpretability of the rf method mainly refers to its ability to quantify the importance i e contribution rate in our study of different forcing variables chakraborty et al 2021 gilpin et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2016 shortridge et al 2016 xu and liang 2021 to further understand and verify this we compared the contribution rates from the rf method with those estimated by the conventional mass balance approach table 7 the comparison indicates that the magnitude of the contribution rates from the two methods is somewhat different but the orders of their magnitude and identified dominate components are basically the same algorithmically feature importance in rf is calculated based on the modeling error difference for out of bag samples with and without noise for all trees breiman 2001 as the rf trees are built based on random selection of variables and samples the method has a non linear model structure and it can assess variables importance by quantifying their contributions to the nodes of the trees in a model breiman 2001 jing et al 2019 xie et al 2019b on the contrary the mass balance approach acts like a general linear model where each storage component has the same weight of 1 i e twsc swc swec lwsc gpic the two methods have their own merits and limits for estimating contribution rates benefiting from its non linear structure and random sampling of training data and variables the rf method could provide a more reliable and comprehensive estimation of the contribution of each variable especially for long term time series data however as a data driven method the rf method requires more data to train the model and its result may not be as reliable with small training datasets furthermore the rf method cannot reveal the negative or positive effects of different storage components as it lacks physical meanings conversely the contribution rate derived from the mass balance equation has a clear physical meaning and its calculation is very simple zhang et al 2013 and the approach also can be used even with small data sets and can provide the negative or positive effects of each storage change to twsc this approach however may not be suitable for long term time series data e g multi annual as there is the potential that the positive change of a storage component in some years could be offset by its negative change in other years resulting in a weak impact on total water storage change e g swc effects in s04 over p1 fig 11f as such the dominant component s identified by the index could be biased or wrong another limit is that the index may smooth out temporal variation because of its averaging approach and therefore may not guarantee consistent results between short term and long term data 5 3 intensified hydrological cycle and spatial temporal heterogeneity with the increase of prec and rising temp the exchange between land surface and the atmosphere has intensified in the region overall we find that not only most of the storage variables twsa lws and gws have increased but the exchanges between these components i e change of storage and the exchanges with other systems e g atmosphere and vegetation have increased i e increased flux indicating an intensified regional hydrological cycle in the endorheic tp based on the extended long term twsa and twsc data we have revealed some new findings on the hydrological variation in the region we found the difference between the eastern and western ib in addition to the difference between the northern and southern ib reported by deng et al 2018 and wang et al 2020a the western ib s02 is located mainly in continuous permafrost but its temporal variation in twsa is more similar to that of the qb and southern ib s04 and s06 however the processes and mechanisms causing the changes in s02 and the southern ib s04 and s06 may not be the same although the slope of prec is large the total amount of prec in s02 is still small compared with other sub regions the region has the largest proportion of glaciers see table 1 and the effect of glacier changes in twsa is more significant lei et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2017 according to zhang et al 2020b the glacier in the north western s02 showed an increasing trend in p2 from the early 2000s but a larger decreasing trend in p1 so the overall decrease in glacier storage may offset the increase in other water storage e g sw and lws caused by prec at regional level therefore twsa maintains a relatively stable state fig 8 and the inter annual variation of twsc is also small as it is determined by prec et fig s2 we also found that annual twsa decreased in the pre mutation period and then quickly increased in the post mutation period in both the ib and qb the prior decreasing trend was not well reported in previous studies deng et al 2018 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 because of the short time span of grace data used in those studies zhang et al 2017 found that lwsc 52 contributed the highest rate in twsc in the ib followed by gwsc 34 during the period of 2003 2009 in our study during p2 2006 2019 we found a higher lwsc contribution rate 65 indicating that the positive effect of lwsc has been further enhanced especially in water storage surplus periods in water storage deficit periods swc has a higher contribution rate than lwsc and the effect of lwsc varied among sub regions none of these findings have been reported by previous studies deng et al 2018 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 the difference between the southern and northern ib is mainly due to different permafrost types in the northern ib s01 s03 and s05 dominated with continuous permafrost ground ice melts as temp increases zhang et al 2017 and soil permeability tends to increase woo et al 2008 the hydraulic exchange between surface water and suprapermafrost water increases accordingly liu et al 2020 and aquifer activity increases as well wang et al 2009 woo et al 2008 this may lead to increased recharge from suprapermafrost water and surface water to lakes liu et al 2020 resulting in an increase in lws seasonal frozen ground and island permafrost are mainly located in the southern ib s04 and s06 with some continuous permafrost in s04 in the regions with island permafrost permafrost degradation may lead to the expansion of taliks liu et al 2020 wang et al 2009 yoshikawa and hinzman 2003 which connects island permafrost with surrounding groundwater system and discharges more subpermafrost water and groundwater to lakes jepsen et al 2013 liu et al 2020 with the drainage of groundwater lakes continue to expand and groundwater continues to decline in s06 for s04 with temp increase some continuous permafrost may be transformed into island permafrost or seasonal frozen ground and some island permafrost may also be degraded from p1 to p2 the permafrost degradation was intensified with continuous temperature increase in s04 so the influence of continuous permafrost in this region was weakened this may be the reason why glpia increased in p1 and decreased in p2 despite the continuous increase in prec in this region 5 4 difference between twsa and twsc based on our results and other studies deng et al 2018 lv et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020a we found there are some differences between twsa and twsc firstly the magnitude and sign of twsa and twsc have different meanings in general the higher the twsa the greater the regional water storage the higher the absolute value of twsc twsc the faster the exchange of water storage and regional hydrological cycle positive and negative twsa indicate whether the tws during certain time periods e g day month and year is higher or lower than its time series mean positive and or negative twsc means water storage surplus or deficit in a certain period compared to a previous time period secondly twsa includes not only the information at the current time e g prec et and twsc at time t but also the information in the previous time e g twsa at time t 1 and twsc at previous time however twsc is only determined by the input and output at the current time according to the water balance equation twsct prect ett rt lv et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020a thirdly twsc is more directly related to other water balance terms e g prec and et than twsa is lv et al 2020 twsa at the current time on the other hand is more closely related to the cumulative water balance term in a previous time and is more closely related to cumulative prec so although twsa is a direct measurement of water storage twsc may be more suitable for analyzing the impact of climate change finally the long term trends of annual twsa and twsc also have different meanings and magnitude twsa trend is the same as tws trend but is different from twsc trend a positive twsa trend indicates increasing regional water storage and vice versa for a negative trend a positive trend slope of absolute twsc i e twsc means an accelerated hydrological cycle the contribution rates of different water storage components change e g swc swec lwsc and gpic to twsc are also quite different from those of different components anomalies e g swa swea lwsa and gipa to twsa 6 conclusions using rf models and the ensemble means of hydrological and climatic variables we reconstructed a long term 1989 2019 time series of twsa and twsc for each region in the endorheic tp based on the data and through the mass balance approach we analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of twsa and its different components as well as the contribution of each component to twsc our key findings are summarized below 1 prec temp and et all showed increasing trends in both ib and qb in pa indicating overall climate warming and wetting in the endorheic tp the southern ib has a stronger warming trend than the northern ib and the western ib has a stronger wetting trend than the eastern ib the overall reduction of warming and wetting in p2 in ib mainly comes from the north eastern ib 2 the rf method achieved excellent estimates with the training datasets even with very limited data but the performance with the test datasets differs greatly with regions and variable combinations twsc can be an alternative when the twsa estimate is poor and prec and et can improve the performance while temp has less effect the underestimation or overestimation may be due to the lack of groundwater data and the rf method is very effective for estimating hydrological variables in data scarce regions 3 the hydrological cycle has intensified in the endorheic tp during the study period especially in eastern ib annual twsa decreased during p1 in both the ib 0 65 mm a and qb 3 51 mm a while increased during p2 and pa annual glpia in both the ib 2 64 mm a and qb 0 23 mm a showed a similar variation pattern as that of twsa during pa the unreported difference in eastern and western ib is mainly caused by the differences in precipitation magnitude glacier proportions and permafrost types we also found that twsa is more related to the magnitude of precipitation while twsc is more related to precipitation change 4 during the whole period twsc in the ib was mainly determined by lwsc followed by gpic while twsc in the qb was mainly determined by swc followed by gpic and lwsc the effects of lwsc on twsc were more significant in the ib and especially in its southeastern sub regions for a long term twsc time series rf models can provide a more reasonable interpretation of component contributions than the mass balance approach does indicating the method is a good hydrological inference tool credit authorship contribution

department of geography and atmospheric science university of kansas lawrence 66045 usa department of geography and atmospheric science university of kansas lawrence 66045 usa terrestrial water storage tws and its change twsc are extremely sensitive to climate change and are good indicators of the response of the hydrological system to climate change in the tibetan plateau tp however long term variation in tws and its components as well as contributions of these component changes to twsc are still not well documented in this study we extended monthly tws anomaly twsa and twsc from 1989 to 2019 using the random forest rf method analyzed the long term contribution rates of each component change to twsc using a mass balance approach and compared them with the rates estimated by the rf method our major findings are 1 the warming and wetting trend in the entire analysis period pa and in the pre mutation period p1 was slowed down or even reversed in the post mutation period p2 which was caused mainly by the decrease in temperature and precipitation in the north eastern inner basin ib and southern qaidam basin qb 2 the rf method is capable of estimating monthly twsa and twsc 0 872 r2 0 957 in training data 0 528 r2 0 860 in test data variable selection has an important impact on the method and twsc can be used as an alternative when twsa estimate is poor 3 significant annual twsa increase 2 20 mm a p 0 05 in the ib during pa comes from a higher increase during p2 3 62 mm a p 0 05 and a small variation during p1 0 65 m a p 0 1 spatially the increase is attributed to the higher increase trends 4 50 mm a p 0 05 in north eastern ib during pa and p2 and slight decrease in western and southern ib during pa the spatial and temporal heterogeneity was mainly caused by the differences in precipitation amount glacier proportions and permafrost types 4 during pa twsc in the ib was mainly determined by lake water storage change lwsc with a contribution rate of 62 while in the qb it was mainly determined by soil water change 43 and lwsc had a contribution rate of 27 lwsc impact on twsc was more significant in the ib especially in the southeastern sub regions with regional water storage surplus twsc 0 the overall increase in water storages and fluxes and exchanges imply an intensified hydrologic cycle in the region keywords grace mass balance random forest contribution rate terrestrial water storage change 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is a fundamental state variable of the terrestrial hydrological cycle deng et al 2020 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a it provides an overall status of a hydrological system deng et al 2018 watkins et al 2015 xiang et al 2016 which includes soil water sw snow water equivalent swe surface water in lakes lws permafrost pm glacial ice ice and groundwater gws wang et al 2020a xiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 and is especially useful for endorheic basins without surface stream inflow and outflow i e the main flux of hydrological systems due to the harsh environment low air temperature high elevation strong radiation and low air pressure human activities have little impact on the alpine hydrological system in the endorheic tibetan plateau tp li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a as such tws as well as its components and its change are good indicators that reflect the impacts of climate change jing et al 2019 wang et al 2020a xie et al 2019b yeh et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 additionally water storage and its change are closely related to flow conditions bibi et al 2019 deng et al 2018 high soil water storage may produce large and quick runoff with the same amount of precipitation and flow variability can be adjusted and buffered by water storage abiy and melesse 2017 bibi et al 2019 kuriqi et al 2020 so understanding water storage can also promote our understanding of streamflow processes and their variability li et al 2016 xie et al 2019a since april 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites and the successor grace follow on mission from june 2018 to the present began providing direct measurements of global tws and its anomaly twsa the products of grace and grace follow on grace fo have been used in the estimation of groundwater storage xiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 glacier loss zhang et al 2013 lake water storage change zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 and total basin discharge xie et al 2019a however its short time span limits its application in the analysis of the impacts of climate change usually no 30 years in climatology analysis this lack of long term data leads to some apparently conflicting phenomena in the region for example in the inner basin ib of the endorheic tp fig 1 an increase trend in precipitation began slowing down or even reversing in the 2000s but twsa showed a significant increasing trend during the period of 2002 2016 wang et al 2020a and in the southern ib precipitation continued an increasing trend after 2000 but twsa showed a decreasing trend wang et al 2020a to solve these puzzles it is necessary to explore the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the changes in the hydrological cycle and to analyze the effects of different storage components on twsa changes twsc using long term hydrological and climatic time series data however such studies in the endorheic tp are few and far between meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2013 machine learning methods have been more and more applied in various fields of the geosciences and have shown promising results jing et al 2019 jing et al 2020 xie et al 2019a xie et al 2019b however a key issue and challenge is the interpretability of these methods schmidt et al 2020 shortridge et al 2016 machine learning models are still black boxes similar to traditional statistical methods as they do not model the mechanisms of physical processes involved the random forest rf method is a popular and effective machine learning method jing et al 2019 jing et al 2020 xie et al 2019b which has a certain degree of interpretability compared with other methods such as artificial neural networks ann and support vector machines svm xie et al 2019b ostad ali askari et al 2017 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 because of its tree based model structure rf can evaluate variables importance by quantifying their contributions to trees nodes breiman 2001 jing et al 2020 strobl et al 2009 the contributions however only indicate the importance of different variables or features in the classification or regression without knowing their real physical meanings jing et al 2019 based on the water balance we can also estimate the contribution rates of different storage components to twsc which have clear physical meanings by comparing the rates from the two approaches it helps us understand the feasibility and interpretability of the rates estimated by the rf method with climate warming and wetting in the region there have been numerous studies on the changes in one or several components in the endorheic tibetan plateau tp including terrestrial water storage deng et al 2018 soil water wang et al 2020a glaciers zhang et al 2013 snow pulliainen et al 2020 lakes zhang et al 2020a evapotranspiration et yin et al 2013 and groundwater bibi et al 2019 however there are few comprehensive explorations about whether the hydrological cycle is accelerating or decelerating li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b which is an unsolved key issue in hydrology bloschl et al 2019 for example the rapid expansion of lakes in recent years has attracted great attention lei et al 2013 qiao et al 2019 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a but existing studies mostly focus on a few lakes or basins biskop et al 2016 ding et al 2018 lei et al 2013 and there is a lack of study on the long term effects of lws change in regional hydrological cycles yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 for example zhang et al 2017 studied the effects of lake water storage change on total water storage in the ib for a very limited time period 2003 2009 simultaneously the climate hydro geomorphology and cryosphere in the region are quite complex fig 1 and lake water storage variation in different parts of the region and time periods has been reported qiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b so the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of lake water storage change and its impacts on regional water storage variation as well as other storage components need further exploration in this study we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the spatial and temporal variation in tws and its different components in response to climate change in the endorheic tp the main objectives of the study are 1 to identify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of long term 1989 2019 variation in tws and its components 2 to determine whether the regional hydrological cycle intensified or weakened 3 to test the feasibility and interpretability of the random forest method in estimating twsa and twsc and 4 to detect the effects of different storage components to twsc particularly the effects of lakes in the endorheic tp the novelties of this study are mainly in three aspects 1 we compared for the first time the contribution rates of water storage components estimated from the rf model with those from the traditional mass balance approach and we evaluated the rf method on estimating both twsa and twsc while most of the existing studies only focused on twsa jing et al 2020 landerer et al 2020 li et al 2021 2 we analyzed the lake effect on tws change for the first time using newly developed long term 1989 2019 comprehensive lake volume data all lakes 1 km2 wang et al 2021a https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5543615 and 3 we analyzed the contribution rates under different hydrological conditions i e storage surplus vs deficit with finer sub regions while previous studies mainly focused on either the trend of entire study period or in the pre and post mutation periods with coarse sub regions deng et al 2018 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 the study can provide useful information for water resource management and rational water utilization under the changing environment in the tp 2 materials and datasets 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the endorheic region of the tibetan plateau tp 29 38 39 21 n 78 38 99 17 e with a total area of approximately 14 22 105 km2 fig 1a accounting for about 32 of the entire tp the region consists of the inner basin ib and the qaidam basin qb zhang et al 2013 and both of them have many endorheic sub basins of different sizes fig 2 controlled by local topography there are no large rivers but numerous lakes with varying sizes in this region according to zhang et al 2019 total lake area in this region accounted for 73 87 of the total lake area in the tp in 2018 the region has a vast number of glaciers and a large area of snow coverage in the high mountains especially in the ib fig 1a continuous permafrost is perennial in the northern ib and in the high mountains at the south edge of the qb while seasonal frozen ground is widely distributed across the qb and intertwined with island permafrost in southern ib fig 1b about 69 of lakes in the tp lie in the permafrost region liu et al 2020 glaciers snow permafrost and lakes form a unique alpine cryospheric hydrological system in the region according to the köppen geiger climate classification beck et al 2018 the climate gradually transitions from arid desert cold bwk to arid steppe cold bsk and then to polar tundra pt along the west east direction in the ib and along the north south direction in the qb fig 1c the defining criteria of these climate types can be found in table s1 and more details can be found in beck et al 2018 and peel et al 2007 the ib is dominated by the indian monsoon in summer and westerlies in winter yang et al 2017 and its annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 650 mm with 60 90 of it falling between june and september the mean annual air temperature in the ib is 4 956 c 1989 2019 table 1 the qb is influenced by the indian and east asian monsoons during summer yao et al 2012 annual mean air temperature is 4 8 c in the plain area and is 1 5 c in the periphery mountains areas annual precipitation in the qb ranges from 25 to 485 mm and mainly falls from april to november bibi et al 2019 2 2 sub region demarcation due to the complex climate hydro geomorphology and cryosphere we divide the endorheic tp into eight sub regions based on an aridity index watershed lake distribution permafrost type and climate type of its constituent catchments the sub region demarcation was conducted separately in the two large inner basins ib and qb fig 1a similar to zhang et al 2013 specifically we first calculated the mean aridity index for each of 477 catchments fig 2 in the ib and qb based on the hydrosheds watershed data lehner et al 2008 http www worldwildlife org hydrosheds and aridity index data from trabucco and zomer 2018 https cgiarcsi community then we divided the ib into western and eastern parts based on an aridity index threshold of 0 2 the division between arid and semi arid unep and thomas 1992 in the eastern ib catchments with continuous permafrost fig 1b are grouped as sub region s03 and other catchments with island permafrost and seasonally frozen ground are grouped as sub region s04 fig 1b in the western ib catchments with an aridity index 0 1 are grouped as sub region s02 catchments with an aridity index ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 and dominated by island permafrost and seasonally frozen ground are grouped as sub region s06 and other catchments 0 1 aridity index 0 2 are further grouped as sub regions s05 bsk and s01 bwk based on their dominate climate types fig 1c in the qb catchments with aridity index 0 1 are grouped as sub region s07 and catchments with aridity index 0 1 are grouped as sub region s08 these sub regions are shown in fig 2 and their details are listed in table 1 2 3 data sources and processing data from different sources table 2 are jointly used to provide more reliable estimates on meteorological and hydrological variables due to the coarse spatial resolution of these data regional means are calculated and used in the analysis 2 3 1 meteorological data annual and monthly mean air temperatures temp c of the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 yang et al 2010 were used in the study the cmfd data is a set of near surface meteorological reanalysis data yang et al 2010 which was developed based on several existing remote sensing reanalysis and observation datasets the cmfd temp data are only available from 1989 to 2018 a linear regression model for each sub region was constructed based on monthly cmfd temp and global land data assimilation system gldas temp for the period of 1989 2018 the model was then used to estimate monthly temp in 2019 based on gldas data for that year three sets of reanalysis precipitation prec mm data the cmfd global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 and era 5 hersbach et al 2020 were combined using a simple weighting scheme see section 3 1 for the study since the cmfd dataset has assimilated the gldas data the gldas prec is not used in the weighted combination to reduce data redundancy but is only used for estimating cmfd prec in 2019 using the same process as for estimating cmfd temp in 2019 monthly cmfd prec was then used for weighting with era 5 prec 2 3 2 hydrological data in this study variables including soil water content sw snow water equivalent swe and evapotranspiration et from gldas rodell et al 2004 and era 5 hersbach et al 2020 were combined and used in the mass balance calculation for consistency in spatial resolution and continuity in time periods monthly data of gldas noah lsms gldas noah v2 0 from 1989 to 2010 and v2 1 from 2000 to 2019 were used since gldas noah v2 0 and v2 1 were forced with different meteorological datasets but the same land surface parameters hiroko and rodell 2020 rodell et al 2004 the ratio of those two versions during the period of overlap 2000 2010 was calculated the ratio was then used to adjust the gldas noah v2 0 data from 1989 to 2000 to produce consistent gldas data wang et al 2020a the volumetric soil water content m3 m3 in era 5 was converted to water thickness mm of water equivalent based on layer depths the total sw and swe of gldas noah and era 5 were then used for a simple weighted combination see section 3 1 in addition to the gldas noah et and era 5 et a remote sensing based et data from the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 3a gleam martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2010 was also used in this study the gleam et is computed as a function of potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture stress according to bai and liu 2018 the gleam et data shows good consistency with ground flux tower observations in china because the gleam et is available through 2018 the three datasets were used for calculating weighted monthly et from 1989 to 2018 while only gldas noah and era 5 data were used in 2019 2 3 3 lake volume change glacier and permafrost data annual lake volume change of 977 lakes area 1 km2 in 1989 2019 in the endorheic tp was used in this study which was provided from our previous study wang et al 2021a lake volume change was estimated based on the lake area extracted from landsat imagery from jun to nov and lake surface elevation from digital elevation models dem which tends to be the maximum in a year more details on lake area and volume change can be found in wang et al 2021a since there are no detailed reports on the annual or monthly glacier and permafrost storage in the endorheic tp data from relevant literatures were used table 2 area and spatial distribution of glacier and permafrost are from the second glacier inventory dataset of china guo et al 2015 https data tpdc ac cn and the map of permafrost on the tibetan plateau 1 3 000 000 cheng et al 2012 https data tpdc ac cn respectively 2 3 4 grace and grace follow on twsa data two monthly grace fo twsa datasets grace fo rl06 mascon solutions from the center for space research csr of the university of texas save et al 2016 and grace fo rl06 global mascon from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl of nasa landerer et al 2020 watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 were used to analyze storage variation in the study the difference in these two twsa datasets is mainly induced by different parameter settings and solution methods xie et al 2019a due to battery management issues of the grace satellite there are a few missing months in the twsa data landerer et al 2020 save et al 2016 xie et al 2019a these missing values are filled using a linear interpolation method based on the twsa of previous and following months wang et al 2020a xie et al 2019a it is worth noting that the linear filling was not conducted for the missing data between the two missions i e grace and grace follow on between july 2017 and may 2018 3 methods the overall workflow and major methods are illustrated in fig 3 and their details are discussed below 3 1 simple weighting method a simple weighting method i e ensemble mean which can provide a plausible optimal estimation based on available data aires 2014 pellet et al 2020 is used to calculate the monthly means of precipitation prec evapotranspiration et soil water anomaly swa snow water equivalent anomaly swea and terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa taking prec as an example its ensemble mean can be estimated as follows 1 prec sw 1 p 1 i 1 p k i σ k 2 k 1 p σ k 2 prec i where precsw is the simple weighted mean of prec mm p is the number of prec sources used for weighting σ i is the standard deviation of the preci and preci is the ith prec while this approach can reduce the uncertainty to a certain extent overall improvement in these data still depends on the supplement and improvement of ground observations 3 2 estimating tws change and its components the mass balance in the endorheic tp can be expressed as follows wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 2 tws s w s w e l w s p m i c e g w s where tws sw swe lws pm ice and gws are total water storage soil water storage snow water equivalent lake water storage permafrost water storage glacier ice water storage and groundwater storage respectively since the grace fo tws is actually the anomaly with respect to its mean baseline 2004 2009 i e twsa the anomaly of each component on the right side of equation 2 over the same period should be used the mass balance thus should be transformed as follows 3 twsa s w a s w e a l w s a p m a i c e a g w s a where twsa swa swea lwsa pma icea and gwsa are the anomalies of those components relative to their means in the period of 2004 2009 there are no annual or monthly ice and pm data in the endorheic tp and gws data are also not available in the reanalysis data i e gldas noah and era 5 in the study period in addition there are some inconsistence between the maximum lake water storage lws we calculated and the annual means of other components in a year so equation 4 bibi et al 2019 long et al 2017 seoane et al 2013 yeh et al 2006 was used to deduce the total storage of groundwater lake water glacier and permafrost glpia from twsa in the endorheic tp 4 glpia t w s a s w a s w e a where glpia is the anomaly of the total storage of groundwater lake water glacier and permafrost based on equation 3 terrestrial water storage change twsc and its components can also be expressed as follows 5 twsc s w c s w e c l w s c p m c i c e c g w s c where swc swec lwsc pmc icec and gwsc are the monthly or annual change in sw swe lws pm ice and gws respectively at the monthly time scale according to previous studies li et al 2016 pellet et al 2020 ramillien et al 2006 xie et al 2019a twsc for a month should be estimated by the double difference time derivative of twsa as the grace fo twsa is the mean value of a month rather than the instantaneous value so monthly twsc can be estimated as follows 6 twsc t t w s a t 1 t w s a t 1 2 δ t where twsc t is terrestrial water storage change for month t twsa t 1 and twsa t 1 are twsa for month t 1 and t 1 respectively the time period t is taken as one month in the study at the annual scale we assumed that lake volume reaches its maximum in august each year in the endorheic tp biskop et al 2016 qiao et al 2019 to be consistent with the change in lakes twsc during a hydrological year from august in previous year to july in this year for this study can be calculated as follows xie et al 2020 zeng et al 2012 7 twsc t t w s a t 8 t w s a t 1 8 where twsc t is the change of total terrestrial water storage in hydrological year t twsa t 8 and twsa t 1 8 are august value of twsa in years t and t 1 annual swc swec and lwsc are calculated using the same procedure as twsc equation 7 based on equation 5 annul total storage change in gws pm and ice for hydrological year t i e gpic t can be estimated as follows 8 g p i c t t w s c t l w s c t s w c t s w e c t where gpic t twsc t lwsc t swc t and swec t are the change of total storage in gws pm and ice total water storage lake water storage soil water storage and snow water storage for hydrological year t respectively the relative contribution rate of lakes as well as swc swec and gpic to the variation of total terrestrial water storage at an annual scale can be calculated as follows wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 9 rate lwsc lwsc s w c s w e c g p i c l w s c where rate lwsc is the contribution rate of lwsc to the change of total terrestrial water storage 3 3 random forest for extending twsa and twsc we used the random forest rf method to extend the grace data based on two widely used reanalysis datasets while the rf method is still a black box low interpretability and complexity compared with physical models high interpretability and complexity it has high flexibility ability to integrate different data without scaling and certain interpretability jing et al 2019 jing et al 2020 which may achieve a balance between interpretability and complexity xie et al 2019a found that different variable combinations produce large differences in twsa estimates in the tp in our early data exploration we also found that twsa and twsc estimates in different regions are quite different in their accuracy see section 4 2 twsc is critical to the analysis of changes in terrestrial water storage and contribution rates calculations and monthly twsa can be obtained through recursion by using existing grace fo and twsc based on equation 6 therefore in this study we use the rf method with different variable combinations table 3 to train april 2002 june 2017 and june 2018 nov 2019 and estimate jan 1989 mar 2002 and jul 2017 may 2018 monthly twsa and twsc for each sub region the 198 monthly grace fo twsa and twsc observations are randomly divided into training sets and test sets at a ratio of 7 3 for the rf model to reduce the risk of overfitting the training sets are used to determine the optimal parameters of the rf model according to the simulation results of 5 fold cross validation evaluation criteria including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and relative bias bias are chosen to evaluate model performance and to select the optimal model and variable combination scheme moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 xie et al 2019a these metrics are defined as follows 10a r 2 1 i 1 n y i f i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 10b rmse 1 n i 1 n y i f i 2 10c bias i 1 n y i f i i n y i where n is the number of months for the training sets n 138 or test sets n 60 yi and fi are observed i e grace fo and predicted monthly twsa or twsc respectively y i is the mean of simulated monthly twsa or twsc the optimal model with its variable combinations of each region was used to extend the time span of the grace fo twsa and twsc data from 2002 back to 1989 3 4 statistical method for trend test and change point detection for each sub region the slope of a linear regression model is used to indicate the change rate of each variable i e twsa swa swea and prec during the time period from 1989 to 2019 a positive slope indicates an upward trend while a negative slope indicates a downward trend daneshvar et al 2016 wang et al 2020b the non parametric pettitt statistic method is used to detect the mutation point of annual twsa which appears when the shift in the central tendency of a time series has been detected pettitt 1979 verstraeten et al 2006 this method is less sensitive to outliers and skewed data compared to other tests pettitt 1979 verstraeten et al 2006 and has been used for detecting the mutation point of water storage in the tp zhang et al 2017 the rank r 1 r n of a time series x 1 x n is used in the method 11 u k 2 i 1 k r i k n 1 where u k is the pettitt statistic n is the length of time series k 1 n r i is the rank of x i the probable mutation point is located where u k has its maximum absolute value pettitt 1979 verstraeten et al 2006 3 5 uncertainty analysis at a monthly time scale glpia is calculated as the residual of twsa swa and swea based on equation 4 therefore the uncertainty of glpia σ glpia can be computed as follows xie et al 2019a 12 σ glpia σ twsa 2 σ swa 2 σ swea 2 where σ twsa σ swa and σ swea are the uncertainty of monthly twsa swa and swea mm respectively as the ensemble mean see equation 1 of each variable was used taking twsa as an example its uncertainty can be estimated as follows pellet et al 2020 13 σ twsa 1 p 1 2 i 1 p k i σ k 2 k σ k 2 2 σ i 2 where p is the number of twsa data sources used in the weighting p 2 as twsa from grace fo csr and jpl were used in this study i e grace fo csr and jpl σ i is the standard deviation of the ith twsa the uncertainty of monthly swa swea prec and et are calculated following the similar approach for twsa 4 results 4 1 spatial and temporal variation of hydro climate variables during the period of 1989 2019 annual temperature temp precipitation prec and evapotranspiration et all show increasing trends i e slope 0 in both regions fig 4 g i the slope of prec in ib 3 995 mm a p 0 05 was higher than that in qb 2 20 mm a p 0 05 while the slopes of temp and et were lower than that in qb based on the mutation analysis of twsa in each region see section 4 3 1 the period from 1989 to 2019 pa is divided into two parts the pre mutation period p1 and the post mutation period p2 temp in both the ib and qb showed an increasing trend in p1 and p2 but the slope in p2 0 01 c a p 0 10 was smaller than that in p1 0 03 c a p 0 10 in ib and the slopes in the qb in the two periods were almost the same 0 09 c a p 0 05 the rapid increasing trend in prec in p1 was completely reversed in p2 in both regions both regions showed increasing trends of et over p1 and p2 after mutation however while the trend in the ib slowed down it increased further in the qb mean annual temp prec and et for each sub region during p1 p2 and pa are illustrated in fig 4 a c the hinterland of qb s07 has the highest mean temp 2 62 c and the lowest prec 78 54 mm and et 65 50 mm from p1 to p2 positive temp p 2 p 1 where p 1 and p 2 are the mean of selected variables in p1 and p2 respectively was found in all the sub regions except for s01 and s02 for prec the only negative prec was found in s04 prec was 80 mm in s02 and s06 in the western ib as for et the only negative et was found in s05 in pa all variables showed increasing trends except for the insignificant decreasing trend of temp in s01 slope 0 02 c a p 0 10 and et in s05 slope 0 55 mm a p 0 10 fig 4d f the increasing trend of prec in p1 was higher than that in p2 and the trend in s01 s03 s05 and s08 was completely reversed during p2 indicating that the overall increase of prec in pa mainly came from the increase in p1 in most sub regions 4 2 estimates of twsa and twsc the rf model was used to estimate and extend twsa and twsc in each region input variables were based on the mass balance equations 3 and 5 three performance metrics including r2 rmse and bias were used and their values under different variable combinations for the training sets and test sets in each region are illustrated in fig 5 rf models with a rmse and bias value closer to 0 and an r2 value closer to 1 indicates better performance because twsa tends to have a larger range than twsc does twsa s rmse is also larger than that of twsc fig 5 as such rmse is mainly used for comparing models for the same predictor while the comparison between twsa and twsc is mainly based on r2 and bias based on the performance higher r2 and lower rmse and bias of the test sets the optimal rf model with its variable combination for each region was selected and listed in table 4 the estimates for the training sets and the test sets under the optimal variable combination are shown in fig 6 which indicates that with appropriate variable selection the rf model can achieve high accuracy estimates for twsa and twsc in all regions with a minimum r2 of 0 5 figs 6 7 and fig s1 on the whole the rf models can reproduce the seasonal and annual variations of twsa and twsc well fig 7 and fig s1 though there are some underestimates and overestimates of the high value and low value in all the regions the optimal models were then used to extend the data records of twsa or twsc in each region for regions using twsa i e qb s02 s04 s06 s07 and s08 monthly twsc values were calculated according to equation 6 monthly twsa values in other regions were obtained through recursion using the grace fo observations and rf estimated twsc with equation 6 the extended before the grace period and estimated during the grace period twsa time series were used for further analysis we also compared the recursively obtained twsa with grace observations fig 7a c e and g and found that although the biases are still large for some regions e g s05 fig 7g or specific periods e g aug 2018 to dec 2019 in the ib fig 7a its accuracy was greatly improved compared with the direct estimation of twsa in the regions 4 3 variation in annual twsa and its components 4 3 1 years of twsa mutation the pettitt non parametric test was used to find the twsa mutation year in each region and the results are listed in table 5 to better understand tws response to climate change the time period from 1989 to 2019 pa was divided into two stages p1 before mutation and p2 after mutation including the mutation year for each region because the two mutation years are very close in s05 and s06 the first mutation year is regarded as the end year of p1 i e p1 of s05 is 1989 2003 p1 of s06 is 1989 1995 this time period division is also used in the analysis of other variables such as prec temp et see section 4 1 swa and so on see section 4 3 3 4 3 2 variation in annual twsa annual twsa for each region and their trend slopes are illustrated in fig 8 both the ib 2 20 mm a and qb 0 26 mm a have a positive trend slope in annual twsa during pa indicating an overall increase in twsa for the sub regions in the ib annual twsa showed decreasing trends in the western and southern ib 0 62 0 14 mm a and increasing trends in the other sub regions 4 76 10 83 mm a there are varying temporal patterns in annual twsa in different regions and time periods annual twsa decreased during p1 in both the ib 0 65 mm a and qb 3 51 mm a but increased during p2 fig 7a and b for the sub regions in the ib s01 s03 and s05 showed similar temporal patterns although their mutation years and trend slopes were different the temporal pattern in s08 was basically similar to that in the qb it is also worth noting that annual twsa decreased around 2015 in all regions with decreased prec at the same time fig 4 indicating that prec may play a driving role in inter annual variation of twsa 4 3 3 variations in swa swea and glpia annual swa 0 33 mm a and swea 0 11 mm a showed a significantly p 0 05 decreasing trend in the ib fig 9 g and 9 h while a significantly increasing trend was found in glpia slope 2 64 mm a p 0 05 during pa fig 9i annual swa in the ib first increased in p1 and then decreased in p2 but the opposite occurred in the qb glpia in both regions decreased first in p1 and then increased in p2 the mean and trend slope of annual swa swea and glpia for each sub region during the period of p1 p2 and pa are illustrated in fig 9 a f from p1 to p2 negative swa was found in the eastern ib s01 s03 s04 and s05 while positive swa was found in western ib s02 and s06 indicating that swa decrease in the ib mainly occurred in the eastern ib and the increase of swa in the qb was mainly occurred in the high mountain area i e s08 glpia trend in pa showed just the opposite of swa in each sub region in the ib fig 9f glpia was positive in most sub regions in the ib except for s04 so the increase of glpia in the ib was mainly from the eastern ib as the degradation of permafrost and glaciers in the tp increases with climate warming yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2013 the rapid increase of glpia during p2 may come from groundwater and or lakes 4 3 4 changes of lake water storage the trend slopes of annual lws for each of the 977 lakes area 1 km2 during the periods of p1 p2 and pa are illustrated in fig 10 a c for comparison between regions annual total lws in each region was converted into water depth in mm fig 10d during pa most lakes 907 977 showed increasing trends and lakes with higher increasing trends slope 0 15 km3 were mostly located in the eastern ib fig 10c with s03 slope 1 68 mm a p 0 05 and s04 slope 1 14 mm a p 0 05 showing the highest increasing rates fig 10e s07 is the only region showing a minor decreasing trend slope 0 002 mm a p 0 1 fig 10e the total lws in the ib slope 5 23 mm a and qb slope 0 05 mm a both showed significant increasing trends p 0 05 during pa from p1 to p2 the rapidly increasing trend slope 3 23 mm a p 0 05 in the ib further increased slope 5 22 mm a p 0 05 while the decreasing trend slope 0 03 mm a p 0 1 in the qb changed to an increasing trend slope 0 02 mm a p 0 1 fig 10e the number of lakes with a decreasing trend during p1 200 977 was comparable to that of p2 228 977 but the spatial distribution of these lakes was somewhat different fig 10a and b in the ib shrinking lakes were mainly located in the periphery areas of s02 southern s04 eastern s01 and s06 during p1 fig 10a in p2 shrinking lakes were mainly located in western s02 central s03 and s05 and southeastern s04 fig 10b rapidly expanding lakes slope 0 15 km3 a were mainly located in s04 during p1 fig 10a but in s03 during p2 fig 10b resulting in the highest slope 2 01 mm a p 0 05 in s03 during p2 among all eight sub regions fig 10e 4 4 component contributions to twsc to better recognize the variation in twsc its mean value under different scenarios i e twsc 0 and twsc 0 over different periods was calculated table 6 scenario p1 p2 and pa refer to component contributions during the pre mutation post mutation and entire study period in addition years with negative twsc i e storage deficit and referred to as p1 p2 and pa and years with positive twsc i e storage surplus referred to as p1 p2 and pa within the three periods were also selected as scenarios the contribution rate of swc swec lwsc and gpic to twsc under these scenarios for each region was calculated as illustrated in fig 11 during pa the twsc of the ib was mainly determined by lwsc rate 0 624 followed by gpic rate 0 327 and the contribution rate of swc and swec was minor fig 11a the twsc of the qb on the other hand was mainly determined by swc rate 0 426 followed by gpic rate 0 298 and lwsc rate 0 274 fig 11b for the sub regions of the ib and qb the dominate component of twsc during pa was gpic in s01 s02 s03 s05 s07 and s08 swc in s06 and both gpic and lwsc in s04 it is interesting that the contribution rate of lwsc was relatively small 0 05 during both p1 and p2 in the qb but the rate during pa was moderate rate 0 274 which may be caused by the offset of the positive and negative gpic in the two periods fig 11b the surplus during p2 in the ib was mainly caused by the greater positive effect of lwsc and the transformation of the effect of gwsc from negative to positive fig 11a while the surplus in the qb was mainly because the negative contributions of gpic and swc both turned positive and with minor variation in the absolute value of their contribution rate fig 11b similar transformation patterns and component contributions in the qb were also found in its two sub regions i e s07 and s08 fig 11i and j higher lwsc contribution rates were found in the ib fig 11a and its two southeastern sub regions s03 and s04 fig 11e and f and a higher lws increasing rate was also found in these regions see fig 10d which indicates higher effects of lws in the regional hydrological cycle in these regions the magnitude of lwsc contribution rate under storage surplus scenarios i e p1 p2 and pa was mostly higher than that under storage deficit scenarios i e p1 p2 and pa fig 11a e and f indicating that lwsc has a more significant effect on the increase of regional water storage in the ib twsc under storage surplus scenarios was mainly determined by lwsc while the dominant component under storage deficit scenarios was more complicated fig 11a for the qb twsc under both surplus and deficit scenarios was determined by gpic fig 11b 5 discussions 5 1 uncertainties and limitations the uncertainties of monthly prec et swa swea twsa and glpia were calculated based on equations 12 and 13 for each region table s3 there are large uncertainties in these variables and the uncertainties differ in regions according to previous studies xie et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 noah sw has the lowest error among all gldas products and it was used in the study a scaling factor was calculated and applied to make consistent the two versions of gldas noah data which also inevitably brings some uncertainty we combined era 5 and gldas noah reanalysis datasets to estimate different hydrological variables using the simple weighting method pellet et al 2020 this approach can reduce the uncertainty to a certain extent but the overall improvement in these data still depends on the supplement and improvement of ground observations which is still very urgent for the region grace fo satellite observations i e twsa also have some uncertainty as shown in table s3 and the comparison between prec et and twsc i e water balance analysis fig s2 and supplementary text s2 further illustrates the uncertainty in prec et and twsc similar to many previous studies jing et al 2020 wang et al 2020a xie et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 we used two different data sources to reduce the uncertainty of twsa in addition due to the coarse spatial resolution of the data its uncertainty increases as study area decreases abiy and melesse 2017 in this study we resampled the data to a finer spatial resolution to reduce the error when clipping the data to the sub regions abiy and melesse 2017 xie et al 2019a both the regional approach and the resampling method can reduce uncertainty and error to some extent but it still has a great risk using the data in small sub regions due to the original coarse spatial resolution many researchers have adopted spatial downscaling methods to improve the spatial resolution of twsa abiy and melesse 2017 seyoum and milewski 2017 and we will consider this approach in future research due to the short time span of grace fo data rf models were built to extend twsa in this study the results indicate that this approach can obtain accurate estimates of twsa or twsc and is very effective for extending grace fo observations however there are still some underestimation or overestimation on extreme values and for some regions the estimated twsa still has a large bias e g s05 which could affect analysis accuracy in addition the extended twsa i e before the grace period has not been validated by other independent data limited by data availability we treated groundwater glaciers permafrost i e gpic as a whole however under climate change their change characteristics e g magnitude variability and duration are quite different individual component changes and the exchange and feedback among them need further study in the future when data is available 5 2 feasibility and interpretability of random forest models in this study the feasibility of the rf method mainly refers to whether the method can be used to estimate and reconstruct twsa time series similar to other related studies chakraborty et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 it was validated by comparing model estimates with available grace twsa and twsc observations which indicates that the calibrated rf models with optimal forcing variables and parameters can provide reasonable estimates moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 therefore the rf method is feasible in reconstructing twsa and twsc time series in the region we also found that the rf models performed differently in estimating twsa and twsc in different regions there are two possible reasons for this difference based on the temporal variation characteristics e g significant trend or fluctuation of twsa in these regions we speculate that one possible reason is that the rf method might be better at capturing fluctuations for example significant trends p 0 05 were found in regions with better model estimates of twsc such as ib s01 and s03 while not significant trends were found in regions with better model estimates of twsa another possible reason is forcing variable selection although the rf model can provide good estimation of twsa and twsc there are still some problems with forcing variable selection in this study for example due to the lack of data groundwater storage is not available as a forcing variable which may have a greater impact on model performance in some regions xie et al 2019a as confirmed by the contribution rate of glpic table 7 region s01 and most of the forcing variables do not reflect the memory effect of twsa xu et al 2018 except for swa and swea with minor possibility the interpretability of the rf method mainly refers to its ability to quantify the importance i e contribution rate in our study of different forcing variables chakraborty et al 2021 gilpin et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2016 shortridge et al 2016 xu and liang 2021 to further understand and verify this we compared the contribution rates from the rf method with those estimated by the conventional mass balance approach table 7 the comparison indicates that the magnitude of the contribution rates from the two methods is somewhat different but the orders of their magnitude and identified dominate components are basically the same algorithmically feature importance in rf is calculated based on the modeling error difference for out of bag samples with and without noise for all trees breiman 2001 as the rf trees are built based on random selection of variables and samples the method has a non linear model structure and it can assess variables importance by quantifying their contributions to the nodes of the trees in a model breiman 2001 jing et al 2019 xie et al 2019b on the contrary the mass balance approach acts like a general linear model where each storage component has the same weight of 1 i e twsc swc swec lwsc gpic the two methods have their own merits and limits for estimating contribution rates benefiting from its non linear structure and random sampling of training data and variables the rf method could provide a more reliable and comprehensive estimation of the contribution of each variable especially for long term time series data however as a data driven method the rf method requires more data to train the model and its result may not be as reliable with small training datasets furthermore the rf method cannot reveal the negative or positive effects of different storage components as it lacks physical meanings conversely the contribution rate derived from the mass balance equation has a clear physical meaning and its calculation is very simple zhang et al 2013 and the approach also can be used even with small data sets and can provide the negative or positive effects of each storage change to twsc this approach however may not be suitable for long term time series data e g multi annual as there is the potential that the positive change of a storage component in some years could be offset by its negative change in other years resulting in a weak impact on total water storage change e g swc effects in s04 over p1 fig 11f as such the dominant component s identified by the index could be biased or wrong another limit is that the index may smooth out temporal variation because of its averaging approach and therefore may not guarantee consistent results between short term and long term data 5 3 intensified hydrological cycle and spatial temporal heterogeneity with the increase of prec and rising temp the exchange between land surface and the atmosphere has intensified in the region overall we find that not only most of the storage variables twsa lws and gws have increased but the exchanges between these components i e change of storage and the exchanges with other systems e g atmosphere and vegetation have increased i e increased flux indicating an intensified regional hydrological cycle in the endorheic tp based on the extended long term twsa and twsc data we have revealed some new findings on the hydrological variation in the region we found the difference between the eastern and western ib in addition to the difference between the northern and southern ib reported by deng et al 2018 and wang et al 2020a the western ib s02 is located mainly in continuous permafrost but its temporal variation in twsa is more similar to that of the qb and southern ib s04 and s06 however the processes and mechanisms causing the changes in s02 and the southern ib s04 and s06 may not be the same although the slope of prec is large the total amount of prec in s02 is still small compared with other sub regions the region has the largest proportion of glaciers see table 1 and the effect of glacier changes in twsa is more significant lei et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2017 according to zhang et al 2020b the glacier in the north western s02 showed an increasing trend in p2 from the early 2000s but a larger decreasing trend in p1 so the overall decrease in glacier storage may offset the increase in other water storage e g sw and lws caused by prec at regional level therefore twsa maintains a relatively stable state fig 8 and the inter annual variation of twsc is also small as it is determined by prec et fig s2 we also found that annual twsa decreased in the pre mutation period and then quickly increased in the post mutation period in both the ib and qb the prior decreasing trend was not well reported in previous studies deng et al 2018 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 because of the short time span of grace data used in those studies zhang et al 2017 found that lwsc 52 contributed the highest rate in twsc in the ib followed by gwsc 34 during the period of 2003 2009 in our study during p2 2006 2019 we found a higher lwsc contribution rate 65 indicating that the positive effect of lwsc has been further enhanced especially in water storage surplus periods in water storage deficit periods swc has a higher contribution rate than lwsc and the effect of lwsc varied among sub regions none of these findings have been reported by previous studies deng et al 2018 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2017 the difference between the southern and northern ib is mainly due to different permafrost types in the northern ib s01 s03 and s05 dominated with continuous permafrost ground ice melts as temp increases zhang et al 2017 and soil permeability tends to increase woo et al 2008 the hydraulic exchange between surface water and suprapermafrost water increases accordingly liu et al 2020 and aquifer activity increases as well wang et al 2009 woo et al 2008 this may lead to increased recharge from suprapermafrost water and surface water to lakes liu et al 2020 resulting in an increase in lws seasonal frozen ground and island permafrost are mainly located in the southern ib s04 and s06 with some continuous permafrost in s04 in the regions with island permafrost permafrost degradation may lead to the expansion of taliks liu et al 2020 wang et al 2009 yoshikawa and hinzman 2003 which connects island permafrost with surrounding groundwater system and discharges more subpermafrost water and groundwater to lakes jepsen et al 2013 liu et al 2020 with the drainage of groundwater lakes continue to expand and groundwater continues to decline in s06 for s04 with temp increase some continuous permafrost may be transformed into island permafrost or seasonal frozen ground and some island permafrost may also be degraded from p1 to p2 the permafrost degradation was intensified with continuous temperature increase in s04 so the influence of continuous permafrost in this region was weakened this may be the reason why glpia increased in p1 and decreased in p2 despite the continuous increase in prec in this region 5 4 difference between twsa and twsc based on our results and other studies deng et al 2018 lv et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020a we found there are some differences between twsa and twsc firstly the magnitude and sign of twsa and twsc have different meanings in general the higher the twsa the greater the regional water storage the higher the absolute value of twsc twsc the faster the exchange of water storage and regional hydrological cycle positive and negative twsa indicate whether the tws during certain time periods e g day month and year is higher or lower than its time series mean positive and or negative twsc means water storage surplus or deficit in a certain period compared to a previous time period secondly twsa includes not only the information at the current time e g prec et and twsc at time t but also the information in the previous time e g twsa at time t 1 and twsc at previous time however twsc is only determined by the input and output at the current time according to the water balance equation twsct prect ett rt lv et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020a thirdly twsc is more directly related to other water balance terms e g prec and et than twsa is lv et al 2020 twsa at the current time on the other hand is more closely related to the cumulative water balance term in a previous time and is more closely related to cumulative prec so although twsa is a direct measurement of water storage twsc may be more suitable for analyzing the impact of climate change finally the long term trends of annual twsa and twsc also have different meanings and magnitude twsa trend is the same as tws trend but is different from twsc trend a positive twsa trend indicates increasing regional water storage and vice versa for a negative trend a positive trend slope of absolute twsc i e twsc means an accelerated hydrological cycle the contribution rates of different water storage components change e g swc swec lwsc and gpic to twsc are also quite different from those of different components anomalies e g swa swea lwsa and gipa to twsa 6 conclusions using rf models and the ensemble means of hydrological and climatic variables we reconstructed a long term 1989 2019 time series of twsa and twsc for each region in the endorheic tp based on the data and through the mass balance approach we analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of twsa and its different components as well as the contribution of each component to twsc our key findings are summarized below 1 prec temp and et all showed increasing trends in both ib and qb in pa indicating overall climate warming and wetting in the endorheic tp the southern ib has a stronger warming trend than the northern ib and the western ib has a stronger wetting trend than the eastern ib the overall reduction of warming and wetting in p2 in ib mainly comes from the north eastern ib 2 the rf method achieved excellent estimates with the training datasets even with very limited data but the performance with the test datasets differs greatly with regions and variable combinations twsc can be an alternative when the twsa estimate is poor and prec and et can improve the performance while temp has less effect the underestimation or overestimation may be due to the lack of groundwater data and the rf method is very effective for estimating hydrological variables in data scarce regions 3 the hydrological cycle has intensified in the endorheic tp during the study period especially in eastern ib annual twsa decreased during p1 in both the ib 0 65 mm a and qb 3 51 mm a while increased during p2 and pa annual glpia in both the ib 2 64 mm a and qb 0 23 mm a showed a similar variation pattern as that of twsa during pa the unreported difference in eastern and western ib is mainly caused by the differences in precipitation magnitude glacier proportions and permafrost types we also found that twsa is more related to the magnitude of precipitation while twsc is more related to precipitation change 4 during the whole period twsc in the ib was mainly determined by lwsc followed by gpic while twsc in the qb was mainly determined by swc followed by gpic and lwsc the effects of lwsc on twsc were more significant in the ib and especially in its southeastern sub regions for a long term twsc time series rf models can provide a more reasonable interpretation of component contributions than the mass balance approach does indicating the method is a good hydrological inference tool credit authorship contribution

3137,in addition to china s physical water shortage income and expenditure disparities can exacerbate the country s water issues thus preventing an equitable distribution of water resources across diverse household groups by linking chinese data on household expenditure with an environmentally extended multiregional input output mrio table this study calculates household water footprints wfs for 12 income groups in 30 provinces across china and assesses the water inequality among households in 2012 in addition to inequality across regions importantly water inequality across different income groups is identified the findings show that 1 the inequality in wfs between households within and across provinces in china is large within provinces the wf of urban residents is 2 5 times as large as that of rural residents across provinces xinjiang has the highest per capita wf 1126 17 m3 while shandong has the lowest 155 97 m3 2 differences in household wfs vary widely by income group the gap in the per capita wf between very low income urban households and very high income households ranges between 163 3 m3 tianjin and 1646 4 m3 xinjiang while the gap among rural households ranges only from 37 0 m3 beijing to 519 8 m3 xinjiang 3 water inequality declines with regional economic development in 2012 the province level total wf gini coefficients ranged from 0 20 beijing to 0 36 guizhou the water inequality in china s wealthier eastern region is much narrower than that in the poorer provinces in western china governments need to pay more attention to household water

adjustments to the industrial structure population growth and improvements in quality of life global demand for water and the pressure on global water resources are increasing daily vanham et al 2018 however there is an imbalance in the demand for and supply of water the supply of available freshwater is far less than the demand in terms of timing and its geographical distribution sun et al 2017 leading to water scarcity in many regions of the world besides physical water scarcity economic water scarcity may lead to the severe consequences for most vulnerable and poor people molden and ed 2007 rosa et al 2020 vallino et al 2020 china as the world s second largest economy also suffers from water scarcity the per capita available water resources in china are only one quarter of the world average guan et al 2014 water scarcity has become an important threat to sustainable development identifying the sources of water and available quantities and measuring the consumption of water helps to clarify and alleviate the challenge of water shortages hoekstra 2014 the water footprint is the amount of water needed to produce a commodity or a set of produced or consumed commodities d odorico et al 2019 wfs provide a new perspective on complex water problems and their solutions and enables the generation of new ideas for freshwater utilization ge et al 2011 chini et al 2017 rushforth and ruddell 2018 household wfs refer to water needed for household to live which contains direct and indirect water use water used directly includes surface water or groundwater blue water indirect water use is the water used throughout the production process of goods which consumed by a household virtual water allan 1998 dalin et al 2012 as the largest percentage of total household water consumption virtual water is highly important in the analysis of water resource utilization virtual water is accompanied by regional trade and transferred between regions yang and zehnder 2007 in theory the use of virtual water can result in a transfer of water resources away from rich areas to scarce areas for utilization thus achieving a spatial redistribution of water resources alleviating the current imbalance in the spatial distribution of wfs and providing a way to resolve water shortages dalin et al 2012 household consumption includes expenditures on food health care housing household facilities clothing transport and education among others fan et al 2020 household consumption is influenced by household income consumption tendencies individual pursuits and other factors which means that household consumption structures are uncertain soltani et al 2020 virtual water use can also change with changes in the trade of goods and services feng et al 2012 thus affecting the inequality in household water footprints reducing income inequality has been highlighted as one of the united nations 17 sustainable development goals sdgs wiedmann and lenzen 2018 in addition to household income inequality household inequality in resource consumption has also been observed and become the subject of research an example of non income inequality is carbon footprint inequality feng et al 2021 household consumption characteristics vary across regions due to differences in economic development and technology levels zhao et al 2017 and this variation is visible not only among urban households but also among rural households lise and seitz 2011 income inequality is one reason for inequality in household consumption several studies have investigated inequality in water consumption for example sun et al 2017 measured the water inequality among the chinese provinces according to water use category and wang and wang 2021 analyzed the evolution of water inequality in china from 2004 to 2018 and its drivers however few studies have examined the water inequality between households in one region furthermore few studies have examined the differences in household expenditures between various consumption categories in this study we address the following three issues what is the per capita wf of chinese households in various income groups how is water inequality distributed across income groups in china which expenditure categories contribute the most to the inequality in household wfs to this end we evaluate the water inequality between 12 income groups across china in 2012 we account for the direct and indirect consumption of water by urban and rural households by using a multiregional input output mrio model furthermore we use gini coefficients to measure water inequality and lorenz curves to identify changes in the household wf between the various income groups this study provides new insights into how household consumption expenditure patterns and urban rural disparities influence household wfs and sheds light on potential inequality issues in other developing countries 2 methodology and materials 2 1 system boundary the system boundary for this study is depicted in fig 1 household consumption for each income group is obtained from the provincial statistical yearbooks urban households are sorted into seven groups and rural households are sorted into five groups according to household income water resource and water use data are obtained from the china statistical yearbook which provides data on water consumption in various sectors and direct household consumption direct household water consumption includes surface water or groundwater for drinking from the tap in the shower for toilets and for flowers among other uses furthermore this study extends the classical use of the chinese economic mrio multiregional input output model by employing water resource and water use data to account for indirect household water use that is the water used to produce or provide food health care household facilities education clothing and transport among other goods and services indirect household water consumption may occur as follows on the one hand people living in region a may purchase commodities and services produced in their local area and this production uses the water resources available in region a on the other hand residents in region a may consume goods and services produced in other regions the amount of water consumed indirectly by households in the process of purchasing goods and services can be derived through the use of water use data for various sectors in different regions the indirect household water footprint is also referred to as the household virtual water footprint vwf because it captures the water use that is embodied in commodities and services liao et al 2021 local consumption and regional water leakage are both included in the extended environmental mrio accounting framework for china 2 2 household virtual water footprint calculation household physical water consumption can be obtained from the china statistical yearbook a water extended input output weio table is employed to calculate vwfs on the basis of the economic mrio table for china fig 2 in line with several recent studies sun et al 2017 lin et al 2019 islam et al 2021 as a consistent accounting and modeling framework the weio table quantifies regional water leakages along with the economic links between different sectors across various regions it provides a method for linking household consumption to interregional goods and services chains feng et al 2021 the household vwf accounting model is based on the weio table given an economic system with n economic sectors in r regions the general equation for the mrio analysis can be written as follows 1 x 1 x r x r a 11 a 1 r a r 1 a rs a rr a r 1 a rr x 1 x r x r y 11 y s y 1 s e x 1 y rr y s y rs e x r y rr y s y rs e x r where x r is an n 1 vector that indicates the total output of the n sectors in province r a rs is n n matrices of technical coefficients and element a ij rs in a rs indicating intermediate input y rr is an n 1 vector that indicates the local final consumption of goods and services produced by various sectors y rs is the goods and services from province r to province s used for final consumption and ex r indicates the volume of goods and services produced by the various sectors in province r that exported to foreign countries by using eq 1 the total output of the various regions sorted by sector can be transformed into final consumption as follows 2 x i a 1 y where i is the identity matrix i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix and y s y 1 s e x 1 s y 2 s e x 2 s y rs e x r t eq 2 can be extended by introducing water consumption the vwf can then be calculated with the following formula 3 w d x d i a 1 y t y where w w 1 w 2 w r t w r is an n 1 vector denoting the water consumed by each sector in province r d is a matrix whose diagonal elements represent the intensity of direct water use and t is the water use coefficient matrix for both direct and indirect water use the flow of virtual water from region r to region s is defined as v w rs and can be calculated using eq 4 4 v w rs i t ri y is where t ri is a row vector denoting the water resources from region r that are needed to produce one unit of output in the various sectors in region i and y is is a column vector of commodities produced by the various sectors from region i that are imported to region s the vwf for region s is calculated with eq 5 5 vw f s v w s v w rs where vw f s represents the vwf of region s v w s is the virtual water induced by local consumption and v w rs indicates the virtual water from region r to region s 2 3 measure of household water inequality gini coefficient the gini coefficient is a classic indicator for measuring the equality in the distribution of resident incomes and has been widely applied in previous studies gini 1921 wiedenhofer et al 2017 mi et al 2020 the gini coefficient has also been used to investigate regional inequality in water scarcity sun et al 2021 we employ the gini coefficient to quantify household water inequality ranging from zero to one the gini coefficient indicates greater inequality as its value increases a value of zero means perfect equality while a value of one represents extreme inequality the general equation for an ordinary gini coefficient is 6 g i 1 n d i y i 2 i 1 n d i 1 t i 1 where g is the gini coefficient the share of the population in each group is represented by d i while the share of income in each group is denoted by y i t i represents the cumulative share of income for each group different household groups defined by income are indexed with i which ranges from 0 to n the aim of our study is to measure the inequality in household wfs this is done by deriving the wf gini coefficient wf gini an extension of the standard gini coefficient which can be computed by replacing household income with household wfs 7 g wf i 1 n d i f i 2 i 1 n d i 1 u i 1 where g wf denotes the wf gini f i is the share of the wf attributable to each group and u i indicates the cumulative share of the household wf for group i 2 4 data compilation all urban households are classified into seven groups very poor 10 poor 10 lower middle 20 middle 20 upper middle 20 rich 10 and very rich 10 and rural households into five groups poor 20 lower middle 20 middle 20 upper middle 20 and rich 20 according to household income notably the groups are defined on the basis of the number of households rather than the population household consumption can be characterized by expenditures in eight primary categories food health care housing household facilities clothing transport education and other detailed data on the consumption of the 12 household groups are available in the provincial statistical yearbooks and the household consumption of each group is divided into the eight categories above although the shares for each group are calculated on the basis of the number of households the provincial statistical yearbooks report per capita annual monetary expenditures which provide the foundation for us to calculate the per capita wf of each income group the water resource and water use data cover blue water which is defined as surface water and groundwater without accounting for green water and greywater this approach is similar to that of various studies focusing on resident wfs chini et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 direct water consumption and population data for the 30 provinces are available in the china statistical yearbook china national bureau of statistics 2013 the primary users of water have been aggregated into four categories in the water consumption data agriculture industry the tertiary sector and households and ecological construction although it is not transferred into commodities or services the water consumed by households is accounted for in the wf as direct use however ecological water consumption is not included in our study owing to its weak linkage to economic activities the water consumed by agriculture includes the water used for crop farming for forestry for raising livestock and in fisheries the water consumed by specific sectors in the secondary industry is calculated with reference to the shares reported in the chinese economic census yearbook the state council leading group office of second china economic census 2008 given that the tertiary sector and households are not separated in the china statistical yearbook we use the water resources bulletin released by the provincial level water resources department for each province to calculate water consumption separately for the tertiary sector and households the total water consumed by all service sectors is allocated across sectors according to the proportion of intermediate inputs from the water production and supply sector allocated to each service sector in the mrio an approach that was developed in previous research zhang and anadon 2014 the mrio table is compiled by adopting a gravity model on the basis of national and provincial input output io tables zheng et al 2020 we obtain china mrio table from ceads database https www ceads net our mrio table covers 42 economic sectors which gives more detail than the mrio tables used in previous studies sun 2019 these sectors can be classified into the three main industrial categories the primary industry agriculture the secondary industry heavy industry and the tertiary industry services given the lack of water use data this study excludes construction and focuses on the remaining 41 sectors we use g1 to g41 to denote the 41 sectors and a detailed correspondence can be found in supplementary table 1 the chinese mrio table provides the monetary linkages among 30 of china s provinces data are unavailable for tibet hong kong macao and taiwan household consumption matrices are contained in the mrio which lays the foundations for calculating the household wf the 2012 chinese mrio table is obtained from the carbon emission accounts and datasets provided by existing research liu et al 2021 following previous studies mi et al 2020 the consumption of the goods and services produced by the 41 sectors under study was divided into eight categories see supplementary table 2 with direct water use being grouped into the housing category the household vwf is attributable to the consumption in these eight categories 2 5 limitations beginning with the chinese mrio table that includes household consumption our study investigates the per capita wf of the households in various income groups and across china s 30 provinces this accounting method limits the additional consideration of indirect water consumed via import goods from abroad as is the case for existing research jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 as one of the largest importers globally china imports approximately 120 gm3 of virtual water via international trade hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 including the virtual water embodied in imported commodities in the accounting of household wfs may influence our measurement of water inequality this however is not within the scope of our research dynamic changes in household consumption and inequality are not depicted we employ official data from national and provincial statistical bureaus and calculate both direct and indirect household wfs however the latest survey of household expenditures by income group was conducted in 2012 and that survey is not an annual survey furthermore the categorization of household expenditures suffers from subjective measurement errors that are unavoidable in household level surveys especially surveys conducted in rural areas within developing countries in addition it would be worthwhile to investigate other factors such as age and gender that cause water inequality across households finally all data on household income and expenditures are in nominal terms which is common in previous studies these limitations highlight the direction of future work 3 results and discussion 3 1 water use intensity in the various sectors in different provinces water use intensity wui is the ratio of water consumption to the value of output in this study the coefficient of total water use is used to represent wui water resources are consumed in the production of goods and the provision of services given that our accounting framework is based on monetary values it was necessary to obtain the wui in the various sectors in the different provinces before calculating household vwfs fig 3 depicts the wui results and the cumulative values with the breakdown of the contributions from the three primary industries are shown in the right hand panel given that wui is greater in agriculture than in the other sectors agriculture is assigned its own color map with a wider scale to illustrate the differences across provinces in 2012 there was substantial variation in wui in agriculture it ranged from 256 8 beijing to 3212 6 xinjiang agricultural wui was less than 500 in 14 provinces while in 11 provinces it was between 500 and 1000 in addition to xinjiang ningxia also had a considerably high agricultural wui at 2102 7 we also observe wide variation in wui in sectors g2 to g41 across the different provinces the average wui in each secondary industry sector from g2 to g27 falls between 6 2 and 158 7 wui in g12 g24 g6 and g14 was high in nearly all provinces with average values of 158 7 143 6 127 0 and 121 6 respectively however in beijing wui in the same four sectors was relatively low with values of 41 7 6 1 31 6 and 29 3 respectively wui in g21 g27 and g26 was low in almost all provinces with an average wui in each of those three sectors of less than 10 for the tertiary industry from g28 to g41 wui in g28 ranging from 32 0 to 143 6 g29 from 35 8 to 128 0 and g32 from 12 0 to 97 1 was relatively high with an average wui in each sector of 69 6 66 3 and 54 9 respectively interestingly wui in g36 in yunnan guizhou sichuan guangxi shandong and fujian was greater than 100 while that in 21 of the provinces was less than 20 wui in g38 g39 g40 and g41 was low in almost all provinces in these four sectors the average wui was 6 8 2 3 6 5 and 7 0 respectively the sum of the wui values across the three primary industries could be interpreted as a global wui measure global wui was the lowest in beijing while it was the highest in xinjiang although wui in the service industry in beijing was not low compared to that in other provinces the low wui in agriculture and the secondary industry in beijing resulted in that city having the lowest global wui xinjiang and ningxia had the highest global and agricultural wui and wui in the service industry in those two provinces were also relatively high in four provinces xinjiang ningxia qinghai and gansu the cumulative value of agricultural wui in the other 26 provinces the secondary industry accounted for the largest share in guizhou sichuan shandong fujian zhejiang shanghai liaoning and beijing the share of the cumulative wui value attributable to the service industry was greater than that attributable to agriculture 3 2 regional differentiation and the structure of the per capita water footprint fig 4 a shows the per capita wf and gdp of the 30 chinese provinces the national average wf which accounts for both direct and indirect water consumption was 282 1 m3 as shown in fig 4a however the per capita wf varied substantially across the 30 provinces the per capita wf was the highest in xinjiang at 1126 17 m3 and ningxia had the second highest per capita wf 691 62 m3 this is due to the high wui in those two provinces there were 13 provinces xinjiang ningxia shanghai guangdong jiangsu guangxi qinghai heilongjiang jiangxi zhejiang fujian hunan and gansu in which the per capita wf was higher than the national average in seven provinces shandong hebei tianjin shanxi henan guizhou and shaanxi the per capita wf was less than 170 m3 of these seven provinces residents living in shandong had an average wf of 155 97 m3 furthermore in ten provinces the per capita wf was below the national average wf a previous investigation has revealed that per capita carbon footprints and per capita gdp are correlated mi et al 2020 however we do not observe a similar relation between the per capita wfs and gdp in this study fig 4b provides detailed information on the composition of the per capita wfs this figure implies that the vwf is an important component of the total wf fig 4c presents the share of the vwf attributable to various sectors in most provinces g1 agriculture accounted for the highest share of the vwf g6 food processing and tobacco also accounted for a considerable share in many provinces the sum of the shares attributable to g1 and to g6 was lower in wealthy provinces than in poor provinces for example the shares summed to 29 1 in beijing 34 8 in shanghai 51 3 in zhejiang and 56 3 in jiangsu however the same sum was 96 4 in xinjiang 93 9 in ningxia 92 4 in yunnan and 90 2 in hainan in wealthy provinces the vwf in g28 transport and storage and g32 real estate also accounted for a considerable share of the total the share of the vwf in g28 was highest in shanghai and beijing reaching 20 3 and 13 3 respectively similarly the share of the vwf in g32 was also highest in beijing and shanghai reaching 28 8 and 15 5 respectively 3 3 variation in expenditures and the water footprint across various groups fig 5 shows that per capita expenditures climbed rapidly with the increases in household income at the national level per capita expenditures among middle income households were 74 4 higher than those among low income households while expenditures among high income households were 98 9 higher than those of middle income households the larger gap in expenditures between low and high income households was due mainly to a larger gap in the consumption of food and clothing per capita expenditures on food and clothing among middle income households were 1509 yuan and 770 yuan higher respectively than those of low income households the growth in expenditures on clothing 2572 yuan among high income households was greater than that among middle income households while consumption of food among high income households was higher by 2464 yuan furthermore the increase in expenditures on transport in the high income groups was remarkable middle income households spent 555 yuan more on transport than low income households while expenditures on transport among high income households were 1655 yuan higher than those among middle income households for urban households the gaps between the different income groups were larger middle income households spent 85 9 more than low income households while high income households spent 101 8 more than middle income households expenditures among high income households were 3 77 times greater than those among low income households the ranking of the contributions of the different expenditure categories is similar to that at the national level with food and clothing still being the largest expenditure categories the next largest contributor was transport among rural households expenditures among middle income households were merely 45 1 higher than those of low income households which is less than the gap at the national level or among urban households however the expenditures of high income households were dramatically higher than those of middle income households with gaps that were nearly twice as large as those between the low and middle income households food consumption was the dominant source of the gap in expenditures between low and middle income households while the contribution of clothing was not noteworthy although food was still a primary contributor to the gap in expenditures between middle and high income households which is similar to the pattern among urban households the housing rather than clothing was the second major contributor to that gap interestingly expenditures on health care account for a substantial share of the gap in household consumption between low income and high income urban households while health care did not clearly contribute to the variation in expenditures among rural households in 2012 the population in urban households accounted for 53 of the total population of china and contributed 74 of china s total household wf fig 6 presents the per capita water footprints of 12 the household groups for each of the 30 chinese provinces the per capita wf of urban households is much higher than that of rural households in all provinces there was a much larger gap in the per capita wf between urban and rural residents in provinces with a much larger per capita wf for example the per capita wf of urban households in xinjiang fig 6 row 6 column 5 which had the highest per capita wf out of all 30 provinces in 2012 was 2 77 times that of rural households however the per capita wf of urban households in shandong fig 6 row 3 column 5 which had the lowest per capita wf was merely 2 2 times that of rural households these per capita wf results are similar to those estimated by previous studies sun and fang 2019 interestingly the gaps in the per capita wf between the seven urban income groups was larger than those between the five rural income groups the gaps in the per capita wf between the lowest income urban households and highest income households ranged from 163 3 tianjin to 1646 4 xinjiang while the gap among rural households ranged only from 37 0 beijing to 519 8 xinjiang the per capita wfs of yunnan and inner mongolia were 224 94 m3 and 260 0 m3 respectively both of which are less than the national average wf however the wfs of the highest income urban groups in those two provinces were dramatically higher similar results were also observed for beijing liaoning jilin heilongjiang shanghai jiangsu fujian jiangxi sichuan and guizhou these results indicate a discrepancy between household wfs and regional economic development although the income and expenditures of households in poorer western china were lower than those in eastern china per capita wfs were smaller in wealthy provinces for example the per capita wf of each income group in xinjiang was much higher than that of each income group in beijing while the per capita gdp of xinjiang was merely 36 1 of that of beijing in 2012 this is primarily due to disparities in wui the cumulative value of wui in xinjiang was 4917 3 m3 yuan while that in beijing was 1073 4 m3 yuan given the dominant position of agriculture in the composition of household wfs discrepancies in agricultural wui caused by differences in climate and irrigation practices are responsible for these results liu et al 2021 furthermore relatively extensive water management practices and simple agricultural techniques were the primary drivers of the high wfs xinjiang and ningxia have struggled to develop their agricultural production by introducing water efficient irrigation systems the agricultural wui in the two provinces was 3212 6 and 2102 7 m3 yuan respectively which is very high provinces with a high cumulative wui such as xinjiang ningxia qinghai and gansu have weaker economic development resulting in a lower share of commodities from other provinces in consumption and a higher share of local goods and services in addition to the differences in wui the discrepancy in consumption patterns between the various income groups is also remarkable supplementary table 3 for example rural residents living in poor provinces such as beijing 14 2 m3 inner mongolia 10 5 m3 and shanghai 10 4 m3 exhibited high per capita wfs due to expenditures on housing which is closely associated with high levels of water consumption in the production of commodities and for direct use 3 4 inequality in household water footprints across china to probe into the inequality in household wfs across china and identify the contribution of various household expenditures to the urban rural disparity and provincial differences we examine the water inequality in the eight main expenditure categories fig 7 a illustrates the variation in the national cumulative wf across income levels from lowest to highest it reveals substantial discrepancies between the different groups for example the water inequality in clothing was the greatest with a wf gini of 0 62 because 12 of the total wf was attributable to the bottom 60 of the population in terms of income while 88 was attributable to the top 40 clothing is followed by education with over half of the corresponding wf being attributable to 20 of the population across china and the wf gini for education was 0 49 the water inequality in housing was the smallest with a wf gini of 0 21 which can be interpreted as relative equality the wf ginis for food other consumption and transport were 0 30 0 31 and 0 33 respectively which indicate relative inequality the inequality in both household facilities and health care was substantial with wf ginis of 0 41 and 0 43 respectively fig 7b depicts the wf ginis for the eight expenditure categories among urban and rural households in detail in five of the eight categories food health care residence clothing and other consumption water inequality was greater among rural households than among urban residents in contrast the wf ginis for the remaining three categories were much higher among urban households interestingly the wf ginis for transport education and other consumptions were higher for china as a whole than among either urban or rural households this illustrates that the wf caused by consumption in these categories among high income rural households exceeded that among low income urban households we also found that the wf gini for housing in china as a whole 0 21 was lower than that among both urban 0 23 and rural 0 25 households this is primarily due to the strictly lower wfs of rural households relative to that of urban households the largest gap between urban and rural households was in the wf gini for household facilities the urban wf gini for household facilities was 0 43 indicating great inequality while the rural wf gini was 0 36 representing relatively less inequality the above results may suggest that water inequality is closely related to household consumption volume similar findings have also been obtained in research on household carbon inequality mi et al 2020 and energy inequality wu et al 2017 provincial total wf ginis ranged from 0 20 beijing to 0 36 guizhou in 2012 fig 7c water inequality declined with regional economic development for example the three provinces with the lowest wf ginis were beijing 0 20 shanghai 0 22 and tianjin 0 24 while per capita gdp was the highest in these three provinces by comparison poor provinces in western china had high levels of water inequality the wf gini in guizhou a poor western province was 0 36 in 2012 while its per capita gdp was only 19 668 yuan furthermore per capita gdp in gansu and yunnan was also very low and the wf ginis in those provinces were 0 33 and 0 34 respectively overall the water inequality in china s wealthier eastern regions was much narrower than that in the poorer provinces in western china as identified by the lower wf gini coefficients the water inequality in each expenditure category differed across the provinces for example in shanghai the lowest wf gini was for food and the highest was for transport in anhui the smallest water inequality was in housing and the largest in education this is due to differences in the expenditure structures of the different groups within the different provinces across china conclusions and policy implications there were large wf inequalities between households within and across provinces in china in 2012 first the wf of urban residents was 2 5 times as large as that of rural residents there was a much larger gap in the per capita wf between urban and rural residents in provinces with a much larger per capita wf although china has experienced rapid economic development in recent decades it suffers from an obvious urban rural divide as one of china s greatest challenges the urban rural divide has also prevented sustainable development much higher incomes and more colorful lifestyles mean a higher wf among urban households than rural households second the per capita wf varied widely across the different chinese provinces in contrast with the carbon footprint however there was no observable correlation between the per capita wf and per capita gdp water use embodied in food consumption accounted for the highest share of the household wf and agriculture was the largest consumer of water variation in the wui of agricultural sectors is closely related to geographical location and climatic conditions china has made great efforts to ease regional water shortages and overcome the spatial heterogeneity in water availability by physically transferring water across valleys as in the south north water transfer project third the household wfs within the various income groups exhibit substantial variation the gaps in the per capita wfs between the seven urban income groups were larger than those between the five rural income groups the gap in the per capita wf between the lowest income urban households and the highest income urban households ranged from 163 3 tianjin to 1646 4 xinjiang while the same gap among rural households ranged only from 37 0 beijing to 519 8 xinjiang in provinces with per capita wfs that were lower than the national average such as yunnan a high per capita wf was observed among the high income urban households water inequality declined with regional economic development on the whole the water inequality in china s wealthier eastern regions was much smaller than that in the poorer provinces of western china economic growth not only increases household income but also helps shift household consumption to commodities and services with a lower wui and reduce water inequality in china despite the large per capita wfs among high income households we emphasize the importance of focusing on the variation in water inequality in addition to the per capita wf advanced technologies and strict water management regulations have contributed to the decrease in wui in china higher income households purchase more goods and have larger wfs than lower income households but the share of less water intensive items in their expenditures is larger thus the gaps between the various income groups decline furthermore the water inequality in the eight expenditure categories differs between urban and rural households in five categories food health care housing clothing and other consumption the water inequality among rural households was greater than that among urban households in contrast the wf ginis for the remaining three categories were much higher among urban households across the 30 provinces there is substantial variation in the water inequality in the eight consumption categories due to the differences in expenditure structures among different groups governments need to pay more attention to household water inequality when considering water resource allocations and water saving duties although china has recognized the importance of regional equality in the allocation of watershed water water equality at the individual or household level is rarely mentioned according to our findings the urban rural divide promotes inequality in household wfs positive action should be taken to close the urban rural divide our results also revealed the household wfs of rich groups are higher than poor groups the gaps in the wf can be reduced by improving the income of low income households enabling them to overcome their poverty and reducing the consumption of high wui commodities among high income households furthermore water taxation appropriate legislation and other policy tools are necessary to improve water inequality any broad brush policy may lead to a reduction in inequality for example an increase in the price of water should lead to an increase in the prices of commodities which frequently affects low income households more strongly than high income households therefore policy makers need to pay more attention to the poorest segments of society credit authorship contribution statement gang liu methodology data curation software writing original

3137,in addition to china s physical water shortage income and expenditure disparities can exacerbate the country s water issues thus preventing an equitable distribution of water resources across diverse household groups by linking chinese data on household expenditure with an environmentally extended multiregional input output mrio table this study calculates household water footprints wfs for 12 income groups in 30 provinces across china and assesses the water inequality among households in 2012 in addition to inequality across regions importantly water inequality across different income groups is identified the findings show that 1 the inequality in wfs between households within and across provinces in china is large within provinces the wf of urban residents is 2 5 times as large as that of rural residents across provinces xinjiang has the highest per capita wf 1126 17 m3 while shandong has the lowest 155 97 m3 2 differences in household wfs vary widely by income group the gap in the per capita wf between very low income urban households and very high income households ranges between 163 3 m3 tianjin and 1646 4 m3 xinjiang while the gap among rural households ranges only from 37 0 m3 beijing to 519 8 m3 xinjiang 3 water inequality declines with regional economic development in 2012 the province level total wf gini coefficients ranged from 0 20 beijing to 0 36 guizhou the water inequality in china s wealthier eastern region is much narrower than that in the poorer provinces in western china governments need to pay more attention to household water inequality when considering the allocation of water and water saving duties keywords water footprint inequality input output analysis sdgs urban rural disparity 1 introduction water is the source of the development of human society water is not only related to the rational overall utilization of various resources but is also important for the sustainable development of regional economies due to adjustments to the industrial structure population growth and improvements in quality of life global demand for water and the pressure on global water resources are increasing daily vanham et al 2018 however there is an imbalance in the demand for and supply of water the supply of available freshwater is far less than the demand in terms of timing and its geographical distribution sun et al 2017 leading to water scarcity in many regions of the world besides physical water scarcity economic water scarcity may lead to the severe consequences for most vulnerable and poor people molden and ed 2007 rosa et al 2020 vallino et al 2020 china as the world s second largest economy also suffers from water scarcity the per capita available water resources in china are only one quarter of the world average guan et al 2014 water scarcity has become an important threat to sustainable development identifying the sources of water and available quantities and measuring the consumption of water helps to clarify and alleviate the challenge of water shortages hoekstra 2014 the water footprint is the amount of water needed to produce a commodity or a set of produced or consumed commodities d odorico et al 2019 wfs provide a new perspective on complex water problems and their solutions and enables the generation of new ideas for freshwater utilization ge et al 2011 chini et al 2017 rushforth and ruddell 2018 household wfs refer to water needed for household to live which contains direct and indirect water use water used directly includes surface water or groundwater blue water indirect water use is the water used throughout the production process of goods which consumed by a household virtual water allan 1998 dalin et al 2012 as the largest percentage of total household water consumption virtual water is highly important in the analysis of water resource utilization virtual water is accompanied by regional trade and transferred between regions yang and zehnder 2007 in theory the use of virtual water can result in a transfer of water resources away from rich areas to scarce areas for utilization thus achieving a spatial redistribution of water resources alleviating the current imbalance in the spatial distribution of wfs and providing a way to resolve water shortages dalin et al 2012 household consumption includes expenditures on food health care housing household facilities clothing transport and education among others fan et al 2020 household consumption is influenced by household income consumption tendencies individual pursuits and other factors which means that household consumption structures are uncertain soltani et al 2020 virtual water use can also change with changes in the trade of goods and services feng et al 2012 thus affecting the inequality in household water footprints reducing income inequality has been highlighted as one of the united nations 17 sustainable development goals sdgs wiedmann and lenzen 2018 in addition to household income inequality household inequality in resource consumption has also been observed and become the subject of research an example of non income inequality is carbon footprint inequality feng et al 2021 household consumption characteristics vary across regions due to differences in economic development and technology levels zhao et al 2017 and this variation is visible not only among urban households but also among rural households lise and seitz 2011 income inequality is one reason for inequality in household consumption several studies have investigated inequality in water consumption for example sun et al 2017 measured the water inequality among the chinese provinces according to water use category and wang and wang 2021 analyzed the evolution of water inequality in china from 2004 to 2018 and its drivers however few studies have examined the water inequality between households in one region furthermore few studies have examined the differences in household expenditures between various consumption categories in this study we address the following three issues what is the per capita wf of chinese households in various income groups how is water inequality distributed across income groups in china which expenditure categories contribute the most to the inequality in household wfs to this end we evaluate the water inequality between 12 income groups across china in 2012 we account for the direct and indirect consumption of water by urban and rural households by using a multiregional input output mrio model furthermore we use gini coefficients to measure water inequality and lorenz curves to identify changes in the household wf between the various income groups this study provides new insights into how household consumption expenditure patterns and urban rural disparities influence household wfs and sheds light on potential inequality issues in other developing countries 2 methodology and materials 2 1 system boundary the system boundary for this study is depicted in fig 1 household consumption for each income group is obtained from the provincial statistical yearbooks urban households are sorted into seven groups and rural households are sorted into five groups according to household income water resource and water use data are obtained from the china statistical yearbook which provides data on water consumption in various sectors and direct household consumption direct household water consumption includes surface water or groundwater for drinking from the tap in the shower for toilets and for flowers among other uses furthermore this study extends the classical use of the chinese economic mrio multiregional input output model by employing water resource and water use data to account for indirect household water use that is the water used to produce or provide food health care household facilities education clothing and transport among other goods and services indirect household water consumption may occur as follows on the one hand people living in region a may purchase commodities and services produced in their local area and this production uses the water resources available in region a on the other hand residents in region a may consume goods and services produced in other regions the amount of water consumed indirectly by households in the process of purchasing goods and services can be derived through the use of water use data for various sectors in different regions the indirect household water footprint is also referred to as the household virtual water footprint vwf because it captures the water use that is embodied in commodities and services liao et al 2021 local consumption and regional water leakage are both included in the extended environmental mrio accounting framework for china 2 2 household virtual water footprint calculation household physical water consumption can be obtained from the china statistical yearbook a water extended input output weio table is employed to calculate vwfs on the basis of the economic mrio table for china fig 2 in line with several recent studies sun et al 2017 lin et al 2019 islam et al 2021 as a consistent accounting and modeling framework the weio table quantifies regional water leakages along with the economic links between different sectors across various regions it provides a method for linking household consumption to interregional goods and services chains feng et al 2021 the household vwf accounting model is based on the weio table given an economic system with n economic sectors in r regions the general equation for the mrio analysis can be written as follows 1 x 1 x r x r a 11 a 1 r a r 1 a rs a rr a r 1 a rr x 1 x r x r y 11 y s y 1 s e x 1 y rr y s y rs e x r y rr y s y rs e x r where x r is an n 1 vector that indicates the total output of the n sectors in province r a rs is n n matrices of technical coefficients and element a ij rs in a rs indicating intermediate input y rr is an n 1 vector that indicates the local final consumption of goods and services produced by various sectors y rs is the goods and services from province r to province s used for final consumption and ex r indicates the volume of goods and services produced by the various sectors in province r that exported to foreign countries by using eq 1 the total output of the various regions sorted by sector can be transformed into final consumption as follows 2 x i a 1 y where i is the identity matrix i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix and y s y 1 s e x 1 s y 2 s e x 2 s y rs e x r t eq 2 can be extended by introducing water consumption the vwf can then be calculated with the following formula 3 w d x d i a 1 y t y where w w 1 w 2 w r t w r is an n 1 vector denoting the water consumed by each sector in province r d is a matrix whose diagonal elements represent the intensity of direct water use and t is the water use coefficient matrix for both direct and indirect water use the flow of virtual water from region r to region s is defined as v w rs and can be calculated using eq 4 4 v w rs i t ri y is where t ri is a row vector denoting the water resources from region r that are needed to produce one unit of output in the various sectors in region i and y is is a column vector of commodities produced by the various sectors from region i that are imported to region s the vwf for region s is calculated with eq 5 5 vw f s v w s v w rs where vw f s represents the vwf of region s v w s is the virtual water induced by local consumption and v w rs indicates the virtual water from region r to region s 2 3 measure of household water inequality gini coefficient the gini coefficient is a classic indicator for measuring the equality in the distribution of resident incomes and has been widely applied in previous studies gini 1921 wiedenhofer et al 2017 mi et al 2020 the gini coefficient has also been used to investigate regional inequality in water scarcity sun et al 2021 we employ the gini coefficient to quantify household water inequality ranging from zero to one the gini coefficient indicates greater inequality as its value increases a value of zero means perfect equality while a value of one represents extreme inequality the general equation for an ordinary gini coefficient is 6 g i 1 n d i y i 2 i 1 n d i 1 t i 1 where g is the gini coefficient the share of the population in each group is represented by d i while the share of income in each group is denoted by y i t i represents the cumulative share of income for each group different household groups defined by income are indexed with i which ranges from 0 to n the aim of our study is to measure the inequality in household wfs this is done by deriving the wf gini coefficient wf gini an extension of the standard gini coefficient which can be computed by replacing household income with household wfs 7 g wf i 1 n d i f i 2 i 1 n d i 1 u i 1 where g wf denotes the wf gini f i is the share of the wf attributable to each group and u i indicates the cumulative share of the household wf for group i 2 4 data compilation all urban households are classified into seven groups very poor 10 poor 10 lower middle 20 middle 20 upper middle 20 rich 10 and very rich 10 and rural households into five groups poor 20 lower middle 20 middle 20 upper middle 20 and rich 20 according to household income notably the groups are defined on the basis of the number of households rather than the population household consumption can be characterized by expenditures in eight primary categories food health care housing household facilities clothing transport education and other detailed data on the consumption of the 12 household groups are available in the provincial statistical yearbooks and the household consumption of each group is divided into the eight categories above although the shares for each group are calculated on the basis of the number of households the provincial statistical yearbooks report per capita annual monetary expenditures which provide the foundation for us to calculate the per capita wf of each income group the water resource and water use data cover blue water which is defined as surface water and groundwater without accounting for green water and greywater this approach is similar to that of various studies focusing on resident wfs chini et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 direct water consumption and population data for the 30 provinces are available in the china statistical yearbook china national bureau of statistics 2013 the primary users of water have been aggregated into four categories in the water consumption data agriculture industry the tertiary sector and households and ecological construction although it is not transferred into commodities or services the water consumed by households is accounted for in the wf as direct use however ecological water consumption is not included in our study owing to its weak linkage to economic activities the water consumed by agriculture includes the water used for crop farming for forestry for raising livestock and in fisheries the water consumed by specific sectors in the secondary industry is calculated with reference to the shares reported in the chinese economic census yearbook the state council leading group office of second china economic census 2008 given that the tertiary sector and households are not separated in the china statistical yearbook we use the water resources bulletin released by the provincial level water resources department for each province to calculate water consumption separately for the tertiary sector and households the total water consumed by all service sectors is allocated across sectors according to the proportion of intermediate inputs from the water production and supply sector allocated to each service sector in the mrio an approach that was developed in previous research zhang and anadon 2014 the mrio table is compiled by adopting a gravity model on the basis of national and provincial input output io tables zheng et al 2020 we obtain china mrio table from ceads database https www ceads net our mrio table covers 42 economic sectors which gives more detail than the mrio tables used in previous studies sun 2019 these sectors can be classified into the three main industrial categories the primary industry agriculture the secondary industry heavy industry and the tertiary industry services given the lack of water use data this study excludes construction and focuses on the remaining 41 sectors we use g1 to g41 to denote the 41 sectors and a detailed correspondence can be found in supplementary table 1 the chinese mrio table provides the monetary linkages among 30 of china s provinces data are unavailable for tibet hong kong macao and taiwan household consumption matrices are contained in the mrio which lays the foundations for calculating the household wf the 2012 chinese mrio table is obtained from the carbon emission accounts and datasets provided by existing research liu et al 2021 following previous studies mi et al 2020 the consumption of the goods and services produced by the 41 sectors under study was divided into eight categories see supplementary table 2 with direct water use being grouped into the housing category the household vwf is attributable to the consumption in these eight categories 2 5 limitations beginning with the chinese mrio table that includes household consumption our study investigates the per capita wf of the households in various income groups and across china s 30 provinces this accounting method limits the additional consideration of indirect water consumed via import goods from abroad as is the case for existing research jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 as one of the largest importers globally china imports approximately 120 gm3 of virtual water via international trade hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 including the virtual water embodied in imported commodities in the accounting of household wfs may influence our measurement of water inequality this however is not within the scope of our research dynamic changes in household consumption and inequality are not depicted we employ official data from national and provincial statistical bureaus and calculate both direct and indirect household wfs however the latest survey of household expenditures by income group was conducted in 2012 and that survey is not an annual survey furthermore the categorization of household expenditures suffers from subjective measurement errors that are unavoidable in household level surveys especially surveys conducted in rural areas within developing countries in addition it would be worthwhile to investigate other factors such as age and gender that cause water inequality across households finally all data on household income and expenditures are in nominal terms which is common in previous studies these limitations highlight the direction of future work 3 results and discussion 3 1 water use intensity in the various sectors in different provinces water use intensity wui is the ratio of water consumption to the value of output in this study the coefficient of total water use is used to represent wui water resources are consumed in the production of goods and the provision of services given that our accounting framework is based on monetary values it was necessary to obtain the wui in the various sectors in the different provinces before calculating household vwfs fig 3 depicts the wui results and the cumulative values with the breakdown of the contributions from the three primary industries are shown in the right hand panel given that wui is greater in agriculture than in the other sectors agriculture is assigned its own color map with a wider scale to illustrate the differences across provinces in 2012 there was substantial variation in wui in agriculture it ranged from 256 8 beijing to 3212 6 xinjiang agricultural wui was less than 500 in 14 provinces while in 11 provinces it was between 500 and 1000 in addition to xinjiang ningxia also had a considerably high agricultural wui at 2102 7 we also observe wide variation in wui in sectors g2 to g41 across the different provinces the average wui in each secondary industry sector from g2 to g27 falls between 6 2 and 158 7 wui in g12 g24 g6 and g14 was high in nearly all provinces with average values of 158 7 143 6 127 0 and 121 6 respectively however in beijing wui in the same four sectors was relatively low with values of 41 7 6 1 31 6 and 29 3 respectively wui in g21 g27 and g26 was low in almost all provinces with an average wui in each of those three sectors of less than 10 for the tertiary industry from g28 to g41 wui in g28 ranging from 32 0 to 143 6 g29 from 35 8 to 128 0 and g32 from 12 0 to 97 1 was relatively high with an average wui in each sector of 69 6 66 3 and 54 9 respectively interestingly wui in g36 in yunnan guizhou sichuan guangxi shandong and fujian was greater than 100 while that in 21 of the provinces was less than 20 wui in g38 g39 g40 and g41 was low in almost all provinces in these four sectors the average wui was 6 8 2 3 6 5 and 7 0 respectively the sum of the wui values across the three primary industries could be interpreted as a global wui measure global wui was the lowest in beijing while it was the highest in xinjiang although wui in the service industry in beijing was not low compared to that in other provinces the low wui in agriculture and the secondary industry in beijing resulted in that city having the lowest global wui xinjiang and ningxia had the highest global and agricultural wui and wui in the service industry in those two provinces were also relatively high in four provinces xinjiang ningxia qinghai and gansu the cumulative value of agricultural wui in the other 26 provinces the secondary industry accounted for the largest share in guizhou sichuan shandong fujian zhejiang shanghai liaoning and beijing the share of the cumulative wui value attributable to the service industry was greater than that attributable to agriculture 3 2 regional differentiation and the structure of the per capita water footprint fig 4 a shows the per capita wf and gdp of the 30 chinese provinces the national average wf which accounts for both direct and indirect water consumption was 282 1 m3 as shown in fig 4a however the per capita wf varied substantially across the 30 provinces the per capita wf was the highest in xinjiang at 1126 17 m3 and ningxia had the second highest per capita wf 691 62 m3 this is due to the high wui in those two provinces there were 13 provinces xinjiang ningxia shanghai guangdong jiangsu guangxi qinghai heilongjiang jiangxi zhejiang fujian hunan and gansu in which the per capita wf was higher than the national average in seven provinces shandong hebei tianjin shanxi henan guizhou and shaanxi the per capita wf was less than 170 m3 of these seven provinces residents living in shandong had an average wf of 155 97 m3 furthermore in ten provinces the per capita wf was below the national average wf a previous investigation has revealed that per capita carbon footprints and per capita gdp are correlated mi et al 2020 however we do not observe a similar relation between the per capita wfs and gdp in this study fig 4b provides detailed information on the composition of the per capita wfs this figure implies that the vwf is an important component of the total wf fig 4c presents the share of the vwf attributable to various sectors in most provinces g1 agriculture accounted for the highest share of the vwf g6 food processing and tobacco also accounted for a considerable share in many provinces the sum of the shares attributable to g1 and to g6 was lower in wealthy provinces than in poor provinces for example the shares summed to 29 1 in beijing 34 8 in shanghai 51 3 in zhejiang and 56 3 in jiangsu however the same sum was 96 4 in xinjiang 93 9 in ningxia 92 4 in yunnan and 90 2 in hainan in wealthy provinces the vwf in g28 transport and storage and g32 real estate also accounted for a considerable share of the total the share of the vwf in g28 was highest in shanghai and beijing reaching 20 3 and 13 3 respectively similarly the share of the vwf in g32 was also highest in beijing and shanghai reaching 28 8 and 15 5 respectively 3 3 variation in expenditures and the water footprint across various groups fig 5 shows that per capita expenditures climbed rapidly with the increases in household income at the national level per capita expenditures among middle income households were 74 4 higher than those among low income households while expenditures among high income households were 98 9 higher than those of middle income households the larger gap in expenditures between low and high income households was due mainly to a larger gap in the consumption of food and clothing per capita expenditures on food and clothing among middle income households were 1509 yuan and 770 yuan higher respectively than those of low income households the growth in expenditures on clothing 2572 yuan among high income households was greater than that among middle income households while consumption of food among high income households was higher by 2464 yuan furthermore the increase in expenditures on transport in the high income groups was remarkable middle income households spent 555 yuan more on transport than low income households while expenditures on transport among high income households were 1655 yuan higher than those among middle income households for urban households the gaps between the different income groups were larger middle income households spent 85 9 more than low income households while high income households spent 101 8 more than middle income households expenditures among high income households were 3 77 times greater than those among low income households the ranking of the contributions of the different expenditure categories is similar to that at the national level with food and clothing still being the largest expenditure categories the next largest contributor was transport among rural households expenditures among middle income households were merely 45 1 higher than those of low income households which is less than the gap at the national level or among urban households however the expenditures of high income households were dramatically higher than those of middle income households with gaps that were nearly twice as large as those between the low and middle income households food consumption was the dominant source of the gap in expenditures between low and middle income households while the contribution of clothing was not noteworthy although food was still a primary contributor to the gap in expenditures between middle and high income households which is similar to the pattern among urban households the housing rather than clothing was the second major contributor to that gap interestingly expenditures on health care account for a substantial share of the gap in household consumption between low income and high income urban households while health care did not clearly contribute to the variation in expenditures among rural households in 2012 the population in urban households accounted for 53 of the total population of china and contributed 74 of china s total household wf fig 6 presents the per capita water footprints of 12 the household groups for each of the 30 chinese provinces the per capita wf of urban households is much higher than that of rural households in all provinces there was a much larger gap in the per capita wf between urban and rural residents in provinces with a much larger per capita wf for example the per capita wf of urban households in xinjiang fig 6 row 6 column 5 which had the highest per capita wf out of all 30 provinces in 2012 was 2 77 times that of rural households however the per capita wf of urban households in shandong fig 6 row 3 column 5 which had the lowest per capita wf was merely 2 2 times that of rural households these per capita wf results are similar to those estimated by previous studies sun and fang 2019 interestingly the gaps in the per capita wf between the seven urban income groups was larger than those between the five rural income groups the gaps in the per capita wf between the lowest income urban households and highest income households ranged from 163 3 tianjin to 1646 4 xinjiang while the gap among rural households ranged only from 37 0 beijing to 519 8 xinjiang the per capita wfs of yunnan and inner mongolia were 224 94 m3 and 260 0 m3 respectively both of which are less than the national average wf however the wfs of the highest income urban groups in those two provinces were dramatically higher similar results were also observed for beijing liaoning jilin heilongjiang shanghai jiangsu fujian jiangxi sichuan and guizhou these results indicate a discrepancy between household wfs and regional economic development although the income and expenditures of households in poorer western china were lower than those in eastern china per capita wfs were smaller in wealthy provinces for example the per capita wf of each income group in xinjiang was much higher than that of each income group in beijing while the per capita gdp of xinjiang was merely 36 1 of that of beijing in 2012 this is primarily due to disparities in wui the cumulative value of wui in xinjiang was 4917 3 m3 yuan while that in beijing was 1073 4 m3 yuan given the dominant position of agriculture in the composition of household wfs discrepancies in agricultural wui caused by differences in climate and irrigation practices are responsible for these results liu et al 2021 furthermore relatively extensive water management practices and simple agricultural techniques were the primary drivers of the high wfs xinjiang and ningxia have struggled to develop their agricultural production by introducing water efficient irrigation systems the agricultural wui in the two provinces was 3212 6 and 2102 7 m3 yuan respectively which is very high provinces with a high cumulative wui such as xinjiang ningxia qinghai and gansu have weaker economic development resulting in a lower share of commodities from other provinces in consumption and a higher share of local goods and services in addition to the differences in wui the discrepancy in consumption patterns between the various income groups is also remarkable supplementary table 3 for example rural residents living in poor provinces such as beijing 14 2 m3 inner mongolia 10 5 m3 and shanghai 10 4 m3 exhibited high per capita wfs due to expenditures on housing which is closely associated with high levels of water consumption in the production of commodities and for direct use 3 4 inequality in household water footprints across china to probe into the inequality in household wfs across china and identify the contribution of various household expenditures to the urban rural disparity and provincial differences we examine the water inequality in the eight main expenditure categories fig 7 a illustrates the variation in the national cumulative wf across income levels from lowest to highest it reveals substantial discrepancies between the different groups for example the water inequality in clothing was the greatest with a wf gini of 0 62 because 12 of the total wf was attributable to the bottom 60 of the population in terms of income while 88 was attributable to the top 40 clothing is followed by education with over half of the corresponding wf being attributable to 20 of the population across china and the wf gini for education was 0 49 the water inequality in housing was the smallest with a wf gini of 0 21 which can be interpreted as relative equality the wf ginis for food other consumption and transport were 0 30 0 31 and 0 33 respectively which indicate relative inequality the inequality in both household facilities and health care was substantial with wf ginis of 0 41 and 0 43 respectively fig 7b depicts the wf ginis for the eight expenditure categories among urban and rural households in detail in five of the eight categories food health care residence clothing and other consumption water inequality was greater among rural households than among urban residents in contrast the wf ginis for the remaining three categories were much higher among urban households interestingly the wf ginis for transport education and other consumptions were higher for china as a whole than among either urban or rural households this illustrates that the wf caused by consumption in these categories among high income rural households exceeded that among low income urban households we also found that the wf gini for housing in china as a whole 0 21 was lower than that among both urban 0 23 and rural 0 25 households this is primarily due to the strictly lower wfs of rural households relative to that of urban households the largest gap between urban and rural households was in the wf gini for household facilities the urban wf gini for household facilities was 0 43 indicating great inequality while the rural wf gini was 0 36 representing relatively less inequality the above results may suggest that water inequality is closely related to household consumption volume similar findings have also been obtained in research on household carbon inequality mi et al 2020 and energy inequality wu et al 2017 provincial total wf ginis ranged from 0 20 beijing to 0 36 guizhou in 2012 fig 7c water inequality declined with regional economic development for example the three provinces with the lowest wf ginis were beijing 0 20 shanghai 0 22 and tianjin 0 24 while per capita gdp was the highest in these three provinces by comparison poor provinces in western china had high levels of water inequality the wf gini in guizhou a poor western province was 0 36 in 2012 while its per capita gdp was only 19 668 yuan furthermore per capita gdp in gansu and yunnan was also very low and the wf ginis in those provinces were 0 33 and 0 34 respectively overall the water inequality in china s wealthier eastern regions was much narrower than that in the poorer provinces in western china as identified by the lower wf gini coefficients the water inequality in each expenditure category differed across the provinces for example in shanghai the lowest wf gini was for food and the highest was for transport in anhui the smallest water inequality was in housing and the largest in education this is due to differences in the expenditure structures of the different groups within the different provinces across china conclusions and policy implications there were large wf inequalities between households within and across provinces in china in 2012 first the wf of urban residents was 2 5 times as large as that of rural residents there was a much larger gap in the per capita wf between urban and rural residents in provinces with a much larger per capita wf although china has experienced rapid economic development in recent decades it suffers from an obvious urban rural divide as one of china s greatest challenges the urban rural divide has also prevented sustainable development much higher incomes and more colorful lifestyles mean a higher wf among urban households than rural households second the per capita wf varied widely across the different chinese provinces in contrast with the carbon footprint however there was no observable correlation between the per capita wf and per capita gdp water use embodied in food consumption accounted for the highest share of the household wf and agriculture was the largest consumer of water variation in the wui of agricultural sectors is closely related to geographical location and climatic conditions china has made great efforts to ease regional water shortages and overcome the spatial heterogeneity in water availability by physically transferring water across valleys as in the south north water transfer project third the household wfs within the various income groups exhibit substantial variation the gaps in the per capita wfs between the seven urban income groups were larger than those between the five rural income groups the gap in the per capita wf between the lowest income urban households and the highest income urban households ranged from 163 3 tianjin to 1646 4 xinjiang while the same gap among rural households ranged only from 37 0 beijing to 519 8 xinjiang in provinces with per capita wfs that were lower than the national average such as yunnan a high per capita wf was observed among the high income urban households water inequality declined with regional economic development on the whole the water inequality in china s wealthier eastern regions was much smaller than that in the poorer provinces of western china economic growth not only increases household income but also helps shift household consumption to commodities and services with a lower wui and reduce water inequality in china despite the large per capita wfs among high income households we emphasize the importance of focusing on the variation in water inequality in addition to the per capita wf advanced technologies and strict water management regulations have contributed to the decrease in wui in china higher income households purchase more goods and have larger wfs than lower income households but the share of less water intensive items in their expenditures is larger thus the gaps between the various income groups decline furthermore the water inequality in the eight expenditure categories differs between urban and rural households in five categories food health care housing clothing and other consumption the water inequality among rural households was greater than that among urban households in contrast the wf ginis for the remaining three categories were much higher among urban households across the 30 provinces there is substantial variation in the water inequality in the eight consumption categories due to the differences in expenditure structures among different groups governments need to pay more attention to household water inequality when considering water resource allocations and water saving duties although china has recognized the importance of regional equality in the allocation of watershed water water equality at the individual or household level is rarely mentioned according to our findings the urban rural divide promotes inequality in household wfs positive action should be taken to close the urban rural divide our results also revealed the household wfs of rich groups are higher than poor groups the gaps in the wf can be reduced by improving the income of low income households enabling them to overcome their poverty and reducing the consumption of high wui commodities among high income households furthermore water taxation appropriate legislation and other policy tools are necessary to improve water inequality any broad brush policy may lead to a reduction in inequality for example an increase in the price of water should lead to an increase in the prices of commodities which frequently affects low income households more strongly than high income

over the world and they may be extreme events in some conditions similarly to debris flows they involve a water sediment mixture moving under the effect gravity under proper geomorphological conditions usually triggered by either short heavy rainfalls or long periods of rain these flows are often distinguished based on the quantity and the characteristics of the solid fraction takahashi 2018 and generally mud flows correspond to highly concentrated mixtures of water and fine sediments in which volumetric solid concentration varies from 6 to 60 ng and mei 1994 o brien 2003 widjaja and hsien heng lee 2013 along with debris and mud flows lava flows characterized by a mass of volcanic material flowing over natural slopes due to the gravity may also be regarded as dangerous and sudden events harris 2015 debris mud and lava flows can also be related to quite high hazard due to the impossibility to predict the triggering event well in advance and the possible presence of civil structures along the path of propagation iverson 2003 jenkins et al 2017 thus the modelling of propagation of such flows and their interaction with structures is particularly relevant for risk management it is of utmost importance to evaluate the forces acting on buildings and on structure in order to design different kinds of countermeasures such as protective flexible and rigid barriers mizuyama 2008 ng et al 2017 scifoni et al 2010 both experiments and numerical simulations have been widely used for evaluating the impact dynamics of debris mud lava flows against rigid walls considering dry granular and debris flows many experimental research addressed the impact through field e g hu et al 2011 marchi et al 2002 and laboratory e g armanini and scotton 1993 cui et al 2015 investigations small scale laboratory experiments choi et al 2015 ng et al 2021 scheidl et al 2013 permitted the systematic study of the complex flow structure interaction under controlled conditions these investigations allowed to define the peak value of the impact force and different simplified theoretical continuum based approaches have been used to deduce semi empirical formulas e g armanini 2009 armanini and scotton 1993 bugnion et al 2012 vagnon and segalini 2016 based on different consideration and hypothesis the impact of a mud flow against an obstacle has been experimentally analyzed by tiberghien et al 2007 the fluid was a carbopol solution with yield stress and the dynamics of the impact has been deeply analyzed through the measure of the local velocities and of the pressure distribution on the obstacle besides experimental investigations numerical simulations based on appropriate flow models are nowadays commonly used to analyze the interaction of sediment laden flows with obstacles for simulating debris mud flows both two phase and one phase models have been employed ancey 2007 coussot 2017a the former approach accounting for the mass and momentum equations for both the solid and fluid components can independently reproduce the solid and fluid phase velocities e g di cristo et al 2016 greco et al 2012 pudasaini 2012 and has also been used to simulate the fluid structure interaction e g chiou et al 2005 di cristo et al 2020 kattel et al 2018 the one phase models conversely consider the mixture as a homogeneous continuum with a non newtonian rheology either with a yield stress such as bingham e g imran et al 2001 liu and mei 1989 liu and mei 1989 imran et al 2001 and herschel bulkley e g chanson et al 2006 coussot 1994 di cristo et al 2013 huang and garcía 1998 maciel et al 2017 models or without it i e the power law model e g hwang et al 1994 ng and mei 1994 an extensive discussion concerning the role played by the yield stress may be found in balmforth et al 2014 and coussot 2017b power law rheological models are adequate to describe slurry matrices remaining essentially liquefied through the flow iverson 2014 and they therefore may be used to reproduce the behavior of landslides carotenuto et al 2015 and flows of natural estuarine muds bai and tian 2011 zhang et al 2010 simple one phase models despite the complexity due to degassing and cooling processes can be usefully applied also to lava flows even if in some cases high temperature and few gas the lava can be efficiently modelled as either a newtonian e g takagi and huppert 2010 tallarico and dragoni 1999 or homogeneous non newtonian fluid for example a bingham rheology castruccio et al 2013 kelfoun and vargas 2016 can be adopted in the presence of bubbles and or crystals and depending on the amount of degassing that has occurred both herschel bulkley and power law model tallarico et al 2011 balmforth and craster 2000 conroy and lev 2021 filippucci et al 2010 soule and cashman 2005 may be used to describe the fluid behaviour for these reasons the one phase model has been extensively used to investigate the interaction of both debris mud ionescu 2013 rickenmann et al 2006 and lava chirico et al 2009 fujita et al 2009 scifoni et al 2010 waves with obstacles however to estimate the pressure force caused by the impact of a wave against obstacles one phase models with yield stress have been mainly considered laigle et al 2007 tang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 zanuttigh and lamberti 2006 than the power law model the impact of a yield less mud wave against obstacles has been numerically studied by iervolino et al 2017 and greco et al 2019 both studies considered specific values of the rheological parameters i e consistency μ n and power law exponent n in order to represent the rheology of the catastrophic landslides occurred in 1999 in cervinara italy carotenuto et al 2015 among the different proposals the choice of the most suitable way to predict the impact force and in particular its peak value caused by a shear thinning flow representative of a mud or a lava wave is still an open question the present paper numerically analyzes the impact of a wave of shear thinning power law fluids against a rigid wall systematically varying both the rheological parameters and flow conditions inspired by the fair accuracy of the depth integrated schematization fent et al 2018 in the estimation of the impact forces on rigid structures due to water aureli et al 2015 hien and van chien 2021 and debris sarno et al 2013 zanuttigh and lamberti 2006 waves the shallow water model proposed by ng and mei 1994 valid when the length scale normal to the bottom is very small compared to longitudinal and transverse ones has been herein considered in details this study analyzes the temporal history of the force to evaluate its dependence on the values of the rheological parameters of the fluid consistency density and rheological index and on the distance from the wall the effect of the bed slope is also investigated the results furnish useful indication for the evaluation of the peak force in different conditions the article is organized as follows in section 2 both the investigated problem and the governing equations are briefly described while section 3 reports the adopted numerical scheme and the performed tests in section 3 the results are presented and discussed the conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 problem description and governing equations this study analyses the impact against a rigid wall of a mud flow running over a steep slope adopting the simple and idealized geometrical setting sketched in fig 1 a mass of mud represented as an incompressible homogeneous shear thinning power law fluid is instantaneously released and flows along a slope inclined of angle θ with respect the horizontal plane in the initial configuration the mud mass occupies a triangular wedge with the depth h described by the following function h x 0 h o x t a n θ l u x 0 0 x 0 with x the streamwise coordinate along the plane t the time and h x t the flow depth the abscissa x 0 corresponds to the downstream side of the triangle l u h o c o t θ is the length of the wedge for the given slope angle a rigid wall perpendicular to the bottom is encountered downstream at distance l d from the triangle side considering a gradually varied flow where spatial variations occur over scales larger than flow depth a depth averaged scheme is adopted flow resistance by the sidewalls is neglected with respect to that by the bottom considering the analogy with open channel clear water flows this simplification may be assumed whenever the width of the flow exceeds the depth by ten times or more chow 2009 additionally the surface tension is ignored and the mud rheology is decribed by the power law model the resulting flow model is represented by the following dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations di

index is smaller than one for shear thinning fluids while values larger than one pertains to shear thickening ones in the following only shear thinning fluids are considered it is expected that the flow dynamics and the resulting impact force both depend on the geometry of the considered case i e the inclination angle θ the initial depth at the downstream side h o and the wall distance l d as well as on the rheological properties of the fluid namely the density ρ the consistency μ n and the rheological index n the problem is made dimensionless using l r h o and t r h o g as length and time

force against the wall depends on the considered geometry characterized by the inclination angle θ and the wall distance l d 3 numerical method and performed tests 3 1 numerical method the non linear hyperbolic system 5 6 has been numerically solved with a finite volume scheme which is second order accurate in space and total variation diminishing tvd and first order accurate in time in what follows the numerical scheme is briefly described denoting the vector of the unknowns with w h q t the governing eqs 5 and 6 are rewritten in following compact form 11 w t f w x s w in which the expressions of flux and source vectors f and s directly follow from 5 and 6 indicating with w the average value of w in the finite volume of dimension δ x with f the numerical approximation of the flux f at the interface between two volumes and s the volume averaged value of the source term the semi discretized version of eq 11 is 12 w t 1 δ x f i 1 2 f i 1 2 s following the harten lax van leer hll scheme harten et al 1983 and denoting with w l resp w r the w values on the left resp right side of the interface the following expression of numerical approximation of the flux has been

2 h 2 h c o s θ to guarantee the second order spatial accuracy of the scheme a piecewise linear reconstruction at the interfaces is performed to evaluate w l and w r moreover the non linear minmod limiter leveque 2011 has been applied to preserve the solution monotonicity finally the time discretization has been carried out through the first order euler method the solid wall boundary condition at the end of the channel has been implemented through the ghost cells technique leveque 2011 the above numerical method possesses the typical simplicity robustness and built in conservation properties of the riemann solvers which has led to many successful applications in shallow flow simulations involving highly discontinuous flows transcritical flows shock waves and moving wet dry fronts among the approximate riemann solvers the adopted hll scheme is often preferred in one dimensional simulations since it does not require an iterative scheme it is positive definite and generally computationally more efficient than other schemes additional details about the numerical scheme and the boundary conditions may be found in campomaggiore et al 2016 and iervolino et al 2017 3 2 validation of the numerical model reproducing an experimental dam break test to demonstrate the capabilities of the considered flow model to simulate shallow flows of shear thinning fluids one of the dam break experiments carried out by balmforth et al 2007 has been reproduced the experiment consists in the sudden release of a slump 2 2 cm height of aqueous suspension of xanthan gum with concentration order of 1 in a 0 1 m wide 0 6 m deep channel the rheology of the considered shear thinning fluid may be reasonably described by n 0 27 μ n 6 p a s n ρ 1000 k g m 3 the fluid is kept at rest by a dam at x 0 4 m which is rapidly lifted at t 0 s the experiment has been simulated by considering δ x 0 005 and δ t 0 004 fig 2 compares the experimental measurements and the numerical reproduction of the downstream front position of the wave denoted as x f the comparison shows that the computational model is able to reasonably reproduce the experimental results both in the near field t 0 2 1 s where inertia plays a prominent role and in the long term one t 100 s in which the fluid spreading is largely dominated by the bottom shear stress for t 0 2 s the agreement is less satisfactory but as noted by saramito et al 2013 this short term regime could be affected by the dam lifting more than by the flow inertia 3 3 performed tests of dam break wave with impact the numerical simulations of dam break waves with impact fig 1 have been carried out adopting spatial discretization step δ x 0 038 and a temporal time step δ t 0 001 sensitivity to the discretization has been checked by halving the δ x and δ t under constant cfl obtaining differences on the estimated peak force smaller than 1 the performed tests investigate the influence on the dynamics and on the peak value of the impact force f for unit width due to the basal drag coefficient b d to the power law exponent n and to the wall distance l d for two values of the inclination angles namely θ 10 l u 5 67 and θ 20 l u 2 75 with the aim of representing fluids with shear thinning attitude the power law exponent has been varied between 0 2 and 0 9 under these conditions basal drag coefficient values of typical mud and lava flows range between 10 3 and 10 1 while the lower values of the above range of the basal drag coefficient may be encountered in both mud and lava flows the higher ones may represent typical lava flows this is exemplified in table 1 where the basal drag coefficient values for one mud and two different lava flows are reported the considered mud case 1 is characterized by the following rheological parameters n 0 14 ρ 1440 k g m 3 μ n 104 1 p a s n zhang et al 2010 the other cases represent lava fluids with following rheology case 2 has n 0 763 ρ 2780 k g m 3 μ n 51 88 p a s n weed et al 1986 case 3 is characterized by n 0 9 ρ 2650 k g m 3 μ n 1000 p a s n filippucci et al 2010 for these three fluids table 1 reports the bd values assuming an initial flow depth h o 1 8 m and the critical basal drag values b d c eq 10 required to guarantee the occurrence of laminar condition results shown in table 1 confirm that the flow can be safely considered laminar in all the herein studied cases independently on the initial conditions and the governing parameters the flow asymptotically in time approaches a quiescent condition with horizontal free surface in this condition the impact force for unit width assumes the hydrostatic dimensionless value f as 1 2 which is used in what follows to normalize the instantaneous values of the impact force f f f as 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact dynamics to assess the role of the basal drag coefficient b d in the impact dynamics fig 3 compares the time evolution of the normalised impact force f for two different b d values namely b d 10 3 and b d 10 2 for a fluid with n 0 5 and for a wall distance l d 15 the comparison is provided for θ 20 in fig 3a and for θ 10 in fig 3b regardless of b d and slope values the force rapidly increases after the impact for a given slope the wave impact against the rigid wall occurs earlier for the smaller value of b d soon after the front of the wave touches the obstacle f reaches a peak fig 3a shows that at the lowest b d value f significantly grows over the asymptotic value while in the b d 10 2 case the f as value is never overcome but only asymptotically reached moreover for b d 10 3 the peak is followed by a damped oscillatory trend while in the b d 10 2 case f decreases after the peak and then it monotonically approaches the asymptotic value such a strong dependence of the force behaviour on the b d coefficient essentially reflects the relative importance of the inertial and gravitational forces along with the pressure gradient induced by the free surface with respect to bottom resistance indeed a smaller basal drag coefficient value corresponds to a reduced relevance of the bottom resistance i e the second term at the r h s of eq 6 this induces smaller momentum losses at the bottom and therefore higher values of the front velocity v f and consequently of the peak force for the θ 10 case fig 3b shows a similar temporal evolution of the force thus confirming the strong dependence of the front propagation velocity and of the peak force on the basal drag coefficient both front velocity propagation and peak force values in the θ 10 case are smaller than the corresponding ones in the θ 20 case the dependence of the impact force upon the power law exponent can be inferred through the results presented in fig 4 for fixed values of both basal drag coefficient b d 10 2 and the wall distance l d 15 fig 4a and b report the time history of the normalized impact force f for two different n values namely n 0 2 and n 0 9 for the slope angles θ 20 and θ 10 respectively independently of the θ value the reduction of the power law exponent n induces an increase of the front velocity propagation i e a reduction of wave impact time and an increase of the force peak value the observed influence of the rheological index on the impact force behaviour fig 4 can be explained considering that the power law exponent plays a twofold role in the momentum conservation equation eq 6 indeed the power law exponent influences both the bottom resistance i e the second term at the r h s of eq 6 and the convective inertia i e the second term at the l h s of eq 6 through the momentum correction factor β n eq 3 since the front velocity v f decreases with the bottom resistance and increases with the convective inertia hogg and pritchard 2004 have shown that v f can either increase with n since the bottom resistance decreases with n or decrease since the convective inertia decreases for increasing n then for sufficiently small b d values the effect of the convective inertia prevails over the one due to the bottom resistance present results for b d 10 2 agree with this theoretical interpretation showing a reduction of the front propagation velocity with n however it is expected that higher b d values could correspond to an opposite dependence of the front velocity with respect to the rheological exponent n fig 5 reports the time evolution of the normalised impact force f for b d 0 05 and three n values for a wall distance l d equals to 15 in this case the increase of the basal drag coefficient is sufficient to revert the dependence of v f and therefore of force f on n as a result the impact time is in this condition a decreasing function of the power law exponent witnessing that the effect of the bottom resistance prevails over the convective inertia fig 6 investigates the dependence of the impact force on the wall distance l d considering b d 10 2 and n 0 5 fig 6a and b report the time history of the normalized impact force f for l d 5 and l d 20 and considering again the two values of the slope for the tests θ 20 and θ 10 independently of the θ value fig 6 indicates that an increase of the wall distance reduces the maximum value of the impact force such a result is consistent with the increase of the momentum loss due to the bottom resistance forces with the distance travelled by the wave before the impact as a result depending on the wall distance the peak force may overwhelm or not the asymptotic hydrostatic value to further analyse the dependence of the impact force f from the wall distance fig 7 depicts the behaviour of the maximum force f peak as a function of l d for three different n values b d 10 3 and θ 20 regardless the n value fig 7 reveals a non monotone behaviour of the peak force f peak with l d since f peak first increases reaches a maximum and then decreases with l d this behaviour can be interpreted in the following way while the gravity acts as a driving force increasing the momentum of the flow at the impact a short wall distance may not be sufficient to allow the resistance forces to produce an appreciable momentum loss as the distance travelled by the wave increases this trend reverts since the resistance prevails on the gravity and the peak force reduces with l d for sufficiently large l d values the resisting effect is so neat that the f peak reduces to 1 implying that the peak force is attained in the asymptotic hydrostatic condition 4 2 evaluation of the peak force previous results taken collectively indicate that for a fixed value of the channel slope θ the wave dynamics strongly depends on the b d n l d triplet consequently the peak of the force against the obstacle may overwhelm the asymptotic value i e f peak 1 or not in particular figs 4 and 7 suggests that for a fixed slope a given pair b d n for wall distance longer than a minimum value l d m i n the condition f peak 1 is verified for example from fig 7 for n 0 5 the minimum distance above which f peak 1 is 80 such a limiting value has been evaluated based on the results of numerous numerical simulations for four values of the basal drag coefficient i e b d 10 3 2 5 10 3 5 0 10 3 10 2 and for values of the power law exponent in the range 0 2 n 0 9 the results are summarized in fig 8 for θ 20 fig 8a and θ 10 fig 8b indeed for a fixed value of b d in the portion of the n l d plane bounded on the left by the corresponding curve the peak value of the force against the obstacle coincides with the asymptotic value i e f peak 1 with reference to the largest considered slope value θ 20 fig 8a shows that keeping fixed the basal drag coefficient an increase of the power law exponent n leads to smaller values of l d m i n similar conclusions are drawn keeping fixed n and increasing b d both results are consistent with the reduction of the front velocity due to an increase either of b d for a fixed value of n see fig 3a or of n for a fixed value of b d see fig 4a this trend is confirmed also in the θ 10 case fig 8b for a fixed value of the b d n pair the l d m i n value in the θ 10 case is smaller than in the θ 20 one fig 8 furnishes the lower bound of the wall distance l d m i n above which the force peak does not exceed its asymptotic value therefore if only the maximum value of force against the obstacle is of interest the asymptotic value f as 1 2 represents a safe assumption provided that the dimensionless wall distance exceeds l d m i n coherently with the results of fig 5 fig 8 shows that for a sufficiently high basal drag coefficient i e b d 10 2 the asymptotic value may be safely assumed independently of the wall distance on the other hand whenever the basal drag coefficient is smaller than 10 2 and the wall distance is smaller than l d m i n the peak force exceeds the asymptotic value and a detailed numerical simulation is required for its evaluation to provide a comprehensive picture of the behaviour of the peak force value in these conditions figs 9 and 10 report for l d l d min the isolines of f peak in the ld n plane for θ 20 and θ 10 respectively and considering four different basal drag values i e b d 10 3 2 5 10 3 5 0 10 3 for a fixed value of f peak f peak i e for a given curve reported in figs 9 and 10 the b d n pairs inside the region bounded on the right and or on the top by the curve exhibit f peak f peak for practical applications figs 9 and 10 allow to quickly estimate for different fluids the amount by which the peak force exceeds the asymptotic value as function of the wall distance the most demanding condition in the perspective of wall design occurs for b d 10 3 for which fig 10a shows that f peak varies in the range 1 0 2 5 in a specific set of conditions i e for fluid characterized by small value of the power law exponent n 0 3 and for wall distance smaller than the values represented by the 2 0 curve the peak force exceeds twice the asymptotic hydrostatic value to pinpoint these most critical conditions for fluids with different rheological properties table 2 reports the maximum peak impact force for a given fluid rheology f max max l d f peak and the corresponding wall distance l d m a x the maximum value of the peak force strongly reduces with the basal drag coefficient for example for n 0 2 and b d 10 3 the maximum peak force equals 2 45 whereas this value reduces to 2 11 1 73 and 1 40 for b d 2 5 10 3 b d 5 10 3 and b d 10 2 respectively fig 10 shows that the above described behaviour does not change for the milder considered slope θ 10 although the force peak values are smaller than in the previous case for example even for b d 10 3 fig 10a indicates that for n 0 3 the peak value does not double the asymptotic value table 3 is the counterpart of table 2 for the θ 10 case the maximum peak force f max equals 2 17 for n 0 2 and b d 10 3 this extreme value reduces increasing n and b d values consistently with the results shown by figs 3b and 4b the contour plots of figs 9a b 10a and b show that for certain values of n increasing l d the peak force firstly grows then reaches a maximum and finally decreases this behaviour is coherent with the results shown in fig 7 due to the combined effect of the flow acceleration and momentum losses in conclusion the presented results suggest that the fluid rheology has a strong influence on the dynamic of the impact as indicated by the different behaviour of the temporal evolution of the force observed for value of the basal drag smaller or larger than 10 2 moreover in the condition b d 10 2 the asymptotic hydrostatic value may be exceeded depending on the rheological index value and the wall distance in particular the rheological index strongly influences the peak force which grows as n decreases as far as the wall distance is concerned it is possible to individuate a limit value above which the maximum impact force corresponds to the final hydrostatic condition whenever the sidewalls flow resistance cannot be neglected with respect to the bottom one it may be conjectured that the application of present results would lead to a conservative estimation in terms of f peak and therefore in terms of l d m i n 5 conclusions the present paper investigates the impact force against a rigid wall due to dam break wave of a shear thinning power law fluid a one dimensional shallow water model is used and a second order finite volume scheme is employed to numerically solve the governing equations several numerical tests have been performed to investigate the influence on the dynamics and on the peak value of the impact force of the rheological characters of the fluids and of the problem geometry in the performed tests the model parameters basal drag coefficient b d and power law exponent n have been varied in realistic ranges for mud and lava flows and several dimensionless wall distance l d have been considered for two values of the inclination angles namely θ 10 and θ 20 the results show that for fixed values of the channel slope θ the b d n l d values strongly influence the wave dynamics and two different behaviours of the temporal evolution have been found indeed or the force sharply increases and the peak value overwhelms the final hydrostatic value or the force grows smoothly in time asymptotically approaching the hydrostatic value for a fixed value of the power law exponent the latter behaviour occurs whenever the basal drag coefficient is sufficiently high and in these cases the asymptotic value may be safely assumed to evaluate the peak force conversely for small basal drag the peak force may overwhelm the asymptotic value or not depending on l d values indeed there exists a minimum value of the wall distance l d m i n above which the peak force does not exceed its asymptotic hydrostatic value i e f peak 1 the minimum value of the wall distance l d m i n has been found to strongly increase when the power law exponent is reduced for two different values of the channel slope the dimensionless value of this lower bound l d m i n is individuated considering several values of the dimensionless governing parameters b d n moreover for l d l d min an evaluation of the maximum value of the peak forces is also provided the results of this work represent a novel contribution on the evaluation of the force produced by a mud lava flow wave on a rigid obstacle furnishing a theoretical interpretation of the impact dynamics and useful applicative indications on the estimation of the peak value

conditions usually triggered by either short heavy rainfalls or long periods of rain these flows are often distinguished based on the quantity and the characteristics of the solid fraction takahashi 2018 and generally mud flows correspond to highly concentrated mixtures of water and fine sediments in which volumetric solid concentration varies from 6 to 60 ng and mei 1994 o brien 2003 widjaja and hsien heng lee 2013 along with debris and mud flows lava flows characterized by a mass of volcanic material flowing over natural slopes due to the gravity may also be regarded as dangerous and sudden events harris 2015 debris mud and lava flows can also be related to quite high hazard due to the impossibility to predict the triggering event well in advance and the possible presence of civil structures along the path of propagation iverson 2003 jenkins et al 2017 thus the modelling of propagation of such flows and their interaction with structures is particularly relevant for risk management it is of utmost importance to evaluate the forces acting on buildings and on structure in order to design different kinds of countermeasures such as protective flexible and rigid barriers mizuyama 2008 ng et al 2017 scifoni et al 2010 both experiments and numerical simulations have been widely used for evaluating the impact dynamics of debris mud lava flows against rigid walls considering dry granular and debris flows many experimental research addressed the impact through field e g hu et al 2011 marchi et al 2002 and laboratory e g armanini and scotton 1993 cui et al 2015 investigations small scale laboratory experiments choi et al 2015 ng et al 2021 scheidl et al 2013 permitted the systematic study of the complex flow structure interaction under controlled conditions these investigations allowed to define the peak value of the impact force and different simplified theoretical continuum based approaches have been used to deduce semi empirical formulas e g armanini 2009 armanini and scotton 1993 bugnion et al 2012 vagnon and segalini 2016 based on different consideration and hypothesis the impact of a mud flow against an obstacle has been experimentally analyzed by tiberghien et al 2007 the fluid was a carbopol solution with yield stress and the dynamics of the impact has been deeply analyzed through the measure of the local velocities and of the pressure distribution on the obstacle besides experimental investigations numerical simulations based on appropriate flow models are nowadays commonly used to analyze the interaction of sediment laden flows with obstacles for simulating debris mud flows both two phase and one phase models have been employed ancey 2007 coussot 2017a the former approach accounting for the mass and momentum equations for both the solid and fluid components can independently reproduce the solid and fluid phase velocities e g di cristo et al 2016 greco et al 2012 pudasaini 2012 and has also been used to simulate the

in balmforth et al 2014 and coussot 2017b power law rheological models are adequate to describe slurry matrices remaining essentially liquefied through the flow iverson 2014 and they therefore may be used to reproduce the behavior of landslides carotenuto et al 2015 and flows of natural estuarine muds bai and tian 2011 zhang et al 2010 simple one phase models despite the complexity due to degassing and cooling processes can be usefully applied also to lava flows even if in some cases high temperature and few gas the lava can be efficiently modelled as either a newtonian e g takagi and huppert 2010 tallarico and dragoni 1999 or homogeneous non newtonian fluid for example a bingham rheology castruccio et al 2013 kelfoun and vargas 2016 can be adopted in the presence of bubbles and or crystals and depending on the amount of degassing that has occurred both herschel bulkley and power law model tallarico et al 2011 balmforth and craster 2000 conroy and lev 2021 filippucci et al 2010 soule and cashman 2005 may be used to describe the fluid behaviour for these reasons the one phase model has been extensively used to investigate the interaction of both debris mud ionescu 2013 rickenmann et al 2006 and lava chirico et al 2009 fujita et al 2009 scifoni et al 2010 waves with obstacles however to estimate the pressure force caused by the impact of a wave against obstacles one phase models with yield stress have been mainly considered laigle et al 2007 tang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 zanuttigh and lamberti 2006 than the power law model the impact of a yield less mud wave against obstacles has been numerically studied by iervolino et al 2017 and greco et al 2019 both studies considered specific values of the rheological parameters i e consistency μ n and power law exponent n in order to represent the rheology of the catastrophic landslides occurred in 1999 in cervinara italy carotenuto et al 2015 among the different proposals the choice of the most suitable way to predict the impact force and in particular its peak value caused by a shear thinning flow representative of a mud or a lava wave is still an open question the present paper numerically analyzes the impact of a wave of shear thinning power law fluids against a rigid wall systematically varying both the rheological parameters and flow conditions inspired by the fair accuracy of the depth integrated schematization fent et al 2018 in the estimation of the impact forces on rigid structures due to water aureli et al 2015 hien and van chien 2021 and debris sarno et al 2013 zanuttigh and lamberti 2006 waves the shallow water model proposed by ng and mei 1994 valid when the length scale normal to the bottom is very small compared to longitudinal and transverse ones has been herein considered in details this study analyzes the temporal history of the force to evaluate its dependence on the values of the rheological parameters of the fluid consistency density and rheological index and on the distance from the wall the effect of the bed slope is also investigated the results furnish useful indication for the evaluation of the peak force in different conditions the article is organized as follows in section 2 both the investigated problem and the governing equations are briefly described while section 3 reports the adopted numerical scheme and the performed tests in section 3 the results are presented and discussed the conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 problem description and governing equations this study analyses the impact against a rigid wall of a mud flow running over a steep slope adopting the simple and idealized geometrical setting sketched in fig 1 a mass of mud represented as an incompressible homogeneous shear thinning power law fluid is instantaneously released and flows along a slope inclined of angle θ with respect the horizontal plane in the initial configuration the mud mass occupies a triangular wedge with the depth h described by the following function h x 0 h o x t a n θ l u x 0 0 x 0 with x the streamwise coordinate along the plane t the time and h x t the flow depth the abscissa x 0 corresponds to the downstream side of the triangle l u h o c o t θ is the length of the wedge for the given slope angle a rigid wall perpendicular to the bottom is encountered downstream at distance l d from the triangle side considering a gradually varied flow where spatial variations occur over scales larger than flow depth a depth averaged scheme is adopted flow resistance by the sidewalls is neglected with respect to that by the bottom considering the analogy with open channel clear water flows this simplification may be assumed whenever the width of the flow exceeds the depth by ten times or more chow 2009 additionally the surface tension is ignored and the mud rheology is decribed by the power law model the resulting flow model is represented by the following dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations di cristo et al 2014 ng and mei 1994 1 h t q x 0 2 q t β n x q 2 h g c o s θ x h 2 2 g h s i n θ τ b ρ where q is the flow rate for unit of width g and ρ the gravity and the fluid density respectively β

index is smaller than one for shear thinning fluids while values larger than one pertains to shear thickening ones in the following only shear thinning fluids are considered it is expected that the flow dynamics and the resulting impact force both depend on the geometry of the considered case i e the inclination angle θ the initial depth at the downstream side h o and the wall distance l d as well as on the rheological properties of the fluid namely the density ρ the consistency μ n and the rheological index n the problem is made dimensionless using l r h o and t r h o g as length and time

force against the wall depends on the considered geometry characterized by the inclination angle θ and the wall distance l d 3 numerical method and performed tests 3 1 numerical method the non linear hyperbolic system 5 6 has been numerically solved with a finite volume scheme which is second order accurate in space and total variation diminishing tvd and first order accurate in time in what follows the numerical scheme is briefly described denoting the vector of the unknowns with w h q t the governing eqs 5 and 6 are rewritten in following compact form 11 w t f w x s w in which the expressions of flux and source vectors f and s directly follow from 5 and 6 indicating with w the average value of w in the finite volume of dimension δ x with f the numerical approximation of the flux f at the interface between two volumes and s the volume averaged value of the source term the semi discretized version of eq 11 is 12 w t 1 δ x f i 1 2 f i 1 2 s following the harten lax van leer hll scheme harten et al 1983 and denoting with w l resp w r the w values on the left resp right side of the interface the following expression of numerical approximation of the flux has been

2 h 2 h c o s θ to guarantee the second order spatial accuracy of the scheme a piecewise linear reconstruction at the interfaces is performed to evaluate w l and w r moreover the non linear minmod limiter leveque 2011 has been applied to preserve the solution monotonicity finally the time discretization has been carried out through the first order euler method the solid wall boundary condition at the end of the channel has been implemented through the ghost cells technique leveque 2011 the above numerical method possesses the typical simplicity robustness and built in conservation properties of the riemann solvers which has led to many successful applications in shallow flow simulations involving highly discontinuous flows transcritical flows shock waves and moving wet dry fronts among the approximate riemann solvers the adopted hll scheme is often preferred in one dimensional simulations since it does not require an iterative scheme it is positive definite and generally computationally more efficient than other schemes additional details about the numerical scheme and the boundary conditions may be found in campomaggiore et al 2016 and iervolino et al 2017 3 2 validation of the numerical model reproducing an experimental dam break test to demonstrate the capabilities of the considered flow model to simulate shallow flows of shear thinning fluids one of the dam break experiments carried out by balmforth et al 2007 has been reproduced the experiment consists in the sudden release of a slump 2 2 cm height of aqueous suspension of xanthan gum with concentration order of 1 in a 0 1 m wide 0 6 m deep channel the rheology of the considered shear thinning fluid may be reasonably described by n 0 27 μ n 6 p a s n ρ 1000 k g m 3 the fluid is kept at rest by a dam at x 0 4 m which is rapidly lifted at t 0 s the experiment has been simulated by considering δ x 0 005 and δ t 0 004 fig 2 compares the experimental measurements and the numerical reproduction of the downstream front position of the wave denoted as x f the comparison shows that the computational model is able to reasonably reproduce the experimental results both in the near field t 0 2 1 s where inertia plays a prominent role and in the long term one t 100 s in which the fluid spreading is largely dominated by the bottom shear stress for t 0 2 s the agreement is less satisfactory but as noted by saramito et al 2013 this short term regime could be affected by the dam lifting more than by the flow inertia 3 3 performed tests of dam break wave with impact the numerical simulations of dam break waves with impact fig 1 have been carried out adopting spatial discretization step δ x 0 038 and a temporal time step δ t 0 001 sensitivity to the discretization has been checked by halving the δ x and δ t under constant cfl obtaining differences on the estimated peak force smaller than 1 the performed tests investigate the influence on the dynamics and on the peak value of the impact force f for unit width due to the basal drag coefficient b d to the power law exponent n and to the wall distance l d for two values of the inclination angles namely θ 10 l u 5 67 and θ 20 l u 2 75 with the aim of representing fluids with shear thinning attitude the power law exponent has been varied between 0 2 and 0 9 under these conditions basal drag coefficient values of typical mud and lava flows range between 10 3 and 10 1 while the lower values of the above range of the basal drag coefficient may be encountered in both mud and lava flows the higher ones may represent typical lava flows this is exemplified in table 1 where the basal drag coefficient values for one mud and two different lava flows are reported the considered mud case 1 is characterized by the following rheological parameters n 0 14 ρ 1440 k g m 3 μ n 104 1 p a s n zhang et al 2010 the other cases represent lava fluids with following rheology case 2 has n 0 763 ρ 2780 k g m 3 μ n 51 88 p a s n weed et al 1986 case 3 is characterized by n 0 9 ρ 2650 k g m 3 μ n 1000 p a s n filippucci et al 2010 for these three fluids table 1 reports the bd values assuming an initial flow depth h o 1 8 m and the critical basal drag values b d c eq 10 required to guarantee the occurrence of laminar condition results shown in table 1 confirm that the flow can be safely considered laminar in all the herein studied cases independently on the initial conditions and the governing parameters the flow asymptotically in time approaches a quiescent condition with horizontal free surface in this condition the impact force for unit width assumes the hydrostatic dimensionless value f as 1 2 which is used in what follows to normalize the instantaneous values of the impact force f f f as 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact dynamics to assess the role of the basal drag coefficient b d in the impact dynamics fig 3 compares the time evolution of the normalised impact force f for two different b d values namely b d 10 3 and b d 10 2 for a fluid with n 0 5 and for a wall distance l d 15 the comparison is provided for θ 20 in fig 3a and for θ 10 in fig 3b regardless of b d and slope values the force rapidly increases after the impact for a given slope the wave impact against the rigid wall occurs earlier for the smaller value of b d soon after the front of the wave touches the obstacle f reaches a peak fig 3a shows that at the lowest b d value f significantly grows over the asymptotic value while in the b d 10 2 case the f as value is never overcome but only asymptotically reached moreover for b d 10 3 the peak is followed by a damped oscillatory trend while in the b d 10 2 case f decreases after the peak and then it monotonically approaches the asymptotic value such a strong dependence of the force behaviour on the b d coefficient essentially reflects the relative importance of the inertial and gravitational forces along with the pressure gradient induced by the free surface with respect to bottom resistance indeed a smaller basal drag coefficient value corresponds to a reduced relevance of the bottom resistance i e the second term at the r h s of eq 6 this induces smaller momentum losses at the bottom and therefore higher values of the front velocity v f and consequently of the peak force for the θ 10 case fig 3b shows a similar temporal evolution of the force thus confirming the strong dependence of the front propagation velocity and of the peak force on the basal drag coefficient both front velocity propagation and peak force values in the θ 10 case are smaller than the corresponding ones in the θ 20 case the dependence of the impact force upon the power law exponent can be inferred through the results presented in fig 4 for fixed values of both basal drag coefficient b d 10 2 and the wall distance l d 15 fig 4a and b report the time history of the normalized impact force f for two different n values namely n 0 2 and n 0 9 for the slope angles θ 20 and θ 10 respectively independently of the θ value the reduction of the power law exponent n induces an increase of the front velocity propagation i e a reduction of wave impact time and an increase of the force peak value the observed influence of the rheological index on the impact force behaviour fig 4 can be explained considering that the power law exponent plays a twofold role in the momentum conservation equation eq 6 indeed the power law exponent influences both the bottom resistance i e the second term at the r h s of eq 6 and the convective inertia i e the second term at the l h s of eq 6 through the momentum correction factor β n eq 3 since the front velocity v f decreases with the bottom resistance and increases with the convective inertia hogg and pritchard 2004 have shown that v f can either increase with n since the bottom resistance decreases with n or decrease since the convective inertia decreases for increasing n then for sufficiently small b d values the effect of the convective inertia prevails over the one due to the bottom resistance present results for b d 10 2 agree with this theoretical interpretation showing a reduction of the front propagation velocity with n however it is expected that higher b d values could correspond to an opposite dependence of the front velocity with respect to the rheological exponent n fig 5 reports the time evolution of the normalised impact force f for b d 0 05 and three n values for a wall distance l d equals to 15 in this case the increase of the basal drag coefficient is sufficient to revert the dependence of v f and therefore of force f on n as a result the impact time is in this condition a decreasing function of the power law exponent witnessing that the effect of the bottom resistance prevails over the convective inertia fig 6 investigates the dependence of the impact force on the wall distance l d considering b d 10 2 and n 0 5 fig 6a and b report the time history of the normalized impact force f for l d 5 and l d 20 and considering again the two values of the slope for the tests θ 20 and θ 10 independently of the θ value fig 6 indicates that an increase of the wall distance reduces the maximum value of the impact force such a result is consistent with the increase of the momentum loss due to the bottom resistance forces with the distance travelled by the wave before the impact as a result depending on the wall distance the peak force may overwhelm or not the asymptotic hydrostatic value to further analyse the dependence of the impact force f from the wall distance fig 7 depicts the behaviour of the maximum force f peak as a function of l d for three different n values b d 10 3 and θ 20 regardless the n value fig 7 reveals a non monotone behaviour of the peak force f peak with l d since f peak first increases reaches a maximum and then decreases with l d this behaviour can be interpreted in the following way while the gravity acts as a driving force increasing the momentum of the flow at the impact a short wall distance may not be sufficient to allow the resistance forces to produce an appreciable momentum loss as the distance travelled by the wave increases this trend reverts since the resistance prevails on the gravity and the peak force reduces with l d for sufficiently large l d values the resisting effect is so neat that the f peak reduces to 1 implying that the peak force is attained in the asymptotic hydrostatic condition 4 2 evaluation of the peak force previous results taken collectively indicate that for a fixed value of the channel slope θ the wave dynamics strongly depends on the b d n l d triplet consequently the peak of the force against the obstacle may overwhelm the asymptotic value i e f peak 1 or not in particular figs 4 and 7 suggests that for a fixed slope a given pair b d n for wall distance longer than a minimum value l d m i n the condition f peak 1 is verified for example from fig 7 for n 0 5 the minimum distance above which f peak 1 is 80 such a limiting value has been evaluated based on the results of numerous numerical simulations for four values of the basal drag coefficient i e b d 10 3 2 5 10 3 5 0 10 3 10 2 and for values of the power law exponent in the range 0 2 n 0 9 the results are summarized in fig 8 for θ 20 fig 8a and θ 10 fig 8b indeed for a fixed value of b d in the portion of the n l d plane bounded on the left by the corresponding curve the peak value of the force against the obstacle coincides with the asymptotic value i e f peak 1 with reference to the largest considered slope value θ 20 fig 8a shows that keeping fixed the basal drag coefficient an increase of the power law exponent n leads to smaller values of l d m i n similar conclusions are drawn keeping fixed n and increasing b d both results are consistent with the reduction of the front velocity due to an increase either of b d for a fixed value of n see fig 3a or of n for a fixed value of b d see fig 4a this trend is confirmed also in the θ 10 case fig 8b for a fixed value of the b d n pair the l d m i n value in the θ 10 case is smaller than in the θ 20 one fig 8 furnishes the lower bound of the wall distance l d m i n above which the force peak does not exceed its asymptotic value therefore if only the maximum value of force against the obstacle is of interest the asymptotic value f as 1 2 represents a safe assumption provided that the dimensionless wall distance exceeds l d m i n coherently with the results of fig 5 fig 8 shows that for a sufficiently high basal drag coefficient i e b d 10 2 the asymptotic value may be safely assumed independently of the wall distance on the other hand whenever the basal drag coefficient is smaller than 10 2 and the wall distance is smaller than l d m i n the peak force exceeds the asymptotic value and a detailed numerical simulation is required for its evaluation to provide a comprehensive picture of the behaviour of the peak force value in these conditions figs 9 and 10 report for l d l d min the isolines of f peak in the ld n plane for θ 20 and θ 10 respectively and considering four different basal drag values i e b d 10 3 2 5 10 3 5 0 10 3 for a fixed value of f peak f peak i e for a given curve reported in figs 9 and 10 the b d n pairs inside the region bounded on the right and or on the top by the curve exhibit f peak f peak for practical applications figs 9 and 10 allow to quickly estimate for different fluids the amount by which the peak force exceeds the asymptotic value as function of the wall distance the most demanding condition in the perspective of wall design occurs for b d 10 3 for which fig 10a shows that f peak varies in the range 1 0 2 5 in a specific set of conditions i e for fluid characterized by small value of the power law exponent n 0 3 and for wall distance smaller than the values represented by the 2 0 curve the peak force exceeds twice the asymptotic hydrostatic value to pinpoint these most critical conditions for fluids with different rheological properties table 2 reports the maximum peak impact force for a given fluid rheology f max max l d f peak and the corresponding wall distance l d m a x the maximum value of the peak force strongly reduces with the basal drag coefficient for example for n 0 2 and b d 10 3 the maximum peak force equals 2 45 whereas this value reduces to 2 11 1 73 and 1 40 for b d 2 5 10 3 b d 5 10 3 and b d 10 2 respectively fig 10 shows that the above described behaviour does not change for the milder considered slope θ 10 although the force peak values are smaller than in the previous case for example even for b d 10 3 fig 10a indicates that for n 0 3 the peak value does not double the asymptotic value table 3 is the counterpart of table 2 for the θ 10 case the maximum peak force f max equals 2 17 for n 0 2 and b d 10 3 this extreme value reduces increasing n and b d values consistently with the results shown by figs 3b and 4b the contour plots of figs 9a b 10a and b show that for certain values of n increasing l d the peak force firstly grows then reaches a maximum and finally decreases this behaviour is coherent with the results shown in fig 7 due to the combined effect of the flow acceleration and momentum losses in conclusion the presented results suggest that the fluid rheology has a strong influence on the dynamic of the impact as indicated by the different behaviour of the temporal evolution of the force observed for value of the basal drag smaller or larger than 10 2 moreover in the condition b d 10 2 the asymptotic hydrostatic value may be exceeded depending on the rheological index value and the wall distance in particular the rheological index strongly influences the peak force which grows as n decreases as far as the wall distance is concerned it is possible to individuate a limit value above which the maximum impact force corresponds to the final hydrostatic condition whenever the sidewalls flow resistance cannot be neglected with respect to the bottom one it may be conjectured that the application of present results would lead to a conservative estimation in terms of f peak and therefore in terms of l d m i n 5 conclusions the present paper investigates the impact force against a rigid wall due to dam break wave of a shear thinning power law fluid a one dimensional shallow water model is used and a second order finite volume scheme is employed to numerically solve the governing equations several numerical tests have been performed to investigate the influence on the dynamics and on the peak value of the impact force of the rheological characters of the fluids and of the problem geometry in the performed tests the model parameters basal drag coefficient b d and power law exponent n have been varied in realistic ranges for mud and lava flows and several dimensionless wall distance l d have been considered for two values of the inclination angles namely θ 10 and θ 20 the results show that for fixed values of the channel slope θ the b d n l d values strongly influence the wave dynamics and two different behaviours of the temporal evolution have been found indeed or the force sharply increases and the peak value overwhelms the final hydrostatic value or the force grows smoothly in time asymptotically approaching the hydrostatic value for a fixed value of the power law exponent the latter behaviour occurs whenever the basal drag coefficient is sufficiently high and in these cases the asymptotic value may be safely assumed to evaluate the peak force conversely for small basal drag the peak force may overwhelm the asymptotic value or not depending on l d values indeed there exists a minimum value of the wall distance l d m i n above which the peak force does not exceed its asymptotic hydrostatic value i e f peak 1 the minimum value of the wall distance l d m i n has been found to strongly increase when the power law exponent is reduced for two different values of the channel slope the dimensionless value of this lower bound l d m i n is individuated considering several values of the dimensionless governing parameters b d n moreover for l d l d min an evaluation of the maximum value of the peak forces is also provided the results of this work represent a novel contribution on the evaluation of the force produced by a mud lava flow wave on a rigid obstacle furnishing a theoretical interpretation of the impact dynamics and useful applicative indications on the estimation of the peak value

3139,in practical engineering slopes are in rainfall evaporation environments over long periods considering the dry wet cycles effect on unsaturated loess slope instability is of great significance in this paper a soil water characteristic curve test of unsaturated loess is carried out combined with the prediction model the curve between the volumetric water content and unsaturated permeability coefficient is obtained and the obtained curve is used as the material assignment condition for slope stability analysis the results show that dry wet cycles affect slope stability by changing the volumetric water content and unsaturated loess permeability coefficient of unsaturated loess the more dry wet cycles there are the larger the unsaturated permeability coefficient with increasing volumetric water content the slope stability decreases under the same dry wet cycle conditions the greater the rainfall intensity and the longer the rainfall duration the easier the slope is to be unstable the influence of the dry wet cycle effect on the slope stability is weakened with an increasing number of cycles when more than 5 dry wet cycles are carried out the slope safety factor tends to be stable keywords slope instability loess dry wet cycle soil water characteristic curve unsaturated permeability coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction loess is widely distributed in china with a total area of 630 000 km2 the internal pore structure of loess is rich the vertical joints are well developed and its properties are susceptible to rainfall studies have shown that rainfall is one of the main causes of slope landslide ali et al 2014 kristoet al 2017 panet al 2020 rahardjoet al 2007 with the infiltration of water the matric suction of unsaturated loess decreases gradually resulting in a decrease in the shear strength of soil which makes it prone to slope instability chaeet al 2015 liet al 2018 ran et al 2018 the study area is located in northwest china and is composed of a typical loess plateau in this region the rainfall is concentrated in summer and the local environment temperature is high which means the loess is always in a dry wet cycle of rainfall infiltration and water vapor evaporation this dynamic cycle leads to the reorganization of the internal structure of the loess thereby changing its infiltration characteristics fig 1 shows common landslides in northwest china the permeability characteristics of loess are sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature resulting in different manifestations of soil mechanical properties lu et al 2019 terzaghi 1942 yates et al 2018 the problem of unsaturated soil is generally solved by the richards equation based on darcy s law gong et al 2004 rahardjo et al 2012 since the richards seepage equation involves the basic parameters of unsaturated soil we can use the soil water characteristic curve denoted as the swcc which is used to express the relationship between the matric suction and soil volumetric water content to obtain the soil parameters to describe the pore distribution of the soil to predict the permeability coefficient of the unsaturated soil and to obtain the corresponding relationship between the soil moisture content and unsaturated permeability coefficient fredlund 2006 additionally the swcc can be used to explain the permeability characteristics deformation characteristics and shear strength changes of unsaturated soil the swcc includes two variation curves of dehumidification and moisture absorption ahangar asr et al 2012 oh et al 2012 zhai et al 2020 since the dry wet cycle process causes the hydraulic path inside the soil to change the relationship of the swcc is not constant some scholars used the hysteresis loop area to quantitatively characterize the swcc as shown in fig 2 gao et al 2021 yan et al 2018 while others proposed the concept of the hysteresis degree to more comprehensively characterize the ability of soil samples to produce a hysteresis effect within a certain range of water contents kristo et al 2019 ran et al 2018a although rainfall infiltration is an important cause of loess slope instability its triggering mechanism is influenced by many factors with the wide application of numerical calculation methods the current research on slope instability mostly relies on computer simulation dyson and tolooiyan 2020 jia et al 2013 on the basis of the galerkin method proposed by neuman jellali and frikha 2017 akai et al 1997 used the finite element method to numerically simulate the results of

conditions liu et al 2021 proposed a new green ampt infiltration model through sensitivity analysis it was found that permeability coefficient water content difference suction head rainfall intensity and slope angle all affected the wet front depth of unsaturated loess the simplified model calculation results are closer to the actual results under different influencing conditions the changes in loess permeability and the swcc affect the slope stability previous studies have mostly focused on the analysis of the slope stability using empirical data or are limited to the study of soil permeability in this paper a soil water characteristic curve test of unsaturated loess is carried out and the permeability characteristics of the soil obtained from the test are applied to the slope stability analysis of the study area this method has a certain reliability in terms of the study of slope stability in a specific area in addition due to the concentrated rainfall and large temperature difference between day and night in the study area the finite element analysis of the slope instability mechanism considering the permeability characteristics of the loess under the effect of the dry wet cycle is closer to the actual engineering through monitoring it is found that the slope in the study area has produced large creep deformation considering the large hazards of sudden landslides to avoid casualties and property losses the authors carried out a series of studies on this basis and this study can provide a reliable theoretical basis for preventing and controlling landslide disasters in loess areas 2 research background the geographical location of the study area is shown in fig 3 table 1 shows the basic climatic data of the study area and the average annual rainfall is approximately 390 mm according to the statistics of meteorological data the annual rainfall in this area is mainly concentrated from may to september with an average daily rainfall of 1 82 mm precipitation is scarce and unevenly distributed fig 4 shows the measured daily rainfall in the region from october 2019 to october 2021 according to the survey data the landslides are mainly composed of loess the upper loess structure is loose with large pores and strong collapsibility vertical joint fissures of soil are developed and the joint penetration is good under the condition of rainwater infiltration the shear strength of soil decreases and the friction resistance is reduced the long term field monitoring plan for landslides in the study area began in mid june 2019 fig 5 shows the layout of the onsite monitoring system there are 4 monitoring points including one humidity and temperature measuring point one rainfall measuring point and two displacement measuring points which are used to monitor the daily rainfall regional climate change and slope deformation the slope has a u shape in plan and the boundary of the landslide is relatively obvious the back wall is steep and approximately 20 30 m high the slope gradient is approximately 25 45 and is close to upright in parts the bottom of the slope is unstable due to the continuous erosion of the gully bottom by water flow according to local residents the mountain has undergone creep deformation many times and the cracks formed by the latest deformation are clearly visible the width of the cracks is approximately 6 8 cm and the height of the staggered platform is approximately 10 cm according to site drilling the thickness of the landslide is approximately 8 15 m the average thickness is approximately 10 m and the landslide volume is 2 5 105 m3 indicating a medium landslide the preliminary exploration results show that the landslide is in the stage of creeping extrusion which creates certain hidden dangers for the roads and local residents in the study area fig 6 shows the engineering geological section of the slope 3 materials and methods 3 1 material the soil for the test was taken from the study area to ensure its effectiveness and uniformity the loess was taken from approximately 6 m below the ground surface the loess sample appeared yellowish brown and the soil was loose with abundant pores according to the standard for geotechnical test methods the basic physical indexes of the loess samples were tested and the results are shown in table 2 drilling data show that the landslide is mainly composed of loess soil and the front edge of the landslide is affected by water erosion exhibiting obvious shear deformation at present the landslide is in the stage of creep extrusion therefore the basic parameters for calculating the stability of the slope in the study area are comprehensively determined by geotechnical tests and engineering geological analogs and the specific values are shown in table 3 3 2 methods 3 2 1 experiments on the swcc the swcc test used the soil water characteristic pressure gauge jointly developed by fredlund and gcts company see fig 7 dried soil samples were crushed and passed through a sieve with a diameter of 2 0 mm according to the standard compaction test the maximum dry density of the loess was 1 74 g cm3 and the optimal moisture content was 19 3 according to the initial dry density and the maximum dry density soil samples with a dry density of 1 65 g cm3 were configured according to the standard operation the sample box was placed in a constant humidity container and could be used to make the sample to be tested after standing for 12 h the sample to be tested was a cylinder sample with a height of 2 cm and a diameter of 5 cm relevant research shows that the physical properties of the soil tend to be stable after 5 dry wet cycles wen et al 2020 therefore the design numbers of dry wet cycles in this study were 0 1 3 5 and 6 the suction path design of the swcc test under different dry wet cycles is shown in table 4 in which saturation drying saturation is taken as a dry wet cycle process to quantitatively express the relationship between the hydraulic characteristics of unsaturated loess and the swcc the van genuchten model is selected to fit the experimental data hedayati et al 2020

permeameter fig 8 was used for the variable head test the sample to be tested was a cylinder with a diameter of 61 8 mm and a height of 40 mm firstly the top and bottom surfaces of the undisturbed soil were cut flush with the ring knife by using a soil cutter the sample the sealing ring and the permeable stone were installed in sequence and the upper fixing screw was tightened then the instrument with the sample was placed smoothly on the horizontal operating platform the inlet and the water supply device were connected and the water flowed and exhausted under the action of a water head not more than 2 m after water escaped from the outlet pipe the saturated permeability coefficient could be tested table 5 shows the test results of the saturated permeability coefficient of the remodeled loess under different dry wet cycles the van genuchten model and childs collis geroge model were combined to predict the unsaturated permeability coefficient of the loess the swcc was divided into 20 equal parts along the longitudinal axis and the matric suction corresponding to each midpoint was used to calculate the unsaturated permeability coefficient 2 k w θ w i k s k sc a d j

finite element method was used to analyze the slope stability of the study area under different working conditions table 6 shows the design of the finite element simulation working conditions in which every time rainfall occurs the rain stops for 2 days which constitutes a dry wet cycle the seep w and slope w modules of the geostudio model were selected for finite element modeling based on the actual geological survey results a two dimensional numerical model of the slope was established the model was discretized by quadrilateral elements and triangular elements among them the precision of the quadrilateral grid is 0 25 m and the average area of the triangular grid is 0 03 m2 the slope was divided into 16 853 nodes and 16 655 elements the model and meshing are shown in fig 9 the material assignment of the slope model was based on the above experimental results fig 10 shows the measured swcc and unsaturated permeability coefficient the initial state has a great influence on the simulation results of the slope seepage field so the distribution of the water content in the slope needs to be given firstly combined with the actual survey results at the site given the slope groundwater level then the average temperature for many years was taken as the initial internal temperature of the soil raj and sengupta 2014 zhou et al 2019 finally the seepage of the slope was obtained through steady state analysis and the obtained results were imported into transient analysis as the initial conditions for subsequent analysis seep w is based on darcy s law and the expression is as follows 5 q k i where q is the specific discharge cm s k is the hydraulic conductivity cm s and i is the hydraulic conductivity since the change in the unsaturated permeability coefficient was related to the volumetric water content a two dimensional unsaturated soil seepage calculation equation was proposed 6 x k x h x y k y h y q θ t where h is the total head m k x is the permeability coefficient in the x direction m s k y is the permeability coefficient in the y direction m s q is the applied boundary flux m s θ is the volumetric water content m 3 m 3 t is time s in the seepage analysis the total stress was constant and the change in external load changes was not considered in the soil it was assumed that the pore air pressure was constant in the state of unsteady flow and that the change in volumetric water content was related to u a u w since u a was a constant the change in the volumetric water content was related only to the pore water pressure and the relationship between the changes was given by the following equation 7 θ m w u w where m w is the slope of the swcc u w is the pore water pressure kpa the total head is defined as 8 h y u w γ w where γ w is the bulk density of water kg m 3 and y is height m substituting formulas 7 and 8 into 6 we obtain 9 x k x h x y k y h y q m w γ w h t the slope w module uses the theory of force and moment balance to calculate the safety factor of the slope stability it was assumed that the sliding surface passed through the soil and that the soil was divided vertically to simplify the calculation the limit equilibrium assumed that the soil cohesion and internal friction angle were equal that is the safety factors of all blocks were equal above the groundwater level the pore water pressure of the soil was negative and the tangential force did not change with the total stress and pore water pressure therefore slope w proposed two ways to calculate the shear strength the authors used the modified mohr coulomb formula proposed by oh et al 2008 based on swcc 10 s c σ n u a tan ϕ u a u w θ w θ r θ s θ r tan ϕ where c is the effective cohesion kpa and ϕ is effective friction angle when θ w θ s the shear strength of the soil was determined completely by the matric suction when θ w θ r the matric suction no longer affected the shear strength this formula fully considered the influence of matric suction on the strength which was more in line with the actual situation the formula for calculating the safety factor for saturated soil is defined as follows shiferaw 2021 11 fs s r s m where s r is the total maximum shear force along the whole sliding surface kpa and s m is the total sliding force along the whole sliding surface kpa considering the effect of negative pore water pressure in unsaturated soils slope w uses two independent factor of safety equations one with respect to moment equilibrium and the other with respect to horizontal force equilibrium the parameters involved in formulas 12 and 13 are shown in table 7 and fig 11 shows the meanings of each parameter when only moment equilibrium is satisfied the factor of safety equation is 12 f m c β r n u w β tan ϕ b tan ϕ u a β 1 tan ϕ b tan ϕ r tan ϕ wx nf kwe dd aa the factor of safety equation with respect to horizontal force equilibrium is 13 f f c β cos α n u w β tan ϕ b tan ϕ u a β 1 tan ϕ b tan ϕ tan ϕ cos α n sin α α kw d cos ω a 4 results and discussions 4 1 influence of dry wet cycles on swcc the effect of dry wet cycles on the swcc is shown in fig 12 the full line in the figure represents the dehumidification process and the dashed line represents the hygroscopic process when the matric suction is in the range of 0 100 kpa the volumetric water content is 60 lower than the initial volumetric water content the smaller the matric suction is the faster the volumetric water content decreases with increasing matric suction the decreasing rate of the water content slows when the matric suction reaches approximately 220 kpa the volumetric water content tends to be stable after 0 1 3 5 and 6 dry wet cycles the volumetric water content is close to 0 110 m3 m3 0 095 m3 m3 0 100 m3 m3 0 090 m3 m3 0 090 m3 m3 respectively which are similar to its corresponding volumetric residual water content value due to the different effects of dehumidification and moisture absorption on the internal structure of the soil the variation trend of volumetric water content with matrix suction is not completely synchronized and the two curves have obvious hysteresis effects it can be observed that the hysteresis loop gradually decreases with the increase of the number of dry wet cycles when five dry wet cycles were performed the dehumidification and moisture absorption curves almost overlapped which was consistent with the results of chen et al 2018 indicating that soil properties were more easily affected by previous dry wet cycles and the soil properties tended to be stable after more than 5 dry wet cycles 4 2 influence of dry wet cycles on the unsaturated permeability coefficient the influence of dry wet cycles on the unsaturated permeability coefficient is shown in figs 13 and 14 when the matric suction is below 30 kpa the unsaturated permeability coefficient of the soil without dry wet cycle is the smallest and the permeability coefficient is almost equal after 6 times dry wet cycles in addition when the matric suction is 30 80 kpa the permeability coefficient decreases sharply with the increase of the matric suction on the whole the permeability coefficient showed a trend of increasing gradually with the increase of the number of dry wet cycles from the perspective of volumetric water content under the same volumetric water content the permeability coefficient of 0 dry wet cycles is 10 times higher than that of 6 dry wet cycles after 5 times dry wet cycles the change trend of permeability coefficient is no longer prominent and gradually tends to be stable combined with the references javanshir et al 2020 suh and yun 2018 the authors analyze the reasons for this phenomenon 1 with the increase in the number of dry wet cycles external water enters the soil which increases the number of micropores in the soil and makes the distribution of the pores more uniform enhances the water penetration and increases the permeability coefficient 2 there is air in the pores of the sample that can prevent water exchange and flow when the volumetric water content decreases the air content in the pores increases and the water dissipation in the soil becomes slower additionally external water does not easily enter the soil when a certain number of dry wet cycles is reached the properties of the soil tend to be stable and the unsaturated permeability coefficient remains basically unchanged the exponential function is used to fit the prediction data of the unsaturated permeability coefficient and the result can be used for subsequent research 4 3 influence of the rainfall intensity on the slope stability numerical analysis of the seepage and stability of slopes in the study area was carried out the influence of the rainfall intensity rainfall duration and dry wet cycles on the volumetric water content and slope safety factor in the rainy season were studied fig 15 shows the distribution of the volumetric water content in the initial state of the slope fig 16 shows the change in the volumetric water content with time at slope node 9846 23 22 after the slope has experienced rainfall of 0 02 m d moderate rain and 0 08 m d heavy rain the volumetric water content shows an overall increasing trend with rainfall intensity when the initial volumetric water content of the slope is the same after a dry wet cycle the volumetric water content corresponding to the rainfall intensity of 0 02 mm day does not change indicating that the depth of the wetting peak has not reached point 9846 at this time and that the rainfall has no effect on the volumetric water content of the point however when the rainfall intensity is 0 08 mm day the corresponding volumetric water content rapidly increases to 0 36 m3 m3 which is twice the initial volumetric water content the largest difference in volumetric water content between the two rainfall intensities occurs when the rainfall intensity is 0 02 m d the volumetric water content increases gradually with time regardless of whether it is in the raining phase or the rain stopped phase while when the rainfall intensity is 0 08 m d the change in soil water content fluctuates and the soil volumetric water content increases during the rain stopped phase due to the hysteresis of water infiltration since the soil permeability coefficient is less than the rainfall intensity water is accumulated on the slope during the rain stopped period the water gradually seeps down with increasing time and the volumetric water content at this location fluctuates around the saturated water content this was different form the study research results of chatra et al 2019 which showed that high intensity rainfall leads to slope failures that are initially unsaturated rainfall is the main triggering factor for the slope failure the above seepage analysis obtains the distribution of the volumetric water content and matric suction of the slope according to the above results stability analysis is carried out fig 17 shows the manifestation of the critical sliding surface inside the slope the variation trend of the slope safety factor under different rainfall intensities is shown in fig 18 when the rainfall intensity is 0 08 m d the volumetric water content of the slope increases with the occurrence of rainfall the safety factor drops sharply after the first dry wet cycle which is below 2 0 but the slope stability is still good if rain continues the slope safety factor continues to decline and the internal structure of the soil continues to be damaged and developed which produces later slope instability when the rainfall intensity is 0 02 m d due to the hysteresis effect of the dry wet cycle the safety factor of the slope remains constant after the second dry wet cycle with the continuation of the dry wet cycle although the safety factor is still decreasing the slope is always in a stable state due to its small decrease and the decrease of the safety factor is far less than the rainfall intensity of 0 08 m d 4 4 influence of the rainfall duration on the slope stability the rainfall lasts for 2 days and 5 days and the distribution cloud diagrams of volumetric water content after 1 2 and 3 dry wet cycles are shown in fig 19 fig 20 and fig 21 respectively the depth of the wetting peak on the slope generally increases with the rainfall when the rainfall lasts for 2 days the depths of the wetting peak after 1 2 and 3 dry wet cycles are 0 5 m 0 7 m and 1 0 m respectively when the rainfall lasts for 5 0 days the depths of the wetting peak after 1 2 and 3 dry wet cycles are 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 9 m respectively twice those of the continuous rainfall for 2 days in addition regardless of continuous rainfall for 2 days or 5 days the change in the volumetric water content of the slope does not cause fluctuations in the groundwater level when it rains continuously for 5 days water readily accumulates at the top and toe of the slope existing literature liu et al 2017 does not mention this problem but stagnant water will have serious consequences in practical engineering once water accumulates the slope is prone to instability therefore in practical engineering the top and toe of the slope should be protected to actively respond to the influence of long rainfall durations the variation trend of the slope safety factor is shown in fig 22 when the slope experiences 3 dry wet cycles the slope safety factor corresponding to 2 consecutive days of rainfall decreases by 6 6 and the slope safety factor corresponding to 5 consecutive days of rainfall decreases by 13 4 the influence of a long rainfall duration on slope stability is greater than that of a short rainfall duration and the slope safety factor decreases with rainfall similarly when it rains continuously for 2 days the safety factor of the slope remains basically constant after the second dry wet cycle and the reason for this phenomenon is the same as that in section 4 3 and will not be repeated here 4 5 influence of dry wet cycles on slope stability fig 23 shows that with an increasing number of dry wet cycles the volumetric water content of the slope surface is greater than the initial soil water content and the volumetric water content increases significantly during the first three dry wet cycles which are 3 22 50 00 and 31 25 respectively the volumetric water content in the last three dry wet cycles increases slowly at 4 76 3 03 and 1 52 respectively it can be concluded that the influence of the initial dry wet cycles is greater than that of the later dry wet cycles the analysis of the reasons for the above phenomenon is as follows li et al 2021 rainfall is scarce in the northwest and the slope is in an unsaturated state all year round therefore in the initial stage of rainfall all water seeps into the slope and the volumetric water content of the soil increases rapidly when rainfall occurs for a period of time the surface soil tends to be saturated and there are many pores filled with water which makes it difficult for air to be discharged and the process of water penetration into the lower soil becomes difficult so the growth rate of volumetric water content at this stage is slow as shown in fig 24 as the number of dry wet cycles increases the safety factor of the slope gradually decreases indicating that repeated rainfall evaporation decreases the stability of the slope after the fourth dry wet cycle the safety factor of the slope fluctuates around 1 5 and the slope is in a critical failure state at this time with an increasing number of cycles the decreasing rate of the slope safety factor gradually decreases and the safety factor decreases by nearly 50 after 6 dry wet cycles in practical engineering slopes are often subjected to the repeated effects of rainfall evaporation and water air circulation through finite element simulation analysis it can be seen that the stability of slopes is closely related to the dry wet cycles and different projects should be carried out according to different influencing factors to avoid immeasurable property losses and casualties caused by slope instability 5 conclusions based on a case study the influencing factors of loess slope instability under the coupling action of complex conditions are studied the results show that the dry wet cycle does not necessarily lead to slope instability and failure and rainfall intensity and duration are also important factors to be considered the process of evaporation and infiltration has a hysteresis which leads to the unstable fluctuation of the slope safety factor for medium and light rain and short duration rainfall the change of the slope safety factor is not simply reduced the specific performance is that the safety factor of the slope remains basically constant within a certain interval and its fluctuation has almost no weakening effect on the slope stability for example when p 0 02 mm d the safety factor is reduced by 0 03 when t 5d the safety factor is reduced by 0 07 for heavy rainstorm and long duration rainfall the change of safety factor is very significant when p 0 08 mm d the safety factor decreases by 6 1 when t 5d the safety factor decreases by 2 8 in addition the hysteresis effect of swcc was significantly affected by the dry wet cycle and the hysteresis effect decreased with the increase of the number of dry wet cycles while the unsaturated permeability coefficient increased with the increase of the dry wet cycles and in the first three dry wet cycles the change trend was more obvious in the low matrix suction range 30 80 kpa in the numerical simulation analysis of slope stability the measured soil sample parameters are used as input values which are closer to the actual working conditions than the empirical values after that the authors will continue to conduct research on slopes of different types and regions focus

3139,in practical engineering slopes are in rainfall evaporation environments over long periods considering the dry wet cycles effect on unsaturated loess slope instability is of great significance in this paper a soil water characteristic curve test of unsaturated loess is carried out combined with the prediction model the curve between the volumetric water content and unsaturated permeability coefficient is obtained and the obtained curve is used as the material assignment condition for slope stability analysis the results show that dry wet cycles affect slope stability by changing the volumetric water content and unsaturated loess permeability coefficient of unsaturated loess the more dry wet cycles there are the larger the unsaturated permeability coefficient with increasing volumetric water content the slope stability decreases under the same dry wet cycle conditions the greater the rainfall intensity and the longer the rainfall duration the easier the slope is to be unstable the influence of the dry wet cycle effect on the slope stability is weakened with an increasing number of cycles when more than 5 dry wet cycles are carried out the slope safety factor tends to be stable keywords slope instability loess dry wet cycle soil water characteristic curve unsaturated permeability coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction loess is widely distributed in china with a total area of 630 000 km2 the internal pore structure of loess is rich the vertical joints are well developed and its properties are susceptible to rainfall studies have shown that rainfall is one of the main causes of slope landslide ali et al 2014 kristoet al 2017 panet al 2020 rahardjoet al 2007 with the infiltration of water the matric suction of unsaturated loess decreases gradually resulting in a decrease in the shear strength of soil which makes it prone to slope instability chaeet al 2015 liet al 2018 ran et al 2018 the study area is located in northwest china and is composed of a typical loess plateau in this region the rainfall is concentrated in summer and the local environment temperature is high which means the loess is always in a dry wet cycle of rainfall infiltration and water vapor evaporation this dynamic cycle leads to the reorganization of the internal structure of the loess thereby changing its infiltration characteristics fig 1 shows common landslides in northwest china the permeability characteristics of loess are sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature resulting in different manifestations of soil mechanical properties lu et al 2019 terzaghi 1942 yates et al 2018 the problem of unsaturated soil is generally solved by the richards equation based on darcy s law gong et al 2004 rahardjo et al 2012 since the richards seepage equation involves the basic parameters of unsaturated soil we can use the soil water characteristic curve denoted as the swcc which is used to express the relationship between the matric suction and soil volumetric water content to obtain the soil parameters to describe the pore distribution of the soil to predict the permeability coefficient of the unsaturated soil and to obtain the corresponding relationship between the soil moisture content and unsaturated permeability coefficient fredlund 2006 additionally the swcc can be used to explain the permeability characteristics deformation characteristics and shear strength changes of unsaturated soil the swcc includes two variation curves of dehumidification and moisture absorption ahangar asr et al 2012 oh et al 2012 zhai et al 2020 since the dry wet cycle process causes the hydraulic path inside the soil to change the relationship of the swcc is not constant some scholars used the hysteresis loop area to quantitatively characterize the swcc as shown in fig 2 gao et al 2021 yan et al 2018 while others proposed the concept of the hysteresis degree to more comprehensively characterize the ability of soil samples to produce a hysteresis effect within a certain range of water contents kristo et al 2019 ran et al 2018a although rainfall infiltration is an important cause of loess slope instability its triggering mechanism is influenced by many factors with the wide application of numerical calculation methods the current research on slope instability mostly relies on computer simulation dyson

conditions liu et al 2021 proposed a new green ampt infiltration model through sensitivity analysis it was found that permeability coefficient water content difference suction head rainfall intensity and slope angle all affected the wet front depth of unsaturated loess the simplified model calculation results are closer to the actual results under different influencing conditions the changes in loess permeability and the swcc affect the slope stability previous studies have mostly focused on the analysis of the slope stability using empirical data or are limited to the study of soil permeability in this paper a soil water characteristic curve test of unsaturated loess is carried out and the permeability characteristics of the soil obtained from the test are applied to the slope stability analysis of the study area this method has a certain reliability in terms of the study of slope stability in a specific area in addition due to the concentrated rainfall and large temperature difference between day and night in the study area the finite element analysis of the slope instability mechanism considering the permeability characteristics of the loess under the effect of the dry wet cycle is closer to the actual engineering through monitoring it is found that the slope in the study area has produced large creep deformation considering the large hazards of sudden landslides to avoid casualties and property losses the authors carried out a series of studies on this basis and this study can provide a reliable theoretical basis for preventing and controlling landslide disasters in loess areas 2 research background the geographical location of the study area is shown in fig 3 table 1 shows the basic climatic data of the study area and the average annual

rainwater infiltration the shear strength of soil decreases and the friction resistance is reduced the long term field monitoring plan for landslides in the study area began in mid june 2019 fig 5

steep and approximately 20 30 m high the slope gradient is approximately 25 45 and is close to upright in parts the bottom of the slope is unstable due to the continuous erosion of the gully bottom by

were 0 1 3 5 and 6 the suction path design of the swcc test under different dry wet cycles is shown in table 4 in which saturation drying saturation is taken as a dry wet cycle process to quantitatively express the relationship between the hydraulic characteristics of unsaturated loess and the swcc the van genuchten model is selected to fit the experimental data hedayati et al 2020

permeameter fig 8 was used for the variable head test the sample to be tested was a cylinder with a diameter of 61 8 mm and a height of 40 mm firstly the top and bottom surfaces of the undisturbed soil were cut flush with the ring knife by using a soil cutter the sample the sealing ring and the permeable stone were installed in sequence and the upper fixing screw was tightened then the instrument with the sample was placed smoothly on the horizontal operating platform the inlet and the water supply device were connected and the water flowed and exhausted under the action of a water head not more than 2 m after water escaped from the outlet pipe the saturated permeability coefficient could be tested table 5 shows the test results of the saturated permeability coefficient of the remodeled loess under different dry wet cycles the van genuchten model and childs collis geroge model were combined to predict the unsaturated permeability coefficient of the loess the swcc was divided into 20 equal parts along the longitudinal axis and the matric suction corresponding to each midpoint was used to calculate the unsaturated permeability coefficient 2 k w θ w i k s k sc a d j

finite element method was used to analyze the slope stability of the study area under different working conditions table 6 shows the design of the finite element simulation working conditions in which every time rainfall occurs the rain stops for 2 days which constitutes a dry wet cycle the seep w and slope w modules of the geostudio model were selected for finite element modeling based on the actual geological survey results a two dimensional numerical model of the slope was established the model was discretized by quadrilateral elements and triangular elements among them the precision of the quadrilateral grid is 0 25 m and the average area of the triangular grid is 0 03 m2 the slope was divided into 16 853 nodes and 16 655 elements the model and meshing are shown in fig 9 the material assignment of the slope model was based on the above experimental results fig 10 shows the measured swcc and unsaturated permeability coefficient the initial state has a great influence on the simulation results of the slope seepage field so the distribution of the water content in the slope needs to be given firstly combined with the actual survey results at the site given the slope groundwater level then the average temperature for many years was taken as the initial internal temperature of the soil raj and sengupta 2014 zhou et al 2019 finally the seepage of the slope was obtained through steady state analysis and the obtained results were imported into transient analysis as the initial conditions for subsequent analysis seep w is based on darcy s law and the expression is as follows 5 q k i where q is the specific discharge cm s k is the hydraulic conductivity cm s and i is the hydraulic conductivity since the change in the unsaturated permeability coefficient was related to the volumetric water content a two dimensional unsaturated soil seepage calculation equation was proposed 6 x k x h x y k y h y q θ t where h is the total head m k x is the permeability coefficient in the x direction m s k y is the permeability coefficient in the y direction m s q is the applied boundary flux m s θ is the volumetric water content m 3 m 3 t is time s in the seepage analysis the total stress was constant and the change in external load changes was not considered in the soil it was assumed that the pore air pressure was constant in the state of unsteady flow and that the change in volumetric water content was related to u a u w since u a was a constant the change in the volumetric water content was related only to the pore water pressure and the relationship between the changes was given by the following equation 7 θ m w u w where m w is the slope of the swcc u w is the pore water pressure kpa the total head is defined as 8 h y u w γ w where γ w is the bulk density of water kg m 3 and y is height m substituting formulas 7 and 8 into 6 we obtain 9 x k x h x y k y h y q m w γ w h t the slope w module uses the theory of force and moment balance to calculate the safety factor of the slope stability it was assumed that the sliding surface passed through the soil and that the soil was divided vertically to simplify the calculation the limit equilibrium assumed that the soil cohesion and internal friction angle were equal that is the safety factors of all blocks were equal above the groundwater level the pore water pressure of the soil was negative and the tangential force did not change with the total stress and pore water pressure therefore slope w proposed two ways to calculate the shear strength the authors used the modified mohr coulomb formula proposed by oh et al 2008 based on swcc 10 s c σ n u a tan ϕ u a u w θ w θ r θ s θ r tan ϕ where c is the effective cohesion kpa and ϕ is effective friction angle when θ w θ s the shear strength of the soil was determined completely by the matric suction when θ w θ r the matric suction no longer affected the shear strength this formula fully considered the influence of matric suction on the strength which was more in line with the actual situation the formula for calculating the safety factor for saturated soil is defined as follows shiferaw 2021 11 fs s r s m where s r is the total maximum shear force along the whole sliding surface kpa and s m is the total sliding force along the whole sliding surface kpa considering the effect of negative pore water pressure in unsaturated soils slope w uses two independent factor of safety equations one with respect to moment equilibrium and the other with respect to horizontal force equilibrium the parameters involved in formulas 12 and 13 are shown in table 7 and fig 11 shows the meanings of each parameter when only moment equilibrium is satisfied the factor of safety equation is 12 f m c β r n

represents the dehumidification process and the dashed line represents the hygroscopic process when the matric suction is in the range of 0 100 kpa the volumetric water content is 60 lower than the initial volumetric water content the smaller the matric suction is the faster the volumetric water content decreases with increasing matric suction the decreasing rate of the water content slows when the matric suction reaches approximately 220 kpa the volumetric water content tends to be stable after 0 1 3 5 and 6 dry wet cycles the volumetric water content is close to 0 110 m3 m3 0 095 m3 m3 0 100 m3 m3 0 090 m3 m3 0 090 m3 m3 respectively which are similar to its corresponding volumetric residual water content value due to the different effects of dehumidification and moisture absorption on the internal structure of the soil the variation trend of volumetric water content with matrix suction is not completely synchronized and the two curves have obvious hysteresis effects it can be observed that the hysteresis loop gradually decreases with the increase of the number of dry wet cycles when five dry wet cycles were performed the dehumidification and moisture absorption curves almost overlapped which was consistent with the results of chen et al 2018 indicating that soil properties were more easily affected by previous dry wet cycles and the soil properties tended to be stable after more than 5 dry wet cycles 4 2 influence of dry wet cycles on the unsaturated permeability coefficient the influence of dry wet cycles on the unsaturated permeability coefficient is shown in figs 13 and 14 when the matric suction is below 30 kpa the unsaturated permeability coefficient of the soil without dry wet cycle is the smallest and the permeability coefficient is almost equal after 6 times dry wet cycles in addition when the matric suction is 30 80 kpa the permeability coefficient decreases sharply with the increase of the matric suction on the whole the permeability coefficient showed a trend of increasing gradually with the increase of the number of dry wet cycles from the perspective of volumetric water content under the same volumetric water content the permeability coefficient of 0 dry wet cycles is 10 times higher than that of 6 dry wet cycles after 5 times dry wet cycles the change trend of permeability coefficient is no longer prominent and gradually tends to be stable combined with the references javanshir et al 2020 suh and yun 2018 the authors analyze the reasons for this phenomenon 1 with the increase in the number of dry wet cycles external water enters the soil which increases the number of micropores in the soil and makes the distribution of the pores more uniform enhances the water penetration and increases the permeability coefficient 2 there is air in the pores of the sample that can prevent water exchange and flow when the volumetric water content decreases the air content in the pores increases and the water dissipation in the soil becomes slower additionally external water does not easily enter the soil when a certain number of dry wet cycles is reached the properties of the soil tend to be stable and the unsaturated permeability coefficient remains basically unchanged the exponential function is used to fit the prediction data of the unsaturated permeability coefficient and the result can be used for subsequent research 4 3 influence of the rainfall intensity on the slope stability numerical analysis of the seepage and stability of slopes in the study area was carried out the influence of the rainfall intensity rainfall duration and dry wet cycles on the volumetric water content and slope safety factor in the rainy season were studied fig 15 shows the distribution of the volumetric water content in the initial state of the slope fig 16 shows the change in the volumetric water content with time at slope node 9846 23 22 after the slope has experienced rainfall of 0 02 m d moderate rain and 0 08 m d heavy rain the volumetric water content shows an overall increasing trend with rainfall intensity when the initial volumetric water content of the slope is the same after a dry wet cycle the volumetric water content corresponding to the rainfall intensity of 0 02 mm day does not change indicating that the depth of the wetting peak has not reached point 9846 at this time and that the rainfall has no effect on the volumetric water content of the point however when the rainfall intensity is 0 08 mm day the corresponding volumetric water content rapidly increases to 0 36 m3 m3 which is twice the initial volumetric water content the largest difference in volumetric water content between the two rainfall intensities occurs when the rainfall intensity is 0 02 m d the volumetric water content increases gradually with time regardless of whether it is in the raining phase or the rain stopped phase while when the rainfall intensity is 0 08 m d the change in soil water content fluctuates and the soil volumetric water content increases during the rain stopped phase due to the hysteresis of water infiltration since the soil permeability coefficient is less than the rainfall intensity water is accumulated on the slope during the rain stopped period the water gradually seeps down with increasing time and the volumetric water content at this location fluctuates around the saturated water content this was different form the study research results of chatra et al 2019 which showed that high intensity rainfall leads to slope failures that are initially unsaturated rainfall is the main triggering factor for the slope failure the above seepage analysis obtains the distribution of the volumetric water content and matric suction of the slope according to the above results stability analysis is carried out fig 17 shows the manifestation of the critical sliding surface inside the slope the variation trend of the slope safety factor under different rainfall intensities is shown in fig 18 when the rainfall intensity is 0 08 m d the volumetric water content of the slope increases with the occurrence of rainfall the safety factor drops sharply after the first dry wet cycle which is below 2 0 but the slope stability is still good if rain continues the slope safety factor continues to decline and the internal structure of the soil continues to be damaged and developed which produces later slope instability when the rainfall intensity is 0 02 m d due to the hysteresis effect of the dry wet cycle the safety factor of the slope remains constant after the second dry wet cycle with the continuation of the dry wet cycle although the safety factor is still decreasing the slope is always in a stable state due to its small decrease and the decrease of the safety factor is far less than the rainfall intensity of 0 08 m d 4 4 influence of the rainfall duration on the slope stability the rainfall lasts for 2 days and 5 days and the distribution cloud diagrams of volumetric water content after 1 2 and 3 dry wet cycles are shown in fig 19 fig 20 and fig 21 respectively the depth of the wetting peak on the slope generally increases with the rainfall when the rainfall lasts for 2 days the depths of the wetting peak after 1 2 and 3 dry wet cycles are 0 5 m 0 7 m and 1 0 m respectively when the rainfall lasts for 5 0 days the depths of the wetting peak after 1 2 and 3 dry wet cycles are 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 9 m respectively twice those of the continuous rainfall for 2 days in addition regardless of continuous rainfall for 2 days or 5 days the change in the volumetric water content of the slope does not cause fluctuations in the groundwater level when it rains continuously for 5 days water readily accumulates at the top and toe of the slope existing literature liu et al 2017 does not mention this problem but stagnant water will have serious consequences in practical engineering once water accumulates the slope is prone to instability therefore in practical engineering the top and toe of the slope should be protected to actively respond to the influence of long rainfall durations the variation trend of the slope safety factor is shown in fig 22 when the slope experiences 3 dry wet cycles the slope safety factor corresponding to 2 consecutive days of rainfall decreases by 6 6 and the slope safety factor corresponding to 5 consecutive days of rainfall decreases by 13 4 the influence of a long rainfall duration on slope stability is greater than that of a short rainfall duration and the slope safety factor decreases with rainfall similarly when it rains continuously for 2 days the safety factor of the slope remains basically constant after the second dry wet cycle and the reason for this phenomenon is the same as that in section 4 3 and will not be repeated here 4 5 influence of dry wet cycles on slope stability fig 23 shows that with an increasing number of dry wet cycles the volumetric water content of the slope surface is greater than the initial soil water content and the volumetric water content increases significantly during the first three dry wet cycles which are 3 22 50 00 and 31 25 respectively the volumetric water content in the last three dry wet cycles increases slowly at 4 76 3 03 and 1 52 respectively it can be concluded that the influence of the initial dry wet cycles is greater than that of the later dry wet cycles the analysis of the reasons for the above phenomenon is as follows li et al 2021 rainfall is scarce in the northwest and the slope is in an unsaturated state all year round therefore in the initial stage of rainfall all water seeps into the slope and the volumetric water content of the soil increases rapidly when rainfall occurs for a period of time the surface soil tends to be saturated and there are many pores filled with water which makes it difficult for air to be discharged and the process of water penetration into the lower soil becomes difficult so the growth rate of volumetric water content at this stage is slow as shown in fig 24 as the number of dry wet cycles increases the safety factor of the slope gradually decreases indicating that repeated rainfall evaporation decreases the stability of the slope after the fourth dry wet cycle the safety factor of the slope fluctuates around 1 5 and the slope is in a critical failure state at this time with an increasing number of cycles the decreasing rate of the slope safety factor gradually decreases and the safety factor decreases by nearly 50 after 6 dry wet cycles in practical engineering slopes are often subjected to the repeated effects of rainfall evaporation and water air circulation through finite element simulation analysis it can be seen that the stability of slopes is closely related to the dry wet cycles and different projects should be carried out according to different influencing factors to avoid immeasurable property losses and casualties caused by slope instability 5 conclusions based on a case study the influencing factors of loess slope instability under the coupling action of complex conditions are studied the results show that the dry wet cycle does not necessarily lead to slope instability and failure and rainfall intensity and duration are also important factors to be considered the process of evaporation and infiltration has a hysteresis which leads to the unstable fluctuation of the slope safety factor for medium and light rain and short duration rainfall the change of the slope safety factor is not simply reduced the specific performance is that the safety factor of the slope remains basically constant within a certain interval and its fluctuation has almost no weakening effect on the slope stability for example when p 0 02 mm d the safety factor is reduced by 0 03 when t 5d the safety factor is reduced by 0 07 for heavy rainstorm and long duration rainfall the change of safety factor is very significant when p 0 08 mm d the safety factor decreases by 6 1 when t 5d the safety factor decreases by 2 8 in addition the hysteresis effect of swcc was significantly affected by the dry wet cycle and the hysteresis effect decreased with the increase of the number of dry wet cycles while the unsaturated permeability coefficient increased with the increase of the dry wet cycles and in the first three dry wet cycles the change trend was more obvious in the low matrix suction range 30 80 kpa in the numerical simulation analysis of slope stability the measured soil sample parameters are used as input values which are closer to the actual working conditions than the empirical values after that the authors will continue to conduct research on slopes of different types and regions focus
