17610,the rejection of disinfection byproducts dbps is an important consideration for the application of forward osmosis fo in wastewater recycling however the transport of organic compounds in fo is not well predicted by existing models partially because these models have not incorporated the effect of reverse salt flux a phenomenon previously shown to influence the transport of pharmaceutical compounds in this study we investigated the effects of reverse salt flux on dbp transport in fo and the corresponding mechanisms we used a commercial aquaporin membrane and tested sixteen dbps relevant to wastewater recycling using draw solutions constituted by nacl mgso4 or glucose in a bench scale fo system we first confirmed that higher reverse salt flux resulted in lower dbp permeance by integrating results from the bench scale fo system and those from diffusion cell tests we showed that two mechanisms contributed to the hindered dbp transport the steric hindrance in the active layer caused by the presence of the draw solute and the retarded diffusion of dbps in the support layer via a salting out effect lastly we developed a modified solution diffusion model incorporating these two mechanisms by accounting for the free volume occupied by draw solute molecules in the active layer and by introducing the setschenow constant respectively the modified model significantly improved the prediction of permeance for halogenated dbps and revealed the relative importance of steric hindrance dominant for large dbps and retarded diffusion dominant for hydrophobic dbps the modified model did not accurately predict the permeance of nitrosamines attributable to their extremely high hydrophilicity or large size graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward

alternative or supplement membrane technology to reverse osmosis ro for wastewater recycling linares et al 2014 lutchmiah et al 2014 qin and he 2014 yuan et al 2015 zou and he 2016 unlike ro that applies hydraulic pressure to drive water transport fo utilizes a draw solution with higher osmotic pressure than the feed stream lin 2016 accordingly fo features lower energy costs shaffer et al 2012 xiang et al 2017 yangali quintanilla et al 2011 zou et al 2016 and less irreversible membrane fouling jang et al 2016 mi and elimelech 2010 shaffer et al 2015 than ro transport of small organic molecules such as disinfection byproducts dbps and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps is an important consideration for wastewater recycling in fo with sodium chloride nacl or seawater as draw solutions the transport of ppcps was slow for large and charged compounds but fast for small and neutral compounds alturki et al 2013 coday et al 2014 xie et al 2014 dbps are compounds formed in the reactions between disinfectants and wastewater constituents many of the organic dbps are neutral halogenated and or nitrogenous compounds with lower molecular weight than most ppcps coday et al 2014 zeng et al 2016 dbps such as trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles and n nitrosamines have been detected at 0 01 20 µg l 1 levels along the treatment train in full scale wastewater recycling plants employing ro dai et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 the u s environmental protection agency epa regulates eleven dbps for drinking water including 4 trihalomethanes epa 2010 but recent research shows that the unregulated haloacetonitriles and nitrosamines exhibit much higher toxicity than the regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids wagner and plewa 2017 and account for the majority of cytotxicity after integrating the concentration and toxicity of different dbp classes lau et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 for potable reuse dbps can pose greater risks to human health than ppcps nrc 2012 our previous study showed that fo can exhibit slightly better rejection than ro for four groups of dbps trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles haloketones and nitrosamines xu et al 2018 reverse salt flux the diffusion of draw solute molecules through the fo membrane to the feed solution ferby et al 2020 zou et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 has been shown to hinder the forward transport of ppcps through cellulose triacetate and aquaporin membranes alturki et al 2013 kim et al 2012 xie et al 2018 2012 this phenomenon was attributed to the steric hindrance introduced by the draw solute molecules e g nacl present in the membrane matrix considering that the hydrated radii of sodium and chloride ions were comparable to the radii of the ppcps investigated as well as the membrane pore radius xie et al 2012 however a recent study sauchelli et al 2018 using diffusion cells i e without salt gradient across the membrane found that the permeance of three neutral ppcps was not affected by the amount of salt present in the membrane consistent with the latter kim et al did not observe the hindered forward transport for three relatively hydrophilic ppcps log kow 2 6 kim et al 2017 these conflicting results suggest that there are additional mechanisms contributing to the hindered forward transport of organic molecules in fo the difference observed for ppcps with different degrees of hydrophobicity suggests that the partition of organic compounds into the organic polymeric membrane may have affected the transport process i e retarded diffusion moreover unlike that in ro the membrane support layer in fo interfaces with solutions of high salinity i e the draw solution the presence of salt is known to promote the sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds i e the salting out effect burant et al 2017 ni and yalkowsky 2003 the salting out effect has been reported for polysulfone cheong et al 2013 a common material for the support layer of fo membranes han et al 2012 luo et al 2018 qi et al 2016 a recent study d haese 2020 also proposed that the sorption of feed organic solutes can play an important role in affecting their transport to date most solute transport models for fo are built upon models originally developed for nanofiltration nf and ro heo et al 2013 jin et al 2011 kong et al 2018 2014 2015 madsen et al 2015 xie et al 2018 2012 2014 xu et al 2018 these models have not been able to accurately predict the forward transport of organic compounds presumably because the effects of reverse salt flux have not been incorporated for example a pore hindrance model overestimated the rejection of hydrophobic organic compounds log kow 3 2 at ph 8 whereas underestimated the rejection of small compounds mw 180 g mol 1 xie et al 2018 similarly the solution diffusion model exhibited good prediction for the charged haloacetic acids kong et al 2014 and pharmaceuticals kong et al 2015 but poorly predicted the transport of the neutral molecules chloroform and bromoform xu et al 2018 as well as boron kim et al 2012 the goal of this study is to explore the mechanisms behind the hindered forward transport of organic compounds by the reverse salt flux in fo with a specific focus on dbps due to their importance in wastewater recycling a total of sixteen neutral dbps were selected as model compounds including four trihalomethanes three haloacetonitriles two haloketones and seven nitrosamines dbp permeance was first measured in a bench scale fo setup with a commercial aquaporin membrane and different draw solutions and then in a diffusion cell without cross membrane salt gradient correlations between the change in dbp permeance due to the reverse salt flux and the molecular size or hydrophobicity of dbps were assessed to show the relative importance of steric hindrance and sorption effects on dbp transport lastly the conventional solution diffusion model was modified to incorporate the effects of steric hindrance and sorption induced retarded diffusion to predict dbp transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and membranes epa 521 nitrosamine mix 2000 µg ml 1 of each nitrosamine in methylene chloride epa 501 601 trihalomethanes calibration mix

q water a commercial fo membrane aquaporin membrane a s lyngby denmark was used in this study aquaporin membrane is a thin film composite membrane with aquaporin protein embedded in the polyamide active layer it exhibits higher water permeability and lower reverse salt flux than the conventional cellulose triacetate membrane for fo xu et al 2018 the performance of this membrane in rejecting organic molecules has been tested for ppcps engelhardt et al 2018 madsen et al 2015 xie et al 2018 and dbps xu et al 2018 a previous study has reported that the transport of organic contaminants was dominantly through the polyamide matrix rather than the aquaporin protein xie et al 2018 the characteristics of the aquaporin membrane are shown in table s1 the water flux of the flat sheet aquaporin membrane used in this study is consistent with that previously reported for the same membrane madsen et al 2015 xia et al 2017 2 2 bench scale forward osmosis experiments a bench scale cross flow system figure s1 was used it is comprised of a modified permeation cell sepa cf ii sterlitech corporation with countercurrent flow for the feed and draw solutions pressure valves flow meters feed and draw solution reservoirs and two gear pumps cole parmer as previously described xu et al 2018 the permeation cell holds a membrane with an effective area of 140 cm2 and features 2 mm channel height on each side the active and support layers face feed and draw reservoirs respectively aquaporin membranes were immersed in milli q water for 24 h before the experiments the draw and feed reservoirs initially contained 2 0 l of draw solution and 1 5 l milli q water respectively the draw solutions tested were 1 0 m mgso4 1 5 m glucose 0 5 m nacl 1 m nacl and 0 2 m nacl crossflow velocity was set at 0 048 m s 1 after a constant water flux was reached approximately 15 min dbps were spiked into the feed reservoir to make up an initial concentration of 20 µg l 1 for each halogenated dbp or 10 µg l 1 for each nitrosamine the feed and draw reservoirs were sampled periodically every 1 2 h by 5 ml and 15 ml respectively for dbp analysis the molecular properties of all dbps tested in this study are shown in table s2 the volume of feed and draw solutions was recorded continuously based on the weight of the reservoirs feed solutions were monitored for the change in conductivity when nacl or mgso4 was used as the draw solute or total organic carbon concentration when glucose was used as the draw solute for the calculation of reverse salt flux further details on the calculation of water flux dbp rejection dbp permeance and reverse salt flux are described in text s1 the external concentration polarization factor of each dbp in the feed solution was considered when calculating dbp permeance the values of concentration polarization factor are shown in table s3 2 3 diffusion cell experiments a diffusion cell was used to determine dbp permeance in the absence of the reverse salt flux a membrane coupon contact area 0 79 cm2 was sandwiched between two silicone gaskets the chambers facing the active layer hereafter referred to as the feed reservoir and support layer draw reservoir of the membranes contained 40 ml of the same solution milli q water 0 5 m nacl or 1 0 m nacl i e there was no salt gradient across the membrane both feed and draw reservoirs were continuously mixed by magnetic stirring at a rate of 200 rpm to minimize concentration polarization dbp transport was driven by the dbp concentration difference in the two chambers with initial concentrations 2 mg l 1 and 50 µg l 1 in the feed and draw reservoirs respectively aquaporin membrane coupons were pre soaked for 24 h in the same solution as that used in the subsequent diffusion test over the course of 20 h of the diffusion test 0 6 ml and 0 1 ml samples were periodically withdrawn from the draw and feed reservoirs respectively for dbp analysis the volume of the samples withdrawn for dbp analysis was accounted for during data processing the dbp permeance was calculated by 1 v f t v d t a m v f t v d t ln c f 0 c d 0 c f t c d t b diffusion cell t where bdiffusion

beginning of the experiments respectively the dbp permeance bdiffusion cell was determined using linear regression of eq 1 as a function of t duplicate experiments were conducted the results for the experiment using pure water are shown in figure s2 as an example to evaluate the mechanisms of the effects of reverse salt flux on dbp transport pearson s and spearman s tests were conducted using minitab 19 these tests examined the correlation between the change of dbp permeance by reverse salt flux quantified by the ratio between dbp permeance in fo experiments and that in diffusion cell test using milli q water bfo bdiffusion cell di and the molecular size molecular volume or hydrophobicity log kow of the dbps pearson s r measures the linear relationship between two variables while spearman s ρ is a nonparametric monotonic measure of rank correlation between two variables the significance level α was set at 0 05 when p value from these tests are less than 0 05 a significant positive r or ρ 0 or negative r or ρ 0 correlation is present 2 4 dbp sorption test batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the sorption of halogenated dbps to aquaporin membrane and polysulfone beads the material of the aquaporin support layer an aquaporin membrane coupon 0 255 g 35 cm2 or 2 g polysulfone beads were added to 20 ml solutions containing 50 µg l 1 of each halogenated dbp to test the salting out effect sorption tests were conducted in milli q water or 1 m nacl controls were set up with the same dbp concentration and water matrix but without membrane or polysulfone beads aqueous samples were collected at 17 24 and 41 h and analyzed for dbp concentrations dbp sorption was calculated based on a mass balance approach with details shown in text s2 2 5 dbp analysis samples were raised to 30 ml using milli q water prior to solvent extraction for dbp analysis for the analysis of halogenated dbps the 30 ml samples were spiked with the internal standard 1 2 dibromopropane 10 µg l 1 and mixed with 2 ml mtbe and 10 g sodium sulfate the extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography electron capture detector gc ecd agilent 7890b 63ni ecd with an hp 5 column using a

membrane and ddbp m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient of an individual dbp in milli q water the detailed derivation is described in text s3 to improve the prediction of dbp transport in fo steric hindrance in the active layer and sorption in the support layer were incorporated into the sd model to account for the effects of reverse salt flux through the derivation described in text s3 eq 3 can be obtained for a modified solution diffusion m sd model 3 1 b m s d 1 b a l s s r r d d b p where bm sd m s 1 is the dbp permeance through fo membrane predicted using the m sd model b a l s m s 1 is

for nacl ds 1 61 10 9 m2 s 1 phillip et al 2010 ds values of the three draw solutes are shown in table s4 the external concentration polarization for nacl was not considered in this equation because the external concentration polarization factor was close to 1 in our experiments β 0 997 0 999 calculated as described in our previous study xu et al 2018 by solving eq 5 using the results from fo experiments with different draw nacl concentrations s was calculated to be 179 µm for the aquaporin membrane used in this study the diffusion coefficient of each dbp ddbp m2 s 1 was predicted using

a l s the sd model considers the polyamide active layer as nonporous but recent studies showed that this dense layer contains interconnected pore like microvoids wang et al 2014 xie et al 2018 and that the permeance of dbp through the active layer can be influenced by the effective average pore radius rp nm in the aquaporin membrane xu et al 2018 7 b a l 1 r d b p r p 2 where rdpb nm is the molecular radius of the dbp see table s2 and bal m s 1 is the dbp permeance through the active layer hence dbp permeance through the active layer under a given reverse salt flux can be calculated as 8 b a l s b a l d i 1 r d b p r p s 1 r d b p r p d i 2 where r p s nm and r p d i nm are the effective average pore radii in the presence and absence of the salt respectively with the calculation

k d b p s a l t m 1 is the setschenow constant and ncs m is the corresponding salt concentration of the saline solution within the support layer the extent of the salting out effect is influenced by the salt concentration profile figure s3 and therefore k d b p m s l in eq 10 for fo is a thickness averaged partitioning coefficient 3 2 1 draw solute concentration profile in support layer the salt

table 2 validating them for estimating the k d b p d i m s l and k d b p s a l t values of the other 9 dbps investigated in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of reverse salt flux on dbp rejection and permeance over the course of the fo experiment the rejection of all dbps by aquaporin membrane exhibited a small initial decline and then stabilized after 150 600 ml of water permeated through the membrane figure s4 for four dbps as examples the stabilized rejection is used in the discussion for the rest of the manuscript fig 2 a shows the rejection of the sixteen dbps under a water flux of 3 0 4 0 l m 2 h 1 with three different compounds nacl mgso4 and glucose as draw solutes for halogenated dbps the rejection was highest when nacl was used as the draw solute followed by glucose and then mgso4 two of the trihalomethanes tcm and dcbm even exhibited negative rejection with mgso4 as the draw solute based on the solution diffusion mechanism xie et al 2018 dbp transport in fo is mainly governed by diffusion and is independent on water flux in cases where water flux was low e g 3 0 l m 2 h 1 with 1 m mgso4 as the draw solution the faster transport of dbp than water would lead to a dbp to water flux ratio equations s1 and s2 greater than the average dbp concentration in the feed solution resulting in a negative rejection equation s3 the dependence of the rejection of halogenated dbps on draw solutes is similar to that previously reported for ppcps i e nacl provided the highest ppcp rejection followed by glucose and mgso4 xie et al 2018 because the three draw solutions imposed a range of reverse salt flux 6 8 35 8 mmol m 2 h 1 our results further support the previous observation that reverse salt flux is an important factor influencing the forward transport of organic solutes xie et al 2012 in contrast most nitrosamines except the smallest compound ndma did not show a substantial difference in rejection when different draw solutes were used fig 2a dbp permeance from the above experiments as well as those from experiments using nacl solutions of different concentrations rejection values shown in fig 2b was calculated to further assess the effects of reverse salt flux on dbp transport fig 3 the five different draw solutions resulted in a range of reverse salt flux 6 8 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 table s4 the permeance of halogenated dbps figs 3a and 3b decreased with the increase of reverse salt flux for example the permeance of tcm and dcan decreased from 1 00 µm s 1 to 0 81 µm s 1 and from 0 76 µm s 1 to 0 66 µm s 1 respectively when reverse salt flux increased from 6 8 to 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 in contrast such a trend was not observed for nitrosamines the permeance of which remained approximately constant across the range of reverse salt flux tested fig 3c previous studies hypothesized that the effect of reverse salt flux can be attributed to the steric hindrance introduced by the draw solute molecules on the forward transport of organic molecules xie et al 2012 in other words one would expect that organic molecules of similar sizes to be impacted by reserve salt flux similarly this however does not apply to our dbp results for example dcan and ndma feature similar molecular radii around 0 259 nm but only dcan showed a decrease in permeance with increasing reverse salt flux the different effects of reverse salt flux on the rejection and permeance between halogenated dbps and nitrosamines despite their similar molecular size suggest that mechanisms beyond the hindrance effect are at play it should be mentioned that convection can also play a role in the transport of organic contaminants xie et al 2014 which can generate confounding factors for the effect of reverse salt flux because varying reverse salt flux is often accompanied with different water fluxes however as shown in table s10 even at the highest water flux 8 1 l m 2 h 1 tested in this study i e maximal convection convection only accounted for less than 10 of total flux for all dbps indicating that its role was overall minor in this study 4 2 mechanistic investigation of the reverse salt flux effects 4 2 1 steric hindrance the steric hindrance for the forward transport of organic molecules can result from the countermovement of draw solute molecules or simply from their presence in the membrane active layer to differentiate these two possibilities experiments were conducted in diffusion cells where there is no movement of draw solute molecules as shown in fig 4 dbp permeance was much lower in nacl solutions than that in pure water the higher the nacl concentration the lower the dbp permeance these results indicate that the presence of nacl in the membrane i e without movement already hinders dbp transport according to the steric hindrance theory draw solutes with similar radii as the membrane effective pore radius could occupy the free space in the membrane active layer and thereby hinder the transport of organic molecules with similar molecular radii scheme s1a in other words for organic molecules smaller than the draw solutes their transport should be less hindered scheme s1b this hypothesis was tested by examining the relationship between the drop in dbp permeance in the presence of draw solutes and the size of dbps fig 5 the decrease in dbp permeance is represented as the ratio of the dbp permeance in fo experiments with various draw solutes to the dbp permeance in diffusion cell experiments with pure water pearson s linear parametric and spearman s monotonic non parametric correlation tests show that the drop in dbp permeance in the presence of draw solutes mgso4 or glucose inversely correlated with the molecular volume of dbps but such a correlation was not observed for nacl these results indicate that the steric hindrance by the larger draw solutes mgso4 or glucose plays an important role in hindering the forward dbp transport in fo but other physicochemical processes may contribute to the hindered dbp transport by the smaller draw solute nacl 4 2 2 retardation of dbp diffusion in the support layer the role of the support layer in the presence of draw solutes on dbp transport has not been previously examined compared with the active layer the support layer has an open structure and hence is not likely to restrict the movement of dbp molecules however it can serve as a sorption media for organic compounds accordingly the relationship between the drop in dbp permeance in the presence of draw solutes and the hydrophobicity of dbps log kow was analyzed fig 6 in contrast to the results observed for molecular volume fig 5 fig 6 shows that the drop in dbp permeance due to the presence of nacl inversely correlated with the log kow of dbps but such a correlation was not observed for mgso4 or glucose this can be rationalized by the larger size of mgso4 and glucose than nacl which results in a dominating steric hindrance effect in the active layer and in the case of glucose the lack of ionic charge to induce the salting out effect in the support layer the wastewater relevant low dbp concentrations 10 20 µg l 1 used in the feed for the fo experiments render it challenging to quantify the amount of dbp in the aquaporin membrane using desorption tests accordingly we conducted sorption experiments in batch systems using aquaporin membrane coupons or polysulfone beads the material of the support layer in milli q water or 1 m nacl solution for halogenated dbps figure s5 in the presence of aquaporin membrane or polysulfone beads dbp concentrations in the aqueous phase declined initially and then reached a plateau by 41 h by when 70 98 and 11 52 of the total dbp mass partitioned into the aquaporin membrane coupon and polysulfone beads respectively higher sorption occurred in 1 m nacl solution than in milli q water among different dbps the extent of sorption on aquaporin membrane or polysulfone beads in milli q water correlated with the partitioning coefficient k d b p d i m s l value of the dbps figures s6a and s6b additionally the enhancement of sorption in 1 m nacl solution compared with that in milli q water correlated with the setschenow constant k d b p s a l t of the dbps figures s6c and s6d supporting the salting out effects overall these results support that sorption of dbps in the support layer especially in the presence of the high concentration of salts can contribute to the retardation of dbp transport in fo 4 3 modelling dbp transport in fo 4 3 1 steric hindrance in the active layer the effective pore radius r p s and the associated dbp permeance through the active layer b a l s are shown in table 3 for four representative dbps as reverse nacl flux increased both r p s and b a l s decreased when reverse nacl flux increased from 0 to 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 r p s decreased from 0 305 to 0 297 nm this seemingly small change in r p s 3 decrease resulted in a substantial decrease in b a l s by 26 38 additionally the decrease in b a l s is more pronounced for larger dbps tbm rdbp 0 271 nm exhibited a greater decrease 38 in b a l s than the other three dbps rdbp 0 256 0 259 nm 26 29 decrease fig 7 simulates the change in b a l s due to the presence of nacl as a function of dbp size showing that the presence of salt has a stronger effect on suppressing the permeance of larger dbps through the active layer beyond dbps this trend may be applicable to other neutral organic molecules with radii smaller than the effective pore radius of the membrane in the presence of draw solutes 4 3 2 retarded diffusion in the support layer the values of the retardation factor rr for all dbps are shown in table 4 for all dbps the higher the reverse nacl flux the greater the value of rr indicating a stronger retardation effect in the support layer additionally the increase in rr accompanied by increasing reverse nacl flux is greater for dbps with higher hydrophobicity for example rr of tbm log kow 2 40 increased by 42 when reverse nacl flux increased from 0 to 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 while ndma log kow 0 64 featured only 7 increase in rr this dependence is consistent with the results observed in fig 6 where a stronger effect of reverse nacl flux was observed on the permeance of dbps with higher hydrophobicity 4 3 3 predicting dbp permeance with the modified solution diffusion model the dbp permeance and rejection determined from fo experiments were compared with those predicted using the conventional solution diffusion sd model or the modified solution diffusion m sd model as shown in fig 8 for all halogenated dbps trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles haloketones the m sd model more accurately predicted dbp permeance and rejection than the sd model and the improved accuracy of the m sd model is more pronounced at higher reverse salt flux the model error calculated by eq 4 was compared between the m sd and sd models for trihalomethanes a group of dbps regulated by u s epa the m sd model predicted their permeance with error of 3 20 at the low reverse nacl flux of 20 9 mmol m 2 h 1 fig 8a better than the sd model 9 30 error at the high reverse nacl flux of 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 the errors of the m sd and sd models in predicting trihalomethanes permeance were 2 121 and 28 238 fig 8b respectively for haloacetonitriles a group of dbps recently shown to contribute to the majority of the toxicity in recycled wastewater lau et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 the m sd model provided accurate prediction for their permeance 2 13 and 10 25 errors at low and high reverse nacl flux respectively a significant improvement from the sd model 10 22 and 20 91 errors for haloketones the m sd and sd model predicted the permeance with errors of 89 35 and 10 150 respectively at the high reverse nacl flux in contrast for the four nitrosamines the m sd model underestimated their permeance at the high reverse nacl flux the error of the m sd model in predicting permeance was 26 for ndma and 37 94 for the other three nitrosamines fig 8b whereas the error of the sd model was 1 33 for these nitrosamines ndma the smallest nitrosamine with high hydrophilicity log kow 0 64 can possibly be transported through convection but the low contribution of convection to total ndma flux in our experiments 3 table s10 suggests that the prediction error of the m sd model for ndma is attributed to other factors as for the other three nitrosamines the poor performance of the m sd model may be attributed to the large size of these compounds with radius 0 278 0 295 nm close to the effective pore radius r p s of the active layer in the presence of salt as shown in fig 7 the effect of steric hindrance reflected by the ratio of b a l s to b a l d i is extremely sensitive to dbp radii as they approach r p s in reality rather than a uniform pore size r p s the effective pores in the active layer likely feature a range of sizes fang et al 2014 with larger pores available for the transport of large dbps this pore size distribution is not considered in either the m sd or sd model but m sd model is more affected due to the consideration of pore restriction by draw salt in the active layer for halogenated dbps the relative importance of steric hindrance versus retarded diffusion in contributing to the effects of reverse salt flux on dbp permeance is shown in fig 9 for three representative compounds between tcm and dcan with similar molecular sizes rdbp 0 256 0 259 nm the more hydrophobic tcm log kow 1 97 is more affected by retarded diffusion in the support layer than by steric hindrance in the active layer while the less hydrophobic dcan log kow 0 29 is more affected by steric hindrance for dibromochloromethane dbcm a relatively large and hydrophobic dbp steric hindrance and retarded diffusion contributed similarly 4 3 4 model limitations although the m sd model significantly improved the prediction of the permeance of halogenated dbps a few limitations should be acknowledged first the pore size distribution of the active layer is not captured by the use of effective pore radius r p s in the model as a result the m sd model cannot predict the permeance of dbps with radii larger than r p s such as n nitrosopiperidine n nitrosodipropylamine and n nitrosodibutylamine tables 3 and s2 even for dbps with radii smaller than but close to r p s the m sd model significantly underestimated the permeance such as for n nitrosodiethylamine rdbp 0 295 nm figure s7 this limitation however may not be critical for application in wastewater recycling because these large dbps generally have high rejection e g 85 with 1 m nacl as the draw solution fig 2 and have been shown to contribute to relatively low health risks in full scale wastewater recycling operation zeng et al 2016 second the m sd model does not consider the convection process although convection contributed to less than 10 of the total dbp flux across experiments conducted in this study table s10 its role can be substantial at higher water fluxes warranting further consideration in future studies third further improvement of the m sd model may consider the depth heterogeneity of the support layer when determining the effect of retarded diffusion on hydrophobic compounds the polysulfone layer is usually heterogeneous in depth breitbach et al 1991 suggesting that the partitioning coefficient determined from the surface of the support layer may not fully represent the partitioning in the entire support layer because retarded diffusion is particularly important for the more hydrophobic compounds accurate determination of their partitioning coefficients with the support layer is critical for predicting their permeance in the presence of reverse salt flux for example the only three halogenated dbps i e dichlorobromomethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform whose permeance values were not accurately predicted by the m sd model see fig 8 had the highest hydrophobicity among the halogenated dbps tested log kow 2 lastly the m sd model has not incorporated the effects of organic fouling organic fouling can hinder the diffusion of draw solutes from the active layer to the feed solution and therefore elevate draw solute concentrations in the active layer lee et al 2010 as a result the steric hindrance caused by reverse salt flux on dbp transport is expected to be enhanced by the organic fouling future research is needed to systematically evaluate the varying effects of the different types of organic fouling that are relevant to wastewater recycling on the transport of organic contaminants and to incorporate them into transport models 5 conclusion this study evaluated the effects of reverse salt flux on the forward transport of 16 neutral dbps in fo including 9 halogenated dbps 4 trihalomethanes 3 haloacetonitriles and 2 haloketones and 7 nitrosamines using three draw solutes nacl mgso4 and glucose we observed that the higher the reverse salt flux the lower the dbp permeance and hence the higher the dbp rejection by the aquaporin membrane this effect of reverse salt flux was stronger for halogenated dbps than for nitrosamines correlation analysis combining results from fo and diffusion cell experiments showed that the steric hindrance in the active layer contributed to the effects of reverse salt flux for mgso4 and glucose while the retarded diffusion in the support layer played a major role for nacl this study is one of the first attempts to incorporate the effects of reverse salt flux for the forward transport of organic compounds in fo transport models we modified the conventional solution diffusion sd model by incorporating both steric hindrance and retarded diffusion to predict the dbp permeance under low and high reverse salt fluxes the steric hindrance in the active layer was reflected by the effective pore radius r p s after accounting for the free volumes occupied by draw solutes the retardation factor in the support layer was estimated using the partitioning coefficient of dbps between the support layer and water k d b p d i m s l as well as the setschenow constant representing the salting out effect k d b p s a l t our modified sd m sd model predicted the permeance of halogenated dbps better than the conventional sd model specifically the permeance of haloacetonitriles a group of high priority dbps in wastewater recycling was predicted by the m sd model with less than 25 error from the experimental observation steric hindrance is the dominant mechanism for the reverse salt flux effect for large dbps while retarded diffusion contributed more for hydrophobic dbps the m sd model underestimated the permeance of nitrosamines presumably due to the limitation that the m sd model did not consider

17610,the rejection of disinfection byproducts dbps is an important consideration for the application of forward osmosis fo in wastewater recycling however the transport of organic compounds in fo is not well predicted by existing models partially because these models have not incorporated the effect of reverse salt flux a phenomenon previously shown to influence the transport of pharmaceutical compounds in this study we investigated the effects of reverse salt flux on dbp transport in fo and the corresponding mechanisms we used a commercial aquaporin membrane and tested sixteen dbps relevant to wastewater recycling using draw solutions constituted by nacl mgso4 or glucose in a bench scale fo system we first confirmed that higher reverse salt flux resulted in lower dbp permeance by integrating results from the bench scale fo system and those from diffusion cell tests we showed that two mechanisms contributed to the hindered dbp transport the steric hindrance in the active layer caused by the presence of the draw solute and the retarded diffusion of dbps in the support layer via a salting out effect lastly we developed a modified solution diffusion model incorporating these two mechanisms by accounting for the free volume occupied by draw solute molecules in the active layer and by introducing the setschenow constant respectively the modified model significantly improved the prediction of permeance for halogenated dbps and revealed the relative importance of steric hindrance dominant for large dbps and retarded diffusion dominant for hydrophobic dbps the modified model did not accurately predict the permeance of nitrosamines attributable to their extremely high hydrophilicity or large size graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward

applies hydraulic pressure to drive water transport fo utilizes a draw solution with higher osmotic pressure than the feed stream lin 2016 accordingly fo features lower energy costs shaffer et al 2012 xiang et al 2017 yangali quintanilla et al 2011 zou et al 2016 and less irreversible membrane fouling jang et al 2016 mi and elimelech 2010 shaffer et al 2015 than ro transport of small organic molecules such as disinfection byproducts dbps and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps is an important consideration for wastewater recycling in fo with sodium chloride nacl or seawater as draw solutions the transport of ppcps was slow for large and charged compounds but fast for small and neutral compounds alturki et al 2013 coday et al 2014 xie et al 2014 dbps are compounds formed in the reactions between disinfectants and wastewater constituents many of the organic dbps are neutral halogenated and or nitrogenous compounds with lower molecular weight than most ppcps coday et al 2014 zeng et al 2016 dbps such as trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles and n nitrosamines have been detected at 0 01 20 µg l 1 levels along the treatment train in full scale wastewater recycling plants employing ro dai et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 the u s environmental protection agency epa regulates eleven dbps for drinking water including 4 trihalomethanes epa 2010 but recent research shows that the unregulated haloacetonitriles and nitrosamines exhibit much higher toxicity than the regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids wagner and plewa 2017 and account for the majority of cytotxicity after integrating the concentration and toxicity of different dbp classes lau et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 for potable reuse dbps can pose greater risks to human health than ppcps nrc 2012 our previous study showed that fo can exhibit slightly better rejection than ro for four groups of dbps trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles haloketones and nitrosamines xu et al 2018 reverse salt flux the diffusion of draw solute molecules through the fo membrane to the feed solution ferby et al 2020 zou et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 has been shown to hinder the forward transport of ppcps through cellulose triacetate and aquaporin membranes alturki et al 2013 kim et al 2012 xie et al 2018 2012 this phenomenon was attributed to the steric hindrance introduced by the draw solute molecules e g nacl present in the membrane matrix considering that the hydrated radii of sodium and chloride ions were comparable to the radii of the ppcps investigated as well as the membrane pore radius xie et al 2012 however a recent study sauchelli et al 2018 using diffusion cells i e without salt gradient across the membrane found that the permeance of three neutral ppcps was not affected by the amount of salt present in the membrane consistent with the latter kim et al did not observe the hindered forward transport for three relatively hydrophilic ppcps log kow 2 6 kim et al 2017 these conflicting results suggest that there are additional mechanisms contributing to the hindered forward transport of organic molecules in fo the difference observed for ppcps with different degrees of hydrophobicity suggests that the partition of organic compounds into the organic polymeric membrane may have affected the transport process i e retarded diffusion moreover unlike that in ro the membrane support layer in fo interfaces with solutions of high salinity i e the draw solution the presence of salt is known to promote the sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds i e the salting out effect burant et al 2017 ni and yalkowsky 2003 the salting out effect has been reported for polysulfone cheong et al 2013 a common material for the support layer of fo membranes han et al 2012 luo et al 2018 qi et al 2016 a recent study d haese 2020 also proposed that the sorption of feed organic solutes can play an important role in affecting their transport to date most solute transport models for fo are built upon models originally developed for nanofiltration nf and ro heo et al 2013 jin et al 2011 kong et al 2018 2014 2015 madsen et al 2015 xie et al 2018 2012 2014 xu et al 2018 these models have not been able to accurately predict the forward transport of organic compounds presumably because the effects of reverse salt flux have not been incorporated for example a pore hindrance model overestimated the rejection of hydrophobic organic compounds log kow 3 2 at ph 8 whereas underestimated the rejection of small compounds mw 180 g mol 1 xie et al 2018 similarly the solution diffusion model exhibited good prediction for the charged haloacetic acids kong et al 2014 and pharmaceuticals kong et al 2015 but poorly predicted the transport of the neutral molecules chloroform and bromoform xu et al 2018 as well as boron kim et al 2012 the goal of this study is to explore the mechanisms behind the hindered forward transport of organic compounds by the reverse salt flux in fo with a specific focus on dbps due to their importance in wastewater recycling a total of sixteen neutral dbps were selected as model compounds including four trihalomethanes three haloacetonitriles two haloketones and seven nitrosamines dbp permeance was first measured in a bench scale fo setup with a commercial aquaporin membrane and different draw solutions and then in a diffusion cell without cross membrane salt gradient correlations between the change in dbp permeance due to the reverse salt flux and the molecular size or hydrophobicity of dbps were assessed to show the relative importance of steric hindrance and sorption effects on dbp transport lastly the conventional solution diffusion model was modified to incorporate the effects of steric hindrance and sorption induced retarded diffusion to

active layer it exhibits higher water permeability and lower reverse salt flux than the conventional cellulose triacetate membrane for fo xu et al 2018 the performance of this membrane in rejecting organic molecules has been tested for ppcps engelhardt et al 2018 madsen et al 2015 xie et al 2018 and dbps xu et al 2018 a previous study has reported that the transport of organic contaminants was

permeance the values of concentration polarization factor are shown in table s3 2 3 diffusion cell experiments a diffusion cell was used to determine dbp permeance in the absence of the reverse salt flux a membrane coupon contact area 0 79 cm2 was sandwiched between two silicone gaskets the chambers facing the active layer hereafter referred to as the feed reservoir and support layer draw reservoir of the membranes contained 40 ml of the same solution milli q water 0 5 m nacl or 1 0 m nacl i e there was no salt gradient across the membrane both feed and draw reservoirs were continuously mixed by magnetic stirring at a rate of 200 rpm to minimize concentration polarization dbp transport was driven by the dbp concentration difference in the two chambers with initial concentrations 2 mg l 1 and 50 µg l 1 in the feed and draw reservoirs respectively aquaporin membrane coupons were pre soaked for 24 h in the same solution as that used in the subsequent diffusion test over the course of 20 h of the diffusion test 0 6 ml and 0 1 ml samples were periodically withdrawn from the draw and feed reservoirs respectively for dbp analysis the volume of the samples withdrawn for dbp analysis was accounted for during data processing the dbp permeance was calculated by 1 v f t v d t a m v f t v d t ln c f 0 c d 0 c f t c d t b diffusion cell t where bdiffusion

experiment using pure water are shown in figure s2 as an example to evaluate the mechanisms of the effects of reverse salt flux on dbp transport pearson s and spearman s tests were conducted using minitab 19 these tests examined the correlation between the change of dbp permeance by reverse salt flux quantified by the ratio between dbp permeance in fo experiments and that in diffusion cell test

spearman s ρ is a nonparametric monotonic measure of rank correlation between two variables the significance level α was set at 0 05 when p value from these tests are less than 0 05 a significant positive r or ρ 0 or negative r or ρ 0 correlation is present 2 4 dbp sorption test batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the sorption of halogenated dbps to aquaporin membrane and polysulfone beads the material of the aquaporin support layer an aquaporin membrane coupon 0 255 g 35 cm2 or 2 g polysulfone beads were added to 20 ml solutions containing 50 µg l 1 of each halogenated dbp to test the salting out effect sorption tests were conducted in milli q water or 1 m nacl controls were set up with the same dbp concentration and water matrix but without membrane or polysulfone beads aqueous samples were collected at 17 24 and 41 h and analyzed for dbp concentrations dbp sorption was calculated based on a mass balance approach with details shown in text s2 2 5 dbp analysis samples were raised to 30 ml using milli q water prior to solvent extraction for dbp analysis for the analysis of halogenated dbps the 30 ml samples were spiked with the internal standard 1 2 dibromopropane

the literature the γ j l w γ j and γ j values for the support layer of the aquaporin membrane and the four dbps are summarized in table 1 for these four dbps k d b p d i m s l values were calculated using eqs 15 and 16 in order to obtain the setschenow constants k d b p s a l t for these four dbps the surface tension components of 8 nacl solutions 0 1 3 m were determined using their contact

described in 3 2 2 is limited to the availability of pure compounds and involves the handling of highly toxic substances to expand the application of m sd model to the other 9 dbps investigated in this study their partitioning coefficient and setschenow constants were estimated using methods based on their molecular properties ni and yalkowsky 2003 vaes et al 1998 vaes et al 1998 used a

values for the support layer of the aquaporin membrane using eqs 15 and 16 subsequently a multivariate regression model describing the relationship between the molecular properties of the 22 organic

table 2 validating them for estimating the k d b p d i m s l and k d b p s a l t values of the other 9 dbps investigated in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of reverse salt flux on dbp rejection and permeance over the course of the fo experiment the rejection of all dbps by aquaporin membrane exhibited a small initial decline and then stabilized after 150 600 ml of water permeated through the membrane figure s4 for four dbps as examples the stabilized rejection is used in the discussion for the rest of the manuscript fig 2 a shows the rejection of the sixteen dbps under a water flux of 3 0 4 0 l m 2 h 1 with three different compounds nacl mgso4 and glucose as draw solutes for halogenated dbps the rejection was highest when nacl was used as the draw solute followed by glucose and then mgso4 two of the trihalomethanes tcm and dcbm even exhibited negative rejection with mgso4 as the draw solute based on the solution diffusion mechanism xie et al 2018 dbp transport in fo is mainly governed by diffusion and is independent on water flux in cases where water flux was low e g 3 0 l m 2 h 1 with 1 m mgso4 as the draw solution the faster transport of dbp than water would lead to a dbp to water flux ratio equations s1 and s2 greater than the average dbp concentration in the feed solution resulting in a negative rejection equation s3 the dependence of the rejection of halogenated dbps on draw solutes is similar to that previously reported for ppcps i e nacl provided the highest ppcp rejection followed by glucose and mgso4 xie et al 2018 because the three draw solutions imposed a range of reverse salt flux 6 8 35 8 mmol m 2 h 1 our results further support the previous observation that reverse salt flux is an important factor influencing the forward transport of organic solutes xie et al 2012 in contrast most nitrosamines except the smallest compound ndma did not show a substantial difference in rejection when different draw solutes were used fig 2a dbp permeance from the above experiments as well as those from experiments using nacl solutions of different concentrations rejection values shown in fig 2b was calculated to further assess the effects of reverse salt flux on dbp transport fig 3 the five different draw solutions resulted in a range of reverse salt flux 6 8 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 table s4 the permeance of halogenated dbps figs 3a and 3b decreased with the increase of reverse salt flux for example the permeance of tcm and dcan decreased from 1 00 µm s 1 to 0 81 µm s 1 and from 0 76 µm s 1 to 0 66 µm s 1 respectively when reverse salt flux increased from 6 8 to 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 in contrast such a trend was not observed for nitrosamines the permeance of which remained approximately constant across the range of reverse salt flux tested fig 3c previous studies hypothesized that the effect of reverse salt flux can be attributed to the steric hindrance introduced by the draw solute molecules on the forward transport of organic molecules xie et al 2012 in other words one would expect that organic molecules of similar sizes to be impacted by reserve salt flux similarly this however does not apply to our dbp results for example dcan and ndma feature similar molecular radii around 0 259 nm but only dcan showed a decrease in permeance with increasing reverse salt flux the different effects of reverse salt flux on the rejection and permeance between halogenated dbps and nitrosamines despite their similar molecular size suggest that mechanisms beyond the hindrance effect are at play it should be mentioned that convection can also play a role in the transport of organic contaminants xie et al 2014 which can generate confounding factors for the effect of reverse salt flux because varying reverse salt flux is often accompanied with different water fluxes however as shown in table s10 even at the highest water flux 8 1 l m 2 h 1 tested in this study i e maximal convection convection only accounted for less than 10 of total flux for all dbps indicating that its role was overall minor in this study 4 2 mechanistic investigation of the reverse salt flux effects 4 2 1 steric hindrance the steric hindrance for the forward transport of organic molecules can result from the countermovement of draw solute molecules or simply from their presence in the membrane active layer to differentiate these two possibilities experiments were conducted in diffusion cells where there is no movement of draw solute molecules as shown in fig 4 dbp permeance was much lower in nacl solutions than that in pure water the higher the nacl concentration the lower the dbp permeance these results indicate that the presence of nacl in the membrane i e without movement already hinders dbp transport according to the steric hindrance theory draw solutes with similar radii as the membrane effective pore radius could occupy the free space in the membrane active layer and thereby hinder the transport of organic molecules with similar molecular radii scheme s1a in other words for organic molecules smaller than the draw solutes their transport should be less hindered scheme s1b this hypothesis was tested by examining the relationship between the drop in dbp permeance in the presence of draw solutes and the size of dbps fig 5 the decrease in dbp permeance is represented as the ratio of the dbp permeance in fo experiments with various draw solutes to the dbp permeance in diffusion cell experiments with pure water pearson s linear parametric and spearman s monotonic non parametric correlation tests show that the drop in dbp permeance in the presence of draw solutes mgso4 or glucose inversely correlated with the molecular volume of dbps but such a correlation was not observed for nacl these results indicate that the steric hindrance by the larger draw solutes mgso4 or glucose plays an important role in hindering the forward dbp transport in fo but other physicochemical processes may contribute to the hindered dbp transport by the smaller draw solute nacl 4 2 2 retardation of dbp diffusion in the support layer the role of the support layer in the presence of draw solutes on dbp transport has not been previously examined compared with the active layer the support layer has an open structure and hence is not likely to restrict the movement of dbp molecules however it can serve as a sorption media for organic compounds accordingly the relationship between the drop in dbp permeance in the presence of draw solutes and the hydrophobicity of dbps log kow was analyzed fig 6 in contrast to the results observed for molecular volume fig 5 fig 6 shows that the drop in dbp permeance due to the presence of nacl inversely correlated with the log kow of dbps but such a correlation was not observed for mgso4 or glucose this can be rationalized by the larger size of mgso4 and glucose than nacl which results in a dominating steric hindrance effect in the active layer and in the case of glucose the lack of ionic charge to induce the salting out effect in the support layer the wastewater relevant low dbp concentrations 10 20 µg l 1 used in the feed for the fo experiments render it challenging to quantify the amount of dbp in the aquaporin membrane using desorption tests accordingly we conducted sorption experiments in batch systems using aquaporin membrane coupons or polysulfone beads the material of the support layer in milli q water or 1 m nacl solution for halogenated dbps figure s5 in the presence of aquaporin membrane or polysulfone beads dbp concentrations in the aqueous phase declined initially and then reached a plateau by 41 h by when 70 98 and 11 52 of the total dbp mass partitioned into the aquaporin membrane coupon and polysulfone beads respectively higher sorption occurred in 1 m nacl solution than in milli q water among different dbps the extent of sorption on aquaporin membrane or polysulfone beads in milli q water correlated with the partitioning coefficient k d b p d i m s l value of the dbps figures s6a and s6b additionally the enhancement of sorption in 1 m nacl solution compared with that in milli q water correlated with the setschenow constant k d b p s a l t of the dbps figures s6c and s6d supporting the salting out effects overall these results support that sorption of dbps in the support layer especially in the presence of the high concentration of salts can contribute to the retardation of dbp transport in fo 4 3 modelling dbp transport in fo 4 3 1 steric hindrance in the active layer the effective pore radius r p s and the associated dbp permeance through the active layer b a l s are shown in table 3 for four representative dbps as reverse nacl flux increased both r p s and b a l s decreased when reverse nacl flux increased from 0 to 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 r p s decreased from 0 305 to 0 297 nm this seemingly small change in r p s 3 decrease resulted in a substantial decrease in b a l s by 26 38 additionally the decrease in b a l s is more pronounced for larger dbps tbm rdbp 0 271 nm exhibited a greater decrease 38 in b a l s than the other three dbps rdbp 0 256 0 259 nm 26 29 decrease fig 7 simulates the change in b a l s due to the presence of nacl as a function of dbp size showing that the presence of salt has a stronger effect on suppressing the permeance of larger dbps through the active layer beyond dbps this trend may be applicable to other neutral organic molecules with radii smaller than the effective pore radius of the membrane in the presence of draw solutes 4 3 2 retarded diffusion in the support layer the values of the retardation factor rr for all dbps are shown in table 4 for all dbps the higher the reverse nacl flux the greater the value of rr indicating a stronger retardation effect in the support layer additionally the increase in rr accompanied by increasing reverse nacl flux is greater for dbps with higher hydrophobicity for example rr of tbm log kow 2 40 increased by 42 when reverse nacl flux increased from 0 to 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 while ndma log kow 0 64 featured only 7 increase in rr this dependence is consistent with the results observed in fig 6 where a stronger effect of reverse nacl flux was observed on the permeance of dbps with higher hydrophobicity 4 3 3 predicting dbp permeance with the modified solution diffusion model the dbp permeance and rejection determined from fo experiments were compared with those predicted using the conventional solution diffusion sd model or the modified solution diffusion m sd model as shown in fig 8 for all halogenated dbps trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles haloketones the m sd model more accurately predicted dbp permeance and rejection than the sd model and the improved accuracy of the m sd model is more pronounced at higher reverse salt flux the model error calculated by eq 4 was compared between the m sd and sd models for trihalomethanes a group of dbps regulated by u s epa the m sd model predicted their permeance with error of 3 20 at the low reverse nacl flux of 20 9 mmol m 2 h 1 fig 8a better than the sd model 9 30 error at the high reverse nacl flux of 60 3 mmol m 2 h 1 the errors of the m sd and sd models in predicting trihalomethanes permeance were 2 121 and 28 238 fig 8b respectively for haloacetonitriles a group of dbps recently shown to contribute to the majority of the toxicity in recycled wastewater lau et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 the m sd model provided accurate prediction for their permeance 2 13 and 10 25 errors at low and high reverse nacl flux respectively a significant improvement from the sd model 10 22 and 20 91 errors for haloketones the m sd and sd model predicted the permeance with errors of 89 35 and 10 150 respectively at the high reverse nacl flux in contrast for the four nitrosamines the m sd model underestimated their permeance at the high reverse nacl flux the error of the m sd model in predicting permeance was 26 for ndma and 37 94 for the other three nitrosamines fig 8b whereas the error of the sd model was 1 33 for these nitrosamines ndma the smallest nitrosamine with high hydrophilicity log kow 0 64 can possibly be transported through convection but the low contribution of convection to total ndma flux in our experiments 3 table s10 suggests that the prediction error of the m sd model for ndma is attributed to other factors as for the other three nitrosamines the poor performance of the m sd model may be attributed to the large size of these compounds with radius 0 278 0 295 nm close to the effective pore radius r p s of the active layer in the presence of salt as shown in fig 7 the effect of steric hindrance reflected by the ratio of b a l s to b a l d i is extremely sensitive to dbp radii as they approach r p s in reality rather than a uniform pore size r p s the effective pores in the active layer likely feature a range of sizes fang et al 2014 with larger pores available for the transport of large dbps this pore size distribution is not considered in either the m sd or sd model but m sd model is more affected due to the consideration of pore restriction by draw salt in the active layer for halogenated dbps the relative importance of steric hindrance versus retarded diffusion in contributing to the effects of reverse salt flux on dbp permeance is shown in fig 9 for three representative compounds between tcm and dcan with similar molecular sizes rdbp 0 256 0 259 nm the more hydrophobic tcm log kow 1 97 is more affected by retarded diffusion in the support layer than by steric hindrance in the active layer while the less hydrophobic dcan log kow 0 29 is more affected by steric hindrance for dibromochloromethane dbcm a relatively large and hydrophobic dbp steric hindrance and retarded diffusion contributed similarly 4 3 4 model limitations although the m sd model significantly improved the prediction of the permeance of halogenated dbps a few limitations should be acknowledged first the pore size distribution of the active layer is not captured by the use of effective pore radius r p s in the model as a result the m sd model cannot predict the permeance of dbps with radii larger than r p s such as n nitrosopiperidine n nitrosodipropylamine and n nitrosodibutylamine tables 3 and s2 even for dbps with radii smaller than but close to r p s the m sd model significantly underestimated the permeance such as for n nitrosodiethylamine rdbp 0 295 nm figure s7 this limitation however may not be critical for application in wastewater recycling because these large dbps generally have high rejection e g 85 with 1 m nacl as the draw solution fig 2 and have been shown to contribute to relatively low health risks in full scale wastewater recycling operation zeng et al 2016 second the m sd model does not consider the convection process although convection contributed to less than 10 of the total dbp flux across experiments conducted in this study table s10 its role can be substantial at higher water fluxes warranting further consideration in future studies third further improvement of the m sd model may consider the depth heterogeneity of the support layer when determining the effect of retarded diffusion on hydrophobic compounds the polysulfone layer is usually heterogeneous in depth breitbach et al 1991 suggesting that the partitioning coefficient determined from the surface of the support layer may not fully represent the partitioning in the entire support layer because retarded diffusion is particularly important for the more hydrophobic compounds accurate determination of their partitioning coefficients with the support layer is critical for predicting their permeance in the presence of reverse salt flux for example the only three halogenated dbps i e dichlorobromomethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform whose permeance values were not accurately predicted by the m sd model see fig 8 had the highest hydrophobicity among the halogenated dbps tested log kow 2 lastly the m sd model has not incorporated the effects of organic fouling organic fouling can hinder the diffusion of draw solutes from the active layer to the feed solution and therefore elevate draw solute concentrations in the active layer lee et al 2010 as a result the steric hindrance caused by reverse salt flux on dbp transport is expected to be enhanced by the organic fouling future research is needed to systematically evaluate the varying effects of the different types of organic fouling that are relevant to wastewater recycling on the transport of organic contaminants and to incorporate them into transport models 5 conclusion this study evaluated the effects of reverse salt flux on the forward transport of 16 neutral dbps in fo including 9 halogenated dbps 4 trihalomethanes 3 haloacetonitriles and 2 haloketones and 7 nitrosamines using three draw solutes nacl mgso4 and glucose we observed that the higher the reverse salt flux the lower the dbp permeance and hence the higher the dbp rejection by the aquaporin membrane this effect of reverse salt flux was stronger for halogenated dbps than for nitrosamines correlation analysis combining results from fo and diffusion cell experiments showed that the steric hindrance in the active layer contributed to the effects of reverse salt flux for mgso4 and glucose while the retarded diffusion in the support layer played a major role for nacl this study is one of the first attempts to incorporate the effects of reverse salt flux for the forward transport of organic compounds in fo transport models we modified the conventional solution diffusion sd model by incorporating both steric hindrance and retarded diffusion to predict the dbp permeance under low and high reverse salt fluxes the steric hindrance in the active layer was reflected by the effective pore radius r p s after accounting for the free volumes occupied by draw solutes the retardation factor in the support layer was estimated using the partitioning coefficient of dbps between the support layer and water k d b p d i m s l as well as the setschenow constant representing the salting out effect k d b p s a l t our modified sd m sd model predicted the permeance of halogenated dbps better than the conventional sd model specifically the permeance of haloacetonitriles a group of high priority dbps in wastewater recycling was predicted by the m sd model with less than 25 error from the experimental observation steric hindrance is the dominant mechanism for the reverse salt flux effect for large dbps while retarded diffusion contributed more for hydrophobic dbps the m sd model underestimated the permeance of nitrosamines presumably due to the limitation that the m sd model did not consider convection as a transport mechanism for hydrophilic compound or the effective pore size distribution of the membrane active layer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17611,the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents is an emerging concern for environmental scientists and engineers ferrate vi fevio4 2 fevi is a promising oxidant and the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents has been investigated in this study firstly fevi oxidation of selected pharmaceuticals was examined by determining the apparent second order rate constants k app in buffer solutions as a function of ph 5 0 9 5 at ph 8 0 k app of cimetidine famotidine nalidixic acid ronidazole dimetridazole tinidazole and caffeine are 1 6 0 2 103 7 8 0 3 102 2 6 0 4 1 7 0 1 0 9 0 3 0 2 0 1 and 0 1 m 1 s 1 respectively however k app could not be directly employed to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in the effluents due to the inhibited or enhanced effects of effluent organic matters efom therefore an alternative approach of spectroscopic surrogates was investigated since fluorophore was co degraded with pharmaceuticals in the wastewater effluents particularly the humic like fluorescent peak correlated well with the pharmaceutical attenuation the relationship of the reduction of fluorescence and the removal of pharmaceuticals could be described through a universal equation y a 1 x k 1 k w a 2 x k 2 k w a 3 the practical utility of the fluorescence surrogate was validated by applying to field samples monitoring the changes of the fluorescence surrogate provides a promising rapid and inexpensive method for estimating the degradation of pharmaceuticals during fevi treatment of wastewater effluents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate efom pharmaceuticals fluorescence 1 introduction the occurrence and transformation of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environments have gained great attention from environmental scientists and engineers the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment facilities is one of the primary sources of pharmaceuticals due to the incomplete removal by existing biological treatment processes verlicchi et al 2012 costa et al 2019 although only trace levels of pharmaceuticals ng l 1 µg l 1 have been detected in wastewater effluents they still can pose long term potential risks on aquatic ecological systems halling sørensen et al 1998 bunch and bernot 2011 kar and roy 2012 particularly antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes arg being detected in the various aquatic environments have been becoming an emerging health problem sharma et al 2016 chen et al 2019 chlorine a widely used disinfectant could oxidize pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents however it tends to produce potentially toxic disinfection by products such as halomethanes haloacetic acids nitrosodimethylamine zhang et al 2014 therefore advanced oxidation processes aops for pharmaceutical attenuation have been evaluated bu et al 2018 von gunten 2018 huang et al 2020 the application of ozone in wastewater treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals is a promising technology huber et al 2005 wang and chen 2020 in recent years ferrate vi fevio4 2 fevi has received much more attention as an alternate oxidant due to its multi modal functions as disinfectant oxidant and coagulant sharma et al 2015 goodwill et al 2016 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and is the focus of the present study the monitoring of low levels of pharmaceuticals is important to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment technology with the gradual improvement of sewage treatment standards and the development of wastewater reuse the requirements for water quality of sewage treatment facilities are becoming more stringent however continually monitoring the elimination efficiencies of trace amounts of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and pharmaceuticals is impractical laborious and cost prohibitive particularly advanced analytical instruments such as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms are needed therefore sewage treatment facilities are looking for new methods to monitor the removal of pharmaceuticals in conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes one of the monitoring approaches is the use of the indicator compounds which have the potential to decrease the time and cost of the analyzing pharmaceuticals at treatment facilities for instance the removal efficiency of saturated aliphatic substances can be indicated by meprobamate and iopromide dickenson et al 2009 sucralose and caffeine were selected as the surrogates to compare the performance of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 at a full scale water treatment facility because these micropollutants are reactive solely to hydroxyl radical ho and to both ho and reactive chlorine species respectively wang et al 2019 however the application of this method is still limited which depends on the source and variety of wastewater new approaches are still required for monitoring the indicating compounds spectroscopic surrogates may be another useful approach to indirectly monitor the removal efficiency of trace organic contaminants torcs in wastewater treatments dickenson et al 2009 sgroi et al 2017 uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and total fluorescence were used to predict the torcs removal by ozonation gerrity et al 2012 chroma and fluorescence excitation emission spectrum predicting the behavior of torcs in aops also has a good prospect wert et al 2009 nanaboina and korshin 2010 carstea et al 2016 generally natural organic matters noms a combination of soluble microbial products and trace amounts of harmful chemicals are the components of effluent organic matter efom the humic like tyrosine like and tryptophan like peaks were identified in efom using fluorescence excitation and emission spectroscopy matrix eem coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac in the process of oxidant application the fluorescence intensity of these peaks and the content of pharmaceuticals simultaneously reduce based on the correlation between the changes of fluorescence intensity and pharmaceutical attenuation the fluorescent intensities can be employed as surrogates to indirectly monitor the removal of pharmaceuticals ben abdelmelek et al 2011 carstea et al 2016 yan et al 2017 however most of previous studies focused on employing fluorescent surrogates in aops which are mainly radical based oxidation processes comparatively high valent transition metal like fevi is more selective and presents a wide range of reaction rate constants towards torcs fevi oxidation in effluent matrices also involves unique secondary reactive intermediates such fev and feiv and presents high selectivity the chemistry of fevi has significant differences from the involvement of reactive oxygen and sulfur species in aops which promoted us to examine whether fluorescence surrogate can be employed to predict the removal pharmaceuticals in fevi oxidation of wastewater effluents in this paper we present for the first time the fluorescence as a surrogate to monitor the degradation of pharmaceuticals by fevi in our research we noticed a significant deviation in applying kinetics measurements of buffered solutions to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents the efom may greatly influence to cause the deviation from the predicted removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals by fevi an alternative approach is critically needed to evaluate removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents the current study aims to explore whether the fluorescence could be an alternative surrogate to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals during the application of fevi for advanced treatment of wastewater effluents the present paper has following objectives i to determine the rate constants of the reactions between fevi and selected pharmaceuticals as a function of ph 5 0 9 5 to assess the prediction of removal efficiency of a wide range of the target pollutants with varied structures ii to quantify the ability for removal of pharmaceuticals by fevi in wastewater effluents iii to develop a model to correlate the removal of pharmaceuticals by fevi oxidation with the transformation of fluorescence spectroscopy of efom and iv to apply the developed model to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in the field sample waters to validate the reliability of the fluorescence surrogate 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals potassium ferrate k2feo4 90 was prepared using the wet method thompson et al 1951 reagents such as 2 20 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts iron iii nitrate nonahydrate and potassium hydroxide used in the experiments were obtained from tokyo chemical industry tokyo japan sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 and disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china in this study a total 13 pharmaceuticals were selected because of their widespread existence in wastewater effluents and all pharmaceuticals were acquired from sigma aldrich shanghai china or j k scientific beijing china at the highest available purity the isotopically labeled compounds used as internal standards for the lc ms ms analysis were purchased from toronto research chemicals north york on canada the list of 13 pharmaceuticals and the isotopic compounds is given in table s1 of the supporting information si 2 2 the measurement of reaction rate constants of fevi with selected pharmaceuticals the second order reaction rate constants of fevi with carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole diclofenac sulfamethazine trimethoprim and atenolol were obtained from the literature sharma et al 2006 lee et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 anquandah et al 2011 kim et al 2015 the data are given in table 1 the rate constants of fevi with the remaining seven pharmaceuticals were measured under the pseudo first order conditions by monitoring the decay of fevi in the presence of excess pharmaceuticals in the ph range of 5 0 9 5 phosphate buffer 10 0 mm was used in the ph range 5 0 8 5 in the ph range of 8 0 9 5 a mixture of 10 0 mm borate and 10 0 mm phosphate solution was used the concentration of fevi was determined using the abts method in which absorbance at the wavelength of 415 nm was measured lee et al 2005a further experimental details regarding the kinetic measurements are provided in text s1 2 3 3d eem fluorescence experiments and parafac the 3d eem fluorescence measurements were collected using excitation wavelengths from 240 to 550 nm in 1 nm increment and emission wavelengths from 212 to 620 nm using a fluorescence spectrometer aqualog horiba kyoto japan the integration time was 1 0 s the results of 3d eem were processed with inner filter correction and rayleigh scattering elimination the quinine sulfate 1 3 μm was used to normalize the data then parafac was conducted by the matlab using a procedure described in the literature murphy et al 2013 yan et al 2017 the obtained components from parafac analysis for each set of 3d eem spectrum was determined by minimizing the sum of squared residuals the model was validated with the core consistency diagnostic provided in the n way toolbox and split half analysis finally the fluorescence intensity at the maximum of each component was used as a specific fluorescence index for the next data processing 2 4 oxidation of selected pharmaceuticals in an effluent matrix by fevi the removal experiments of 13 pharmaceuticals by fevi were conducted in a typical secondary effluent taken from a municipal sewage facility located in jiangsu province china the domestic sewage at this facility is treated by a circulatory activated sludge treatment system the post chlorinated wastewater effluent was collected in acid cleaned plastic containers and transported to the laboratory within 2 h for performing the experiments the collected effluent was immediately filtered through an acid cleaned membrane 0 22 μm to remove free bacteria and solids and subsequently stored at 4 c in the experiments a mixing of 13 pharmaceutical standards was spiked into the effluent 200 ml to yield an initial concentration of 1 0 μg l 1 that mimic their environmental concentrations halling sørensen et al 1998 kolpin et al 2002 kanakaraju et al 2018 stock solutions of fevi 4 5 5 0 mol l 1 were always prepared freshly by dissolving solid samples of k2feo4 in 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate buffer ph 9 1 a certain amount of fevi stock solution was added into the effluent to obtain an initial fevi concentration of 6 1 6 7 mg fe l 1 108 120 μmol l 1 samples of 1 0 ml were withdrawn periodically and immediately transferred to the abts solution to determine the concentration of fevi a 5 0 ml sample was quenched by na2s2o3 solution ten times more molar concentration than that of fevi feng et al 2018 to perform fluorescence measurements aqualog horriba japan and analyzed by parafac in addition the effect of ph on the model were investigated and the effluent was adjusted by 10 0 mm bicarbonate or 10 0 mm borate buffer all experiments were performed in triplicates 2 5 determination of pharmaceuticals by online solid phase extraction spe lc ms ms an automated online spe coupled to a lc ms ms agilent 1290 6430 with flex cube module santa clara ca was used to analyze the trace levels of pharmaceuticals lian et al 2017 yan et al 2017 briefly a 2 position 10 port valve with two trapping columns plrp s agilent was employed to achieve on line spe a 900 μl sample was withdrawn and injected into one of the two online spe columns with 5 7 ml h2o by using a lc pump then the valve was switched to the position that coupled the spe column with the analysis column c18 column poroshell 120 ec 2 1 50 mm in which the analytes were eluted from the spe column in the back flush mode the details of ms and gradient elution parameters are presented in table s1 table s3 and table s4 2 6 field samples for fluorescence surrogate test five field samples were collected from qingshui river huangpu river a lake in fudan jiangwan campus suzhou river a the upper stream of suzhou river and suzhou river b the middle reaches of suzhou river which are all located in shanghai china these sites were dominated by wastewater effluents and further employed to verify the practicability of the fluorescence surrogates the water quality parameters are provided in table s2 the eem fluorescence of field samples was monitored to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in the fevi treatment process the attenuation of pharmaceuticals was also monitored by the above mentioned online spe lc ms ms method 3 results and discussion 3 1 the measurement of reaction rate constants of selected pharmaceuticals with fevi the rate constants of 7 pharmaceuticals were derived from the decay kinetics of fevi under the condition of fevi ppcp in the ph range of 5 0 9 5 fig 1 demonstrates that the values of k app decreased with an increase in ph the ph effect on the k app of pharmaceuticals may be explained by considering the equilibrium species of fevi and pharmaceuticals x in the studied ph range the values of pk a of each pharmaceutical are in the range from 0 6 8 4 caffeine dimetridazole tinidazole nalidixic acid ronidazole cimetidine and famotidine and pk a of fevi is 7 23 therefore the ph dependence of k app for each ppcp could be expressed by eq 1 1 d hx dt k app f e vi tot hx tot i 1 2 j 1 2 k ij α i β j f e vi tot hx tot where fevi hfeo 4 feo 4 2 hx tot hx x α i and β j represent the fraction of fevi and selected ppcp respectively k ij represent species specific rate constants the concentration of fevi is mainly from the concentrations of hfeo4 and feo4 2 species the distribution of species under varied ph conditions is shown in fig s3 the values of k ij are obtained by nonlinear regression of the data through matlab r2016a details of the calculations are given in text s3 fig 1 shows the rate constants of the reactions of caffeine dimetridazole tinidazole nalidixic acid and ronidazole with fevi which are below 1 0 101 m 1 s 1 suggesting a minimum effect of ph if any in our study the k app values of cimetidine and famotidine show the large variation with ph it is likely due to 1 their pka values are close to that of hfeo4 2 the species of cimetidine and famotidine present significantly different reaction rate constants toward fevi species with the determined species specific rate constants in the table 1 the fitting of ph dependent data in this study reflects the interaction of fevi species hfeo4 and feo4 2 with pharmaceutical acid base species the k app values of ronidazole dimetridazole tinidazole and caffeine mainly depend on the fraction of the hfeo4 species as a function of ph meanwhile the contribution of feo4 2 is trivial the reaction rate constants of hfeo4 with protonated species are greater than the deprotonated species likely due to the electrostatic interaction between fevi and pharmaceuticals species sharma et al 2006 the k app of cimetidine 1 6 103 m 1 s 1 and famotidine 7 8 102 m 1 s 1 present the greatest reactivities with fevi among the selected pharmaceuticals as illustrated in table 1 it is due to that the electro rich moieties including amino groups and sulfur groups present in their molecular structures which agrees well with previous studies hu et al 2009 jiang et al 2013 the group of dimetridazole tinidazole and ronidazole belonging to nitroimidazole drugs presented the lowest reactivities with fevi it may be due to the presence of strong electron withdrawing nitro groups which could reduce the electron density on the aromatic dazole ring smithen and hardy 1982 3 2 kinetic prediction on the removal of pharmaceuticals in the effluent by fevi exposure trace amount of 13 selected pharmaceuticals 1 0 μg l 1 for each were spiked in the wastewater effluent and exposed to fevi at the dose of 6 4 mg fe l 1 more than 95 of sulfamethoxazole sulfamerazine diclofenac carbamazepine famotidine cimetidine and trimethoprim were eliminated within 1 0 min in the case of atenolol nalidixic acid dimetridazole caffeine ronidazole and tinidazole 60 min was necessary to obtain an elimination of more than 70 to observe the degradation behavior of sulfamethoxazole sulfamerazine diclofenac carbamazepine famotidine cimetidine and trimethoprim in the effluent a low fevi dose 1 1 mg fe l 1 was employed however famotidine and cimetidine were completely removed in less than 1 0 min even at such low fevi dose the prediction of the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals by fevi in wastewater effluents may be determined by eq 2 lee et al 2005b 2 c t c 0 exp k app t 0 f e vi dt c c 0 is the residual ratio of pharmaceuticals k app is the second order rate constant for the reaction with fevi table s5 and 0 t f e vi represents the fevi exposure integrating the concentration of fevi from zero to time t fig s4 the degradation of atenolol diclofenac and carbamazepine could be well predicted using eq 2 however the degradation rates of sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine are significantly slower than the predicted values fig 2 the inhibited effects of efom in wastewater effluent may cause this deviation from the predicted degradation rates the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine by fevi could yield the radical cation intermediates feng et al 2019 which could further react with the electron donating moieties in efom to yield back sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine similar inhibited effects of humic acid have also been observed for aniline degradation sun et al 2018 the degradation rates of remaining pharmaceuticals including nalidixic acid trimethoprim ronidazole dimetridazole tinidazole and caffeine have been underestimated by eq 2 the results of atenolol and tinidazole are presented in fig 2 fig s5 gives the measured and predicted degradation rates of other pharmaceuticals previous studies also reported that the degradation rates of certain pharmaceuticals were greater than the predicted values in the wastewater matrices lee et al 2005a lee et al 2009 the enhanced elimination of pharmaceuticals may be due to the fact that the intermediate fev or feiv species were formed by the reaction of fevi with reducing moieties of efom in effluents which are about 2 4 orders of magnitude more reactive than fevi sharma et al 2008 the fev and feiv species may be involved in the pharmaceutical attenuation in the effluents the inaccurate predictions by fevi exposure eq 2 suggest that the reaction rate constants of fevi with pharmaceuticals could not be directly employed to calculate the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents significantly the contribution of fev and feiv species to the removal of pharmaceuticals cannot be ignored however it is challenging to quantify the contributions of fev and fe iv species in pharmaceutical removal furthermore the roles of reducing substances present in effluents were unclear accordingly surrogates are proposed to model the fevi oxidation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents and discussed in the next section 3 3 transformation of the fluorescence spectra of effluent by fevi oxidation during the monitoring of pharmaceutical attenuation in the effluent by fevi oxidation a progressive alteration in the fluorescence spectra was also observed the examples of eem spectra at various fevi exposure are demonstrated in fig 3 a c to investigate the transformation of specific fluorescence peaks parafac was applied to analyze the fluorescence eem spectra of effluents the parafac algorithm is implemented by alternating least squares als algorithm the goal of which is to minimize the sum of squared residuals ssrs residual analysis can estimate the suitable number of components in the process of the examination of split half validation function the positions of the fluorescence maxima obtained by parallel factor analysis were located at λex λem 275 310 nm λex λem 285 350 nm and λex λem 315 440 nm respectively these peaks identified from the profile of eem spectra are named as tyrosine like peak tryptophan like peak and humic like peak respectively chen et al 2003 esparza soto et al 2011 yang et al 2015 the reduction of fluorescence intensities vs fevi exposure is evaluated and demonstrated in fig 3d the removal of humic like peak is significantly faster than that of the tryptophan like peak however tyrosine like peak kept constant with the increasing fevi exposure unlike that pharmaceutical degradation by the first order decay with fevi exposure in the effluent the losses of the humic like and tryptophan like peak don t exhibit simple single first order decay the behaviors agree well with the fact that the efom is a heterogeneous mixture of aliphatic and aromatic organic compounds containing numerous functional groups therefore multiple exponential decays are applied to fit the decay curves as shown in eq 3 3 y a 1 e k 1 t 0 f e vi dt a 2 e k 2 t 0 f e vi dt a 3 as eq 3 illustrated the fluorescent components can be divided into three parts both a1 and a2 undergo first order decays with different decay rates and a3 can be defined as the inert part k 1 fast decay and k 2 slow decay are assumed to be the apparent reaction rate constants of a1 and a2 with fevi the calculation process of the above parameters is shown in text s4 as aforementioned fevi tends to oxidize the electron rich moieties it is reasonable to presume that the humic like and tryptophan like substances with higher aromaticity are much easier oxidized than the tyrosine like component based on the change in fluorophore in effluent the fluorescence peaks acted as the surrogates for predicting the pharmaceutical degradation since the fluorescent components have been co degraded with pharmaceuticals in the effluent in aops the change of total fluorescence δtf has been applied to predict the removal of torcs and empirical correlations have been established gerrity et al 2012 park et al 2017 comparatively fevi presents high selectivity toward fluorescent components in the aops all three fluorescence components simultaneously decreased due to the non selective ho oxidation ben abdelmelek et al 2011 the fluorescence surrogate could also be applied in powdered activated carbon processes ziska et al 2016 3 4 modeling the relationship between the change of fluorescence and the removal of pharmaceuticals as shown in fig 2 and fig s5 the removal of pharmaceuticals in the effluent can be expressed as eq 4 4 c t c 0 exp k w t 0 f e vi dt it should be noted that k w is the apparent reaction rate constants of fevi with pharmaceuticals in the effluents which are quite different from k app in eq 1 in buffer solutions the values of k w are presented in fig s8 as illustrated in eqs 3 and 4 fevi exposure could act as an intermediate variable relating to both the pharmaceutical and fluorescence removal in the combination of eqs 3 and 4 the relationship between the fluorescence attenuation and the pharmaceutical removal is then expressed as eq 5 5 y a 1 x k 1 k w a 2 x k 2 k w a 3 y is the residual ratio of the change of fluorescence intensity and x is the residual ratio of individual ppcp the calculation procedures and results of all the parameters of eq 5 are presented in text s5 and table s6 respectively up to 140 mg l 1 min of fevi expose the reduction of fluorescent peaks presents apparently diverse varieties tyrosine like peak keeps constant tryptophan like peak reduces about 40 meanwhile humic like peak presents the greatest reduction 70 removal among three fluorescent peaks it suggested that the humic like fluorescent peak can be a potential surrogate to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals the predicted models of the removal of atenolol tinidazole sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine regarding humic like fluorescence are presented in fig 4 and the remaining pharmaceuticals can be found in fig s9 the high coefficients r 2 0 90 of the prediction have been obtained for all tested pharmaceuticals implying that the humic like fluorescence can replace fevi exposure to predict the pharmaceutical removal as expected tryptophan like peak could also be a surrogate to predict the fevi oxidation of pharmaceuticals in the effluents and the results are shown in fig s10 nevertheless we proposed that the humic like fluorescence is more suitable for surrogate than tryptophan like peak since 1 humic like peak presented a greater reduction than tryptophan like peak during fevi oxidation 2 humic like peak was originated from residual noms which would stand for steady concentration and not likely been impacted by wastewater treatment processes thurman 1985 however the tryptophan like fluorescence i e protein like substance is mainly contributed from the microbial processes and often used to as an indicator of the biological biomass in wastewater effluent chen et al 2003 cai et al 2020 it fluctuates depending on the biological treatment efficiency leading to the improperly predicted results therefore monitoring the humic like fluorescence may be a suitable indicator for evaluating the attenuation of pharmaceuticals in fevi oxidation processes modeling of pharmaceuticals and humic like fluorescence presented a good correlation indicating that humic like fluorescence may be degraded simultaneously with the oxidation of pharmaceuticals as mentioned previously the humic component is a heterogeneous mixture containing various functional groups e g carboxyl thiol and amine hsu and hatcher 2006 the groups presented in the humic like fluorescence exist different reactivities toward fevi a similar degradation mechanism may exist between the humic component of the efom and pharmaceuticals which contain numerous functional moieties previous studies have developed fluorescence surrogate models to predict the removal of torcs by ozonation both linear correlation gerrity et al 2012 and exponential correlation park et al 2017 exhibited a reasonably good prediction of torcs attenuation the models developed in ozone and other aops are slightly different from the one in this study significantly fluorophores selectively react with fevi to yield multiple exponential decays however clarifying the mechanisms of the relationship between fluorophores and pharmaceuticals needs additional experiments due to fluorophores complex in chemical structures nevertheless the fluorescence could be an alternative surrogate to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals during the application of fevi for advanced treatment of wastewater effluents 3 5 influence of ph the ph effects on the fluorescence surrogate to predict pharmaceutical removal was investigated in the typical ph range of effluents ph 7 0 to 9 0 the attenuation of the humic like peak increases with the decreasing ph it is accordant with the previous studies that applied dissolved organic carbon doc graham et al 2010 and uv254 lim and kim 2009 as surrogates to monitor the removal of noms by fevi under varied ph conditions the changes of humic like peak with varied ph in the fevi oxidation process are likely due to the ratio change of the active hfeo4 species toward total fevi species under varied ph conditions kamachi et al 2005 the decay curves could still be fitted using eq 3 fig s11 of si the parameters of the predicted model in different ph are given in table s7 the correlation of k parameters with ph is shown in fig 5 a the values of k 1 decreased by one order magnitude from ph 7 0 to 9 0 comparatively the values of k 2 varied almost three orders of magnitudes from 10 1 to 102 flu 1 s 1 fig 5b presents the apparent reaction rate constants k w of fevi with pharmaceuticals in the effluent with varying ph the similar tendency as k 1 from humic like fluorescence is also observed fig 5c it indicated that the ph effect on the prediction will be minor and the deviation from the model might be due to the fluctuation of the k 2 k w value fig 5d in our previous study we employed the similar equation to simulate the transformation of fluorescence versus pharmaceuticals removal in wastewater effluent under solar irradiation yan et al 2017 however the ph effect was not observed since the distribution of reactive radicals in the photochemical process is not affected by ph blough and zepp 1995 the values of k 2 k w fluctuate within one order of magnitude from ph 7 0 to ph 9 0 leading to slight underestimating the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals if the eq 5 developed from ph 7 9 is employed for the effluent at ph 9 0 furthermore considering the diverse ph of effluents it is necessary to optimize the parameters of the fitting model however there is no suitable model to fit the values of k 1 and k 2 at different ph since the efom is a complicated mixture the interpolation method has been employed to determine the values of k 1 k 2 and k w under varied ph conditions which could improve the accuracy of the prediction for field samples 3 6 testing the fluorescence surrogate in field samples field samples were employed to investigate the accuracy of fluorescence surrogate in predicting the removal of pharmaceuticals nine pharmaceuticals have been detected in the field samples table s8 the pharmaceutical attenuation was observed at three fevi exposure doses i e low exposure dose 26 0 38 8 mg fe l 1 min medium exposure dose 100 140 mg fe l 1 min and high exposure dose 200 213 mg fe l 1 min fig 6 demonstrated that trimethoprim carbamazepine and diclofenac achieved an elimination of 95 at a low fevi exposure 26 0 38 8 mg fe l 1 min for the other pharmaceuticals such as caffeine nalidixic acid and atenolol an exposure of 100 140 mg fevi l 1 min was necessary to obtain an elimination of 80 indicating that the relatively high fevi exposure 1 3 mg fevi per mgc and the exposure time 30 min is necessary to achieve a significant elimination of pharmaceuticals in effluents the similar fevi exposure doses had also been applied to removal of micropollutants in wastewater effluent lee et al 2009 jiang et al 2013 the fevi exposure dose and k w were initially employed to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals as demonstrated in fig s13 the results showed that the combination of fevi exposure dose and k w may not precisely predict the removal of pharmaceutical possibly due to the varied k w in the differential field samples furthermore the predicted removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in field samples obtained from eq 5 are correlated with the measured results as illustrated in fig 6a the removal efficiency of caffeine atenolol nalidixic acid and dimetridazole in the field samples was underestimated likely due to the ph effects the original fitting eq 5 was developed under ph 7 9 whereas ph of the field samples was slightly higher than ph 7 9 therefore the parameters in eq 5 were modified based on the results from fig 5 after the ph adjustment the accuracy of predicted results is improved as shown in fig 6b the predicted results match well with experimental results for most of the pharmaceuticals 10 except that the removal of trimethoprim and carbamazepine in several field samples were out of the predicting range it indicated that the diverse efom could also present slightly different enhanced inhibited effects for fevi oxidation of pharmaceuticals and water matrices maybe alter the fevi oxidation processes feng et al 2016 deng et al 2018 in addition the model presented in this study is an initial estimation of the behaviors of efom fluorophores and pharmaceuticals in fevi oxidation and additional studies are needed to explore the validation of fluorophore as a surrogate in different water matrices 4 conclusions overall the inhibited or enhanced effects of efom on pharmaceuticals elimination were observed in fevi treatment of wastewater effluents suggesting that the fevi exposure and its reaction rate constants with pharmaceuticals cannot be directly used in the prediction of the pharmaceutical removal therefore the surrogate can be an alternative method to predict the pharmaceutical removal upon fevi treatment the fluorescence of the effluents changed following with the pharmaceutical degradation among three fluorescence peaks the humic like peak presented the greatest elimination and the decay curve with fevi exposure was fitted by a multiple exponential decay furthermore a novel correlation model was established a general formula was created for each pharmaceutical and can be expressed as y a 1 x k 1 k w a 2 x k 2 k w a 3 the strong correlation between the removal of humic like peak and pharmaceuticals illustrated that the humic like fluorescence appears to be an effective surrogate for monitoring pharmaceutical removal during fevi treatment the ph effects on the accuracy of prediction are minor and the predicted deviation of the model might be attributed from the variation of the k 2 k w value field test further prove that the humic like fluorescence can be a practicable surrogate to predict pharmaceutical removal in addition the direct definition of humic like fluorescence based on its ex em wavelength could be a simple approach to monitor the transformation of fluorophore and could be easily employed into an online monitoring system it provides a promising rapid and inexpensive method for estimating the degradation of pharmaceuticals during fevi treatment of wastewater effluents however the potential interference from other fluorophores may be further considered during the application of fluorescence surrogates moreover the compositions of humic like fluorophore in differential wastewater effluents could be varied significantly which could alter the kinetic parameters of fevi oxidation of humic like fluorophore this uncertainty should be further considered in overall prediction using the fluorescence measurements finally great attention should be paid to the impact of water parameters on the prediction accuracy the coexisting constituents such as inorganic ions and metal cations could also affect the accuracy of prediction therefore a thorough evaluation of this model is needed in any further field tests declaration of competing

17611,the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents is an emerging concern for environmental scientists and engineers ferrate vi fevio4 2 fevi is a promising oxidant and the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents has been investigated in this study firstly fevi oxidation of selected pharmaceuticals was examined by determining the apparent second order rate constants k app in buffer solutions as a function of ph 5 0 9 5 at ph 8 0 k app of cimetidine famotidine nalidixic acid ronidazole dimetridazole tinidazole and caffeine are 1 6 0 2 103 7 8 0 3 102 2 6 0 4 1 7 0 1 0 9 0 3 0 2 0 1 and 0 1 m 1 s 1 respectively however k app could not be directly employed to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in the effluents due to the inhibited or enhanced effects of effluent organic matters efom therefore an alternative approach of spectroscopic surrogates was investigated since fluorophore was co degraded with pharmaceuticals in the wastewater effluents particularly the humic like fluorescent peak correlated well with the pharmaceutical attenuation the relationship of the reduction of fluorescence and the removal of pharmaceuticals could be described through a universal equation y a 1 x k 1 k w a 2 x k 2 k w a 3 the practical utility of the fluorescence surrogate was validated by applying to field samples monitoring the changes of the fluorescence surrogate provides a promising rapid and inexpensive method for estimating the degradation of pharmaceuticals during fevi treatment of wastewater effluents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate efom pharmaceuticals fluorescence 1 introduction the occurrence and transformation of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environments have gained great attention from environmental scientists and engineers the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment facilities is one of the primary sources of pharmaceuticals due to the incomplete removal by existing biological treatment processes verlicchi et al 2012 costa et al 2019 although only trace levels of pharmaceuticals ng l 1 µg l 1 have been detected in wastewater effluents they still can pose long term potential risks on aquatic ecological systems halling sørensen et al 1998 bunch and bernot 2011 kar and roy 2012 particularly antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes arg being detected in the various aquatic environments have been becoming an emerging health problem sharma et al 2016 chen et al 2019 chlorine a widely used disinfectant could oxidize pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents however it tends to produce potentially toxic disinfection by products such as halomethanes haloacetic acids nitrosodimethylamine zhang et al 2014 therefore advanced oxidation processes aops for pharmaceutical attenuation have been evaluated bu et al 2018 von gunten 2018 huang et al 2020 the application of ozone in wastewater treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals is a promising technology huber et al 2005 wang and chen 2020 in recent years ferrate vi fevio4 2 fevi has received much more attention as an alternate oxidant due to its multi modal functions as disinfectant oxidant and coagulant sharma et al 2015 goodwill et al 2016 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and is the focus of the present study the monitoring of low levels of pharmaceuticals is important to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment technology with the gradual improvement of sewage treatment standards and the development of wastewater reuse the requirements for water quality of sewage treatment facilities are becoming more stringent however continually monitoring the elimination efficiencies of trace amounts of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and pharmaceuticals is impractical laborious and cost prohibitive particularly advanced analytical instruments such as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms are needed therefore sewage treatment facilities are looking for new methods to monitor the removal of pharmaceuticals in conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes one of the monitoring approaches is the use of the indicator compounds which have the potential to decrease the time and cost of the analyzing pharmaceuticals at treatment facilities for instance the removal efficiency of saturated aliphatic substances can be indicated by meprobamate and iopromide dickenson et al 2009 sucralose and caffeine were selected as the surrogates to compare the performance of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 at a full scale water treatment facility because these micropollutants are reactive solely to hydroxyl radical ho and to both ho and reactive chlorine species respectively wang et al 2019 however the application of this method is still limited which depends on the source and variety of wastewater new approaches are still required for monitoring the indicating compounds spectroscopic surrogates may be another useful approach to indirectly monitor the removal efficiency of trace organic contaminants torcs in wastewater treatments dickenson et al 2009 sgroi et al 2017 uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and total fluorescence were used to predict the torcs removal by ozonation gerrity et al 2012 chroma and fluorescence excitation emission spectrum predicting the behavior of torcs in aops also has a good prospect wert et al 2009 nanaboina and korshin 2010 carstea et al 2016 generally natural organic matters noms a combination of soluble microbial products and trace amounts of harmful chemicals are the components of effluent organic matter efom the humic like tyrosine like and tryptophan like peaks were identified in efom using fluorescence excitation and emission spectroscopy matrix eem coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac in the process of oxidant application the fluorescence intensity of these peaks and the content of pharmaceuticals simultaneously reduce based on the correlation between the changes of fluorescence intensity and pharmaceutical attenuation the fluorescent intensities can be employed as surrogates to indirectly monitor the removal of pharmaceuticals ben abdelmelek et al 2011 carstea et al 2016 yan et al 2017 however most of previous studies focused on employing fluorescent surrogates in aops which are mainly radical based oxidation processes comparatively high valent transition metal like fevi is more selective and presents a wide range of reaction rate constants towards torcs fevi oxidation in effluent matrices also involves unique secondary reactive intermediates such fev and feiv and presents high selectivity the chemistry of fevi has significant differences from the involvement of reactive oxygen and sulfur species in aops which promoted us to examine whether fluorescence surrogate can be employed to predict the removal pharmaceuticals in fevi oxidation of wastewater effluents in this paper we present for the first time the fluorescence as a surrogate to monitor the degradation of pharmaceuticals by fevi in our research we noticed a significant deviation in applying kinetics measurements of buffered solutions to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents the efom may greatly influence to cause the deviation from the predicted removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals by fevi an alternative approach is critically needed to evaluate removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents the current study aims to explore whether the fluorescence could be an alternative surrogate to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals during the application of fevi for advanced treatment of wastewater effluents the present paper has following objectives i to determine the rate constants of the reactions between fevi and selected pharmaceuticals as a function of ph 5 0 9 5 to assess the prediction of removal efficiency of a wide range of the target pollutants with varied structures ii to quantify the ability for removal of pharmaceuticals by fevi in wastewater effluents iii to develop a model to correlate the removal of pharmaceuticals by fevi oxidation with the transformation of fluorescence spectroscopy of efom and iv to apply the developed model to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in the field sample waters to validate the reliability of the fluorescence surrogate 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals potassium ferrate k2feo4 90 was prepared using the wet method thompson et al 1951 reagents such as 2 20 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts iron iii nitrate nonahydrate and potassium hydroxide used in the experiments were obtained from tokyo chemical industry tokyo japan sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 and disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china in this study a total 13 pharmaceuticals were selected because of their widespread existence in wastewater effluents and all pharmaceuticals were acquired from sigma aldrich shanghai china or j k scientific beijing china at the highest available purity the isotopically labeled compounds used as internal standards for the lc ms ms analysis were purchased from toronto research chemicals north york on canada the list of 13 pharmaceuticals and the isotopic compounds is given in table s1 of the supporting information si 2 2 the measurement of reaction rate constants of fevi with selected pharmaceuticals the second order reaction rate constants of fevi with carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole diclofenac sulfamethazine trimethoprim and atenolol were obtained from the literature sharma et al 2006 lee et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 anquandah et al 2011 kim et al 2015 the data are given in table 1 the rate constants of fevi with the remaining seven pharmaceuticals were measured under the pseudo first order conditions by monitoring the decay of fevi in the presence of excess pharmaceuticals in the ph range of 5 0 9 5 phosphate buffer 10 0 mm was used in the ph range 5 0 8 5 in the ph range of 8 0 9 5 a mixture of 10 0 mm borate and 10 0 mm phosphate solution was used the concentration of fevi was determined using the abts method in which absorbance at the wavelength of 415 nm was measured lee et al 2005a further experimental details regarding the kinetic measurements are provided in text s1 2 3 3d eem fluorescence experiments and parafac the 3d eem fluorescence measurements were collected using excitation wavelengths from 240 to 550 nm in 1 nm increment and emission wavelengths from 212 to 620 nm using a fluorescence spectrometer aqualog horiba kyoto japan the integration time was 1 0 s the results of 3d eem were processed with inner filter correction and rayleigh scattering elimination the quinine sulfate 1 3 μm was used to normalize the data then parafac was conducted by the matlab using a procedure described in the literature murphy et al 2013 yan et al 2017 the obtained components from parafac analysis for each set of 3d eem spectrum was determined by minimizing the sum of squared residuals the model was validated with the core consistency diagnostic provided in the n way toolbox and split half analysis finally the fluorescence intensity at the maximum of each component was used as a specific fluorescence index for the next data processing 2 4 oxidation of selected pharmaceuticals in an effluent matrix by fevi the removal experiments of 13 pharmaceuticals by fevi were conducted in a typical secondary effluent taken from a municipal sewage facility located in jiangsu province china the domestic sewage at this facility is treated by a circulatory activated sludge treatment system the post chlorinated wastewater effluent was collected in acid cleaned plastic containers and transported to the laboratory within 2 h for performing the experiments the collected effluent was immediately filtered through an acid cleaned membrane 0 22 μm to remove free bacteria and solids and subsequently stored at 4 c in the experiments a mixing of 13 pharmaceutical standards was spiked into the effluent 200 ml to yield an initial concentration of 1 0 μg l 1 that mimic their environmental concentrations halling sørensen et al 1998 kolpin et al 2002 kanakaraju et al 2018 stock solutions of fevi 4 5 5 0 mol l 1 were always prepared freshly by dissolving solid samples of k2feo4 in 5 mm na2hpo4 1 mm borate buffer ph 9 1 a certain amount of fevi stock solution was added into the effluent to obtain an initial fevi concentration of 6 1 6 7 mg fe l 1 108 120 μmol l 1 samples of 1 0 ml were withdrawn periodically and immediately transferred to the abts solution to determine the concentration of fevi a 5 0 ml sample was quenched by na2s2o3 solution ten times more molar concentration than that of fevi feng et al 2018 to perform fluorescence measurements aqualog horriba japan and analyzed by parafac in addition the effect of ph on the model were investigated and the effluent was adjusted by 10 0 mm bicarbonate or 10 0 mm borate buffer all experiments were performed in triplicates 2 5 determination of pharmaceuticals by online solid phase extraction spe lc ms ms an automated online spe coupled to a lc ms ms agilent 1290 6430 with flex cube module santa clara ca was used to analyze the trace levels of pharmaceuticals lian et al 2017 yan et al 2017 briefly a 2 position 10 port valve with two trapping columns plrp s agilent was employed to achieve on line spe a 900 μl sample was withdrawn and injected into one of the two online spe columns with 5 7 ml h2o by using a lc pump then the valve was switched to the position that coupled the spe column with the analysis column c18 column poroshell 120 ec 2 1 50 mm in which the analytes were eluted from the spe column in the back flush mode the details of ms and gradient elution parameters are presented in table s1 table s3 and table s4 2 6 field samples for fluorescence surrogate test five field samples were collected from qingshui river huangpu river a lake in fudan jiangwan campus suzhou river a the upper stream of suzhou river and suzhou river b the middle reaches of suzhou river which are all located in shanghai china these sites were dominated by wastewater effluents and further employed to verify the practicability of the fluorescence surrogates the water quality parameters are provided in table s2 the eem fluorescence of field samples was monitored to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals in the fevi treatment process the attenuation of pharmaceuticals was also monitored by the above mentioned online spe lc ms ms method 3 results and discussion 3 1 the measurement of reaction rate constants of selected pharmaceuticals with fevi the rate constants of 7 pharmaceuticals were derived from the decay kinetics of fevi under the condition of fevi ppcp in the ph range of 5 0 9 5 fig 1 demonstrates that the values of k app decreased with an increase in ph the ph effect on the k app of pharmaceuticals may be explained by considering the equilibrium species of fevi and pharmaceuticals x in the studied ph range the values of pk a of each pharmaceutical are in the range from 0 6 8 4 caffeine dimetridazole tinidazole nalidixic acid ronidazole cimetidine and famotidine and pk a of fevi is 7 23 therefore the ph dependence of k app for each ppcp could be expressed by eq 1 1 d hx dt k app f e vi tot hx tot i 1 2 j 1 2 k ij α i β j f e vi tot hx tot where fevi hfeo 4 feo 4 2 hx tot hx x α i and β j represent the fraction of fevi and selected ppcp respectively k ij represent species specific rate constants the concentration of fevi is mainly from the concentrations of hfeo4 and feo4 2 species the distribution of species under varied ph conditions is shown in fig s3 the values of k ij are obtained by nonlinear regression of the data through matlab r2016a details of the calculations are given in text s3 fig 1 shows the rate constants of the reactions of caffeine dimetridazole tinidazole nalidixic acid and ronidazole with fevi which are below 1 0 101 m 1 s 1 suggesting a minimum effect of ph if any in our study the k app values of cimetidine and famotidine show the large variation with ph it is likely due to 1 their pka values are close to that of hfeo4 2 the species of cimetidine and famotidine present significantly different reaction rate constants toward fevi species with the determined species specific rate constants in the table 1 the fitting of ph dependent data in this study reflects the interaction of fevi species hfeo4 and feo4 2 with pharmaceutical acid base species the k app values of ronidazole dimetridazole tinidazole and caffeine mainly depend on the fraction of the hfeo4 species as a function of ph meanwhile the contribution of feo4 2 is trivial the reaction rate constants of hfeo4 with protonated species are greater than the deprotonated species likely due to the electrostatic interaction between fevi and pharmaceuticals species sharma et al 2006 the k app of cimetidine 1 6 103 m 1 s 1 and famotidine 7 8 102 m 1 s 1 present the greatest reactivities with fevi among the selected pharmaceuticals as illustrated in table 1 it is due to that the electro rich moieties including amino groups and sulfur groups present in their molecular structures which agrees well with previous studies hu et al 2009 jiang et al 2013 the group of dimetridazole tinidazole and ronidazole belonging to nitroimidazole drugs presented the lowest reactivities with fevi it may be due to the presence of strong electron withdrawing nitro groups which could reduce the electron density on the aromatic dazole ring smithen and hardy 1982 3 2 kinetic prediction on the removal of pharmaceuticals in the effluent by fevi exposure trace amount of 13 selected pharmaceuticals 1 0 μg l 1 for each were spiked in the wastewater effluent and exposed to fevi at the dose of 6 4 mg fe l 1 more than 95 of sulfamethoxazole sulfamerazine diclofenac carbamazepine famotidine cimetidine and trimethoprim were eliminated within 1 0 min in the case of atenolol nalidixic acid dimetridazole caffeine ronidazole and tinidazole 60 min was necessary to obtain an elimination of more than 70 to observe the degradation behavior of sulfamethoxazole sulfamerazine diclofenac carbamazepine famotidine cimetidine and trimethoprim in the effluent a low fevi dose 1 1 mg fe l 1 was employed however famotidine and cimetidine were completely removed in less than 1 0 min even at such low fevi dose the prediction of the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals by fevi in wastewater effluents may be determined by eq 2 lee et al 2005b 2 c t c 0 exp k app t 0 f e vi dt c c 0 is the residual ratio of pharmaceuticals k app is the second order rate constant for the reaction with fevi table s5 and 0 t f e vi represents the fevi exposure integrating the concentration of fevi from zero to time t fig s4 the degradation of atenolol diclofenac and carbamazepine could be well predicted using eq 2 however the degradation rates of sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine are significantly slower than the predicted values fig 2 the inhibited effects of efom in wastewater effluent may cause this deviation from the predicted degradation rates the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine by fevi could yield the radical cation intermediates feng et al 2019 which could further react with the electron donating moieties in efom to yield back sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine similar inhibited effects of humic acid have also been observed for aniline degradation sun et al 2018 the degradation rates of remaining pharmaceuticals including nalidixic acid trimethoprim ronidazole dimetridazole tinidazole and caffeine have been underestimated by eq 2 the results of atenolol and tinidazole are presented in fig 2 fig s5 gives the measured and predicted degradation rates of other pharmaceuticals previous studies also reported that the degradation rates of certain pharmaceuticals were greater than the predicted values in the wastewater matrices lee et al 2005a lee et al 2009 the enhanced elimination of pharmaceuticals may be due to the fact that the intermediate fev or feiv species were formed by the reaction of fevi with reducing moieties of efom in effluents which are about 2 4 orders of magnitude more reactive than fevi sharma et al 2008 the fev and feiv species may be involved in the pharmaceutical attenuation in the effluents the inaccurate predictions by fevi exposure eq 2 suggest that the reaction rate constants of fevi with pharmaceuticals could not be directly employed to calculate the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents significantly the contribution of fev and feiv species to the removal of pharmaceuticals cannot be ignored however it is challenging to quantify the contributions of fev and fe iv species in pharmaceutical removal furthermore the roles of reducing substances present in effluents were unclear accordingly surrogates are proposed to model the fevi oxidation of pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluents and discussed in the next section 3 3 transformation of the fluorescence spectra of effluent by fevi oxidation during the monitoring of pharmaceutical attenuation in the effluent by fevi oxidation a progressive alteration in the fluorescence spectra was also observed the examples of eem spectra at various fevi exposure are demonstrated in fig 3 a c to investigate the transformation of specific fluorescence peaks parafac was applied to analyze the fluorescence eem spectra of effluents the parafac algorithm is implemented by alternating least squares als algorithm the goal of which is to minimize the sum of squared residuals ssrs residual analysis can estimate the suitable number of components in the process of the examination of split half validation function the positions of the fluorescence maxima obtained by parallel factor analysis were located at λex λem 275 310 nm λex λem 285 350 nm and λex λem 315 440 nm respectively these peaks identified from the profile of eem spectra are named as tyrosine like peak tryptophan like peak and humic like peak respectively chen et al 2003 esparza soto et al 2011 yang et al 2015 the reduction of fluorescence intensities vs fevi exposure is evaluated and demonstrated in fig 3d the removal of humic like peak is significantly faster than that of the tryptophan like peak however tyrosine like peak kept constant with the increasing fevi exposure unlike that pharmaceutical degradation by the first order decay with fevi exposure in the effluent the losses of the humic like and tryptophan like peak don t exhibit simple single first order decay the behaviors agree well with the fact that the efom is a heterogeneous mixture of aliphatic and aromatic organic compounds containing numerous functional groups therefore multiple exponential decays are applied to fit the decay curves as shown in eq 3 3 y a 1 e k 1 t 0 f e vi dt a 2 e k 2 t 0 f e vi dt a 3 as eq 3 illustrated the fluorescent components can be divided into three parts both a1 and a2 undergo first order decays with different decay rates and a3 can be defined as the inert part k 1 fast decay and k 2 slow decay are assumed to be the apparent reaction rate constants of a1 and a2 with fevi the calculation process of the above parameters is shown in text s4 as aforementioned fevi tends to oxidize the electron rich moieties it is reasonable to presume that the humic like and tryptophan like substances with higher aromaticity are much easier oxidized than the tyrosine like component based on the change in fluorophore in effluent the fluorescence peaks acted as the surrogates for predicting the pharmaceutical degradation since the fluorescent components have been co degraded with pharmaceuticals in the effluent in aops the change of total fluorescence δtf has been applied to predict the removal of torcs and empirical correlations have been established gerrity et al 2012 park et al 2017 comparatively fevi presents high selectivity toward fluorescent components in the aops all three fluorescence components simultaneously decreased due to the non selective ho oxidation ben abdelmelek et al 2011 the fluorescence surrogate could also be applied in powdered activated carbon processes ziska et al 2016 3 4 modeling the relationship between the change of fluorescence and the removal of pharmaceuticals as shown in fig 2 and fig s5 the removal of pharmaceuticals in the effluent can be expressed as eq 4 4 c t c 0 exp k w t 0 f e vi dt it should be noted that k w is the apparent reaction rate constants of fevi with pharmaceuticals in the effluents which are quite different from k app in eq 1 in buffer solutions the values of k w are presented in fig s8 as illustrated in eqs 3 and 4 fevi exposure could act as an intermediate variable relating to both the pharmaceutical and fluorescence removal in the combination of eqs 3 and 4 the relationship between the fluorescence attenuation and the pharmaceutical removal is then expressed as eq 5 5 y a 1 x k 1 k w a 2 x k 2 k w a 3 y is the residual ratio of the change of fluorescence intensity and x is the residual ratio of individual ppcp the calculation procedures and results of all the parameters of eq 5 are presented in text s5 and table s6 respectively up to 140 mg l 1 min of fevi expose the reduction of fluorescent peaks presents apparently diverse varieties tyrosine like peak keeps constant tryptophan like peak reduces about 40 meanwhile humic like peak presents the greatest reduction 70 removal among three fluorescent peaks it suggested that the humic like fluorescent peak can be a potential surrogate to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals the predicted models of the removal of atenolol tinidazole sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine regarding humic like fluorescence are presented in fig 4 and the remaining pharmaceuticals can be found in fig s9 the high coefficients r 2 0 90 of the prediction have been obtained for all tested pharmaceuticals implying that the humic like fluorescence can replace fevi exposure to predict the pharmaceutical removal as expected tryptophan like peak could also be a surrogate to predict the fevi oxidation of pharmaceuticals in the effluents and the results are shown in fig s10 nevertheless we proposed that the humic like fluorescence is more suitable for surrogate than tryptophan like peak since 1 humic like peak presented a greater reduction than tryptophan like peak during fevi oxidation 2 humic like peak was originated from residual noms which would stand for steady concentration and not likely been impacted by wastewater treatment processes thurman 1985 however the tryptophan like fluorescence i e protein like substance is mainly contributed from the microbial processes and often used to as an indicator of the biological biomass in wastewater effluent chen et al 2003 cai et al 2020 it fluctuates depending on the biological treatment efficiency leading to the improperly predicted results therefore monitoring the humic like fluorescence may be a suitable indicator for evaluating the attenuation of pharmaceuticals in fevi oxidation processes modeling of pharmaceuticals and humic like fluorescence presented a good correlation indicating that humic like fluorescence may be degraded simultaneously with the oxidation of pharmaceuticals as mentioned previously the humic component is a heterogeneous mixture containing various functional groups e g carboxyl thiol and amine hsu and hatcher 2006 the groups presented in the humic like fluorescence exist different reactivities toward fevi a similar degradation mechanism may exist between the humic component of the efom and pharmaceuticals which contain numerous functional moieties previous studies have developed fluorescence surrogate models to predict the removal of torcs by ozonation both linear correlation gerrity et al 2012 and exponential correlation park et al 2017 exhibited a reasonably good prediction of torcs attenuation the models developed in ozone and other aops are slightly different from the one in this study significantly fluorophores selectively react with fevi to yield multiple exponential decays however clarifying the mechanisms of the relationship between fluorophores and pharmaceuticals needs additional experiments due to fluorophores complex in chemical structures nevertheless the fluorescence could be an alternative surrogate to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals during the application of fevi for advanced treatment of wastewater effluents 3 5 influence of ph the ph effects on the fluorescence surrogate to predict pharmaceutical removal was investigated in the typical ph range of effluents ph 7 0 to 9 0 the attenuation of the humic like peak increases with the decreasing ph it is accordant with the previous studies that applied dissolved organic carbon doc graham et al 2010 and uv254 lim and kim 2009 as surrogates to monitor the removal of noms by fevi under varied ph conditions the changes of humic like peak with varied ph in the fevi oxidation process are likely due to the ratio change of the active hfeo4 species toward total fevi species under varied ph conditions kamachi et al 2005 the decay curves could still be fitted using eq 3 fig s11 of si the parameters of the predicted model in different ph are given in table s7 the correlation of k parameters with ph is shown in fig 5 a the values of k 1 decreased by one order magnitude from ph 7 0 to 9 0 comparatively the values of k 2 varied almost three orders of magnitudes from 10 1 to 102 flu 1 s 1 fig 5b presents the apparent reaction rate constants k w of fevi with pharmaceuticals in the effluent with varying ph the similar tendency as k 1 from humic like fluorescence is also observed fig 5c it indicated that the ph effect on the prediction will be minor and the deviation from the model might be due to the fluctuation of the k 2 k w value fig 5d in our previous study we employed the similar equation to simulate the transformation of fluorescence versus pharmaceuticals removal in wastewater effluent under solar irradiation yan et al 2017 however the ph effect was not observed since the distribution of reactive radicals in the photochemical process is not affected by ph blough and zepp 1995 the values of k 2 k w fluctuate within one order of magnitude from ph 7 0 to ph 9 0 leading to slight underestimating the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals if the eq 5 developed from ph 7 9 is employed for the effluent at ph 9 0 furthermore considering the diverse ph of effluents it is necessary to optimize the parameters of the fitting model however there is no suitable model to fit the values of k 1 and k 2 at different ph since the efom is a complicated mixture the interpolation method has been employed to determine the values of k 1 k 2 and k w under varied ph conditions which could improve the accuracy of the prediction for field samples 3 6 testing the fluorescence surrogate in field samples field samples were employed to investigate the accuracy of fluorescence surrogate in predicting the removal of pharmaceuticals nine pharmaceuticals have been detected in the field samples table s8 the pharmaceutical attenuation was observed at three fevi exposure doses i e low exposure dose 26 0 38 8 mg fe l 1 min medium exposure dose 100 140 mg fe l 1 min and high exposure dose 200 213 mg fe l 1 min fig 6 demonstrated that trimethoprim carbamazepine and diclofenac achieved an elimination of 95 at a low fevi exposure 26 0 38 8 mg fe l 1 min for the other pharmaceuticals such as caffeine nalidixic acid and atenolol an exposure of 100 140 mg fevi l 1 min was necessary to obtain an elimination of 80 indicating that the relatively high fevi exposure 1 3 mg fevi per mgc and the exposure time 30 min is necessary to achieve a significant elimination of pharmaceuticals in effluents the similar fevi exposure doses had also been applied to removal of micropollutants in wastewater effluent lee et al 2009 jiang et al 2013 the fevi exposure dose and k w were initially employed to predict the removal of pharmaceuticals as demonstrated in fig s13 the results showed that the combination of fevi exposure dose and k w may not precisely predict the removal of pharmaceutical possibly due to the varied k w in the differential field samples furthermore the predicted removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals in field samples obtained from eq 5 are correlated with the measured results as illustrated in fig 6a the removal efficiency of caffeine atenolol nalidixic acid and dimetridazole in the field samples was underestimated likely due to the ph effects the original fitting eq 5 was developed under ph 7 9 whereas ph of the field samples was slightly higher than ph 7 9 therefore the parameters in eq 5 were modified based on the results from fig 5 after the ph adjustment the accuracy of predicted results is improved as shown in fig 6b the predicted results match well with experimental results for most of the pharmaceuticals 10 except that the removal of trimethoprim and carbamazepine in several field samples were out of the predicting range it indicated that the diverse efom could also present slightly different enhanced inhibited effects for fevi oxidation of pharmaceuticals and water matrices maybe alter the fevi oxidation processes feng et al 2016 deng et al 2018 in addition the model presented in this study is an initial estimation of the behaviors of efom fluorophores and pharmaceuticals in fevi oxidation and additional studies are needed to explore the validation of fluorophore as a surrogate in different water matrices 4 conclusions overall the inhibited or enhanced effects of efom on pharmaceuticals elimination were observed in fevi treatment of wastewater effluents suggesting that the fevi exposure and its reaction rate constants with pharmaceuticals cannot be directly used in the prediction of the pharmaceutical removal therefore the surrogate can be an alternative method to predict the pharmaceutical removal upon fevi treatment the fluorescence of the effluents changed following with the pharmaceutical degradation among three fluorescence peaks the humic like peak presented the greatest elimination and the decay curve with fevi exposure was fitted by a multiple exponential decay furthermore a novel correlation model was established a general formula was created for each pharmaceutical and can be expressed as y a 1 x k 1 k w a 2 x k 2 k w a 3 the strong correlation between the removal of humic like peak and pharmaceuticals illustrated that the humic like fluorescence appears to be an effective surrogate for monitoring pharmaceutical removal during fevi treatment the ph effects on the accuracy of prediction are minor and the predicted deviation of the model might be attributed from the variation of the k 2 k w value field test further prove that the humic like fluorescence can be a practicable surrogate to predict pharmaceutical removal in addition the direct definition of humic like fluorescence based on its ex em wavelength could be a simple approach to monitor the transformation of fluorophore and could be easily employed into an online monitoring system it provides a promising rapid and inexpensive method for estimating the degradation of pharmaceuticals during fevi treatment of wastewater effluents however the potential interference from other fluorophores may be further considered during the application of fluorescence surrogates moreover the compositions of humic like fluorophore in differential wastewater effluents could be varied significantly which could alter the kinetic parameters of fevi oxidation of humic like fluorophore this uncertainty should be further considered in overall prediction using the fluorescence measurements finally great attention should be paid to the impact of water parameters on the prediction accuracy the coexisting constituents such as inorganic ions and metal cations could also affect the accuracy of prediction therefore a thorough evaluation of this model is needed in any further field tests declaration of competing

17612,during hydraulic fracturing or fracking large volumes of wastewater flow back and produced water are generated which are naturally rich in heavy metals and radionuclides such as radium spills may occur during operations and contaminate the groundwater therefore there is an urgent need to identify a practice that can mitigate the negative impact of accidental leaks on water resources here we present an experimental and modeling work on the transport of alkaline earth elements in produced water which are congeners of radium namely barium ba 2 strontium sr 2 calcium ca 2 and magnesium mg 2 in addition to sodium na column flood tests were conducted using produced water from a shale gas site and reactive porous media made of ubiquitous minerals such as sand hydrous ferric oxide activated alumina and manganese oxide in all cases no retardation of the ions was observed at the salinity conditions of the produced water but strong retardation in the ph front was measured indicating that adsorption indeed occurred when using manganese oxide and upon dilution of produced water the concentration fronts of all major divalent cations were retarded however a fast wave of solute traveling at the average flow velocity emerged this phenomenon confirmed that significant adsorption occurred under those conditions but ph dependent adsorption and hydrodynamic dispersion favored fast solute transport overall these results suggest that manganese oxide could be used as a reactive material in the lining of temporary storage tanks and in the well cases in order to retard the migration of the major toxic elements in produced water however mixing must be controlled to avoid the emergence of an instability at the concentration fronts favoring the formation of fast waves keywords alkaline earth elements hydraulic fracturing produced water reactive porous media 1 introduction hydraulic fracturing or fracking is performed to enhance oil and gas recovery from low permeability formations such as shale located at depth greater than 30 m american petroleum institute 2015 jackson et al 2015 norris et al 2016 in recent years fracking has become a widespread technique employed in a number of regions around the world due to the development of advanced drilling techniques u s epa 2016 and it is considered to be an important component for gas extraction in the future it can provide the transition fuel for the shift toward renewable energy resources and helps mitigating carbon dioxide co2 emissions into the atmosphere vidic et al 2013 in the united states alone projections of future oil and gas extraction using hydraulic fracturing forecast up to 2 trillion m3 by 2050 eia 2019 in addition to oil and gas a large amount of wastewater brine is generated during the operation this water is technically called flow back and produced water shaffer et al 2013 and since the beginning of fracking millions of cubic meters of it have been created the brine is made only of 4 8 by the returned injection fluids while the 92 96 of it is a hypersaline brine from the shale formation kondash et al 2017 which is naturally rich in barium ba 2 strontium sr 2 radium ra 2 calcium ca 2 magnesium mg 2 and sodium na almond et al 2014 kahrilas et al 2016 tong et al 2019 yost et al 2016 typically the wastewater is temporarily stored in tanks to be then either recycled reused upon treatment or disposed of ferrar et al 2013 lutz et al 2013 shaffer et al 2013 spills during these activities may occur with potential negative impact on the environment lauer et al 2016 patterson et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 vengosh et al 2014 the leakage may reach water resources through either natural pathways lining failure at wells and storage tanks or along pipeline digiulio and jackson 2016 liang et al 2016 llewellyn et al 2015 warner et al 2012 and the transport of the solutes within the water may change with the mineralogy of the soil cai et al 2018 inorganic and organic pollution associated to spills has been found in soil and river sediments and reported in previous works burgos et al 2017 lauer et al 2016 2018 of particular concern are toxic elements such as ba 2 and ra 2 i e ra 226 and ra 228 as they have negative effect on human health kravchenko et al 2014 u s epa 2019 ra 226 ra 226 ra 228 0 1 may reach concentrations up to 15 000 pci l with a variability among sites of three orders of magnitude fan et al 2018 it is therefore an urgent need to identify a sustainable solution to mitigate the occurrence of leaks and water contamination options are e g the inclusion of a material within the fractures or around the storage pools and the wells that can adsorb the major toxic elements avoiding their migration towards water bodies gusa and vidic 2019 prigiobbe and meng 2015 previous work in our group focused on the transport of barium through a reactive medium made of goethite ye and prigiobbe 2018 it was observed that the speed of the concentration front of barium increases with ionic strength and the element behaves as a tracer at the salinity of produced water here we present an experimental and modeling study which is an extension of our earlier work to investigate the transport behaviour of major cations in produced water from a production well in particular the objective was to understand competitive adsorption of the major cations onto various granular materials made of a proppant coated with common minerals i e hydrous ferric oxide activated alumina and manganese oxide the mineral were chosen because of their known selective adsorption of alkaline earth elements gar 2002 ghaeni et al 2019 gonneea et al 2008 mishra and tiwary 1999 1995 mott et al 1993 tamura et al 1996 conventional proppant materials were also tested for reference an average ph of 8 for the produced water was considered haluszczak et al 2013 lauer et al 2016 and various salinity conditions were tested to account for the dilution of the brine upon mixing with groundwater a reactive transport model was developed for the transport of ba 2 sr 2 ca 2 mg 2 and na through the porous medium coated with manganese oxide which gave the greatest attenuation of the investigated elements the model was implemented in the open source geochemical software phreeqc v 3 usgs 2016 and compared with the experimental results anthony et al 2007

environmental laboratory west virginia the water was taken from a waste storage tank unfiltered and not acidified the concentration of major alkaline earth elements i e barium ba 2 calcium ca 2 magnesium mg 2 sodium na strontium sr 2 in the received water were measured using icp oes upon characterization the ph was adjusted to 8 and filtered using a 0 22 µm filter ge healthcare u s a to remove precipitates which consist mostly of iron oxides then the water was analyzed again table 1 shows the composition upon filtration the ph was adjusted to 8 as it represents an average value for produced water at the production site haluszczak et al 2013 lauer et al 2016 synthetic produced water was prepared and it included only the major alkaline earth elements and chloride ion it was created as an analog to understand the role of organics and other minor species within the produced water on the transport of the elements of interest the preparation was carried out using chloride salts namely bacl2 cacl2 cocl2 fecl3 kcl licl mgcl2 mncl2 nacl and srcl2 fisher chemical u s a the ph was then adjusted to 8 solutions of the synthetic produced water were also created with ratios of 1 100 and 1 1000 to study the effect of dilution of the brine on cation adsorption upon mixing of the brine with fresh water chen and kocar 2018 lauer et al 2018 2 7 set up and experimental procedure transport experiments were performed by supplying a brine to a column of 15 mm of diameter and 200 mm of length dwk life sciences germany through a peristaltic pump masterflex l s u s a the brine was injected from the bottom to the top to avoid fingering due to density driven flow the column was filled with granular materials i e either sand rcs fcs aa and mcs sensors of ph and temperature liquiline cm442 endress hauser u s a were installed inline at the inlet and at the outlet of the column to measure continuously the flow streams grab samples were taken using a fraction collector frac 920 ge healthcare life sciences u s a and analyzed off line using the icp oes the sensors were placed in glass holders where the residence time was about 7 min a small magnetic anchor was added at the bottom of the holder to ensure complete mixing of the solution the grab samples were continuously collected and each vial was filled for 5 min the ph and the cation concentrations were therefore averaged over approximately the same length of time despite of this the sharp features of the concentration fronts are maintained as it is possible to see in section 4 during the tests the column was initially flooded with a solution of ph 5 adjusted by using hcl representing a condition of a slightly acidic uncontaminated shallow aquifer appelo and postma 2005 after the column stabilized at that ph another solution containing the produced water was supplied to the column with a flow rate equal to 1 ml min the type of solution injected into the column is specified for each test in table 2 3 modeling selected experiments were described with a reactive transport model implemented in the open source geochemical software phreeqc v 3 usgs 2016 the model couples chemical reactions in solution and at the solid liquid interface with transport equations the chemical reactions at the solid liquid interface were taken from the literature and they are listed in section 3 1 the governing equations of solute transport are given in section 3 2 3 1 geochemical model a geochemical model to describe the adsorption of the alkaline earth elements onto mno2 was developed the model is based on the cd music charge distribution multisite complexation triple layer model hiemstra et al 1989 1996 and it is coupled with the pitzer activity coefficient method pitzer 1973 to account for the effect of the ionic strength following previous works goldberg 1992 hayes et al 1991 huang and stumm 1973 mcneece and hesse 2016 sahai and sverjensky 1997 sverjensky 1993 2001 2005 tournassat et al 2013 the

km 2 and kna and other parameters are listed in table 3 in this model the adsorption of negatively charged species such as cl was not accounted for as under the conditions applied the adsorption is negligible at those conditions the mineral surfaces are negatively charged fig 2 in the si document and predominantly containing soh sites where cations adsorb is favored instead 3 2 transport model one dimensional 1d reactive transport model was developed in order to describe the migration of the major cations in the produced water through the selected granular materials the model consists of

for the effect of the large ionic strength between 0 001 and 1 1 mol kg the domain was discretized in 40 cells with a time step of 0 1 s an example of the code written in phreeqc to describe one of the experiments run in this work exp 15 is reported in section 6 of the si document in this model the transport of negatively charged species such as cl was not accounted for because of the negligible adsorption under the investigated conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of the granular materials fig 1 reports the results from the characterization of the granular materials used in this work the photos along the upper row of this figure show the characteristic colors of the minerals while the images in the following rows are from xrd eds analyses all the materials were sputter coated with 5 nm of gold to increase the surface conduction as expected the dominant species on the sand surface were silicon si and oxygen o with iron fe aluminum al and manganese mn on hfo coated sand activated alumina and mno2 coated sand respectively more than 99 99 purity was obtained for the rcs and aa materials 4 2 characterization of produced water solutions solution composition was determined on various types of produced water and the results of the analyses are reported in table 1 here it is possible to read that the composition of the natural produced water as received from mseel npw is comparable to the average composition of the produced water from other oil and gas field sites with tds as large as 43 000 mg l lauer et al 2016 thiel and lienhard 2014 where hydraulic fracturing is currently performed the largest ion concentrations were determined for na ca 2 ba 2 sr 2 mg 2 and cl which therefore control the ionic strength upon ph adjustment and filtration the corrected natural produced water cnpw showed a major reduction in iron concentration suggesting that precipitates of iron were formed the corrected synthetic produced water cspw composition compared well with that of cnpw and upon dilution the concentrations dropped of two and three order of magnitudes as expected the ionic strength of natural produced water was determined indirectly from the measured tds as i 2 5 10 5 tds knödel et al 2007 upon filtration whereas for the synthetic produced water i was calculated using eq 14 accounting for all the major ions 4 3 transport experiments the summary of the experimental conditions applied during the transport tests is given in table 2 here the granular materials used in this work are listed together with the types of produced water solutions injected into the column the ph of the initial ph ini and injected ph inj solutions the porosity n the flow rate q ml min the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion d m2 s and the interstitial fluid velocity v m s the values of q v and d were determined by fitting a front of na with the analytic solution of the 1d advection dispersion equation fetter 1993 under conditions where no na adsorption onto the porous medium surface was expected ye and prigiobbe 2018 4 3 1 tests using natural produced water the breakthrough curves of the investigated cations ba 2 ca 2 mg 2 na and sr 2 and ph are shown in fig 2 the reported concentrations were measured at the outlet of the column in exp 1 2 3 4 6 and 7 where natural produced water with adjusted ph to 8 was used the concentration fronts of each cation are normalized by the corresponding injected concentration and they are represented as a function of the pore volume injected i e pv qt v n with v the total volume of the granular material within the column as it is possible to see in this figure the cations in the effluent of exp 1 and 2 where sand and resin coated sand were used respectively break through the column at 1 pv and simultaneously the ph reaches the value of the injected solution this indicates that the transport of these elements through traditional proppants liang et al 2016 i e sand and resin coated sand occurred without retardation and therefore they travelled at the interstitial flow velocity in exp 3 and 4 where hfo coated sand fcs activated alumina aa were respectively used the cation front appeared at 1 pv but the ph did not reach the value of the injected solution simultaneously it stabilized around a constant value of approximately 6 2 this suggests that the adsorption of the cations onto the fcs and aa surfaces occurred and if a larger specific surface area would have been available a more significant adsorption would have happened causing greater retardation in exp 6 and 7 where mno2 coated sand mcs was used all the cation fronts appeared at 1 pv except for barium which is characterized by a broader front centered around 3 pvs in these experiments the ph decreased and stabilized around 2 suggesting that the alkaline earth elements adsorbed onto mno2 coated sand with the largest extent in the case of ba 2 similar trends were observed during exp 5 where the ph of the natural produced water was not adjusted to 8 but was left at 3 in this test all the measured cations except for barium breakthrough at 1 pv and the ph stabilizes around 2 5 fig 3 indicating that adsorption was negligible under these conditions due to the almost neutral surface charge of the mno2 coated sand at that ph and salinity see fig 2 in the si document the greatest reactivity of mno2 coated sand with respect to the other investigated materials is due to the small value of the point of zero charge pzc of mno2 mineral and the large negative surface potential even at the ionic strength of 1 m fig 2 in the si document our results confirm earlier observations which indicate that the affinity of metals for mno x surface follow the order mg ca sr ba murray 1975 the work by moon et al 2003 also reports that ra is favored over other alkaline earth elements as a matter of fact mn oxides have been employed for the removal of ra from seawater towler et al 1996 and radioactive wastewater landa and reid 1983 qureshi and nelson 2003 ringwood et al 1979 it is important to point out the different values of the specific surface areas of the tested mineral coatings which might have affected the retardation of the cations however the values of the specific surface area are comparable to those in earlier works where the same materials were characterized section 2 the larger the surface the larger the adsorption capacity of the material but the specific surface area is not the only factor influencing adsorption the reactivity of the surface due to its mineralogy is critical our results confirm earlier observations that manganese oxide has significant affinity towards alkaline earth elements therefore mno2 coated sand was further investigated using synthetic produced water 4 3 2 tests using synthetic produced water and mno2 coated sand on the basis of the results obtained using natural produced water mno2 coated sand was selected for further investigations using synthetic produced water in order to study the effect of minor species and dilution fig 4 reports the results of the experiments here it is possible to see a different transport behaviour of the divalent cations when either cnpw or cspw were used under the same operating conditions exp 6 and 7 in fig 2 and exp 8 and 9 in fig 4 respectively in the case of the tests using cnpw there is a slight delay of barium with respect to the other cations whereas when cspw was used all cations broke through simultaneously this different behaviour could be due to different surface complexation reactions occurring at the solid liquid interface in the presence of cnpw where minor organic species are present when the diluted produced water was used exp 10 11 and 12 in figs 6 8 the concentration fronts broaden and a peak centered between 1 and 2 pvs arose the concentration curves stabilize around 150 pvs for all divalent cations except for barium where the retarded front start to appear at 500 pvs fig 5 in si document in all cases retardation is due to adsorption which is favored at the ph of injection ca 8 the concentration peaks resemble the fast pulse observed in previous works prigiobbe and bryant 2014 prigiobbe et al 2012 and they are due to ph dependent solute transport and hydrodynamic dispersion in these earlier works it was observed that hydrodynamic dispersion favors the formation of a fast concentration pulse by creating a mixing zone within the pore space between the initial and the injected solutions upon mixing the ph is acidic and adsorption of the cations is negligible therefore a solute pulse forms and moves at the interstitial flow velocity hydrodynamic dispersion is generally regarded as second order effect as it only smooths the concentration fronts whereas adsorption controls the retardation of the fronts the larger the adsorption at given chemical conditions the slower the fronts however even in the presence of significant adsorption the mixing between the initial and the injected solutions in the pore space due to hydrodynamic dispersion can create chemical conditions where a portion of the injected cation concentration is not adsorbed and therefore can travel like a tracer this is shown in our previous paper where we observed the pulse of strontium in a reactive porous medium containing iron oxide prigiobbe et al 2012 in the work reported in this paper both ionic strength and ph control the adsorption process as ionic strength decreases ph dependent adsorption dominates the reactive transport behaviour favoring the formation of the fast wave in the presence of mixing due to hydrodynamic dispersion overall results from exp 11 and 12 confirm the notable reactivity of mno2 mineral in fig 4 it is possible to see that the maximum normalized concentration of the fast pulse reaches for calcium and magnesium values larger than 1 this is because of competitive adsorption of the cations on the same reactive surface sites fast adsorption occurs on the mineral surface initially then it is followed by the desorption of the cations which have less affinity with the surface warner et al 2013 and lauer et al 2018 observed significant retention of alkaline earth elements including radium by river sediments the authors suggest that upon dilution of the high salinity wastewater discharged from a treatment plant with low salinity river water rapid adsorption of radium onto river sediments could occur because of the drop of ionic strength this indeed may be the case also upon a spill of produced water from a storage tank or a well mixing of the brine with fresh groundwater could quickly reduce the ionic strength favoring the adsorption of alkaline earth elements onto soil however our work also shows that a pulse due to ph dependent solute adsorption and hydrodynamic dispersion may arise travel at the average flow velocity and transport the contaminant at speed larger than expected 4 4 modeling and simulations of transport through mno2 coated sand transport experiments 8 through 12 were described using the reactive transport model reported above table 3 summarizes the values of the model parameters in particular the table reports the intrinsic reaction constants k the density of sites ns the capacitances c 1 and c 2 and the specific surface area a values of the constants were taken from the literature and then adjusted to match the measurements an example of a file written in phreeqc to describe exp 12 is reported in section 6 of the si document figs 5 8 show the measurements with the model upon fitting as it is possible to notice in these figures the model agrees well with the data although there is a discrepancy between the calculated and measured ph the model can predict the emergence of the fast wave for the various investigated species as well as the retarded front of barium in exp 11 this is a remarkable result given the complexity of the investigated system and suggests that the proposed model is a valuable tool to identify optimal operating conditions and mineral properties for alkaline earth element removal from produced water 5 conclusions in this paper an experimental and modeling work was presented where proppants and natural minerals were tested to study the transport behaviour of alkaline earth elements in produced water the most significant retardation of the solutes was obtained in the case of a porous medium coated with manganese oxide however a fast travelling pulse arose when retardation was the greatest due to the combined effect of ph dependent solute transport and hydrodynamic dispersion the reactive transport model implemented to describe these results agrees well with the data this opens the possibility for the application of the model to design a reactive mno2 based material which could be used e g as a proppant in the lining of temporary storage tanks and in well cases to mitigate the potential negative impact of produced water spills on potable shallow aquifers however the estimation of the equilibrium constants of the chemical reactions at the solid liquid interface for mno2 based material should be improved and this can be achieved by performing systematic single component transport experiments verified by test with multi component aqueous solutions declaration of competing interest

17612,during hydraulic fracturing or fracking large volumes of wastewater flow back and produced water are generated which are naturally rich in heavy metals and radionuclides such as radium spills may occur during operations and contaminate the groundwater therefore there is an urgent need to identify a practice that can mitigate the negative impact of accidental leaks on water resources here we present an experimental and modeling work on the transport of alkaline earth elements in produced water which are congeners of radium namely barium ba 2 strontium sr 2 calcium ca 2 and magnesium mg

activated alumina and manganese oxide in all cases no retardation of the ions was observed at the salinity conditions of the produced water but strong retardation in the ph front was measured indicating that adsorption indeed occurred when using manganese oxide and upon dilution of produced water the concentration fronts of all major divalent cations were retarded however a fast wave of solute traveling at the average flow velocity emerged this phenomenon confirmed that significant adsorption occurred under those conditions but ph dependent adsorption and hydrodynamic dispersion favored fast solute transport overall these results suggest that manganese oxide could be used as a reactive material in the lining of temporary storage tanks and in the well cases in order to retard the migration of the major toxic elements in produced water however mixing must be controlled to avoid the emergence of an instability at the concentration fronts favoring the formation of fast waves keywords alkaline earth elements hydraulic fracturing produced water reactive porous media 1 introduction hydraulic fracturing or fracking is performed to enhance oil and gas recovery from low permeability formations such as shale located at depth greater than 30 m american petroleum institute 2015 jackson et al 2015 norris et al 2016 in recent years fracking has become a widespread technique employed in a number of regions around the world due to the development of advanced drilling techniques u s epa 2016 and it is considered to be an important component for gas extraction in the future it can provide the transition fuel for the shift toward renewable energy resources and helps mitigating carbon dioxide co2 emissions into the atmosphere vidic et al 2013 in the united states alone projections of future oil and gas extraction using hydraulic fracturing forecast up to 2 trillion m3 by 2050 eia 2019 in addition to oil and gas a large amount of wastewater brine is generated during the operation this water is technically called flow back and produced water shaffer et al 2013 and since the beginning of fracking millions of cubic meters of it have been created the brine is made only of 4 8 by the returned injection fluids while the 92 96 of it is a hypersaline brine from the shale formation kondash et al 2017 which is naturally rich in barium ba 2 strontium sr 2 radium ra 2 calcium ca 2 magnesium mg 2 and sodium na almond et al 2014 kahrilas et al 2016 tong et al 2019 yost et al 2016 typically the wastewater is temporarily stored in tanks to be then either recycled reused upon treatment or disposed of ferrar et al 2013 lutz et al 2013 shaffer et al 2013 spills during these activities may occur with potential negative impact on the environment lauer et al 2016 patterson et al 2017 shrestha et al 2017 vengosh et al 2014 the leakage may reach water resources through either natural pathways lining failure at wells and storage tanks or along pipeline digiulio and jackson 2016 liang et al 2016 llewellyn et al 2015 warner et al 2012 and the transport of the solutes within the water may change with the mineralogy of the soil cai et al 2018 inorganic and organic pollution associated to spills has been found in soil and river sediments and reported in previous works burgos et al 2017 lauer et al 2016 2018 of particular concern are toxic elements such as ba 2 and ra 2 i e ra 226 and ra 228 as they have negative effect on human health kravchenko et al 2014 u s epa 2019 ra 226 ra 226 ra 228 0 1 may reach concentrations up to 15 000 pci l with a variability among sites of three orders of magnitude fan et al 2018 it is therefore an urgent need to identify a sustainable solution to mitigate the occurrence of leaks and water contamination options are e g the inclusion of a material within the fractures or around the storage pools and the wells that can adsorb the major toxic elements avoiding their migration towards water bodies gusa and vidic 2019 prigiobbe and meng 2015 previous work in our group focused on the transport of barium through a reactive medium made of goethite ye and prigiobbe 2018 it was observed that the speed of the concentration front of barium increases with ionic strength and the element behaves as a tracer at the salinity of produced water here we present an experimental and modeling study which is an extension of our earlier work to investigate the transport behaviour of major cations in produced water from a production well in particular the objective was to understand competitive adsorption of the major cations onto various granular materials made of a proppant coated with common minerals i e hydrous ferric oxide activated alumina and manganese oxide the mineral were chosen because of their known selective adsorption of alkaline earth elements gar 2002 ghaeni et al 2019 gonneea et al 2008 mishra and tiwary 1999 1995 mott et al 1993 tamura et al 1996 conventional proppant materials were also tested for reference an average ph of 8 for the produced water was considered haluszczak et al 2013 lauer et al 2016 and various salinity conditions were tested to account for the dilution of the brine upon mixing with groundwater a reactive transport model was developed for the transport of ba 2 sr 2 ca 2 mg 2 and na through the porous medium coated with manganese oxide which gave the greatest attenuation of the investigated elements the model was implemented in the open source geochemical software phreeqc v 3 usgs 2016 and compared with the experimental results anthony et al 2007

environmental laboratory west virginia the water was taken from a waste storage tank unfiltered and not acidified the concentration of major alkaline earth elements i e barium ba 2 calcium ca 2 magnesium mg 2 sodium na strontium sr 2 in the received water were measured using icp oes upon characterization the ph was adjusted to 8 and filtered using a 0 22 µm filter ge healthcare u s a to remove precipitates which consist mostly of iron oxides then the water was analyzed again table 1 shows the composition upon filtration the ph was adjusted to 8 as it represents an average value for produced water at the production site haluszczak et al 2013 lauer et al 2016 synthetic produced water was prepared and it included only the major alkaline earth elements and chloride ion it was created as an analog to understand the role of organics and other minor species within the produced water on the transport of the elements of interest the preparation was carried out using chloride salts namely bacl2 cacl2 cocl2 fecl3 kcl licl mgcl2 mncl2 nacl and srcl2 fisher chemical u s a the ph was then adjusted to 8 solutions of the synthetic produced water were also created with ratios of 1 100 and 1 1000 to study the effect of dilution of the brine on cation adsorption upon mixing of the brine with fresh water chen and kocar 2018 lauer et al 2018 2 7 set up and experimental procedure transport experiments were performed by supplying a brine to a column of 15 mm of diameter and 200 mm of length dwk life sciences germany through a peristaltic pump masterflex l s u s a the brine was injected from the bottom to the top to avoid fingering due to density driven flow the column was filled with granular materials i e either sand rcs fcs aa and mcs sensors of ph and temperature liquiline cm442 endress hauser u s a were installed inline at the inlet and at the outlet of the column to measure continuously the flow streams grab samples were taken using a fraction collector frac 920 ge healthcare life sciences u s a and analyzed off line using the icp oes the sensors were placed in glass holders where the residence time was about 7 min a small magnetic anchor was added at the bottom of the holder to ensure complete mixing of the solution the grab samples were continuously collected and each vial was filled for 5 min the ph and the cation concentrations were therefore averaged over approximately the same length of time despite of this the sharp features of the concentration fronts are maintained as it is possible to see in section 4 during the tests the column was initially flooded with a solution of ph 5 adjusted by using hcl representing a condition of a slightly acidic uncontaminated shallow aquifer appelo and postma 2005 after the column stabilized at that ph another solution containing the produced water was supplied to the column with a flow rate equal to 1 ml min the type of solution injected into the column is specified for each test in table 2 3 modeling selected experiments were described with a reactive transport model implemented in the open source geochemical software phreeqc v 3 usgs 2016 the model couples chemical reactions in solution and at the solid liquid interface with transport equations the chemical reactions at the solid liquid interface were taken from the literature and they are listed in section 3 1 the governing equations of solute transport are given in section 3 2 3 1 geochemical model a geochemical model to describe the adsorption of the alkaline earth elements onto mno2 was developed the model is based on the cd music charge distribution multisite complexation triple layer model hiemstra et al 1989 1996 and it is coupled with the pitzer activity coefficient method pitzer 1973 to account for the effect of the ionic strength following previous works goldberg 1992 hayes et al 1991 huang and stumm 1973 mcneece and hesse 2016 sahai and sverjensky 1997 sverjensky 1993 2001 2005 tournassat et al 2013 the

km 2 and kna and other parameters are listed in table 3 in this model the adsorption of negatively charged species such as cl was not accounted for as under the conditions applied the adsorption is negligible at those conditions the mineral surfaces are negatively charged fig 2 in the si document and predominantly containing soh sites where cations adsorb is favored instead 3 2 transport model one dimensional 1d reactive transport model was developed in order to describe the migration of the major cations in the produced water through the selected granular materials the model consists of

the experiments run in this work exp 15 is reported in section 6 of the si document in this model the transport of negatively charged species such as cl was not accounted for because of the negligible adsorption under the investigated conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of the granular materials fig 1 reports the results from the characterization of the granular materials used in this work the photos along the upper row of this figure show the characteristic colors of the minerals while the images in the following rows are from xrd eds analyses all the materials were sputter coated with 5 nm of gold to increase the surface conduction as expected the dominant species on the sand surface were silicon si and oxygen o with iron fe aluminum al and manganese mn on hfo coated sand activated alumina and mno2 coated sand respectively more than 99 99 purity was obtained for the rcs and aa materials 4 2 characterization of produced water solutions solution composition was determined on various types of produced water and the results of the analyses are reported in table 1 here it is possible to read that the composition of the natural produced water as received from mseel npw is comparable to the average composition of the produced water from other oil and gas field sites with tds as large as 43 000 mg l lauer et al 2016 thiel and lienhard 2014 where hydraulic fracturing is currently performed the largest ion concentrations were determined for na ca 2 ba 2 sr 2 mg 2 and cl which therefore control the ionic strength upon ph adjustment and filtration the corrected natural produced water cnpw showed a major reduction in iron concentration suggesting that precipitates of iron were formed the corrected synthetic produced water cspw composition compared well with that of cnpw and upon dilution the concentrations dropped of two and three order of magnitudes as expected the ionic strength of natural produced water was determined indirectly from the measured tds as i 2 5 10 5 tds knödel et al 2007 upon filtration whereas for the synthetic produced water i was calculated using eq 14 accounting for all the major ions 4 3 transport experiments the summary of the experimental conditions applied during the transport tests is given in table 2 here the granular materials used in this work are listed together with the types of produced water solutions injected into the column the ph of the initial ph ini and injected ph inj solutions the porosity n the flow rate q ml min the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion d m2 s and the interstitial fluid velocity v m s the values of q v and d were determined by fitting a front of na with the analytic solution of the 1d advection dispersion equation fetter 1993 under conditions where no na adsorption onto the porous medium surface was expected ye and prigiobbe 2018 4 3 1 tests using natural produced water the breakthrough curves of the investigated cations ba 2 ca 2 mg 2 na and sr 2 and ph are shown in fig 2 the reported concentrations were measured at the outlet of the column in exp 1 2 3 4 6 and 7 where natural produced water with adjusted ph to 8 was used the concentration fronts of each cation are normalized by the corresponding injected concentration and they are represented as a function of the pore volume injected i e pv qt v n with v the total volume of the granular material within the column as it is possible to see in this figure the cations in the effluent of exp 1 and 2 where sand and resin coated sand were used respectively break through the column at 1 pv and simultaneously the ph reaches the value of the injected solution this indicates that the transport of these elements through traditional proppants liang et al 2016 i e sand and resin coated sand occurred without retardation and therefore they travelled at the interstitial flow velocity in exp 3 and 4 where hfo coated sand fcs activated alumina aa were respectively used the cation front appeared at 1 pv but the ph did not reach the value of the injected solution simultaneously it stabilized around a constant value of approximately 6 2 this suggests that the adsorption of the cations onto the fcs and aa surfaces occurred and if a larger specific surface area would have been available a more significant adsorption would have happened causing greater retardation in exp 6 and 7 where mno2 coated sand mcs was used all the cation fronts appeared at 1 pv except for barium which is characterized by a broader front centered around 3 pvs in these experiments the ph decreased and stabilized around 2 suggesting that the alkaline earth elements adsorbed onto mno2 coated sand with the largest extent in the case of ba 2 similar trends were observed during exp 5 where the ph of the natural produced water was not adjusted to 8 but was left at 3 in this test all the measured cations except for barium breakthrough at 1 pv and the ph stabilizes around 2 5 fig 3 indicating that adsorption was negligible under these conditions due to the almost neutral surface charge of the mno2 coated sand at that ph and salinity see fig 2 in the si document the greatest reactivity of mno2 coated sand with respect to the other investigated materials is due to the small value of the point of zero charge pzc of mno2 mineral and the large negative surface potential even at the ionic strength of 1 m fig 2 in the si document our results confirm earlier observations which indicate that the affinity of metals for mno x surface follow the order mg ca sr ba murray 1975 the work by moon et al 2003 also reports that ra is favored over other alkaline earth elements as a matter of fact mn oxides have been employed for the removal of ra from seawater towler et al 1996 and radioactive wastewater landa and reid 1983 qureshi and nelson 2003 ringwood et al 1979 it is important to point out the different values of the specific surface areas of the tested mineral coatings which might have affected the retardation of the cations however the values of the specific surface area are comparable to those in earlier works where the same materials were characterized section 2 the larger the surface the larger the adsorption capacity of the material but the specific surface area is not the only factor influencing adsorption the reactivity of the surface due to its mineralogy is critical our results confirm earlier observations that manganese oxide has significant affinity towards alkaline earth elements therefore mno2 coated sand was further investigated using synthetic produced water 4 3 2 tests using synthetic produced water and mno2 coated sand on the basis of the results obtained using natural produced water mno2 coated sand was selected for further investigations using synthetic produced water in order to study the effect of minor species and dilution fig 4 reports the results of the experiments here it is possible to see a different transport behaviour of the divalent cations when either cnpw or cspw were used under the same operating conditions exp 6 and 7 in fig 2 and exp 8 and 9 in fig 4 respectively in the case of the tests using cnpw there is a slight delay of barium with respect to the other cations whereas when cspw was used all cations broke through simultaneously this different behaviour could be due to different surface complexation reactions occurring at the solid liquid interface in the presence of cnpw where minor organic species are present when the diluted produced water was used exp 10 11 and 12 in figs 6 8 the concentration fronts broaden and a peak centered between 1 and 2 pvs arose the concentration curves stabilize around 150 pvs for all divalent cations except for barium where the retarded front start to appear at 500 pvs fig 5 in si document in all cases retardation is due to adsorption which is favored at the ph of injection ca 8 the concentration peaks resemble the fast pulse observed in previous works prigiobbe and bryant 2014 prigiobbe et al 2012 and they are due to ph dependent solute transport and hydrodynamic dispersion in these earlier works it was observed that hydrodynamic dispersion favors the formation of a fast concentration pulse by creating a mixing zone within the pore space between the initial and the injected solutions upon mixing the ph is acidic and adsorption of the cations is negligible therefore a solute pulse forms and moves at the interstitial flow velocity hydrodynamic dispersion is generally regarded as second order effect as it only smooths the concentration fronts whereas adsorption controls the retardation of the fronts the larger the adsorption at given chemical conditions the slower the fronts however even in the presence of significant adsorption the mixing between the initial and the injected solutions in the pore space due to hydrodynamic dispersion can create chemical conditions where a portion of the injected cation concentration is not adsorbed and therefore can travel like a tracer this is shown in our previous paper where we observed the pulse of strontium in a reactive porous medium containing iron oxide prigiobbe et al 2012 in the work reported in this paper both ionic strength and ph control the adsorption process as ionic strength decreases ph dependent adsorption dominates the reactive transport behaviour favoring the formation of the fast wave in the presence of mixing due to hydrodynamic dispersion overall results from exp 11 and 12 confirm the notable reactivity of mno2 mineral in fig 4 it is possible to see that the maximum normalized concentration of the fast pulse reaches for calcium and magnesium values larger than 1 this is because of competitive adsorption of the cations on the same reactive surface sites fast adsorption occurs on the mineral surface initially then it is followed by the desorption of the cations which have less affinity with the surface warner et al 2013 and lauer et al 2018 observed significant retention of alkaline earth elements including radium by river sediments the authors suggest that upon dilution of the high salinity wastewater discharged from a treatment plant with low salinity river water rapid adsorption of radium onto river sediments could occur because of the drop of ionic strength this indeed may be the case also upon a spill of produced water from a storage tank or a well mixing of the brine with fresh groundwater could quickly reduce the ionic strength favoring the adsorption of alkaline earth elements onto soil however our work also shows that a pulse due to ph dependent solute adsorption and hydrodynamic dispersion may arise travel at the average flow velocity and transport the contaminant at speed larger than expected 4 4 modeling and simulations of transport through mno2 coated sand transport experiments 8 through 12 were described using the reactive transport model reported above table 3 summarizes the values of the model parameters in particular the table reports the intrinsic reaction constants k the density of sites ns the capacitances c 1 and c 2 and the specific surface area a values of the constants were taken from the literature and then adjusted to match the measurements an example of a file written in phreeqc to describe exp 12 is reported in section 6 of the si document figs 5 8 show the measurements with the model upon fitting as it is possible to notice in these figures the model agrees well with the data although there is a discrepancy between the calculated and measured ph the model can predict the emergence of the fast wave for the various investigated species as well as the retarded front of barium in exp 11 this is a remarkable result given the complexity of the investigated system and suggests that the proposed model is a valuable tool to identify optimal operating conditions and mineral properties for alkaline earth element removal from produced water 5 conclusions in this paper an experimental and modeling work was presented where proppants and natural minerals were tested to study the transport behaviour of alkaline earth elements in produced water the most significant retardation of the solutes was obtained in the case of a porous medium coated with manganese oxide however a fast travelling pulse arose when retardation was the greatest due to the combined effect of ph dependent solute transport and hydrodynamic dispersion the reactive transport model implemented to describe these results agrees well with the data this opens the possibility for the application of the model to design a reactive mno2 based material which could be used e g as a proppant in the lining of temporary storage tanks and in well cases to mitigate the potential negative impact of produced water spills on potable shallow aquifers however the estimation of the equilibrium constants of the chemical reactions at the solid liquid interface for mno2 based material should be improved and this can be achieved by performing systematic single component transport experiments verified by test with multi component aqueous solutions declaration of competing interest

17613,biochar is widely and increasingly applied to farmlands however it remains unclear how long term biochar addition alters the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of soil derived dissolved organic matter dom an important terrestrial disinfection byproduct dbp precursor in watersheds here we analyzed the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of soil derived dom and the formation and toxicity of dbp mixtures from dom chlorination for two long term 5 and 11 years biochar addition experimental farmlands as indicated by spectroscopic indices and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analyses 11 years of biochar addition could increase the humic like and aromatic and condensed aromatic dom and decrease the microbial derived dom while 5 years of biochar addition at the other site did not the response of condensed aromatic dissolved black carbon did not increase with increasing cumulative biochar dose but appeared to be affected by biochar aging time despite the possible increase in aromatic dom biochar addition neither increased the reactivity of dom in forming trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles chloral hydrates or haloketones nor significantly increased the microtoxicity or genotoxicity of the dbp mixture this study indicates that biochar addition in watersheds may not deteriorate the drinking water quality via the export of

soil lehmann et al 2006 as biochar is increasingly produced and applied to soils globally soil properties and soil derived dissolved organic matter dom are expected to be increasingly impacted by long

most current knowledge has been derived from laboratory scale and short term studies it may hardly be extrapolated to field scale conditions with long term biochar aging plant soil microbe interactions and dom translocation e g sorption and leaching and transformation uchimiya et al 2016 biochar aging may alter the dom quantity and quality quan et al 2020 and it was hypothesized that only long term aging may yield condensed aromatic dissolved black carbon dbc braun et al 2020 while a few relatively short term studies have tested how the optical properties of dom may respond to biochar addition eykelbosh et al 2015 smebye et al 2016 the quantity and molecular level characteristics of dom derived from farmlands with biochar addition for longer than a decade remain unexamined terrestrial dom is increasingly recognized as an important precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in watersheds mikkelson et al 2013 particularly after storm events majidzadeh et al 2020 both the dom quantity and quality may affect the formation potential of dbps of various species and toxicity levels marhaba and van 2000 when the dom in watersheds is altered by anthropogenic activity e g effluent organic matter inputs hur et al 2013 or global change e g beetle infection mikkelson et al 2013 and wildfires wang et al 2015b in watersheds and then reacts with the disinfectants in water treatment plants altered formation and toxicity of the resulting dbp mixture are expected recently thermally impacted dom due to wildfires in watersheds was reported to decrease the dom coagulation efficiency and increase the dom reactivity to yield toxic nitrogenous dbps cawley et al 2017 wang et al 2015b as another type of thermally impacted dom the dom leaching from biochar added lands is also expected to be altered due to the increasing application of biochar lehmann et al 2006 although both biochar and wildfire ash derived dom are affected by thermal processes the former mainly experienced pyrolysis while the latter was affected by both combustion and pyrolysis thus their characteristics and chlorine reactivity may not have the same responses to the thermal process recently a laboratory scale study suggested that the condensed aromatics leached from sludge corn and rice biochars may be important dbp precursors lee et al 2018 however it remains unknown whether the long term field application of biochar may alter the formation and toxicity of dbp mixture similar to wildfire events here we implemented two long term 5 and 11 years biochar addition experimental sites to investigate the effects of biochar addition on the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of soil derived dom using optical spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms respectively additionally we analyzed the formation and toxicity microtoxicity and genotoxicity of dbp mixtures with and without biochar impact using chlorination and microtox and sos umu bioassays we hypothesized that 1 the long term addition of aromatic rich biochar would increase the aromatic dom composition such as dbc in soil derived dom linearly with increasing cumulative biochar dose and 2 the altered dom with higher aromaticity would increase the reactivity of dom in forming dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetonitriles hans as well as the toxicity of dbp mixture the present study will provide new insights for the possible linkage between the increasing biochar application and drinking water safety 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling two experimental sites with 5 and 11 years of biochar addition were selected the first site 38 07 n 106 11 e is located in yesheng town in ningxia china denoted as s ningxia hereafter wang et al 2017 a temperate continental climate dominates the region with a mean annual temperature of 9 4 c and a mean annual precipitation of 192 mm its soil was classified as anthropogenic alluvial soil with a silt loam texture 18 2 clay 53 8 silt and 28 0 sand and a bulk density of 1 33 g cm the biochar addition at this site started in 2013 with four treatments control without biochar addition c0 and biochar addition at 4 5 t ha yr c1 9 0 t ha yr c2 and 13 5 t ha yr c3 each treatment had three replicate plots 30 m 20 m all plots were separated with plastic film up to 130 cm deep to prevent water interchange between adjacent plots wang et al 2017 the other site is located in an experimental station 36 57 n 117 58 e in huantai county shandong china referred to as s shandong hereafter du et al 2017 it has temperate continental monsoon climate conditions and a mean annual temperature of 12 4 c the mean annual rainfall is 600 mm the soil is a fluvic cambisol with a sandy loam texture 2 3 clay 26 9 silt and 70 8 sand well drained and a density of 1 52 g cm3 the continuous biochar addition experiment initiated in july 2007 had a randomized block design with three treatments i e control no biochar addition c0 and biochar addition at 4 5 t ha yr c1 and at 9 0 t ha yr c2 each treatment had three replicate plots and the plot size was 6 m 6 m zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 for both sites biochar was purchased from a local company the biochar was consistently produced by the pyrolysis of crushed corncob in an open top concrete tank at 360 c for 24 h the biochar had a density of 0 297 g cm3 and contained 65 7 c 1 4 h 0 5 o 29 9 n 0 9 available p and 1 6 available k zhang et al 2013 biochar was incorporated into the soil via rotary tillage with a tillage depth of approximately 16 cm before crop sowing the aboveground crop residues were removed prior to tillage after maize harvest soils were collected in august 2018 for s ningxia and in september 2018 for s shandong two soil cores of the upper 0 10 cm in each plot were collected and mixed as a composite sample the soils were freeze dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve and plant residues including fine roots were carefully removed 2 2 dom extraction and characterization the water soluble organic matter in the soils from the control and biochar added plots was extracted with milli q water at a soil to water ratio of 1 5 wang et al 2015b mixing was performed on a reciprocating shaker at room temperature and at a rotary speed of 200 rpm for 2 h the supernatant was filtered through a prerinsed 0 45 µm polyethersulfone pes membrane millipore and stored at 4 c before further analysis the water extracts of three freshly made biochar samples from the local company were obtained using the same extraction and filtration methods the analysis of the general water quality and optical spectroscopy for all filtered water were as previously described ye et al 2019 specifically the ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined using a benchtop meter hq440d with an intellical phc201 ph probe and a cdc401 conductivity probe hach loveland usa the doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were measured with a total organic carbon total nitrogen analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu tokyo japan the inorganic nh4 n and nox n were analyzed using an automated discrete analyzer dechem tech cleverchem 380 hamburg germany and the dissolved organic nitrogen don concentration was calculated as the difference between the total and inorganic nitrogen concentrations ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer aqualog kyoto horiba the eem data were all corrected for background and inner filter effects and then transformed into raman unit r u murphy et al 2013 commonly used spectroscopic indices were calculated fellman et al 2010 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 in l mg c m an indicator for the dom aromaticity was calculated by dividing the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration karanfil et al 2002 the e2 e3 ratio an index that is inversely correlated with the dom molecular size was calculated as the absorbance at 254 nm divided by the absorbance at 365 nm peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the freshness index β α an index for the contribution of the recently produced autochthonous dom was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity at 380 nm divided by the maximum emission intensity between 420 and 435 nm with 310 nm excitation wilson and xenopoulos 2008 the fluorescence index fi an indicator for dom source refers to the ratio of the emission wavelengths at 470 and 520 nm with a fixed excitation at 370 nm cory et al 2010 the humification index hix which is positively linked to the humification degree was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity area of 435 480 nm to that of 300 345 nm with a fixed excitation at 254 nm ohno 2002 the samples were also analyzed by ft icr ms to obtain molecular level dom information specifically solid phase extraction spe was performed with varian bond elute ppl cartridges which recovered 54 59 of the doc dittmar et al 2008 the spe isolated dom was infused into the negative mode electrospray ionization esi unit at a flow rate of 120 µl h coupled with a 9 4 t apex ultra ft icr ms instrument bruker daltonics billerica ma usa pan et al 2020 wang et al 2019b the mass limits were set to m z range between 200 and 850 da the spectra were calibrated with an internal calibration list including 51 compounds covering the entire relevant mass range and the maximum mass error was 0 1 ppm the peaks with a signal to noise ratio 4 were used to calculate mathematically possible formulas tolic et al 2017 wagner et al 2015 the formulas were constrained based on element combinations of c0 100h0 200o0 50n0 10s0 2 h c 2 5 o c 1 2 n c 0 5 and s c 0 2 koch et al 2014 stubbins et al 2010 the modified aromaticity index aimod and double bond equivalent dbe were calculated for each assigned molecular formula to reflect the degrees of aromaticity and unsaturation respectively koch and dittmar 2016 the intensity weighted average h c and o c ratios aimod and dbe were calculated all formulas were divided into condensed aromatic aimod 0 67 aromatic 0 5 aimod 0 67 and nonaromatic aimod 0 5 categories koch and dittmar 2016 the accumulated frequency of the dom formulas with various aimod values were calculated and plotted seven biochemical groups were defined as follows 1 lipid like 0 o c 0 2 1 5 h c 2 3 and n c 0 04 2 protein like 0 2 o c 0 52 1 5 h c 2 2 and 0 178 n c 0 44 3 amino sugar like 0 52 o c 0 7 1 5 h c 2 2 and 0 07 n c 0 182 4 carbohydrate like 0 7 o c 1 1 1 5 h c 2 4 and n 0 5 dbc like aimod 0 67 and c 15 6 lignin like 0 25 o c 0 67 and 0 75 h c 1 5 and 7 tannin like 0 67 o c 0 97 and 0 53 h c 1 5 compounds this classification was based on the method in wu et al 2018 by modifying their classification of condensed aromatics 0 o c 0 25 and 0 5 h c 1 25 to dbc like compounds aimod 0 67 and c 15 dittmar and koch 2006 because the condensed aromatics characterized by 0 o c 0 25 and 0 5 h c 1 25 contained considerable amounts of nonaromatics in the present study all relative abundances of the different groups were determined as the ratio of their signals to the total signal of all assigned formulas 2 3 chlorination and dbp analysis the chlorine reactivity of the dom in the forming dbps was evaluated using the specific dbp formation potential sdbp fp in μg dbp mg doc i e the dbp formation potential normalized by the doc concentration based on a chlorination test wang et al 2015a briefly diluted water extract samples at 3 mg doc l were adjusted to a ph of 8 0 0 2 and chlorinated with naocl at a dose of cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh3 n wang et al 2015a the headspace free chlorinated samples in 60 ml brown amber bottles were incubated in dark at 25 0 5 c for 24 h then 10 ml aliquots were withdrawn for the measurements of the ph and residual chlorine concentration the residual chlorine in the remaining 50 ml samples was quenched and the dbps in the samples were immediately extracted with 4 5 ml methyl tert butyl ether mtbe three 1 ml mtbe aliquots were collected the first aliquot was analyzed by gas chromatograph coupled with electron capture detector gc ecd following us epa method 551 1 quantified dbps included four thms trichloromethanes bromodichloromethanes dibromochloromethanes and tribromomethanes four hans trichloroacetonitriles dichloroacetonitriles bromochloroacetonitriles and dibromoacetonitriles chloral hydrate chd and three haloketones hkts 1 1 dichloro 2 propanones 1 2 dibromo 3 propanones and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanones the other two aliquots were dried with high purity n2 99 99 and redissolved in 1 ml milli q water for the microtoxicity and genotoxicity tests respectively following similar method in yang et al 2015 it should be noted that the pretreatments of toxicity analyses e g liquid liquid extraction and n2 gas drying can possibly cause the loss of some dbps and may not reflect the absolute toxicity of the whole dbp mixture however these tests still allowed us to roughly assess the relative difference in toxicity between the dbp mixtures from the control and biochar added sites 2 4 toxicity evaluation the microtoxicity and genotoxicity levels of the dbp mixtures were evaluated by microtox tests and sos umu bioassays respectively han et al 2018 liu et al 2014 oda et al 1985 zito et al 2019 for the microtox tests the luminescence inhibition of photobacterium phosphoreum was adopted to estimate the microbial toxicity of the dbp mixtures briefly the luminescence intensity of p phosphoreum after 15 min of exposure to the treated water containing dbp mixtures was measured by a microplate reader varioscan thermo the percent light loss in the samples relative to the control sample was calculated as the inhibition rate which was further calibrated to the zn ii equivalent concentration to estimate the microtoxicity for the genotoxicity sos umu assays using salmonella nm2009 were conducted han et al 2018 oda et al 1985 the exposure of bacteria to genotoxic dbps causes dna damage that triggers the sos reaction and leads to the production of β galactosidase therefore the relative β galactosidase activity rga was calculated to indicate the overall genotoxicity the rga was calculated at the concentration at which the strain viability was above 50 positive results were designated as rga levels 1 5 fold higher than that of the control in a dose dependent manner the procedural details are described in methods s1 and s2 in the supporting information 2 5 statistics analysis statistical analysis was conducted using spss 20 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s post hoc test were performed to examine the differences between sites and between the control and biochar treatments for various parameters when the data did not satisfy the basic assumptions for one way anova they were tested with the nonparametric kruskal wallis test instead the differences were considered significant at p 0 05 all data are presented as the mean standard error se 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality of the water extracts of soils and biochar as s ningxia and s shandong had different climate and environmental conditions they had distinct water quality of the soil extracts table 1 compared to s ningxia s shandong had similar ph values 8 0 but significantly lower ec values and water extractable doc and tdn concentrations such differences can be attributed to its relatively humid climate and well drained soils and thus stronger leaching than those in s ningxia although biochar extracts had higher ph than soil extracts biochar addition did not significantly alter the ph in either site table 1 in s ningxia the ec values were not significantly altered by biochar addition table 1 in contrast the ec values were significantly elevated from 185 5 μs cm in c0 to 231 3 μs cm in c2 plots in s shandong which received the highest cumulative biochar dose table 1 although the fresh biochar contained higher doc tdn and don concentrations than the soils biochar addition did not significantly change the doc tdn or don concentrations in the soil extracts from either site table 1 similarly although previous laboratory and pilot scale studies liu et al 2019 mitchell et al 2015 mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 and a relatively short term field scale study 2 years zhang et al 2017 showed increased doc levels with biochar addition the long term study here is consistent with previous field studies that showed no altered doc level with 3 5 years of biochar addition dong et al 2019 lu et al 2020 the response of the doc level to biochar addition is likely controlled by abiotic processes of ph dependent sorption desorption of dom from native soil and raw aged biochar and biotic processes of doc production and consumption by microbes jones et al 2011 smebye et al 2016 the weak response of the doc level in this study can be attributed to the nonsignificant altered ph table 1 which means that the alkalinity effect of biochar in increasing the dom solubility smebye et al 2016 was not significant at the long term scale the dom possibly released from raw and aged biochar is also likely counteracted by dom sorption by a large amount of biochar and the possible suppressed microbial dom production from soil organic matter jones et al 2011 3 2 spectroscopic characteristics of the soil derived dom in addition to the dom quantity the dom quality indicated by the spectroscopic characteristics differed significantly between sites compared to s ningxia s shandong had significantly higher suva254 and hix values but lower fi e2 e3 and β α values table 1 as suva254 and hix are indicators of the dom aromaticity karanfil et al 2002 and humification degree ohno 2002 respectively the result suggests that the dom in s shandong had high aromaticity and humification degree low fi e2 e3 and β α values are usually indicative of smaller low molecular weight and fresh microbial contributions to the dom peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 wilson and xenopoulos 2008 therefore s shandong table 1 appeared to have smaller low mw and fresh microbial contributions to the dom possibly due to the stronger leaching of low molecular weight dom in this site although the water extracts of fresh biochar had significantly higher suva254 than the soil extracts the suva254 of the soil extracts was not significantly elevated with biochar addition table 1 in s ningxia suva254 even significantly declined from 1 50 0 05 in the c0 plots to 1 23 0 02 in the c1 plots p 0 05 but was not significantly altered by the c2 and c3 treatments table 1 the significantly lower suva254 in c1 than that in c0 in s ningxia contradicts our first hypothesis that biochar addition would increase the dom aromaticity in s shandong suva254 was not significantly altered the e2 e3 ratio was not significantly altered by any treatment in either site the water extracts of fresh biochar had significantly lower fi and higher hix and β α than the soil extracts table 1 in s ningxia the fi hix and β α values were not significantly altered by biochar addition possibly due to the shorter treatment and lower cumulative biochar dose table 1 with a longer treatment and more cumulative biochar addition in s shandong the fi value decreased with increasing biochar addition and was significantly lower in the c2 plots 1 45 0 00 than in the c0 plots 1 52 0 01 as a lower fi is indicative of smaller microbial contributions this result suggests that 11 years of biochar addition may decrease the microbial contributions to the dom composition in contrast to fi hix increased with increasing biochar addition and was significantly higher in the c2 plots 10 42 0 51 than in the c0 plots 7 73 0 31 as a high hix is indicative of a higher degree of humification this suggests that 11 years of biochar addition increased the humic like dom components in contrast to fi or hix the β α values were not significantly changed in either site overall the spectroscopic indices suggest that the 5 years of biochar addition in s ningxia did not significantly affect most of the dom characteristics but the 11 years of biochar addition in s shandong significantly increased the humic like dom and decreased the microbial derived dom 3 3 molecular signature of dom based on ft icr ms analysis the molecular level characteristics of dom indicated by ft icr ms further confirmed the between site dom difference table 2 the frequency distribution of the dom with various aimod levels clearly demonstrated the differences in mw and dom aromaticity among the samples fig 1 compared to s ningxia s shandong had dom with a similar average mw but a higher aromaticity and unsaturation degree as indicated by the higher average aimod and dbe values table 2 this result is consistent with the higher suva254 and hix values in s shandong than those in s ningxia and further supports the higher dom aromaticity in s shandong table 1 regarding dom composition s shandong had dom with a higher chon abundance lower cho and chos abundances a much higher abundance of dbc like components lower abundances of lignin carbohydrate amino sugar and protein like components and a lower abundance of biolabile components as indicated by the lower mlbl value these results collectively suggest that compared to s ningxia less biolabile dom may have led to the lower microbial contributions to the dom in s shandong the impacts of biochar addition on the molecular level characteristics of dom were also assessed by ft icr ms the average dbe and aimod values table 2 and the accumulated frequency of the different formulas with various aimod values fig 1 showed that the dom aromaticity increased with increasing biochar addition except in c1 in s ningxia this result is consistent with the decreased average suva254 and hix values in c1 in s ningxia but the average suva254 and hix values increased in most of the other treatments a further examination of the dom formulas showed that the decreased dom aromaticity in c1 in s ningxia was mainly caused by a large increase in the nonaromatic octadecanoic acid and hexadecanoic acid which commonly originate from plant waxes wang et al 2019a c1 in s ningxia received the lowest cumulative biochar addition the decreased dom aromaticity occurred possibly because the small amount of biochar did not have sufficient active sorption sites the increased aromaticity in the other biochar added plots can be attributed to the increased aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds leached from the biochar table 2 compared to the cumulative biochar dose the treatment time 5 vs 11 years seems to exert a greater impact on the response of the dom aromaticity for example the c1 and c2 plots in s shandong received different biochar doses but showed a similar frequency distribution of the aromatic and condensed aromatic dom fig 1 additionally the c1 plots in s shandong received much lower cumulative biochar doses than the c3 plots in s ningxia but exhibited much larger increases in the abundances of the aromatic and condensed aromatic dom clearly these results support that longer term biochar aging in the field environment may release more aromatics and condensed aromatics to the soil and alter the soil derived dom to a higher degree biochar addition also changed the dom molecular composition table 2 and fig 2 in contrast to our first hypothesis the aromatic and condensed dom components such as dbc were not linearly correlated with the cumulative biochar dose but appeared to be linked to the treatment duration while 5 years of biochar addition did not increase the relative abundance of dbc like components by more than 1 6 in s ningxia 11 years of biochar addition increased the abundance of dbc like components by at least 7 3 in s shandong fig 2 our results showed that the biochar we used contained a significant amount of condensed aromatic dbc table 2 however we show that 11 years of practical biochar addition could considerably increase the dbc abundance in dom but 5 years of addition did not in addition the dbc in s shandong exhibited a high chemical diversity and contained more high mw c number ranging from 15 to 31 and o rich o number ranging from 2 to 16 species than that in s ningxia c number ranging from 15 to 26 and o number ranging from 2 to 13 this further supports that fresh biochar may not be an important source of dbc and long term aging is needed to yield a substantial amount of dbc in the field abiven et al 2011 braun et al 2020 biochar addition consistently increased the cho abundance but decreased that of chon chos table 2 and amino sugar like components fig 2 regardless of the biochar dose or the site the decreases in chon and chos can be explained by the dilution effect resulting from the cho released from biochar 72 6 of cho in biochar derived dom as shown in table 2 and possible preferential absorption of chon and chos onto biochar luo et al 2019 microbes usually contain more chon and chos than do plants roth et al 2019 and amino sugars are common markers for microbes glaser et al 2004 these results are consistent with the decreasing tendency of the average fi value with increasing biochar addition except c1 in s ningxia in addition all biochar addition treatments decreased the mlbl level except c1 in s ningxia the results collectively suggest that long term biochar addition exerted a suppression effect on microbes and decreased the microbial contributions to dom possibly by reducing the biolabile substrates this observation differs from the findings in many relatively short term studies which showed stimulated microbial activities due to the labile organic carbon in fresh biochar mitchell et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 this may occur because as the treatment duration increased long term biochar addition supplied more aged biochar than fresh biochar and strengthened the sorption and immobilization of labile dom and thus suppressed the microbial production of dom overall ft icr ms analysis supports the spectroscopic results and provides further molecular level evidence of the biochar induced increases in aromatics and condensed aromatics and decreases in microbial derived and n and s containing dom in contrast to our first hypothesis the responses of the dom aromaticity and dbc composition did not vary linearly with the cumulative biochar dose but revealed considerable between site differences three key factors can influence the performance of biochar application to soils tisserant and cherubini 2019 1 production conditions during biochar pyrolysis 2 field management of biochar and 3 soil conditions and background climate as the biochar type and application procedure were identical in both sites the difference is unlikely to be induced by the first factor the longer field management time and more favorable soil and climate conditions for aging in s shandong appear to be the major reasons compared to the 5 year treatment in s ningxia the 11 year treatment in s shandong supplied a higher proportion of aged biochar instead of fresh biochar thus allowing a higher dbc release during biochar decondensation abiven et al 2011 and strengthening the sorption process with increasing cumulative biochar dose in addition the higher mean annual precipitation 600 vs 192 mm and temperature 12 4 vs 9 4 c and better drained soils in s shandong than those in s ningxia are more favorable for biochar aging these between site differences can explain why low mw and lipid like dom slightly increased with the biochar treatment in s ningxia considerable dom release from fresh biochar but decreased in s shandong considerable dom adsorption onto aged biochar why chos decreased to a greater extent in s shandong higher chos sorption by more cumulative biochar luo et al 2015 and why dbc increased only slightly in s ningxia but greatly increased in s shandong considerable dbc released from aged biochar abiven et al 2011 overall the present study highlights how the spectroscopic and molecular characteristics of soil derived dom may respond to long term biochar addition under field conditions which could not be well captured by previous short term or laboratory scale studies 3 4 formation and toxicity of dbp mixtures the sdbp fp values of the dom derived from the soils in s ningxia and s shandong were evaluated using chlorination tests the mean sdbp fp values for the thms hans chd and hkts in the c0 plots were significantly and consistently higher in s shandong than those in s ningxia fig 3 thus the terrestrial dom from s shandong is more reactive than that from s ningxia to yield dbps such as thms and hans this further supports that the terrestrial dbp precursor is highly site specific the largest between site difference in sdbp fp occurred for the thms among all studied dbps as aromatic humic like dom has long been considered a thm precursor hua et al 2014 this result could be explained by the higher abundance of aromatic humic like dom components in s shandong most of the sdbp fp values exhibited slight decrease trends with increasing biochar addition in both sites however most of the percentage changes relative to the control were within 10 and none of the intertreatment differences within a site were statistically significant all at p 0 05 fig 3 in s ningxia the specific thm formation potential sthm fp was 26 38 4 38 µg mg doc in c0 21 20 0 45 µg mg doc in c1 a percentage change of 20 relative to the c0 control 23 24 3 09 µg mg doc in c2 12 and 19 95 1 85 µg mg doc in c3 24 fig 3 in s shandong sthm fp was 39 95 3 13 µg mg doc in c0 36 05 0 78 µg mg doc in c1 10 and 38 93 1 21 µg mg doc in c2 3 fig 3 although the dbc was suspected to be an important thm precursor lee et al 2018 the increased dbc due to long term biochar addition particularly in s shandong was not accompanied by an increased dom reactivity in forming thms the specific han formation potential shan fp of the dom showed strict decrease trends with increasing biochar addition in both sites shan fp decreased from 2 73 0 07 µg mg doc in c0 to 2 57 0 07 µg mg doc in c3 6 in s ningxia and from 2 99 0 18 µg mg doc in c0 to 2 77 0 08 µg mg doc in c2 8 in s shandong fig 3 as nitrogenous dom components such as proteins and amino acids are known precursors of hans le roux et al 2016 the decreasing trend of shan fp is consistent with the decreased abundances chon and protein like components in the ft icr ms analysis with biochar addition the specific chd formation potential schd fp exhibited a negligible change 5 with biochar addition in s ningxia and showed a slight decrease trend from 2 31 0 02 µg mg doc in c0 to 2 05 0 06 µg mg doc in c2 11 in s shandong the specific hkt formation potential shkt fp experienced a negligible change 5 with biochar addition in both sites despite the small between site difference in sthm fp the microtoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbp mixtures yielded from dom chlorination were not significantly different between sites p 0 05 or between the treatments p 0 05 fig s3 after being concentrated 11 times the dbp mixtures had an average microtoxicity equivalent to a 0 75 0 89 mg l zn ii concentration in s ningxia and a 0 61 0 82 mg l zn ii concentration in s shandong as the average rga values of the dbp mixtures were all below the toxicity threshold of 1 5 even when the dbp mixtures have been concentrated 11 times none of the dbp mixtures were found to be genotoxic based on the chlorination test of doc at 3 mg l as opposed to our second hypothesis neither the formation nor the toxicity of the dbp mixtures from dom chlorination significantly increased with biochar addition even when the humic like and aromatic dom components had increased these results highly differ from the findings on wildfire affected dom and contradict a previous hypothesis whereby thermally impacted dom such as dbc would be an important dbp precursor lee et al 2018 wang et al 2015b however they could be explained by a previous laboratory controlled burning experiment in which thermal oxidation greatly increased the precursors of nitrogenous and brominated dbps but oxygen lacking pyrolysis did not wang et al 2015a while the dissolved black nitrogen from thermal oxidation was proposed as a highly reactive precursor of nitrogenous dbps cawley et al 2017 wang et al 2015b we did not find a high abundance of dissolved black nitrogen with biochar addition and the chon and protein like dom common nitrogenous dbp precursor had even decreased this clearly explains why the nitrogenous dbp precursor in soil was increased by wildfires but not by long term biochar addition in this study 3 5 limitation and perspectives as a first attempt to examine the impact of field scale biochar addition on terrestrial dbp precursors we did not find a significant alteration in the formation potential of thms hans chd and hkts or the toxicity levels from chlorinating soil derived dom note that this study used one type of carbon rich biochar in two alkaline farmlands and the terrestrial dbp precursors will also be affected by different types of biochar and site specific environmental conditions therefore our results may not be directly extrapolated to all field conditions with addition of various types and doses of biochar e g those with high nitrogen content in addition we only examined limited types of dbp species and used two methods to evaluate the toxicity of dbp mixtures more studied in the future are needed to further examine whether the long term biochar addition in watersheds with various biochar types and doses in various locations will alter the formation of other dbp species in additional to thms hans chd and hkts particular for those with higher polarity and molecular size and the overall toxicity of the whole dbp mixtures to various types of organisms 4 conclusions using field scale biochar addition experimental sites this study demonstrated that long term biochar addition could significantly alter the soil derived dom characteristics but did not increase the terrestrial precursors of thms hans chd and hkts specifically 11 years of biochar addition significantly increased the aromatics and condensed aromatics and decreased the microbial derived dom while 5 years of biochar addition did not based on the time dependent responses of dom to biochar addition we propose that a longer biochar addition period with more aged biochar may cause different environmental consequences from what we learned from relatively short term or laboratory scale studies importantly this field based long term study did not find significantly altered dbp formation potential or toxicity levels from chlorinating soil derived dom and no evidence was revealed of a possible threat to drinking water safety even after 11 years of biochar addition more research should be performed to fully evaluate the relation between long term biochar application in watersheds

17613,biochar is widely and increasingly applied to farmlands however it remains unclear how long term biochar addition alters the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of soil derived dissolved organic matter dom an important terrestrial disinfection byproduct dbp precursor in watersheds here we analyzed the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of soil derived dom and the formation and toxicity of dbp mixtures from dom chlorination for two long term 5 and 11 years biochar addition experimental farmlands as indicated by spectroscopic indices and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analyses 11 years of biochar addition could increase the humic like and aromatic and condensed aromatic dom and decrease the microbial derived dom while 5 years of biochar addition at the other site did not the response of condensed aromatic dissolved black carbon did not increase with increasing cumulative biochar dose but appeared to be affected by biochar aging time despite the possible increase in aromatic dom biochar addition neither increased the reactivity of dom in forming trihalomethanes haloacetonitriles chloral hydrates or haloketones nor significantly increased the microtoxicity or genotoxicity of the dbp mixture this study indicates that biochar addition in watersheds may not deteriorate the drinking water quality via the export of terrestrial dbp precursors like wildfire events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar amendment water extractable organic matter disinfection by products formation toxicity 1 introduction biochar is a carbon rich organic substance produced from the pyrolysis of biomass residues under oxygen limited conditions lehmann and joseph 2015 sohi 2012 biochar addition could improve soil physics and fertility increase crop growth immobilize pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions lehmann and joseph 2015 liu et al 2019 therefore biochar has been increasingly applied as a soil additive for agricultural management soil remediation and carbon sequestration meyer et al 2012 sohi 2012 spokas et al 2012 the global average biochar production rate amounted to 50 270 tg yr 1 with a steady increase of more than 12 per year jha et al 2010 the amount of carbon stored in biochar may reach 9 5 pg yr 1 by 2100 and more than 80 of the applied biochar tends to be retained in the soil lehmann et al 2006 as biochar is increasingly produced and applied to soils globally soil properties and soil derived dissolved organic matter dom are expected to be increasingly impacted by long term biochar addition given the critical roles of soil derived dom in fueling soil microbes regulating the biogeochemical cycle and serving as a terrestrial disinfection byproduct dbp precursor mikkelson et al 2013 roth et al 2019 characterizing the dom derived from biochar or biochar added soils has been a topic of increasing interest lee et al 2018 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2019 smebye et al 2016 uchimiya et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 however the mechanism by which biochar addition alters the quantity and quality of soil derived dom remains a highly contended issue biochar application to soil can increase liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 decrease shin et al 1999 or cause no change dong et al 2019 lu et al 2020 in the concentration or storage of the dissolved organic carbon doc a proxy for the dom quantity as affected by biochar properties and multiple processes such as dom release from fresh and aged biochar and native soil organic matter dom sorption by biochar and dom processing by biochar altered microbes smebye et al 2016 in addition the molecular weight mw and aromaticity indicated by optical spectroscopy of dom appeared to increase one or several days after biochar addition to soils eykelbosh et al 2015 smebye et al 2016 but no significant alteration was observed after 2 or 5 years of biochar addition to field soils dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 note that most current knowledge has been derived from laboratory scale and short term studies it may hardly be extrapolated to field scale conditions with long term biochar aging plant soil microbe interactions and dom translocation e g sorption and leaching and transformation uchimiya et al 2016 biochar aging may alter the dom quantity and quality quan et al 2020 and it was hypothesized that only long term aging may yield condensed aromatic dissolved black carbon dbc braun et al 2020 while a few relatively short term studies have tested how the optical properties of dom may respond to biochar addition eykelbosh et al 2015 smebye et al 2016 the quantity and molecular level characteristics of dom derived from farmlands with biochar addition for longer than a decade remain unexamined terrestrial dom is increasingly recognized as an important precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in watersheds mikkelson et al 2013 particularly after storm events majidzadeh et al 2020 both the dom quantity and quality may affect the formation potential of dbps of various species and toxicity levels marhaba and van 2000 when the dom in watersheds is altered by anthropogenic activity e g effluent organic matter inputs hur et al 2013 or global change e g beetle infection mikkelson et al 2013 and wildfires wang et al 2015b in watersheds and then reacts with the disinfectants in water treatment plants altered formation and toxicity of the resulting dbp mixture are expected recently thermally impacted dom due to wildfires in watersheds was reported to decrease the dom coagulation efficiency and increase the dom reactivity to yield toxic nitrogenous dbps cawley et al 2017 wang et al 2015b as another type of thermally impacted dom the dom leaching from biochar added lands is also expected to be altered due to the increasing application of biochar lehmann et al 2006 although both biochar and wildfire ash derived dom are affected by thermal processes the former mainly experienced pyrolysis while the latter was affected by both combustion and pyrolysis thus their characteristics and chlorine reactivity may not have the same responses to the thermal process recently a laboratory scale study suggested that the condensed aromatics leached from sludge corn and rice biochars may be important dbp precursors lee et al 2018 however it remains unknown whether the long term field application of biochar may alter the formation and toxicity of dbp mixture similar to wildfire events here we implemented two long term 5 and 11 years biochar addition experimental sites to investigate the effects of biochar addition on the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of soil derived dom using optical spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms respectively additionally we analyzed the formation and toxicity microtoxicity and genotoxicity of dbp mixtures with and without biochar impact using chlorination and microtox and sos umu bioassays we hypothesized that 1 the long term addition of aromatic rich biochar would increase the aromatic dom composition such as dbc in soil derived dom linearly with increasing cumulative biochar dose and 2 the altered dom with higher aromaticity would increase the reactivity of dom in forming dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetonitriles hans as well as the toxicity of dbp mixture the present study will provide new insights for the possible linkage between the increasing biochar application and drinking water safety 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling two experimental sites with 5 and 11 years of biochar addition were selected the first site 38 07 n 106 11 e is located in yesheng town in ningxia china denoted as s ningxia hereafter wang et al 2017 a temperate continental climate dominates the region with a mean annual temperature of 9 4 c and a mean annual precipitation of 192 mm its soil was classified as anthropogenic alluvial soil with a silt loam texture 18 2 clay 53 8 silt and 28 0 sand and a bulk density of 1 33 g cm the biochar addition at this site started in 2013 with four treatments control without biochar addition c0 and biochar addition at 4 5 t ha yr c1 9 0 t ha yr c2 and 13 5 t ha yr c3 each treatment had three replicate plots 30 m 20 m all plots were separated with plastic film up to 130 cm deep to prevent water interchange between adjacent plots wang et al 2017 the other site is located in an experimental station 36 57 n 117 58 e in huantai county shandong china referred to as s shandong hereafter du et al 2017 it has temperate continental monsoon climate conditions and a mean annual temperature of 12 4 c the mean annual rainfall is 600 mm the soil is a fluvic cambisol with a sandy loam texture 2 3 clay 26 9 silt and 70 8 sand well drained and a density of 1 52 g cm3 the continuous biochar addition experiment initiated in july 2007 had a randomized block design with three treatments i e control no biochar addition c0 and biochar addition at 4 5 t ha yr c1 and at 9 0 t ha yr c2 each treatment had three replicate plots and the plot size was 6 m 6 m zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 for both sites biochar was purchased from a local company the biochar was consistently produced by the pyrolysis of crushed corncob in an open top concrete tank at 360 c for 24 h the biochar had a density of 0 297 g cm3 and contained 65 7 c 1 4 h 0 5 o 29 9 n 0 9 available p and 1 6 available k zhang et al 2013 biochar was incorporated into the soil via rotary tillage with a tillage depth of approximately 16 cm before crop sowing the aboveground crop residues were removed prior to tillage after maize harvest soils were collected in august 2018 for s ningxia and in september 2018 for s shandong two soil cores of the upper 0 10 cm in each plot were collected and mixed as a composite sample the soils were freeze dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve and plant residues including fine roots were carefully removed 2 2 dom extraction and characterization the water soluble organic matter in the soils from the control and biochar added plots was extracted with milli q water at a soil to water ratio of 1 5 wang et al 2015b mixing was performed on a reciprocating shaker at room temperature and at a rotary speed of 200 rpm for 2 h the supernatant was filtered through a prerinsed 0 45 µm polyethersulfone pes membrane millipore and stored at 4 c before further analysis the water extracts of three freshly made biochar samples from the local company were obtained using the same extraction and filtration methods the analysis of the general water quality and optical spectroscopy for all filtered water were as previously described ye et al 2019 specifically the ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined using a benchtop meter hq440d with an intellical phc201 ph probe and a cdc401 conductivity probe hach loveland usa the doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were measured with a total organic carbon total nitrogen analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu tokyo japan the inorganic nh4 n and nox n were analyzed using an automated discrete analyzer dechem tech cleverchem 380 hamburg germany and the dissolved organic nitrogen don concentration was calculated as the difference between the total and inorganic nitrogen concentrations ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer aqualog kyoto horiba the eem data were all corrected for background and inner filter effects and then transformed into raman unit r u murphy et al 2013 commonly used spectroscopic indices were calculated fellman et al 2010 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 in l mg c m an indicator for the dom aromaticity was calculated by dividing the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration karanfil et al 2002 the e2 e3 ratio an index that is inversely correlated with the dom molecular size was calculated as the absorbance at 254 nm divided by the absorbance at 365 nm peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the freshness index β α an index for the contribution of the recently produced autochthonous dom was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity at 380 nm divided by the maximum emission intensity between 420 and 435 nm with 310 nm excitation wilson and xenopoulos 2008 the fluorescence index fi an indicator for dom source refers to the ratio of the emission wavelengths at 470 and 520 nm with a fixed excitation at 370 nm cory et al 2010 the humification index hix which is positively linked to the humification degree was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity area of 435 480 nm to that of 300 345 nm with a fixed excitation at 254 nm ohno 2002 the samples were also analyzed by ft icr ms to obtain molecular level dom information specifically solid phase extraction spe was performed with varian bond elute ppl cartridges which recovered 54 59 of the doc dittmar et al 2008 the spe isolated dom was infused into the negative mode electrospray ionization esi unit at a flow rate of 120 µl h coupled with a 9 4 t apex ultra ft icr ms instrument bruker daltonics billerica ma usa pan et al 2020 wang et al 2019b the mass limits were set to m z range between 200 and 850 da the spectra were calibrated with an internal calibration list including 51 compounds covering the entire relevant mass range and the maximum mass error was 0 1 ppm the peaks with a signal to noise ratio 4 were used to calculate mathematically possible formulas tolic et al 2017 wagner et al 2015 the formulas were constrained based on element combinations of c0 100h0 200o0 50n0 10s0 2 h c 2 5 o c 1 2 n c 0 5 and s c 0 2 koch et al 2014 stubbins et al 2010 the modified aromaticity index aimod and double bond equivalent dbe were calculated for each assigned molecular formula to reflect the degrees of aromaticity and unsaturation respectively koch and dittmar 2016 the intensity weighted average h c and o c ratios aimod and dbe were calculated all formulas were divided into condensed aromatic aimod 0 67 aromatic 0 5 aimod 0 67 and nonaromatic aimod 0 5 categories koch and dittmar 2016 the accumulated frequency of the dom formulas with various aimod values were calculated and plotted seven biochemical groups were defined as follows 1 lipid like 0 o c 0 2 1 5 h c 2 3 and n c 0 04 2 protein like 0 2 o c 0 52 1 5 h c 2 2 and 0 178 n c 0 44 3 amino sugar like 0 52 o c 0 7 1 5 h c 2 2 and 0 07 n c 0 182 4 carbohydrate like 0 7 o c 1 1 1 5 h c 2 4 and n 0 5 dbc like aimod 0 67 and c 15 6 lignin like 0 25 o c 0 67 and 0 75 h c 1 5 and 7 tannin like 0 67 o c 0 97 and 0 53 h c 1 5 compounds this classification was based on the method in wu et al 2018 by modifying their classification of condensed aromatics 0 o c 0 25 and 0 5 h c 1 25 to dbc like compounds aimod 0 67 and c 15 dittmar and koch 2006 because the condensed aromatics characterized by 0 o c 0 25 and 0 5 h c 1 25 contained considerable amounts of nonaromatics in the present study all relative abundances of the different groups were determined as the ratio of their signals to the total signal of all assigned formulas 2 3 chlorination and dbp analysis the chlorine reactivity of the dom in the forming dbps was evaluated using the specific dbp formation potential sdbp fp in μg dbp mg doc i e the dbp formation potential normalized by the doc concentration based on a chlorination test wang et al 2015a briefly diluted water extract samples at 3 mg doc l were adjusted to a ph of 8 0 0 2 and chlorinated with naocl at a dose of cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh3 n wang et al 2015a the headspace free chlorinated samples in 60 ml brown amber bottles were incubated in dark at 25 0 5 c for 24 h then 10 ml aliquots were withdrawn for the measurements of the ph and residual chlorine concentration the residual chlorine in the remaining 50 ml samples was quenched and the dbps in the samples were immediately extracted with 4 5 ml methyl tert butyl ether mtbe three 1 ml mtbe aliquots were collected the first aliquot was analyzed by gas chromatograph coupled with electron capture detector gc ecd following us epa method 551 1 quantified dbps included four thms trichloromethanes bromodichloromethanes dibromochloromethanes and tribromomethanes four hans trichloroacetonitriles dichloroacetonitriles bromochloroacetonitriles and dibromoacetonitriles chloral hydrate chd and three haloketones hkts 1 1 dichloro 2 propanones 1 2 dibromo 3 propanones and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanones the other two aliquots were dried with high purity n2 99 99 and redissolved in 1 ml milli q water for the microtoxicity and genotoxicity tests respectively following similar method in yang et al 2015 it should be noted that the pretreatments of toxicity analyses e g liquid liquid extraction and n2 gas drying can possibly cause the loss of some dbps and may not reflect the absolute toxicity of the whole dbp mixture however these tests still allowed us to roughly assess the relative difference in toxicity between the dbp mixtures from the control and biochar added sites 2 4 toxicity evaluation the microtoxicity and genotoxicity levels of the dbp mixtures were evaluated by microtox tests and sos umu bioassays respectively han et al 2018 liu et al 2014 oda et al 1985 zito et al 2019 for the microtox tests the luminescence inhibition of photobacterium phosphoreum was adopted to estimate the microbial toxicity of the dbp mixtures briefly the luminescence intensity of p phosphoreum after 15 min of exposure to the treated water containing dbp mixtures was measured by a microplate reader varioscan thermo the percent light loss in the samples relative to the control sample was calculated as the inhibition rate which was further calibrated to the zn ii equivalent concentration to estimate the microtoxicity for the genotoxicity sos umu assays using salmonella nm2009 were conducted han et al 2018 oda et al 1985 the exposure of bacteria to genotoxic dbps causes dna damage that triggers the sos reaction and leads to the production of β galactosidase therefore the relative β galactosidase activity rga was calculated to indicate the overall genotoxicity the rga was calculated at the concentration at which the strain viability was above 50 positive results were designated as rga levels 1 5 fold higher than that of the control in a dose dependent manner the procedural details are described in methods s1 and s2 in the supporting information 2 5 statistics analysis statistical analysis was conducted using spss 20 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s post hoc test were performed to examine the differences between sites and between the control and biochar treatments for various parameters when the data did not satisfy the basic assumptions for one way anova they were tested with the nonparametric kruskal wallis test instead the differences were considered significant at p 0 05 all data are presented as the mean standard error se 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality of the water extracts of soils and biochar as s ningxia and s shandong had different climate and environmental conditions they had distinct water quality of the soil extracts table 1 compared to s ningxia s shandong had similar ph values 8 0 but significantly lower ec values and water extractable doc and tdn concentrations such differences can be attributed to its relatively humid climate and well drained soils and thus stronger leaching than those in s ningxia although biochar extracts had higher ph than soil extracts biochar addition did not significantly alter the ph in either site table 1 in s ningxia the ec values were not significantly altered by biochar addition table 1 in contrast the ec values were significantly elevated from 185 5 μs cm in c0 to 231 3 μs cm in c2 plots in s shandong which received the highest cumulative biochar dose table 1 although the fresh biochar contained higher doc tdn and don concentrations than the soils biochar addition did not significantly change the doc tdn or don concentrations in the soil extracts from either site table 1 similarly although previous laboratory and pilot scale studies liu et al 2019 mitchell et al 2015 mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 and a relatively short term field scale study 2 years zhang et al 2017 showed increased doc levels with biochar addition the long term study here is consistent with previous field studies that showed no altered doc level with 3 5 years of biochar addition dong et al 2019 lu et al 2020 the response of the doc level to biochar addition is likely controlled by abiotic processes of ph dependent sorption desorption of dom from native soil and raw aged biochar and biotic processes of doc production and consumption by microbes jones et al 2011 smebye et al 2016 the weak response of the doc level in this study can be attributed to the nonsignificant altered ph table 1 which means that the alkalinity effect of biochar in increasing the dom solubility smebye et al 2016 was not significant at the long term scale the dom possibly released from raw and aged biochar is also likely counteracted by dom sorption by a large amount of biochar and the possible suppressed microbial dom production from soil organic matter jones et al 2011 3 2 spectroscopic characteristics of the soil derived dom in addition to the dom quantity the dom quality indicated by the spectroscopic characteristics differed significantly between sites compared to s ningxia s shandong had significantly higher suva254 and hix values but lower fi e2 e3 and β α values table 1 as suva254 and hix are indicators of the dom aromaticity karanfil et al 2002 and humification degree ohno 2002 respectively the result suggests that the dom in s shandong had high aromaticity and humification degree low fi e2 e3 and β α values are usually indicative of smaller low molecular weight and fresh microbial contributions to the dom peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 wilson and xenopoulos 2008 therefore s shandong table 1 appeared to have smaller low mw and fresh microbial contributions to the dom possibly due to the stronger leaching of low molecular weight dom in this site although the water extracts of fresh biochar had significantly higher suva254 than the soil extracts the suva254 of the soil extracts was not significantly elevated with biochar addition table 1 in s ningxia suva254 even significantly declined from 1 50 0 05 in the c0 plots to 1 23 0 02 in the c1 plots p 0 05 but was not significantly altered by the c2 and c3 treatments table 1 the significantly lower suva254 in c1 than that in c0 in s ningxia contradicts our first hypothesis that biochar addition would increase the dom aromaticity in s shandong suva254 was not significantly altered the e2 e3 ratio was not significantly altered by any treatment in either site the water extracts of fresh biochar had significantly lower fi and higher hix and β α than the soil extracts table 1 in s ningxia the fi hix and β α values were not significantly altered by biochar addition possibly due to the shorter treatment and lower cumulative biochar dose table 1 with a longer treatment and more cumulative biochar addition in s shandong the fi value decreased with increasing biochar addition and was significantly lower in the c2 plots 1 45 0 00 than in the c0 plots 1 52 0 01 as a lower fi is indicative of smaller microbial contributions this result suggests that 11 years of biochar addition may decrease the microbial contributions to the dom composition in contrast to fi hix increased with increasing biochar addition and was significantly higher in the c2 plots 10 42 0 51 than in the c0 plots 7 73 0 31 as a high hix is indicative of a higher degree of humification this suggests that 11 years of biochar addition increased the humic like dom components in contrast to fi or hix the β α values were not significantly changed in either site overall the spectroscopic indices suggest that the 5 years of biochar addition in s ningxia did not significantly affect most of the dom characteristics but the 11 years of biochar addition in s shandong significantly increased the humic like dom and decreased the microbial derived dom 3 3 molecular signature of dom based on ft icr ms analysis the molecular level characteristics of dom indicated by ft icr ms further confirmed the between site dom difference table 2 the frequency distribution of the dom with various aimod levels clearly demonstrated the differences in mw and dom aromaticity among the samples fig 1 compared to s ningxia s shandong had dom with a similar average mw but a higher aromaticity and unsaturation degree as indicated by the higher average aimod and dbe values table 2 this result is consistent with the higher suva254 and hix values in s shandong than those in s ningxia and further supports the higher dom aromaticity in s shandong table 1 regarding dom composition s shandong had dom with a higher chon abundance lower cho and chos abundances a much higher abundance of dbc like components lower abundances of lignin carbohydrate amino sugar and protein like components and a lower abundance of biolabile components as indicated by the lower mlbl value these results collectively suggest that compared to s ningxia less biolabile dom may have led to the lower microbial contributions to the dom in s shandong the impacts of biochar addition on the molecular level characteristics of dom were also assessed by ft icr ms the average dbe and aimod values table 2 and the accumulated frequency of the different formulas with various aimod values fig 1 showed that the dom aromaticity increased with increasing biochar addition except in c1 in s ningxia this result is consistent with the decreased average suva254 and hix values in c1 in s ningxia but the average suva254 and hix values increased in most of the other treatments a further examination of the dom formulas showed that the decreased dom aromaticity in c1 in s ningxia was mainly caused by a large increase in the nonaromatic octadecanoic acid and hexadecanoic acid which commonly originate from plant waxes wang et al 2019a c1 in s ningxia received the lowest cumulative biochar addition the decreased dom aromaticity occurred possibly because the small amount of biochar did not have sufficient active sorption sites the increased aromaticity in the other biochar added plots can be attributed to the increased aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds leached from the biochar table 2 compared to the cumulative biochar dose the treatment time 5 vs 11 years seems to exert a greater impact on the response of the dom aromaticity for example the c1 and c2 plots in s shandong received different biochar doses but showed a similar frequency distribution of the aromatic and condensed aromatic dom fig 1 additionally the c1 plots in s shandong received much lower cumulative biochar doses than the c3 plots in s ningxia but exhibited much larger increases in the abundances of the aromatic and condensed aromatic dom clearly these results support that longer term biochar aging in the field environment may release more aromatics and condensed aromatics to the soil and alter the soil derived dom to a higher degree biochar addition also changed the dom molecular composition table 2 and fig 2 in contrast to our first hypothesis the aromatic and condensed dom components such as dbc were not linearly correlated with the cumulative biochar dose but appeared to be linked to the treatment duration while 5 years of biochar addition did not increase the relative abundance of dbc like components by more than 1 6 in s ningxia 11 years of biochar addition increased the abundance of dbc like components by at least 7 3 in s shandong fig 2 our results showed that the biochar we used contained a significant amount of condensed aromatic dbc table 2 however we show that 11 years of practical biochar addition could considerably increase the dbc abundance in dom but 5 years of addition did not in addition the dbc in s shandong exhibited a high chemical diversity and contained more high mw c number ranging from 15 to 31 and o rich o number ranging from 2 to 16 species than that in s ningxia c number ranging from 15 to 26 and o number ranging from 2 to 13 this further supports that fresh biochar may not be an important source of dbc and long term aging is needed to yield a substantial amount of dbc in the field abiven et al 2011 braun et al 2020 biochar addition consistently increased the cho abundance but decreased that of chon chos table 2 and amino sugar like components fig 2 regardless of the biochar dose or the site the decreases in chon and chos can be explained by the dilution effect resulting from the cho released from biochar 72 6 of cho in biochar derived dom as shown in table 2 and possible preferential absorption of chon and chos onto biochar luo et al 2019 microbes usually contain more chon and chos than do plants roth et al 2019 and amino sugars are common markers for microbes glaser et al 2004 these results are consistent with the decreasing tendency of the average fi value with increasing biochar addition except c1 in s ningxia in addition all biochar addition treatments decreased the mlbl level except c1 in s ningxia the results collectively suggest that long term biochar addition exerted a suppression effect on microbes and decreased the microbial contributions to dom possibly by reducing the biolabile substrates this observation differs from the findings in many relatively short term studies which showed stimulated microbial activities due to the labile organic carbon in fresh biochar mitchell et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 this may occur because as the treatment duration increased long term biochar addition supplied more aged biochar than fresh biochar and strengthened the sorption and immobilization of labile dom and thus suppressed the microbial production of dom overall ft icr ms analysis supports the spectroscopic results and provides further molecular level evidence of the biochar induced increases in aromatics and condensed aromatics and decreases in microbial derived and n and s containing dom in contrast to our first hypothesis the responses of the dom aromaticity and dbc composition did not vary linearly with the cumulative biochar dose but revealed considerable between site differences three key factors can influence the performance of biochar application to soils tisserant and cherubini 2019 1 production conditions during biochar pyrolysis 2 field management of biochar and 3 soil conditions and background climate as the biochar type and application procedure were identical in both sites the difference is unlikely to be induced by the first factor the longer field management time and more favorable soil and climate conditions for aging in s shandong appear to be the major reasons compared to the 5 year treatment in s ningxia the 11 year treatment in s shandong supplied a higher proportion of aged biochar instead of fresh biochar thus allowing a higher dbc release during biochar decondensation abiven et al 2011 and strengthening the sorption process with increasing cumulative biochar dose in addition the higher mean annual precipitation 600 vs 192 mm and temperature 12 4 vs 9 4 c and better drained soils in s shandong than those in s ningxia are more favorable for biochar aging these between site differences can explain why low mw and lipid like dom slightly increased with the biochar treatment in s ningxia considerable dom release from fresh biochar but decreased in s shandong considerable dom adsorption onto aged biochar why chos decreased to a greater extent in s shandong higher chos sorption by more cumulative biochar luo et al 2015 and why dbc increased only slightly in s ningxia but greatly increased in s shandong considerable dbc released from aged biochar abiven et al 2011 overall the present study highlights how the spectroscopic and molecular characteristics of soil derived dom may respond to long term biochar addition under field conditions which could not be well captured by previous short term or laboratory scale studies 3 4 formation and toxicity of dbp mixtures the sdbp fp values of the dom derived from the soils in s ningxia and s shandong were evaluated using chlorination tests the mean sdbp fp values for the thms hans chd and hkts in the c0 plots were significantly and consistently higher in s shandong than those in s ningxia fig 3 thus the terrestrial dom from s shandong is more reactive than that from s ningxia to yield dbps such as thms and hans this further supports that the terrestrial dbp precursor is highly site specific the largest between site difference in sdbp fp occurred for the thms among all studied dbps as aromatic humic like dom has long been considered a thm precursor hua et al 2014 this result could be explained by the higher abundance of aromatic humic like dom components in s shandong most of the sdbp fp values exhibited slight decrease trends with increasing biochar addition in both sites however most of the percentage changes relative to the control were within 10 and none of the intertreatment differences within a site were statistically significant all at p 0 05 fig 3 in s ningxia the specific thm formation potential sthm fp was 26 38 4 38 µg mg doc in c0 21 20 0 45 µg mg doc in c1 a percentage change of 20 relative to the c0 control 23 24 3 09 µg mg doc in c2 12 and 19 95 1 85 µg mg doc in c3 24 fig 3 in s shandong sthm fp was 39 95 3 13 µg mg doc in c0 36 05 0 78 µg mg doc in c1 10 and 38 93 1 21 µg mg doc in c2 3 fig 3 although the dbc was suspected to be an important thm precursor lee et al 2018 the increased dbc due to long term biochar addition particularly in s shandong was not accompanied by an increased dom reactivity in forming thms the specific han formation potential shan fp of the dom showed strict decrease trends with increasing biochar addition in both sites shan fp decreased from 2 73 0 07 µg mg doc in c0 to 2 57 0 07 µg mg doc in c3 6 in s ningxia and from 2 99 0 18 µg mg doc in c0 to 2 77 0 08 µg mg doc in c2 8 in s shandong fig 3 as nitrogenous dom components such as proteins and amino acids are known precursors of hans le roux et al 2016 the decreasing trend of shan fp is consistent with the decreased abundances chon and protein like components in the ft icr ms analysis with biochar addition the specific chd formation potential schd fp exhibited a negligible change 5 with biochar addition in s ningxia and showed a slight decrease trend from 2 31 0 02 µg mg doc in c0 to 2 05 0 06 µg mg doc in c2 11 in s shandong the specific hkt formation potential shkt fp experienced a negligible change 5 with biochar addition in both sites despite the small between site difference in sthm fp the microtoxicity and genotoxicity of the dbp mixtures yielded from dom chlorination were not significantly different between sites p 0 05 or between the treatments p 0 05 fig s3 after being concentrated 11 times the dbp mixtures had an average microtoxicity equivalent to a 0 75 0 89 mg l zn ii concentration in s ningxia and a 0 61 0 82 mg l zn ii concentration in s shandong as the average rga values of the dbp mixtures were all below the toxicity threshold of 1 5 even when the dbp mixtures have been concentrated 11 times none of the dbp mixtures were found to be genotoxic based on the chlorination test of doc at 3 mg l as opposed to our second hypothesis neither the formation nor the toxicity of the dbp mixtures from dom chlorination significantly increased with biochar addition even when the humic like and aromatic dom components had increased these results highly differ from the findings on wildfire affected dom and contradict a previous hypothesis whereby thermally impacted dom such as dbc would be an important dbp precursor lee et al 2018 wang et al 2015b however they could be explained by a previous laboratory controlled burning experiment in which thermal oxidation greatly increased the precursors of nitrogenous and brominated dbps but oxygen lacking pyrolysis did not wang et al 2015a while the dissolved black nitrogen from thermal oxidation was proposed as a highly reactive precursor of nitrogenous dbps cawley et al 2017 wang et al 2015b we did not find a high abundance of dissolved black nitrogen with biochar addition and the chon and protein like dom common nitrogenous dbp precursor had even decreased this clearly explains why the nitrogenous dbp precursor in soil was increased by wildfires but not by long term biochar addition in this study 3 5 limitation and perspectives as a first attempt to examine the impact of field scale biochar addition on terrestrial dbp precursors we did not find a significant alteration in the formation potential of thms hans chd and hkts or the toxicity levels from chlorinating soil derived dom note that this study used one type of carbon rich biochar in two alkaline farmlands and the terrestrial dbp precursors will also be affected by different types of biochar and site specific environmental conditions therefore our results may not be directly extrapolated to all field conditions with addition of various types and doses of biochar e g those with high nitrogen content in addition we only examined limited types of dbp species and used two methods to evaluate the toxicity of dbp mixtures more studied in the future are needed to further examine whether the long term biochar addition in watersheds with various biochar types and doses in various locations will alter the formation of other dbp species in additional to thms hans chd and hkts particular for those with higher polarity and molecular size and the overall toxicity of the whole dbp mixtures to various types of organisms 4 conclusions using field scale biochar addition experimental sites this study demonstrated that long term biochar addition could significantly alter the soil derived dom characteristics but did not increase the terrestrial precursors of thms hans chd and hkts specifically 11 years of biochar addition significantly increased the aromatics and condensed aromatics and decreased the microbial derived dom while 5 years of biochar addition did not based on the time dependent responses of dom to biochar addition we propose that a longer biochar addition period with more aged biochar may cause different environmental consequences from what we learned from relatively short term or laboratory scale studies importantly this field based long term study did not find significantly altered dbp formation potential or toxicity levels from chlorinating soil derived dom and no evidence was revealed of a possible threat to drinking water safety even after 11 years of biochar addition more research should be performed to fully evaluate the relation between long term biochar application in watersheds

17614,the forward osmosis reverse osmosis fo ro hybrid process has been extensively researched as part of attempts to reduce the high energy consumption of conventional seawater reverse osmosis in recent years fo operating conditions play a substantial role in the hybrid process dictating not only the performance of the entire system but also the propensity for fouling which deteriorates performance in long term field operations therefore determining the optimal fo operating conditions with regard to membrane fouling may promote sustainable operation through efficient fouling control this study thus evaluated the influence of each hydrodynamic operating condition feed flowrate draw flowrate and hydraulic pressure difference and their synergistic effects on fouling propensity in a pilot scale fo operation under seawater and municipal wastewater conditions fouling induced variation in water flux channel pressure drop diluted concentration and the resulting specific energy consumption sec were comparatively analyzed and utilized to project performance variation in a full scale fo ro system fouling induced performance reduction significantly varied depending on hydrodynamic operating conditions and the resultant fouling propensity during 15 days of continuous operation a high feed flowrate demonstrated a clear ability to mitigate fouling induced performance deterioration in all conditions a high draw flowrate turned out to be detrimental for fouling propensity since its high reverse solute flux accelerated fouling growth applying additional hydraulic pressure during fo operation caused a faster reduction of water flux and thus feed recovery and water production however these drawbacks could be compensated for by a 10 reduction in the required fo membrane area and an additional reduction in ro sec graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis fo ro hybrid process membrane fouling field operation process simulation 1 introduction forward osmosis fo is an osmotically driven membrane process odmp that is favored by low energy consumption mild operating pressure and reversible membrane fouling han et al 2014 kim et al 2014 lee et al 2017 mi and elimelech 2010 since the late 2000s fo has been researched in the setting of hybrid schemes integrated with various membrane processes such as reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration membrane distillation and electrodialysis akther et al 2015 among numerous niche applications the fo ro hybrid process has attracted the most attention due to its potential for low operational cost and less environmental impact in wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination hancock et al 2012 lutchmiah et al 2014 due to its low pressure nature fo has low fouling susceptibility but high fouling reversibility which originates from the looser and more sparse fouling layer on the membrane surface compared to the compacted dense fouling layer in high pressure ro lee et al 2010 siddiqui et al 2018 in order to facilitate sustainable fo operation in association with its low fouling propensity various fouling control strategies have been widely studied including surface modifications of the membrane in this respect several lab scale studies have demonstrated that a higher flowrate i e cross flow velocity and the presence of a feed spacer alleviated membrane fouling by increasing the shear force on the membrane surface boo et al 2013 lotfi et al 2018 several studies reported that fo can be operated with minimal membrane fouling below the critical flux condition nguyen et al 2019 nguyen et al 2020 in addition novel cleaning methods that do not use chemicals were proposed and demonstrated to facilitate sustainable fo operation blandin et al 2015 han et al 2016b mi and elimelech 2010 among the fouling control strategies in fo the most accessible and immediate approach in module scale operations is to control the operating conditions as doing so does not require any additional chemical dosage or extra devices while the feed flowrate i e the increase of cross flow velocity can be an important contributor to the mitigation of membrane fouling as proven in previous lab scale studies boo et al 2013 zou et al 2013 a high draw flowrate is known to enhance water flux by reducing dilutive external concentration polarization in fo operation kook et al 2017 muhammad alvan hidayat kook and kim 2018 lee et al 2020 several studies have investigated the effects of flowrate conditions on performance indicators in module scale fo operations such as the feed recovery rate kim et al 2018 water flux and reverse solute flux im et al 2018 the dilution ratio and specific energy consumption sec kook et al 2017 however the effect of hydraulic operating conditions on the initial performance of the process should be considered simultaneously with fouling behavior because such performance indicators gradually deteriorate under long term operation due to the effects of membrane fouling i e decreased flux and increased channel pressure drop these effects can lead to a discrepancy between the initial sec and the sec after long term operation since the fo sec is determined by water flux flowrate and pressure drop altaee et al 2014 meanwhile pressure assisted forward osmosis pafo has recently emerged as an alternative to replace fo in fo ro hybrid systems in pafo additional hydraulic pressure is applied purposely on the feed side thereby enhancing water flux and osmotic dilution pafo can be differentiated from fo on the basis of lab scale studies blandin et al 2013 oh et al 2014 and pilot based economic assessments kim et al 2018 kook et al 2018a which demonstrated that pafo can further reduce the overall economics of pafo ro systems however although fouling during fo operation has been extensively studied for many years research on fouling in pafo is still severely limited at the pilot scale level a study of a lab scale system blandin et al 2015 reported that hydraulic pressure in pafo led to more severe membrane fouling forming a compacted cake layer similarly pressure retarded osmosis another type of odmp using relatively high hydraulic pressure demonstrated a severer fouling propensity han et al 2018 2017 2016a although some studies have evaluated the performance of fo on the pilot scale those works used artificial seawater and tap water im et al 2018 kim et al 2017 kook et al 2018a and therefore did not resolve the effect of membrane fouling on process performance and economics however to project a realistic estimation of the techno economic feasibility of fo ro hybrid systems membrane fouling under field water conditions real seawater and secondary wastewater effluent and the resulting impacts on process performance need to be evaluated specifically the effects of hydraulic operating conditions need to be investigated to assess the long term operation of hybrid systems in terms of overall performance involving membrane fouling in the current study the effects of hydrodynamic operating conditions in fo spiral wound elements on organic fouling and the performance deterioration of a fo ro hybrid system were investigated the effects of feed flowrate draw flowrate hydraulic pressure difference and synergistic effects on fouling behavior and the resultant deterioration of performance parameters were evaluated under long term field operation conditions ro process simulations were employed to project the performance variation of the full scale hybrid system this study is intended to provide guidelines for determining the operating conditions of fo to ensure the sustainable operation of hybrid systems to the best of the authors knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate differences in fouling propensity according to hydrodynamic operating conditions in pilot scale fo operations with real seawater and wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 fo spiral wound element a spiral wound fo element csm fo 8040 toray chemical korea inc korea was used for the pilot scale operation this fo element consisted of 12 layers of membrane leaves that included two polyamide thin film composite flat sheet membranes two layers of tricot fine spacers and a diamond shaped spacer in the center enveloped by the two fine spacers the total effective membrane area of one element was 15 3 m2 a detailed description of the characteristics of the membrane can be found elsewhere additionally the structural characteristics of the element are illustrated in fig 2 2 2 characteristics of secondary wastewater effluent and seawater real secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and real seawater were pre treated with mesh tube filtration and a cartridge filter to be utilized as feed and draw solutions in the following fo operation each water quality parameter of the feed and draw solutions was measured before and after pretreatment tables 1 and 2 total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan suspended solids and the silt density index were determined using standard procedures astm d4189 072014 2014 ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex usa was used to analyze the cation content in each solution 2 3 fo pilot system design fig 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of the fo pilot system set up the system was equipped with four liquid transfer pumps grundfos product crn10 14 a fgj g e hqqe and crn3 5 a fgj g e hqqe denmark for feed and draw streams an automated pressure valve fci deltap valve g tech eng korea was installed at the outlet of the feed side the pilot system was fully controlled by a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system in connection with the scada system the automated pressure valve and the feed and draw pumps enabled automatic operation maintaining constant feed outlet pressure feed flowrate and draw flowrate regardless of any hydrodynamic changes that occurred during long term operation in this study the hydraulic pressure difference δ p which can be used to differentiate fo versus pafo operation was defined as the difference between the feed outlet and the draw inlet of the second element the fo membrane was oriented with the active layer facing the feed solution and the maximum allowable operating pressure on the feed side 7 bar and the ph 2 11 were kept within the manufacturer s specifications during operation since the pressure and flowrate were maintained constant by the designated conditions there was no pressure dependency on flowrate in this study pressure gauges end ress hauser cerabar s switzerland flowmeters end ress hauser promag 10 switzerland and total dissolved solids meters georg fischer signet 9900 transmitter switzerland were installed to monitor variations in pressure flowrate and concentration according to our previous works kook et al 2017 2018a having more than two fo membrane elements in a serial connection can be inefficient in terms of draw stream dilution and subsequent ro energy cost reduction accordingly two elements stored in separate pressure vessels ropv r8040b300s 1w 1d5d maximum pressure 21 bar china were serially connected to optimize the energy efficiency of the fo ro hybrid the feed and draw streams were not recirculated but were instead operated in a one way direction 2 4 operating conditions for fouling propensity analysis to investigate the synergistic effects of differences in the feed flowrate draw flowrate and hydraulic pressure difference on initial performance and fouling propensity six hydraulic operating conditions were formulated table 3 the base condition was postulated as a draw flowrate of 5 lpm liter per minute and a hydraulic pressure difference of 0 bar based on previous pilot studies using identical fo elements csm fo 8040 toray non base conditions were then established with a high draw flowrate and pressurization pafo mode which were separately set by increasing the draw flowrate from 5 lpm to 10 lpm and the hydraulic pressure difference from 0 bar to 2 bar in these three conditions low feed flowrate 10 lpm and high feed flowrate 40 lpm conditions were tested the cross flow velocity of each flowrate condition was computed considering the width and height of the feed and draw channel inlets and the number of leaves as illustrated in fig 2 the draw channel was somewhat narrower 40 cm than the feed channel 83 5 cm the height of each channel was assumed to be 1 2 mm feed and 1 4 mm draw based on its spacer thickness to avoid the effect of seasonal temperature changes on the process performance the duration of each operation was set as 15 days throughout operation the temperature of water was 18 1 6 c and 15 5 1 1 c for the feed and draw solutions respectively between each operation chemical and physical cleaning were performed until the initial flux and channel pressure drop fully recovered to ensure fair comparisons for chemical cleaning sodium hydroxide ph 11 and sulfuric acid ph 3 solutions were circulated to completely remove foulants on the membrane and channel surfaces the average water flux in each membrane element was computed using the following equation 1 j w q d o u t q d i n a m where jw is the average water flux l m2 h lmh am is the total membrane area in a single element m2 and qd out and qd in lpm are the draw flowrate measured at the inlet and outlet respectively it should be noted that average water flux in this study was defined by taking the average of the two fluxes in light of the serial element configuration reverse solute flux rsf the reverse permeation of draw solute from the draw solution into the feed solution phillip et al 2010 was determined based on the change of the feed flowrate and concentration between the inlet and outlet using the following equation 2 j s q f i n c f i n q f o u t c f o u t a m where js is the reverse solute flux mol m2 hour qf in and qf out are the feed flowrate measured at the inlet and outlet and cf in and cf out are the feed concentration measured at the inlet and outlet respectively 2 5 evaluation of specific energy consumption based on the inlet pressure in both the feed and draw channels pump efficiency and permeate flowrate fo sec was calculated as shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 sec p f q f i n p d q d i n 36 η q p 4 q p q d o u t where pf and pd bar are the inlet pressure of the feed and draw sides qf and qd lpm are the initial feed and draw flowrates η is the pump efficiency and qp lpm is the permeate flowrate the permeate flowrate was assumed to reflect a diluted draw stream the pump efficiency was assumed to be 0 85 2 6 wave simulation for swro sec water application value engine wave is a newly developed simulation software for water related processes by dupont based on older software rosa9 in order to project the sec of two stages of ro in association with the measured diluted concentration from the fo pilot i e the ro feed concentration 36 sets of wave simulations were conducted with ro recovery and feed concentration as independent variables varying from 40 to 80 and from 10 000 to 35 000 ppm respectively the sw30 xle 400i was assumed to be the model ro element and the target plant capacity was set as 100 000 m3 day energy saving by energy recovery devices was not considered in the simulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial water flux and reverse solute flux under different operating conditions initial water flux under each hydraulic operating condition was computed based on performance in the first 30 min which was assumed to reflect the initial performance without interference from membrane fouling as shown in fig 3 while there was no improvement in water flux of the first element as increased feed flowrate the water flux promoted with increasing high draw flowrate 2 1 2 2 lmh and pressurization 1 8 2 1 lmh conditions however the increase in water flux by increasing feed flow rate was found for the second element this can be probably attributed to the difference in the accumulated local concentration on the active layer surface due to mixing of the feed solution and rsf i e concentrative external concentration polarization cecp she et al 2016 increased draw flowrate leads to reduction of diluted icp and diluted ecp which resulted in enhancing the water flux im et al 2018 an increment of rsf is due to high draw flowrate and this fact also has been reported in other pilot studies im et al 2018 kook et al 2017 this phenomenon is attributed to an augmented local concentration in the support layer of the membrane due to the faster replenishment of the draw solution i e a higher draw flowrate meanwhile under conditions of pressurization rsf is suppressed as the hydraulic pressure reduces surface porosity and densifies the active layer kook et al 2018b however the increased water flux under pressurization also creates local increases in concentration on the active layer modifying the dependency of feed solution convection i e the feed flowrate on the resulting water flux a negligible effect of feed flowrate in the base condition neither a high draw flowrate nor pressurization has also been reported in other fo pilot studies im et al 2018 kook et al 2017 this result implies that when only initial water flux is considered in determining the optimal operating conditions the feed flowrate does not necessarily need to be high as long as the water flux reduction is not severe enough to deteriorate overall process performance 3 2 reduction of process performance under long term operation variations in water flux channel pressure drop and diluted concentration were evaluated under 15 days of 24 h continuous operation using the aforementioned hydraulic operating conditions these three factors can be used as indicators of fouling propensity as they are expected to change as a result of membrane fouling through membrane autopsy and scanning electron microscope sem analysis the presence of organic fouling on membrane surfaces was identified sem images of the fouled membrane are presented in figs s2 and s3 of the supplementary information 3 2 1 fouling induced water flux decline in field operations of fo the permeability of the membrane gradually decreases due to the adsorption of organic materials or the growth of biological fouling on the membrane surface which leads to a decline of the initial water flux fig 4 a illustrates the declining trend of water flux due to the effect of membrane fouling under long term operation the declining trend was different depending on the hydraulic operating conditions in all cases high feed flowrate conditions showed less fouling propensity as shown by the maintenance of higher water flux during operation this result is attributed to the additional shear force generated by the high feed cross flow velocity i e feed flowrate which hindered foulants from accumulating on the membrane surface however the effects of the feed flowrate on water flux reduction turned out to be different in each condition in fig 4b the apparent decrement of water flux and the reduction ratio for each condition normalized by initial water flux were compared in the base condition a high feed flow rate 40 lpm assists in decreasing considerably a reduction ratio of water flux from 22 9 to 6 4 i e a decrease by 16 5 however this condition exhibited a lower decrease in reduction ratio for the cases of the high draw flowrate 16 1 and pressurization 12 3 these results are attributed to that the higher rsf and the hydraulic pressure difference of the non base conditions high draw flowrate pressurization contributed more to fouling behavior than the feed flowrate difference as shown in fig 4b pressurization resulted in higher fouling propensity compared to other conditions as shown by both the flux decrement and the reduction ratio in this regard a previous study yun et al 2014 reported that fouling under pressure assisted osmosis pao was negligible while other studies blandin et al 2015 kim et al 2014 reported that a greater flux decline was clearly observed at a higher applied pressure during pao operation in their lab scale experiments in this respect the effect of hydraulic pressure on flux decline turned out to be non negligible in pilot scale field operations as it led to a 1 5 to 3 6 times higher decline in water flux in 15 days this difference is attributed to the compaction of the foulant cake by hydraulic pressure on the deformable colloidal organic foulant layer that induces additional resistance to water permeation moreover all the operating conditions showed periodic increases and decreases in water flux during the operating time this is mainly attributed to the formation of a loose fouling layer on the membrane surface which was regularly peeled off by shear stress of the cross flow velocity during fo and pafo operation lotfi et al 2017 3 2 2 role of reverse solute diffusion as a fouling promoter the other important factor that affects fouling propensity in fo is reverse solute diffusion rsd rsd can enhance fouling intensity through the reverse diffusion of divalent solutes e g magnesium or calcium ions from the draw solution into the feed solution promoting organic fouling growth rsd enhanced fouling is related to the type of draw solute the ability of the diffused draw solute to interact with the foulants in the feed solution and the rate of reverse diffusion of the draw solute i e rsf baoxia and elimelech 2010 boo et al 2013 lee et al 2010 of particular note an earlier study xie et al 2013 reported that the reverse diffusion of calcium ions caused more severe alginate fouling than was observed for magnesium ions since calcium forms much stronger complexes with the carboxylic group in organic foulant molecules they further reported that sodium ions had a negligible complex effect with macromolecular organics but could lead to an increase in local ionic strength near the membrane surface and enhance humic acid deposition as shown in table 1 calcium magnesium and sodium concentrations in typical seawater are dramatically higher than those in wastewater therefore the high rsf of such ions can enhance the fouling propensity in practical fo operations when using seawater as draw and wastewater as feed under pressurization the cake layer hindered the diffusion of solutes within the unstirred layer back to the bulk feed solution and thus increased the solute concentration near the membrane surface a phenomenon known as cake enhanced concentration polarization hoek and elimelech 2003 this phenomenon synergistically diminishes water flux in conjunction with a high rsf as shown in fig 4b these results demonstrate that rsd is an important factor both for losing draw solutes and for fouling propensity when seawater and wastewater are simultaneously used 3 2 3 increase of the pressure drop in the feed and draw channels no studies have yet specifically focused on the increment in the channel pressure drop caused by membrane fouling in fo elements however it is widely acknowledged that the channel pressure drop is caused by blockage of the membrane channels by colloids biological fouling and the growth of fouling cake layers on membrane and spacer surfaces fig 5 a and c shows the increasing trend and the increment of the feed channel pressure drop during 15 days of operation a high draw flowrate resulted in a noticeably higher feed pressure drop compared to other conditions while the increase in the feed pressure drop was marginal under pressurization as discussed in the previous section a high rsf promotes membrane fouling which explains why a high draw flowrate induced the highest feed pressure drop increment meanwhile pressurization can decrease the feed channel pressure drop as opposed to the tendency observed for severe water flux decline because the fouling cake layers are compacted and the feed channel expands as a result of high internal hydraulic pressure in contrast to the tendency observed for water flux decline a greater increase in the feed pressure drop was observed under a high feed flowrate in non pressurized conditions base condition high draw flowrate this is most likely because a high feed flowrate induced high contact efficiency of foulants to surfaces in channels however the effect of fouling in the draw channel is negligible because the rejection rate of organic or colloidal foulants in the feed solution by the fo membrane exceeds 99 and the draw solution has minimal fouling potential table 1 instead the increase in the draw pressure drop may be associated with an increase in the tortuosity of the draw channel under hydraulic pressure from the feed channel the increased tortuosity of the draw channel is most likely attributed to gradual stretching of the membrane into the openings between spacer filaments under long term pressurization in this regard the high draw flowrate showed the highest increment of the draw pressure drop this can be attributed to the increased pressure build up due to the high flowrate and complex geometry of the draw channel inside the membrane element shon et al 2015 it should be also noted that pressurization showed the least increment of the pressure drop in both channels despite a high initial pressure drop especially in terms of the increment ratio which can be beneficial for reducing the sec increment in fo eq 2 3 2 4 increase in the diluted concentration of the draw solution the diluted concentration indicates the direct performance of draw stream dilution in fo thereby playing a decisive role in determining the performance of the following ro unit fig 6 a depicts the variation in the diluted concentration under different operating conditions a high draw flowrate yielded a marginal increase in the diluted concentration compared to the other conditions to interpret this result it is necessary to explore what determines the diluted concentration in fo put simply the diluted concentration is the outcome of the ratio between water flux i e the rate of solvent addition rsf i e the rate of solute subtraction and the draw flowrate i e the retention time of the draw solution in the element when considering the insignificant amount of rsf approx 3 5 mg min of outflow in the two elements water flux and the draw flowrate are the main factors that dictate the diluted concentration here the velocity ratio between water permeation i e water flux and the cross flow of the draw solution can be a measure of the sensitivity of the diluted concentration to variation in the water flux fig 3a in order to resolve this relationship the ratio between the velocity of water permeation and the cross flow of the draw solution was computed using a draw channel cross section of 0 4 m 0 002 m 12 leaves in a single element kook et al 2017 fig 6b shows the velocity ratio between water permeation and the draw cross flow with increments in the ratio of diluted concentration fig 5a the ratio of the increments of the diluted concentrations seemed to be proportional to the ratio between the velocities this means that when the draw flowrate is relatively high compared to water flux the impact of water flux reduction on the diluted concentration is less significant than in low draw flowrate conditions because the water permeation velocity has a negligible impact on dilution of the draw stream due to the significantly lower contact time of the permeate water at a specific region in the element with the draw water body which is traveling at a much higher velocity variation in diluted concentrations is important since even small changes in the concentration can have a significant impact on ro sec this relationship between the diluted concentration and ro sec will be further discussed in later sections 3 3 analysis of sec for a full scale fo ro hybrid system sec is the most representative indicator of the energy efficiency of the membrane process as it is a quantitative measure of energy consumption per produced water volume it is widely believed that the fo ro hybrid process has the strong potential to reduce energy consumption compared to conventional ro as proven by several pilots and economic feasibility studies that demonstrated improved sec in fo ro hybrid systems ali et al 2018 kook et al 2018a valladares linares et al 2016 however the sec increases in long term field operations as a result of membrane fouling in this section the reduction of sec in the fo ro hybrid process is discussed in relation to fouling induced performance deterioration 3 3 1 comparison of fo sec under different operating conditions fo sec can be calculated based on water flux channel pressure drop and initial flowrate in both the feed and draw channels using eqs 2 and 3 and the results of figs 4 and 5 the variation and increment of fo sec were computed as shown in fig 7 a generally pressurization resulted in a relatively high fo sec throughout the operating time and the influence of feed flowrate on fo sec was especially critical under pressurization compared to other conditions a high draw flowrate led to a slightly higher sec than the base condition but the sec difference was not significant compared to that of pressurization when considering that the water flux at a high draw flowrate was higher than that in the base condition fig 2 the contribution of the channel pressure drop fig 4 to fo sec was predominant compared to that of water flux in contrast under pressurization water flux reduction had a stronger effect on increasing fo sec than did increments in the channel pressure drop although each condition had different major causes of increments in fo sec controlling operating conditions for water flux enhancement turned out to be rather detrimental for fo sec as shown by increments in fo sec in fig 7b the cumulative amount of energy consumption during 15 days of fo operation was computed with the assumption of a plant capacity of 100 000 m3 d and ro recovery of 50 which requires an ro feed flowrate i e the diluted draw flowrate in fo of 200 000 m3 d in comparison with the base condition pressurization showed 388 and 885 higher cumulative energy consumption at feed flowrates of 40 and 10 lpm respectively while a high draw flowrate led to 24 and 146 higher cumulative energy consumption these results imply that moderate hydrodynamic conditions i e low flowrate and hydraulic pressure are beneficial for fo sec and fouling propensity despite their low performance 3 3 2 comparison of fo ro sec under different operating conditions although pressurization resulted in dramatically high overall energy consumption in fo ro sec needs to be evaluated simultaneously to ensure a fair comparison in terms of the total energy consumption in the entire hybrid process to evaluate the overall sec of the fo ro hybrid process ro sec was calculated in relation to the ro feed concentration the diluted concentration of the draw solution in fo fig 8 depicts the relationship between the ro feed concentration and optimal sec as computed by ro process simulation software wave dupont if ro sec is assumed to be solely determined by feed concentration it can be obtained by plotting each diluted concentration in fig 6a onto the linear relationship drawn in fig 8 detailed simulation methods for obtaining the linear relationship are furnished in the supplementary data fig 9 a shows the initial sec of the fo ro hybrid system and the amount that sec was increased by membrane fouling after 15 days of operation after 15 days of operation sec increments of 0 117 0 305 kwh m3 were observed depending on the operating conditions pressurization still showed the highest increment 3 05 kwh m3 in the low feed flowrate condition but a fairly low increment 0 208 kwh m3 in the high feed flowrate condition interestingly despite its drastic impact on increasing fo sec pressurization showed a comparable or even lower fo ro sec compared to the base condition in particular when the feed flow rate was 10 lpm fo ro sec was the lowest in both the initial and fouled conditions 2 147 and 2 452 kwh m3 respectively this is because the compensated ro sec resulting from enhanced dilution outweighs the increased fo sec in pressurization meanwhile a high draw flowrate showed the first and second highest fo ro sec 2 77 and 2 78 kwh m3 respectively which can mostly be attributed to inefficient dilution due to the high relative velocity of the draw flow to water permeation according to the sec comparison a high draw flowrate is not favorable in terms of energy consumption of the fo ro hybrid process instead a high draw flowrate showed a 2 3 times lower increment in fo ro sec than the other operating conditions fig 9b depicts the total increment of fo ro sec and the proportion of each increment in fo and ro on the whole the increments in fo sec were relatively marginal compared to those of ro sec the base condition showed the lowest increments of fo sec which was overshadowed by the high increments of ro sec while the other two conditions showed relatively low increments of ro sec at the sacrifice of increments of fo sec in particular a high draw flowrate demonstrated a two times lower ro sec than the other conditions due to the low sensitivity of water flux reduction to the diluted concentration fig 5b in order to examine total energy consumption in the hybrid system cumulative fo ro energy consumption during 15 days was computed as shown in fig 9c unlike the comparison of fo sec in fig 7b the difference in cumulative fo ro energy consumption was not significant with variation only between 2 and 12 in particular although pressurization showed up to a 885 higher fo energy consumption fig 6b the total energy consumption between base condition and pressurization only differed by up to 8 between the base condition and pressurization such a small difference in the total energy consumption between operating conditions implies that the total life cycle cost of the plant is more likely to be determined by capital expenditures rather than operating expenditures 3 4 comparison of feed recovery and plant capacity changes generally a water treatment plant has a certain daily capacity that must be maintained over the year wilf and awerbuch 2007 fo ro hybrid systems which combine wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination can have two target capacities fo feed recovery and final production capacity fo feed recovery is an important parameter as it determines the volume and concentration of the dewatered wastewater stream from fo to be treated in subsequent treatment systems zhang et al 2014 meanwhile seawater desalination plants also have a certain capacity for water supply on a daily basis for these reasons plant operation needs to be stopped at times for membrane cleaning to restore its original capacity for example seawater ro plants have a traditional guideline of a flux reduction of 10 15 that determines membrane cleaning frequency chesters et al 2013 in this regard fig 10 a shows feed recovery depending on operating conditions in a comparison between the first day and after 15 days of operation overall a low feed flowrate was advantageous for increasing feed recovery especially high draw flowrate and pressurization facilitate the further increase of feed recovery through water flux enhancement fig 2 as compared to base conditions while a high draw flowrate demonstrated a similar or even lower reduction in feed recovery fig 10a pressurization resulted in 2 0 3 3 times higher feed recovery reduction in proportion to water flux reduction fig 4b as shown in fig 10b the required fo membrane area to maintain a full scale fo ro plant capacity of 100 000 m3 d was derived from the diluted draw flowrate of 200 000 m3 d in the pilot operation of the serially connected fo elements it is noted that the required membrane area can be reduced to approximately 40 and 16 of the base condition when high draw flowrate and pressurization conditions were assumed in the initial plant design the requirement for less membrane area has the potential to compensate for the higher energy demands of full scale plant operation as shown in fig 9c the results of fig 10b indicate that after 15 days the pressurized condition led the higher required membrane area compared to the others i e base and high flow rate condition since pressurization showed 2 0 3 3 times higher reductions in feed recovery and water production the higher frequency and costs of membrane cleaning also need to be considered in the determination of optimal pilot operating conditions 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of hydrodynamic operating conditions in fo on performance reduction in the fo ro hybrid process using real seawater and secondary wastewater effluent in long term pilot scale operations variation in practical performance indicators such as water flux the channel pressure drop and the diluted concentration was extensively explored in association with energy consumption feed recovery and the required membrane area in a full scale fo ro hybrid system the following conclusions were drawn from this study the rsd of divalent ions turned out to be a crucial factor as it not only accelerated water flux decline but also increased the channel pressure drop due to an enhanced fouling propensity in this respect a high draw flowrate promotes fouling growth due to the high rsf in field operations in order to reduce membrane fouling it is of paramount importance to reduce the rsd of divalent ions under conditions of seawater and wastewater this relationship between draw flowrate and fouling propensity needs to be considered when determining optimal operating conditions for sustainable operation employing a high feed flowrate to attenuate the fouling induced flux decline clearly demonstrated fouling mitigation effects in pilot scale field operations but increasing the feed flowrate must be balanced with additional energy consumption especially in pafo mode pressurization showed an approximately 9 times higher fo sec but only a 2 8 higher overall fo ro sec when considering that pressurization can reduce the required fo membrane area by more than 16 this small difference in total energy consumption indicates the potential feasibility of pafo ro however a 2 3 fold increase in the membrane cleaning cost and frequency may be laborious for practical operations although a high draw flowrate accelerates the fouling propensity in fo it is advantageous to delay increasing ro sec due to the high relative velocity of draw flow to water permeation furthermore a high draw flowrate can significantly reduce the required fo membrane area the results of this study also imply that operating conditions optimized based on the initial sec can become non optimal due to fouling induced

17614,the forward osmosis reverse osmosis fo ro hybrid process has been extensively researched as part of attempts to reduce the high energy consumption of conventional seawater reverse osmosis in recent years fo operating conditions play a substantial role in the hybrid process dictating not only the performance of the entire system but also the propensity for fouling which deteriorates performance in long term field operations therefore determining the optimal fo operating conditions with regard to membrane fouling may promote sustainable operation through efficient fouling control this study thus evaluated the influence of each hydrodynamic operating condition feed flowrate draw flowrate and hydraulic pressure difference and their synergistic effects on fouling propensity in a pilot scale fo operation under seawater and municipal wastewater conditions fouling induced variation in water flux channel pressure drop diluted concentration and the resulting specific energy consumption sec were comparatively analyzed and utilized to project performance variation in a full scale fo ro system fouling induced performance reduction significantly varied depending on hydrodynamic operating conditions and the resultant fouling propensity during 15 days of continuous operation a high feed flowrate demonstrated a clear ability to mitigate fouling induced performance deterioration in all conditions a high draw flowrate turned out to be detrimental for fouling propensity since its high reverse solute flux accelerated fouling growth applying additional hydraulic pressure during fo operation caused a faster reduction of water flux and thus feed recovery and water production however these drawbacks could be compensated for by a 10 reduction in the required fo membrane area and an additional reduction in ro sec graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis fo ro hybrid process membrane fouling field operation process simulation 1 introduction forward osmosis fo is an osmotically driven membrane process odmp that is favored by low energy consumption mild operating pressure and reversible membrane fouling han et al 2014 kim et al 2014 lee et al 2017 mi and elimelech 2010 since the late 2000s fo has been researched in the setting of hybrid schemes integrated with various membrane processes such as reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration membrane distillation and electrodialysis akther et al 2015 among numerous niche applications the fo ro hybrid process has attracted the most attention due to its potential for low operational cost and less environmental impact in wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination hancock et al 2012 lutchmiah et al 2014 due to its low pressure nature fo has low fouling susceptibility but high fouling reversibility which originates from the looser and more sparse fouling layer on the membrane surface compared to the compacted dense fouling layer in high pressure ro lee et al 2010 siddiqui et al 2018 in order to facilitate sustainable fo operation in association with its low fouling propensity various fouling control strategies have been widely studied including surface modifications of the membrane in this respect several lab scale studies have demonstrated that a higher flowrate i e cross flow velocity and the presence of a feed spacer alleviated membrane fouling by increasing the shear force on the membrane surface boo et al 2013 lotfi et al 2018 several studies reported that fo can be operated with minimal membrane fouling below the critical flux condition nguyen et al 2019 nguyen et al 2020 in addition novel cleaning methods that do not use chemicals were proposed and demonstrated to facilitate sustainable fo operation blandin et al 2015 han et al 2016b mi and elimelech 2010 among the fouling control strategies in fo the most accessible and immediate approach in module scale operations is to control the operating conditions as doing so does not require any additional chemical dosage or extra devices while the feed flowrate i e the increase of cross flow velocity can be an important contributor to the mitigation of membrane fouling as proven in previous lab scale studies boo et al 2013 zou et al 2013 a high draw flowrate is known to enhance water flux by reducing dilutive external concentration polarization in fo operation kook et al 2017 muhammad alvan hidayat kook and kim 2018 lee et al 2020 several studies have investigated the effects of flowrate conditions on performance indicators in module scale fo operations such as the feed recovery rate kim et al 2018 water flux and reverse solute flux im et al 2018 the dilution ratio and specific energy consumption sec kook et al 2017 however the effect of hydraulic operating conditions on the initial performance of the process should be considered simultaneously with fouling behavior because such performance indicators gradually deteriorate under long term operation due to the effects of membrane fouling i e decreased flux and increased channel pressure drop these effects can lead to a discrepancy between the initial sec and the sec after long term operation since the fo sec is determined by water flux flowrate and pressure drop altaee et al 2014 meanwhile pressure assisted forward osmosis pafo has recently emerged as an alternative to replace fo in fo ro hybrid systems in pafo additional hydraulic pressure is applied purposely on the feed side thereby enhancing water flux and osmotic dilution pafo can be differentiated from fo on the basis of lab scale studies blandin et al 2013 oh et al 2014 and pilot based economic assessments kim et al 2018 kook et al 2018a which demonstrated that pafo can further reduce the overall economics of pafo ro systems however although fouling during fo operation has been extensively studied for many years research on fouling in pafo is still severely limited at the pilot scale level a study of a lab scale system blandin et al 2015 reported that hydraulic pressure in pafo led to more severe membrane fouling forming a compacted cake layer similarly pressure retarded osmosis another type of odmp using relatively high hydraulic pressure demonstrated a severer fouling propensity han et al 2018 2017 2016a although some studies have evaluated the performance of fo on the pilot scale those works used artificial seawater and tap water im et al 2018 kim et al 2017 kook et al 2018a and therefore did not resolve the effect of membrane fouling on process performance and economics however to project a realistic estimation of the techno economic feasibility of fo ro hybrid systems membrane fouling under field water conditions real seawater and secondary wastewater effluent and the resulting impacts on process performance need to be evaluated specifically the effects of hydraulic operating conditions need to be investigated to assess the long term operation of hybrid systems in terms of overall performance involving membrane fouling in the current study the effects of hydrodynamic operating conditions in fo spiral wound elements on organic fouling and the performance deterioration of a fo ro hybrid system were investigated the effects of feed flowrate draw flowrate hydraulic pressure difference and synergistic effects on fouling behavior and the resultant deterioration of performance parameters were evaluated under long term field operation conditions ro process simulations were employed to project the performance variation of the full scale hybrid system this study is intended to provide guidelines for determining the operating conditions of fo to ensure the sustainable operation of hybrid systems to the best of the authors knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate differences in fouling propensity according to hydrodynamic operating conditions in pilot scale fo operations with real seawater and wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 fo spiral wound element a spiral wound fo element csm fo 8040 toray chemical korea inc korea was used for the pilot scale operation this fo element consisted of 12 layers of membrane leaves that included two polyamide thin film composite flat sheet membranes two layers of tricot fine spacers and a diamond shaped spacer in the center enveloped by the two fine spacers the total effective membrane area of one element was 15 3 m2 a detailed description of the characteristics of the membrane can be found elsewhere additionally the structural characteristics of the element are illustrated in fig 2 2 2 characteristics of secondary wastewater effluent and seawater real secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and real seawater were pre treated with mesh tube filtration and a cartridge filter to be utilized as feed and draw solutions in the following fo operation each water quality parameter of the feed and draw solutions was measured before and after pretreatment tables 1 and 2 total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan suspended solids and the silt density index were determined using standard procedures astm d4189 072014 2014 ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex usa was used to analyze the cation content in each solution 2 3 fo pilot system design fig 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of the fo pilot system set up the system was equipped with four liquid transfer pumps grundfos product crn10 14 a fgj g e hqqe and crn3 5 a fgj g e hqqe denmark for feed and draw streams an automated pressure valve fci deltap valve g tech eng korea was installed at the outlet of the feed side the pilot system was fully controlled by a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system in connection with the scada system the automated pressure valve and the feed and draw pumps enabled automatic operation maintaining constant feed outlet pressure feed flowrate and draw flowrate regardless of any hydrodynamic changes that occurred during long term operation in this study the hydraulic pressure difference δ p which can be used to differentiate fo versus pafo operation was defined as the difference between the feed outlet and the draw inlet of the second element the fo membrane was oriented with the active layer facing the feed solution and the maximum allowable operating pressure on the feed side 7 bar and the ph 2 11 were kept within the manufacturer s specifications during operation since the pressure and flowrate were maintained constant by the designated conditions there was no pressure dependency on flowrate in this study pressure gauges end ress hauser cerabar s switzerland flowmeters end ress hauser promag 10 switzerland and total dissolved solids meters georg fischer signet 9900 transmitter switzerland were installed to monitor variations in pressure flowrate and concentration according to our previous works kook et al 2017 2018a having more than two fo membrane elements in a serial connection can be inefficient in terms of draw stream dilution and subsequent ro energy cost reduction accordingly two elements stored in separate pressure vessels ropv r8040b300s 1w 1d5d maximum pressure 21 bar china were serially connected to optimize the energy efficiency of the fo ro hybrid the feed and draw streams were not recirculated but were instead operated in a one way direction 2 4 operating conditions for fouling propensity analysis to investigate the synergistic effects of differences in the feed flowrate draw flowrate and hydraulic pressure difference on initial performance and fouling propensity six hydraulic operating conditions were formulated table 3 the base condition was postulated as a draw flowrate of 5 lpm liter per minute and a hydraulic pressure difference of 0 bar based on previous pilot studies using identical fo elements csm fo 8040 toray non base conditions were then established with a high draw flowrate and pressurization pafo mode which were separately set by increasing the draw flowrate from 5 lpm to 10 lpm and the hydraulic pressure difference from 0 bar to 2 bar in these three conditions low feed flowrate 10 lpm and high feed flowrate 40 lpm conditions were tested the cross flow velocity of each flowrate condition was computed considering the width and height of the feed and draw channel inlets and the number of leaves as illustrated in fig 2 the draw channel was somewhat narrower 40 cm than the feed channel 83 5 cm the height of each channel was assumed to be 1 2 mm feed and 1 4 mm draw based on its spacer thickness to avoid the effect of seasonal temperature changes on the process performance the duration of each operation was set as 15 days throughout operation the temperature of water was 18 1 6 c and 15 5 1 1 c for the feed and draw solutions respectively between each operation chemical and physical cleaning were performed until the initial flux and channel pressure drop fully recovered to ensure fair comparisons for chemical cleaning sodium hydroxide ph 11 and sulfuric acid ph 3 solutions were circulated to completely remove foulants on the membrane and channel surfaces the average water flux in each membrane element was computed using the following equation 1 j w q d o u t q d i n a m where jw is the average water flux l m2 h lmh am is the total membrane area in a single element m2 and qd out and qd in lpm are the draw flowrate measured at the inlet and outlet respectively it should be noted that average water flux in this study was defined by taking the average of the two fluxes in light of the serial element configuration reverse solute flux rsf the reverse permeation of draw solute from the draw solution into the feed solution phillip et al 2010 was determined based on the change of the feed flowrate and concentration between the inlet and outlet using the following equation 2 j s q f i n c f i n q f o u t c f o u t a m where js is the reverse solute flux mol m2 hour qf in and qf out are the feed flowrate measured at the inlet and outlet and cf in and cf out are the feed concentration measured at the inlet and outlet respectively 2 5 evaluation of specific energy consumption based on the inlet pressure in both the feed and draw channels pump efficiency and permeate flowrate fo sec was calculated as shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 sec p f q f i n p d q d i n 36 η q p 4 q p q d o u t where pf and pd bar are the inlet pressure of the feed and draw sides qf and qd lpm are the initial feed and draw flowrates η is the pump efficiency and qp lpm is the permeate flowrate the permeate flowrate was assumed to reflect a diluted draw stream the pump efficiency was assumed to be 0 85 2 6 wave simulation for swro sec water application value engine wave is a newly developed simulation software for water related processes by dupont based on older software rosa9 in order to project the sec of two stages of ro in association with the measured diluted concentration from the fo pilot i e the ro feed concentration 36 sets of wave simulations were conducted with ro recovery and feed concentration as independent variables varying from 40 to 80 and from 10 000 to 35 000 ppm respectively the sw30 xle 400i was assumed to be the model ro element and the target plant capacity was set as 100 000 m3 day energy saving by energy recovery devices was not considered in the simulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial water flux and reverse solute flux under different operating conditions initial water flux under each hydraulic operating condition was computed based on performance in the first 30 min which was assumed to reflect the initial performance without interference from membrane fouling as shown in fig 3 while there was no improvement in water flux of the first element as increased feed flowrate the water flux promoted with increasing high draw flowrate 2 1 2 2 lmh and pressurization 1 8 2 1 lmh conditions however the increase in water flux by increasing feed flow rate was found for the second element this can be probably attributed to the difference in the accumulated local concentration on the active layer surface due to mixing of the feed solution and rsf i e concentrative external concentration polarization cecp she et al 2016 increased draw flowrate leads to reduction of diluted icp and diluted ecp which resulted in enhancing the water flux im et al 2018 an increment of rsf is due to high draw flowrate and this fact also has been reported in other pilot studies im et al 2018 kook et al 2017 this phenomenon is attributed to an augmented local concentration in the support layer of the membrane due to the faster replenishment of the draw solution i e a higher draw flowrate meanwhile under conditions of pressurization rsf is suppressed as the hydraulic pressure reduces surface porosity and densifies the active layer kook et al 2018b however the increased water flux under pressurization also creates local increases in concentration on the active layer modifying the dependency of feed solution convection i e the feed flowrate on the resulting water flux a negligible effect of feed flowrate in the base condition neither a high draw flowrate nor pressurization has also been reported in other fo pilot studies im et al 2018 kook et al 2017 this result implies that when only initial water flux is considered in determining the optimal operating conditions the feed flowrate does not necessarily need to be high as long as the water flux reduction is not severe enough to deteriorate overall process performance 3 2 reduction of process performance under long term operation variations in water flux channel pressure drop and diluted concentration were evaluated under 15 days of 24 h continuous operation using the aforementioned hydraulic operating conditions these three factors can be used as indicators of fouling propensity as they are expected to change as a result of membrane fouling through membrane autopsy and scanning electron microscope sem analysis the presence of organic fouling on membrane surfaces was identified sem images of the fouled membrane are presented in figs s2 and s3 of the supplementary information 3 2 1 fouling induced water flux decline in field operations of fo the permeability of the membrane gradually decreases due to the adsorption of organic materials or the growth of biological fouling on the membrane surface which leads to a decline of the initial water flux fig 4 a illustrates the declining trend of water flux due to the effect of membrane fouling under long term operation the declining trend was different depending on the hydraulic operating conditions in all cases high feed flowrate conditions showed less fouling propensity as shown by the maintenance of higher water flux during operation this result is attributed to the additional shear force generated by the high feed cross flow velocity i e feed flowrate which hindered foulants from accumulating on the membrane surface however the effects of the feed flowrate on water flux reduction turned out to be different in each condition in fig 4b the apparent decrement of water flux and the reduction ratio for each condition normalized by initial water flux were compared in the base condition a high feed flow rate 40 lpm assists in decreasing considerably a reduction ratio of water flux from 22 9 to 6 4 i e a decrease by 16 5 however this condition exhibited a lower decrease in reduction ratio for the cases of the high draw flowrate 16 1 and pressurization 12 3 these results are attributed to that the higher rsf and the hydraulic pressure difference of the non base conditions high draw flowrate pressurization contributed more to fouling behavior than the feed flowrate difference as shown in fig 4b pressurization resulted in higher fouling propensity compared to other conditions as shown by both the flux decrement and the reduction ratio in this regard a previous study yun et al 2014 reported that fouling under pressure assisted osmosis pao was negligible while other studies blandin et al 2015 kim et al 2014 reported that a greater flux decline was clearly observed at a higher applied pressure during pao operation in their lab scale experiments in this respect the effect of hydraulic pressure on flux decline turned out to be non negligible in pilot scale field operations as it led to a 1 5 to 3 6 times higher decline in water flux in 15 days this difference is attributed to the compaction of the foulant cake by hydraulic pressure on the deformable colloidal organic foulant layer that induces additional resistance to water permeation moreover all the operating conditions showed periodic increases and decreases in water flux during the operating time this is mainly attributed to the formation of a loose fouling layer on the membrane surface which was regularly peeled off by shear stress of the cross flow velocity during fo and pafo operation lotfi et al 2017 3 2 2 role of reverse solute diffusion as a fouling promoter the other important factor that affects fouling propensity in fo is reverse solute diffusion rsd rsd can enhance fouling intensity through the reverse diffusion of divalent solutes e g magnesium or calcium ions from the draw solution into the feed solution promoting organic fouling growth rsd enhanced fouling is related to the type of draw solute the ability of the diffused draw solute to interact with the foulants in the feed solution and the rate of reverse diffusion of the draw solute i e rsf baoxia and elimelech 2010 boo et al 2013 lee et al 2010 of particular note an earlier study xie et al 2013 reported that the reverse diffusion of calcium ions caused more severe alginate fouling than was observed for magnesium ions since calcium forms much stronger complexes with the carboxylic group in organic foulant molecules they further reported that sodium ions had a negligible complex effect with macromolecular organics but could lead to an increase in local ionic strength near the membrane surface and enhance humic acid deposition as shown in table 1 calcium magnesium and sodium concentrations in typical seawater are dramatically higher than those in wastewater therefore the high rsf of such ions can enhance the fouling propensity in practical fo operations when using seawater as draw and wastewater as feed under pressurization the cake layer hindered the diffusion of solutes within the unstirred layer back to the bulk feed solution and thus increased the solute concentration near the membrane surface a phenomenon known as cake enhanced concentration polarization hoek and elimelech 2003 this phenomenon synergistically diminishes water flux in conjunction with a high rsf as shown in fig 4b these results demonstrate that rsd is an important factor both for losing draw solutes and for fouling propensity when seawater and wastewater are simultaneously used 3 2 3 increase of the pressure drop in the feed and draw channels no studies have yet specifically focused on the increment in the channel pressure drop caused by membrane fouling in fo elements however it is widely acknowledged that the channel pressure drop is caused by blockage of the membrane channels by colloids biological fouling and the growth of fouling cake layers on membrane and spacer surfaces fig 5 a and c shows the increasing trend and the increment of the feed channel pressure drop during 15 days of operation a high draw flowrate resulted in a noticeably higher feed pressure drop compared to other conditions while the increase in the feed pressure drop was marginal under pressurization as discussed in the previous section a high rsf promotes membrane fouling which explains why a high draw flowrate induced the highest feed pressure drop increment meanwhile pressurization can decrease the feed channel pressure drop as opposed to the tendency observed for severe water flux decline because the fouling cake layers are compacted and the feed channel expands as a result of high internal hydraulic pressure in contrast to the tendency observed for water flux decline a greater increase in the feed pressure drop was observed under a high feed flowrate in non pressurized conditions base condition high draw flowrate this is most likely because a high feed flowrate induced high contact efficiency of foulants to surfaces in channels however the effect of fouling in the draw channel is negligible because the rejection rate of organic or colloidal foulants in the feed solution by the fo membrane exceeds 99 and the draw solution has minimal fouling potential table 1 instead the increase in the draw pressure drop may be associated with an increase in the tortuosity of the draw channel under hydraulic pressure from the feed channel the increased tortuosity of the draw channel is most likely attributed to gradual stretching of the membrane into the openings between spacer filaments under long term pressurization in this regard the high draw flowrate showed the highest increment of the draw pressure drop this can be attributed to the increased pressure build up due to the high flowrate and complex geometry of the draw channel inside the membrane element shon et al 2015 it should be also noted that pressurization showed the least increment of the pressure drop in both channels despite a high initial pressure drop especially in terms of the increment ratio which can be beneficial for reducing the sec increment in fo eq 2 3 2 4 increase in the diluted concentration of the draw solution the diluted concentration indicates the direct performance of draw stream dilution in fo thereby playing a decisive role in determining the performance of the following ro unit fig 6 a depicts the variation in the diluted concentration under different operating conditions a high draw flowrate yielded a marginal increase in the diluted concentration compared to the other conditions to interpret this result it is necessary to explore what determines the diluted concentration in fo put simply the diluted concentration is the outcome of the ratio between water flux i e the rate of solvent addition rsf i e the rate of solute subtraction and the draw flowrate i e the retention time of the draw solution in the element when considering the insignificant amount of rsf approx 3 5 mg min of outflow in the two elements water flux and the draw flowrate are the main factors that dictate the diluted concentration here the velocity ratio between water permeation i e water flux and the cross flow of the draw solution can be a measure of the sensitivity of the diluted concentration to variation in the water flux fig 3a in order to resolve this relationship the ratio between the velocity of water permeation and the cross flow of the draw solution was computed using a draw channel cross section of 0 4 m 0 002 m 12 leaves in a single element kook et al 2017 fig 6b shows the velocity ratio between water permeation and the draw cross flow with increments in the ratio of diluted concentration fig 5a the ratio of the increments of the diluted concentrations seemed to be proportional to the ratio between the velocities this means that when the draw flowrate is relatively high compared to water flux the impact of water flux reduction on the diluted concentration is less significant than in low draw flowrate conditions because the water permeation velocity has a negligible impact on dilution of the draw stream due to the significantly lower contact time of the permeate water at a specific region in the element with the draw water body which is traveling at a much higher velocity variation in diluted concentrations is important since even small changes in the concentration can have a significant impact on ro sec this relationship between the diluted concentration and ro sec will be further discussed in later sections 3 3 analysis of sec for a full scale fo ro hybrid system sec is the most representative indicator of the energy efficiency of the membrane process as it is a quantitative measure of energy consumption per produced water volume it is widely believed that the fo ro hybrid process has the strong potential to reduce energy consumption compared to conventional ro as proven by several pilots and economic feasibility studies that demonstrated improved sec in fo ro hybrid systems ali et al 2018 kook et al 2018a valladares linares et al 2016 however the sec increases in long term field operations as a result of membrane fouling in this section the reduction of sec in the fo ro hybrid process is discussed in relation to fouling induced performance deterioration 3 3 1 comparison of fo sec under different operating conditions fo sec can be calculated based on water flux channel pressure drop and initial flowrate in both the feed and draw channels using eqs 2 and 3 and the results of figs 4 and 5 the variation and increment of fo sec were computed as shown in fig 7 a generally pressurization resulted in a relatively high fo sec throughout the operating time and the influence of feed flowrate on fo sec was especially critical under pressurization compared to other conditions a high draw flowrate led to a slightly higher sec than the base condition but the sec difference was not significant compared to that of pressurization when considering that the water flux at a high draw flowrate was higher than that in the base condition fig 2 the contribution of the channel pressure drop fig 4 to fo sec was predominant compared to that of water flux in contrast under pressurization water flux reduction had a stronger effect on increasing fo sec than did increments in the channel pressure drop although each condition had different major causes of increments in fo sec controlling operating conditions for water flux enhancement turned out to be rather detrimental for fo sec as shown by increments in fo sec in fig 7b the cumulative amount of energy consumption during 15 days of fo operation was computed with the assumption of a plant capacity of 100 000 m3 d and ro recovery of 50 which requires an ro feed flowrate i e the diluted draw flowrate in fo of 200 000 m3 d in comparison with the base condition pressurization showed 388 and 885 higher cumulative energy consumption at feed flowrates of 40 and 10 lpm respectively while a high draw flowrate led to 24 and 146 higher cumulative energy consumption these results imply that moderate hydrodynamic conditions i e low flowrate and hydraulic pressure are beneficial for fo sec and fouling propensity despite their low performance 3 3 2 comparison of fo ro sec under different operating conditions although pressurization resulted in dramatically high overall energy consumption in fo ro sec needs to be evaluated simultaneously to ensure a fair comparison in terms of the total energy consumption in the entire hybrid process to evaluate the overall sec of the fo ro hybrid process ro sec was calculated in relation to the ro feed concentration the diluted concentration of the draw solution in fo fig 8 depicts the relationship between the ro feed concentration and optimal sec as computed by ro process simulation software wave dupont if ro sec is assumed to be solely determined by feed concentration it can be obtained by plotting each diluted concentration in fig 6a onto the linear relationship drawn in fig 8 detailed simulation methods for obtaining the linear relationship are furnished in the supplementary data fig 9 a shows the initial sec of the fo ro hybrid system and the amount that sec was increased by membrane fouling after 15 days of operation after 15 days of operation sec increments of 0 117 0 305 kwh m3 were observed depending on the operating conditions pressurization still showed the highest increment 3 05 kwh m3 in the low feed flowrate condition but a fairly low increment 0 208 kwh m3 in the high feed flowrate condition interestingly despite its drastic impact on increasing fo sec pressurization showed a comparable or even lower fo ro sec compared to the base condition in particular when the feed flow rate was 10 lpm fo ro sec was the lowest in both the initial and fouled conditions 2 147 and 2 452 kwh m3 respectively this is because the compensated ro sec resulting from enhanced dilution outweighs the increased fo sec in pressurization meanwhile a high draw flowrate showed the first and second highest fo ro sec 2 77 and 2 78 kwh m3 respectively which can mostly be attributed to inefficient dilution due to the high relative velocity of the draw flow to water permeation according to the sec comparison a high draw flowrate is not favorable in terms of energy consumption of the fo ro hybrid process instead a high draw flowrate showed a 2 3 times lower increment in fo ro sec than the other operating conditions fig 9b depicts the total increment of fo ro sec and the proportion of each increment in fo and ro on the whole the increments in fo sec were relatively marginal compared to those of ro sec the base condition showed the lowest increments of fo sec which was overshadowed by the high increments of ro sec while the other two conditions showed relatively low increments of ro sec at the sacrifice of increments of fo sec in particular a high draw flowrate demonstrated a two times lower ro sec than the other conditions due to the low sensitivity of water flux reduction to the diluted concentration fig 5b in order to examine total energy consumption in the hybrid system cumulative fo ro energy consumption during 15 days was computed as shown in fig 9c unlike the comparison of fo sec in fig 7b the difference in cumulative fo ro energy consumption was not significant with variation only between 2 and 12 in particular although pressurization showed up to a 885 higher fo energy consumption fig 6b the total energy consumption between base condition and pressurization only differed by up to 8 between the base condition and pressurization such a small difference in the total energy consumption between operating conditions implies that the total life cycle cost of the plant is more likely to be determined by capital expenditures rather than operating expenditures 3 4 comparison of feed recovery and plant capacity changes generally a water treatment plant has a certain daily capacity that must be maintained over the year wilf and awerbuch 2007 fo ro hybrid systems which combine wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination can have two target capacities fo feed recovery and final production capacity fo feed recovery is an important parameter as it determines the volume and concentration of the dewatered wastewater stream from fo to be treated in subsequent treatment systems zhang et al 2014 meanwhile seawater desalination plants also have a certain capacity for water supply on a daily basis for these reasons plant operation needs to be stopped at times for membrane cleaning to restore its original capacity for example seawater ro plants have a traditional guideline of a flux reduction of 10 15 that determines membrane cleaning frequency chesters et al 2013 in this regard fig 10 a shows feed recovery depending on operating conditions in a comparison between the first day and after 15 days of operation overall a low feed flowrate was advantageous for increasing feed recovery especially high draw flowrate and pressurization facilitate the further increase of feed recovery through water flux enhancement fig 2 as compared to base conditions while a high draw flowrate demonstrated a similar or even lower reduction in feed recovery fig 10a pressurization resulted in 2 0 3 3 times higher feed recovery reduction in proportion to water flux reduction fig 4b as shown in fig 10b the required fo membrane area to maintain a full scale fo ro plant capacity of 100 000 m3 d was derived from the diluted draw flowrate of 200 000 m3 d in the pilot operation of the serially connected fo elements it is noted that the required membrane area can be reduced to approximately 40 and 16 of the base condition when high draw flowrate and pressurization conditions were assumed in the initial plant design the requirement for less membrane area has the potential to compensate for the higher energy demands of full scale plant operation as shown in fig 9c the results of fig 10b indicate that after 15 days the pressurized condition led the higher required membrane area compared to the others i e base and high flow rate condition since pressurization showed 2 0 3 3 times higher reductions in feed recovery and water production the higher frequency and costs of membrane cleaning also need to be considered in the determination of optimal pilot operating conditions 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of hydrodynamic operating conditions in fo on performance reduction in the fo ro hybrid process using real seawater and secondary wastewater effluent in long term pilot scale operations variation in practical performance indicators such as water flux the channel pressure drop and the diluted concentration was extensively explored in association with energy consumption feed recovery and the required membrane area in a full scale fo ro hybrid system the following conclusions were drawn from this study the rsd of divalent ions turned out to be a crucial factor as it not only accelerated water flux decline but also increased the channel pressure drop due to an enhanced fouling propensity in this respect a high draw flowrate promotes fouling growth due to the high rsf in field operations in order to reduce membrane fouling it is of paramount importance to reduce the rsd of divalent ions under conditions of seawater and wastewater this relationship between draw flowrate and fouling propensity needs to be considered when determining optimal operating conditions for sustainable operation employing a high feed flowrate to attenuate the fouling induced flux decline clearly demonstrated fouling mitigation effects in pilot scale field operations but increasing the feed flowrate must be balanced with additional energy consumption especially in pafo mode pressurization showed an approximately 9 times higher fo sec but only a 2 8 higher overall fo ro sec when considering that pressurization can reduce the required fo membrane area by more than 16 this small difference in total energy consumption indicates the potential feasibility of pafo ro however a 2 3 fold increase in the membrane cleaning cost and frequency may be laborious for practical operations although a high draw flowrate accelerates the fouling propensity in fo it is advantageous to delay increasing ro sec due to the high relative velocity of draw flow to water permeation furthermore a high draw flowrate can significantly reduce the required fo membrane area the results of this study also imply that operating conditions optimized based on the initial sec can become non optimal due to fouling induced
