1525,to study the interactions between remediation agent injection and hydrodynamic dispersion as well as the expansion of a contamination plume a two dimensional sandbox experiment was conducted to simulate and monitor the mixing of a remediation agent in the contamination plume and the expansion of the contamination plume over time potassium permanganate is a purple solution and it represents the remediation agent perchloroethylene pce is dyed green and was used to observe the migration and diffusion of the contaminant and the overlap of contamination and the agent plume six quantitative characterization parameters migration distance d m migration area a m initial area ratio k i spreading speed difference ssd area ratio k a and migration distance ratio k d are proposed to comprehensively analyse the influence of the three factors of injection pressure particle size and viscosity change on the mixing of a remediation agent and the expansion of the contamination plume over time the results show that these six parameters can effectively characterize the mixing of the remediation agent and the expansion of the contamination plume where d m a m and ki characterize the expansion and the other three parameters characterize the mixing the factors increasing the expansion of the contamination plume follow the order 40 cm 30 cm 20 cm for injection pressure water head coarse sand medium sand fine sand for particle size and no polymer added added polymer 200 mg l added polymer 800 mg l added polymer 400 mg l for viscosity adjustment the factors that intensify the mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume follow the order 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm water head coarse sand medium sand fine sand and added polymer 400 mg l added polymer 200 mg l no polymer added added polymer 800 mg l finally conclusions from the topsis method show that under optimal injection conditions mixing is enhanced without increasing plume expansion and that the optimum injection conditions are injection pressure 20 cm use of a coarse sand medium and added polymer concentration 400 mg l keywords contamination plume injection remediation agent dispersion and mixing expansion of the plume 1 introduction the most common chlorinated organic solvent compounds in groundwater such as tetrachloroethylene trichloroethylene carbon tetrachloride and vinyl chloride usually have relatively low aqueous solubility and low viscosity and are often difficult to biodegrade contaminated chlorinated solvents tend to form large groundwater contamination plumes significantly impacting regional water resource sustainability in many cases the plumes are hundreds of metres to several kilometres long brusseau et al 2011 in situ remediation is a commonly used technique for groundwater remediation wang and mulligan 2004 including air sparging as jang and aral 2009 johnson et al 2010 groundwater circulation wells gcws johnson and simon 2007 and in situ chemical oxidation isco siegrist et al 2011 seol et al 2003 mackinnon and thomson 2002 of this pool of remediation strategies in situ chemical oxidation isco methods are arguably the most commonly used in situ treatments and are adaptable to a variety of subsurface conditions and contaminant types sutton et al 2011 injection driven in situ remediation technologies have a common feature namely that the remediation agent needs to be injected into the groundwater through injection wells the success of such technologies often requires that the remediation agent is transported effectively underground and is in contact with the contaminants when the remediation agent is injected into the contamination plume since the contaminant degradation reaction occurs only where the agent and the contamination plume overlap mixing of the agent and the contamination plume is a necessary condition for the reaction to occur ottino 1989 due to molecular diffusion and the mixed results of pore scale dispersion only being capable of operating on a small scale mixing during in situ remediation can only occur when the distance between the remediation agent and the contamination plume is small piscopo et al 2013 the effectiveness of such injection driven in situ groundwater remediation techniques is impacted by preferential flow due to aquifer heterogeneity and uneven distributions of pollutants when the remediation agent is injected preferential flow forms easily in high permeability areas and heterogeneity induced bypassing problems easily occur in the low permeability areas smith and schwartz 1981 polymer amended in situ chemical oxidation pa isco has been shown to combats the challenges associated with subsurface permeability heterogeneity and poor isco fluid delivery by the addition of water soluble polymers and polyphosphates to the isco solution formulation silva et al 2017 polymer amendments provide enhanced solution viscosity and shear thinning rheology that combine to provide in situ mobility control and improve the injectivity of the solution when injected into porous media silva et al 2012 martel et al 1998 smith et al 2008 the experiment also demonstrated the compatibility i e oxidation resistance of xanthan gum biopolymer and permanganate oxidant in aqueous solution suggesting that viscosity modification is indeed applicable to isco injecting large amounts of remediation solution generates a driving force if the driving force is too small the mixing of the remediation agent and the pollutants is insufficient seriously weakening the effect of the remediation agent on pollutant digestion once the driving force becomes too great this strong driving force will lead to expansion of the contamination plume increasing the environmental risk of groundwater pollution and increasing the difficulty of restoration simpkin et al 2011 to summarize it is important to select and design a remediation agent injection system when using injectable in situ processing technology to treat contamination plumes cha and borden 2012 groundwater remediation is a lengthy process therefore it is very important to adopt scientific methods and technologies to improve the expansion and mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume and to control the spread of contaminated plumes to avoid further damage in this study a two dimensional plexiglass sandbox was selected and three types of quartz sand with different particle sizes were used as porous media to simulate the expansion and mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume and the development of the concentration and diffusion range of the contamination plume over time the effects of injection pressure on the migration and spread of contamination plume fronts were explored in the injection system design focusing on the interface in the mixing zone between the remediation agent and the contamination plume polymer xanthan gum was used to investigate the driving diffusive action of polymer enhanced injections of the remediation contamination plume 2 materials and methods 2 1 flow cell experiment in this experiment a two dimensional plexiglass sandbox was used to simulate the effect of an injected remediation agent on the spatial distribution of a contaminant plume as demonstrated in fig 1 the sandbox was placed horizontally with a length of 50 cm a width of 40 cm a height of 2 cm and a plexiglass thickness of 0 5 cm the quartz sand was packed homogeneously under water saturated conditions in the sandbox after packing 5 pore volumes pvs of deionized water were poured through the sandbox to remove fines from the packed sand an injection port was provided at the centre of the sandbox for emplacement contamination plumes and for injecting the remediation agents the entire experimental setup consisted of four main parts a two dimensional sandbox a light source a camera and a constant water head supply tank fig 2 a stable light source was used to guarantee the brightness for photography the camera was placed under the sandbox approximately 0 8 m from the box the porous media used in the sandbox experiments were three grades of silica sand 10 20 mesh 0 72 mm average grain size 20 40 0 51 mm and 40 70 0 36 mm obtained from sinopharm chemical agent co ltd table 1 lists the main characteristics of the quartz sands three packing configurations were used for three sets of experiments fig 1 the heterogeneous accusand system was wet packed and was kept saturated with water after packing zhong et al 2011 using a packing method similar to zhong et al 2011 to ensure uniform water distribution three high precision pumps were used to pump fluids into the sandbox through 20 evenly distributed injection ports outflow fluids also flowed through 20 evenly distributed effluent ports connected to a constant water head chamber the flow rate was 5 ml min for all sandbox tests the average porosity and dry bulk density values of the sands listed in table 1 were obtained gravimetrically other physical and chemical properties of the sands can be found in the study by schroth et al schroth et al 1996 a contaminant plume setting method 500 ml dissolved solution pce sino pharmaceutical shanghai 20 mg l was used to simulate the contamination plume to allow visual observations naphthol green b dye was added to colour the plume in the experiments details of the 9 experiments in the 3 groups are presented in table 2 the first three experiments used a potassium permanganate solution sino pharmaceutical beijing as the remediation agent experimental group 1 used 10 20 mesh quartz sand and three different pressures were used for each group the remediation agent was loaded into the water supply tank and the injection pressure was controlled by adjusting the height of the water supply tank experimental groups 2 and 3 were filled with silica sand of 20 40 and 40 70 mesh respectively xanthan gum aladdin china a water soluble biopolymer was used to modify the viscosity of the displacing fluids which are associated with shear thinning properties when xanthan gum is stirred it becomes a suspension with low viscosity if the suspension is then left undisturbed it regains its viscosity with time and it eventually becomes a gel again method for dissolving xanthan gum can refer to chokejaroenrat et al 2013 a brookfield lvdv3t viscometer was used to measure the viscosity of the remediation agent the shear rate range used for viscosity measurements was between 0 1 s 1 and 135 s 1 mackinnon and thomson 2002 the xanthan solutions are shear thinning fluids and the measured apparent viscosity shear rate relationships are shown in fig 3 all polymer solutions were filtered through a 0 6 μm membrane prior to injection to remove microgels that may have been present in solution chauveteau and kohler 1984 two sets of parallel experiments for each experiment with an error range within 15 2 2 quantitative characterization parameters to study the expansion and mixing of the remediation agent and the spread of the contamination plume the following parameters are defined for quantitative characterization fig 4 is the schematic diagram of specific parameter reference migration distance d m the transverse and longitudinal migration distance of the remediation agent and the contamination plume are used to characterize the expansion of

where dr is the migration distance of the remediation agent cm and dc is the migration distance of the contamination plume cm 2 3 topsis method for group decision making the experimental results were additionally used as the basis for further analysis using the topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method the topsis method is a commonly used multi objective decision making method that calculates the distance between the evaluated object and the ideal solution and the negative ideal solution which used to derive optimal remediation agent injection conditions zhou and jiang 2012 in this study the method is based on the theory that the distance between the best solution and the most ideal solution is the shortest this assumes that if each attribute exhibits as a monotonically increasing or decreasing variation then it is easy to define an ideal solution the goal is then to propose a solution which has the shortest distance from the ideal solution in euclidean space tzeng and huang 2010 shanian and savadogo 2006 the topsis method calculates the magnitude of the influence of each evaluation object on the results by calculating the euclidean distance there are several different parameters in this study each of which can affect the expansion of contamination plumes separately the total effect of several different parameters on contamination plumes is analyzed by the methods of the topsis firstly each parameter is converted into a monotonically increasing change that is the larger the parameter is the greater the impact of the experimental conditions on the contamination plume then use the normalization method to convert the parameter to a number of 0 1 finally the best solution is obtained by calculating the euclidean distance ci between each experimental condition and the ideal solution among them the ideal solution is each the experimental condition that has the least influence on the expansion of contamination plumes each parameter of the ideal solution is 0 it may come from different groups of experiments the best solution only comes from one group of experiments which represents that the experimental conditions of this group have the least influence on the contamination plume in all experiments the value of ci is the smallest the topsis method steps are as follows normalize the decision matrix the normalization of the decision matrix is performed using the following transformation 5 η ij r ij σ i 1 m r ij 2 j 1 2 n i 1 2 m where r ij represents the value of the jth attribute of the i th target η ij is the r ij after normalization multiply the columns of the normalized decision matrix by the associated weight and the result is v ij 6 v ij η ij ω j j 1 2 n i 1 2 m where ω j represents the weight of the jth attribute determine the ideal and nadir ideal solutions the ideal and the nadir value sets are determined respectively as follows 7 v 1 v 2 v n max i v ij j k min i v ij j k i 1 2 m 8 v 1 v 2 v n min i v ij j k max i v ij j k i 1 2 m where i is the index set of the benefit criteria and i is the index set of the cost criteria measure distances from the ideal and nadir solutions the two euclidean distances for each alternative are respectively calculated as 9 s i j 1 n v ij v j 2 0 5 j 1 2 n i 1 2 m 10 s i j 1 n v ij v j 2 0 5 j 1 2 n i 1 2 m calculate the relative closeness to the ideal solution the relative closeness to the ideal solution is defined as 11 c i s i s i s i i 1 2 m 0 c i 1 the methods for assessing the relative importance of criteria must be well defined 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment set 1 injection pressures for implementing isco injection pressure is an important design variable the injection pressure range was determined to be 15 45 cm of water head through preliminary experiments and then the experiment in exp 1 table 2 was conducted to study the influence of the injection pressure on the contamination plumes the main observations were the growth of the area of the agent a r and contamination plume a c and its transverse d t and longitudinal migration d l the remediation agent was injected into the centre injection port and photographs were taken at 10 s intervals the results are shown in fig 5 and the experiment photos are shown in fig 6 the d rt and d rl values are combined to characterize the migration of the remediation agent in the groundwater a r is used to characterize the effective remediation area the results are shown in fig 5 a c it can be seen from fig 5 that d rt and the d rl are synchronized at the initial stage but as the remediation agent is continuously injected d rl becomes greater than d rt at the same time the speed at which the remediation agent approaches forward is proportional to the injection pressure under the condition that the internal pore conditions of the medium are similar the main influencing factors of convection and dispersion are the external forces of the soil solution the migration distance of the remediation agent is related to the velocity of groundwater in the early stages of injection the convection effect is dominant and the strength of the convection is affected by the injection rate injection pressure of the remediation agent higher pressures lead to faster migration rates of the agent dispersion is dominant in the late injection stage considering the influence of the groundwater flow rate on the direction of the extension flow the migration distance in the longitudinal direction is greater than that in the transverse direction the experimental results are in agreement with this conclusion and can be confirmed by the theory of convective dispersion mentioned in previous studies peters and smith 2010 sahimi et al 1986 the effects of injection pressure on the contamination plume is not well understood based previous studies d cl and d ct are combined to characterize the migration of the contamination plume in the groundwater a c is used to characterize the expansion of the contamination plume the experimental results are shown by the other two lines in fig 5 a c and in the column chart d taylor taylor 1953 found that the dispersion and transport of solutes in a circular tube can be described by the convection dispersion equation however the dispersion coefficient is not a constant but increases geometrically with the flow velocity at the same time the dispersion coefficient has a certain scale effect with an increase in the transport distance the dispersion coefficient also increases the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dl m2 s 1 and the transverse hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dt are traditionally defined as bear 1972 schincariol and rowe 2001 olsson and grathwohl 2007 12 d l d p α l ν a 13 d t d p α t ν a where d p m2 s 1 is the pore diffusion coefficient ν is the flow velocity and a 1 2 freeze and cherry 1979 α l and α t m denote the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity respectively which are representative properties of the porous medium d p can be estimated from following empirical relationship grathwohl 1998 boving and grathwohl 2001 14 d p d aq f where d aq m2 s 1 is the aqueous diffusion coefficient and ϕ is the porosity when the injection pressure increases the forward approach speed of the remediation agent increases increasing the d aq value of the contamination and then strengthens the dispersion effect when the injection pressure is 20 cm of water head d cl is 39 2 greater than d ct and with 30 cm and 40 cm of water head d cl increases by 27 9 and 23 3 respectively the difference between d cl and d ct can be explained by αl αt bear and verruijt 1987 found ratios of αl αt of 5 1 to 100 1 injection pressure affects the expansion of the contamination plume when the injection pressure is doubled from 20 cm to 40 cm of water head a c increases by 17 96 which greatly affects the remediation effect 3 2 experiment set 2 particle size three porous media with different particle sizes were selected and injection tests were conducted using the same injection pressure 35 cm of water head fig 7 depicts the distribution characteristics of the remediation reagent and the plume in the medium the effect of particle size on the remediation agent is shown by d rt and d rl lines in fig 7 a c the migration rate of the remediation agent in coarse sand is fast while that in fine sand is slow d rt and d rl in fine sand show obvious consistency while coarse sand and medium sand remain synchronous in the initial stage however with the passage of time d rl gradually becomes larger than d rt and in coarse sand d rl and d rt values diverge even more the particle size of the medium can affect the migration rate of the remediation agent in the medium due to the change of pore structure and the porosity of the medium for the case of high flow rates mechanical dispersion plays a dominant role while molecular diffusion plays a dominant role for the case of low flow rates therefore solute in a medium will move along the longitudinal direction and the transverse direction the former is the longitudinal dispersion caused by mechanical dispersion and the latter is the transverse dispersion caused by molecular diffusion the application of this theory can explain the phenomenon that the migration synchronization of remediation agent in fine sand is better than that in coarse sand the effect of the particle size on the contamination plume is shown as the other two lines in fig 7 a c and in the column chart d fine sand can inhibit the expansion of the contamination plume and the front of the contamination plume in coarse sand moves forward rapidly when the particle size increases the effective porosity increases formula 13 shows that the porosity affects daq which in turn affects the dispersion in the medium and the increase in the permeability coefficient k increases the convection effect when the particle size of the medium is increased from 40 to 70 mesh 0 36 mm average grain size to 10 20 mesh 0 72 mm a c increases by 28 45 3 3 experiment set 3 agent viscosity the polymer viscosity range is determined by pre experiment because high viscosities block the injection port to obtain the effects of injected agent viscosity on the hydrodynamic dispersion of the contamination plume 0 1 pv agent was injected into the pce plume through the injection port and experimental values of 0 025 0 05 0 075 and 0 1 pv were selected to plot the results as shown in fig 8 a total of four concentrations of polymer additives were selected including 0 200 400 and 800 mg l the mixed remediation solutions were injected under the same injection pressure 40 cm water head the presence of the polymer causes the lateral and longitudinal migration of the agent to be more uniform and the lateral flow of the agent is significantly enhanced compared to lateral flow in the absence of the polymer in addition the higher viscosity of the remediation agent the better the synchronization effect of d rt and d rl the presence of the polymer keeps d rt and d rl synchronized increases the transverse flow of the remediation agent and causes more uniform remediation the higher the viscosity the better the synchronization effect the reduced mobility i e the increased resistance to flow within the more permeable strata promotes enhanced transverse fluid movement i e cross flow into adjacent lower permeability strata mitigating preferential flow and the bypassing of lower permeability strata that often limits the effectiveness of remediation treatments silva et al 2017 the synchronization between d rt and d rl reaches 99 4 which is higher than the 91 6 that is achieved when no polymer is added adding a polymer to potassium permanganate can reduce the outward expansion of the contamination plume during injection the mixture of a polymer and the remediation agent changes the viscosity of the mixture and further affects the permeability coefficient thus affecting convection and dispersion adding 400 mg l of polymer can effectively reduce a c by 18 6 compared with no addition of polymer however the effects of the polymer remediation agent with different viscosities on the outward expansion of the contamination plume are also different fig 9 shows that a polymer solution with a concentration of 800 mg l produces a driving effect stronger than a solution of 800 mg l concentration in the later stages the reason is that when the polymer solution with 800 mg l concentration is injected the polymer solution is wrapped on the surface of the medium and will change the properties of the medium which affects the permeability thus affecting the convection and dispersion of subsequent injections this is consistent with the polymer acceleration mechanisms inaccessible pore volume ipv and surface exclusion effects described by silva et al 2013 the experimental results show that the application of polymer needs a certain viscosity range and there must be the most suitable injection viscosity in order to avoid the high viscosity polymer solution blocking the injection port or further increasing the risk of contamination plume expansion it is necessary to determine the viscosity range of the remediation agent injection through pre test when the polymer is used for site remediation 3 4 comprehensive analysis initial area ratios ki of 0 025 pv 0 05 pv 0 075 pv and 0 1 pv were selected to analyse expansion of the contamination plume figs 5 d 7 d and 9 respectively represent the effects of injection pressure medium particle size and viscosity of the injection solution on the driving action of the contamination plume ki characterizes the degree of expansion of the contamination plume which is negatively correlated with expansion of contamination plume the driving effect refers to the action of the driving force when the remediation agent is injected on the contamination plume causing the contamination plume moves forward the larger the ki value is the weaker the driving effect of the contamination plume the order of influence of the injection pressure on the driving effect of the contamination plume is 40 cm 30 cm 20 cm for particle size coarse sand medium sand fine sand and for agent viscosity no added polymer added polymer 200 mg l added polymer 800 mg l added polymer 400 mg l the optimal polymer addition amount is 400 mg l when the remediation agent is injected into the contamination plume since the contamination degradation reaction occurs only where the agent and the contamination plume overlap mixing of the agent and the contamination plume is a necessary condition for a reaction to occur ottino 1989 the area ratio k a when the plume reaches the maximum and the spreading speed difference ssd are the two parameters we have defined to measure the mixing effect to ensure the accuracy of the evaluation effect we added two parameters the quantitative longitudinal migration distance ratio k dl and the transverse migration distance ratio k dt the topsis analysis method was used to comprehensively analyse the characterization parameters table 3 and the remediation effect for three pressures was obtained the value of c reflects the influence of the mixing effect for each condition the results of the topsis analyses show that the values of c1 c2 and c3 are 0 22049 0 17752 and 0 16418 respectively since c1 c2 c3 the best mixing pressure is that with a head height of 20 cm the values of c4 c5 and c6 are 0 9464 0 16922 and 0 12173 respectively and they represent the effect of particle size on the mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume the optimum particle size is 10 20 mesh due to c4 c5 c6 average particle size is 0 72 mm the values of c3 c7 c8 and c9 are 0 16418 0 23700 0 35390 and 0 06815 respectively since c8 c7 c3 c9 the best concentration of polymer is 400 mg l xanthan gum for potassium permanganate remediation agent when a remediation agent is injected into an actual contaminated site ensuring that the mixing is enhanced without increasing the expansion of the contamination plume is very important the topsis analysis method is used to comprehensively analyse the optimal agent injection conditions and two evaluation indexes are selected ki characterizes the expansion of the contamination plume and ka represents the mixing effect between the remediation agent and contamination plume the calculation results are shown in table 4 the results show that the best order is 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm coarse sand fine sand medium sand and added polymer 400 mg l added polymer 200 mg l no added polymer added polymer 800 mg l the above results show that the injection effects of fine sand are better than those of coarse sand but in actual site remediation fine sand is difficult to inject due to its poor permeability to make the research have greater value for the actual isco we introduce the injection time t to characterize the degree of injection difficulty and to further optimize the evaluation method as an evaluation index the injection time can be calculated using formula 15 and formula 16 is used to correct 15 t t t m 16 t 1 t where t s is the initial injection time under 0 1 pv conditions and t m s is the maximum injection time for all experiments the calculation results are shown in table 5 the results show that the best order is 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm coarse sand medium sand fine sand and added polymer 400 mg l no polymer added added polymer 800 mg l added polymer 1600 mg l the optimum injection conditions are thus injection pressure 20 cm water head a coarse sand medium and added polymer at 400 mg l the results of using topsis analysis are consistent with the results of the experimental observations topsis can be used to analyse the optimal injection conditions under the influence of various factors but there are still limitations in this study in this paper we only start with a single homogeneous porous medium the complex underground porous medium conditions are not considered especially whether the formation of mno2 will change the medium conditions during the injection process one of the purposes of this study is to use the six parameters migration distance migration area initial area ratio rate ratio area ratio and migration distance ratio to quantitatively characterize the complex solute transport in groundwater environment from this point of view it is feasible and meaningful to propose six parameters and combine them with topsis to solve practical problems 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to explore the interaction between remediation agent injection and the drive and dispersion of the agent and the contamination plume which adds new considerations to in situ chemical techniques for groundwater remediation the conclusions are as follows the parameters migration distance d m migration area a m and initial area ratio k i can be used to characterize the remediation agent and the contamination plume forward approach the spreading speed difference ssd area ratio k a and migration distance ratio k d jointly characterize the mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume the order of the injection pressure for increasing the expansion of contaminated plumes is 40 cm 30 cm 20 cm for particle size coarse sand medium sand fine sand for polymer concentrations no added polymer added polymer 200 mg l added polymer 800 mg l added polymer 400 mg l when studying the mixing of the agent and the contamination plume the effect of particle size is much greater than injection pressure and agent viscosity among the three particle sizes coarse sand has clear advantages for mixing for viscosity the addition of a low viscosity polymer effectively increases the mixing effect in the media with a slightly greater effect than the injection pressure on the mixing when injecting the remediation agent into an actual site the above six parameters should be analyzed together to ensure that mixing is increased without increasing the expansion of the plume through a comprehensive analysis with topsis the optimal injection conditions under the influence of three different influencing factors are obtained and are an injection pressure of 20 cm water head a coarse sand medium and a polymer added at 400 mg l the results of using topsis analysis are consistent with the results of the experimental observations and the experimental observations and topsis analysis show that the setting of this parameter is feasible together we propose a way to translate image information into analyzable data by setting parameters declaration of

1525,to study the interactions between remediation agent injection and hydrodynamic dispersion as well as the expansion of a contamination plume a two dimensional sandbox experiment was conducted to simulate and monitor the mixing of a remediation agent in the contamination plume and the expansion of the contamination plume over time potassium permanganate is a purple solution and it represents the remediation agent perchloroethylene pce is dyed green and was used to observe the migration and diffusion of the contaminant and the overlap of contamination and the agent plume six quantitative characterization parameters migration distance d m migration area a m initial area ratio k i spreading speed difference ssd area ratio k a and migration distance ratio k d are proposed to comprehensively analyse the influence of the three factors of injection pressure particle size and viscosity change on the mixing of a remediation agent and the expansion of the contamination plume over time the results show that these six parameters can effectively characterize the mixing of the remediation agent and the expansion of the contamination plume where d m a m and ki characterize the expansion and the other three parameters characterize the mixing the factors increasing the expansion of the contamination plume follow the order 40 cm 30 cm 20 cm for injection pressure water head coarse sand medium sand fine sand for particle size and no polymer added added polymer 200 mg l added polymer 800 mg l added polymer 400 mg l for viscosity adjustment the factors that intensify the

added added polymer 800 mg l finally conclusions from the topsis method show that under optimal injection conditions mixing is enhanced without increasing plume expansion and that the optimum injection conditions are injection pressure 20 cm use of a coarse sand medium and added polymer concentration 400 mg l keywords contamination plume injection remediation agent dispersion and mixing expansion of the plume 1 introduction the most common chlorinated organic solvent compounds in groundwater such as tetrachloroethylene trichloroethylene carbon tetrachloride and vinyl chloride usually have relatively low aqueous solubility and low viscosity and are often difficult to biodegrade contaminated chlorinated solvents tend to form large groundwater contamination plumes significantly impacting regional water resource sustainability in many cases the plumes are hundreds of metres to several kilometres long brusseau et al 2011 in situ remediation is a commonly used technique for groundwater remediation wang and mulligan 2004 including air sparging as jang and aral 2009 johnson et al 2010 groundwater circulation wells gcws johnson and simon 2007 and in situ chemical oxidation isco siegrist et al 2011 seol et al 2003 mackinnon and thomson 2002 of this pool of remediation strategies in situ chemical oxidation isco methods are arguably the most commonly used in situ treatments and are adaptable to a variety of subsurface conditions and contaminant types sutton et al 2011 injection driven in situ remediation technologies have a common feature namely that the remediation agent needs to be injected into the groundwater through injection wells the success of such technologies often requires that the remediation agent is transported effectively underground and is in contact with the contaminants when the remediation agent is injected into the contamination plume since the contaminant degradation reaction occurs only where the agent and the contamination plume overlap mixing of the agent and the contamination plume is a necessary condition for the reaction to occur ottino 1989 due to molecular diffusion and the mixed results of pore scale dispersion only being capable of operating on a small scale mixing during in situ remediation can only occur when the distance between the remediation agent and the contamination plume is small piscopo et al 2013 the effectiveness of such injection driven in situ groundwater remediation techniques is impacted by preferential flow due to aquifer heterogeneity and uneven distributions of pollutants when the remediation agent is injected preferential flow forms easily in high permeability areas and heterogeneity induced bypassing problems easily occur in the low permeability areas smith and schwartz 1981 polymer amended in situ chemical oxidation pa isco has been shown to combats the challenges associated with subsurface permeability heterogeneity and poor isco fluid delivery by the addition of water soluble polymers and polyphosphates to the isco solution formulation silva et al 2017 polymer amendments provide enhanced solution viscosity and shear thinning rheology that combine to provide in situ mobility control and improve the injectivity of the solution when injected into porous media silva et al 2012 martel et al 1998 smith et al 2008 the experiment also demonstrated the compatibility i e oxidation resistance of xanthan gum biopolymer and permanganate oxidant in aqueous solution suggesting that viscosity modification is indeed applicable to isco injecting large amounts of remediation solution generates a driving force if the driving force is too small the mixing of the remediation agent and the pollutants is insufficient seriously weakening the effect of the remediation agent on pollutant digestion once the driving force becomes too great this strong driving force will lead to expansion of the contamination plume increasing the environmental risk of groundwater pollution and increasing the difficulty of restoration simpkin et al 2011 to summarize it is important to select and design a remediation agent injection system when using injectable in situ processing technology to treat contamination plumes cha and borden 2012 groundwater remediation is a lengthy process therefore it is very important to adopt scientific methods and technologies to improve the expansion and mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume and to control the spread of contaminated plumes to avoid further damage in this study a two dimensional plexiglass sandbox was selected and three types of quartz sand with different particle sizes were used as porous media to simulate the expansion and mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume and the development of the concentration and diffusion range of the contamination plume over time the effects of injection pressure on the migration and spread of contamination plume fronts were explored in the injection system design focusing on the interface in the mixing zone between the remediation agent and the contamination plume polymer xanthan gum was used to investigate the driving diffusive action of polymer enhanced injections of the remediation contamination plume 2 materials and methods 2 1 flow cell experiment in this experiment a two dimensional plexiglass sandbox was used to simulate the effect of an injected remediation agent on the spatial distribution of a contaminant plume as demonstrated in fig 1 the sandbox was placed horizontally with a length of 50 cm a width of 40 cm a height of 2 cm and a plexiglass thickness of 0 5 cm the quartz sand was packed homogeneously under water saturated conditions in the sandbox after packing 5 pore volumes pvs of deionized water were poured through the sandbox to remove fines from the packed sand an injection port was provided at the centre of the sandbox for emplacement contamination plumes and for injecting the remediation agents the entire experimental setup consisted of four main parts a two dimensional sandbox a light source a camera and a constant water head supply tank fig 2 a stable light source was used to guarantee the brightness for photography the camera was placed under the sandbox approximately 0 8 m from the box the porous media used in the sandbox experiments were three grades of silica sand 10 20 mesh 0 72 mm average grain size 20 40 0 51 mm and 40 70 0 36 mm obtained from sinopharm chemical agent co ltd table 1 lists the main characteristics of the quartz sands three packing configurations were used for three sets of experiments fig 1 the heterogeneous accusand system was wet packed and was kept saturated with water after packing zhong et al 2011 using a packing method similar to zhong et al 2011 to ensure uniform water distribution three high precision pumps were used to pump fluids into the sandbox through 20 evenly distributed injection ports outflow fluids also flowed through 20 evenly distributed effluent ports connected to a constant water head chamber the flow rate was 5 ml min for all sandbox tests the average porosity and dry bulk density values of the sands listed in table 1 were obtained gravimetrically other physical and chemical properties of the sands can be found in the study by schroth et al schroth et al 1996 a contaminant plume setting method 500 ml dissolved solution pce sino pharmaceutical shanghai 20 mg l was used to simulate the contamination plume to allow visual observations naphthol green b dye was added to colour the plume in the experiments details of the 9 experiments in the 3 groups are presented in table 2 the first three experiments used a potassium permanganate solution sino pharmaceutical beijing as the remediation agent experimental group 1 used 10 20 mesh quartz sand and three different pressures were used for each group the remediation agent was loaded into the water supply tank and the injection pressure was controlled by adjusting the height of the water supply tank experimental groups 2 and 3 were filled with silica sand of 20 40 and 40 70 mesh respectively xanthan gum aladdin china a water soluble biopolymer was used to modify the viscosity of the displacing fluids which are associated with shear thinning properties when xanthan gum is stirred it becomes a suspension with low viscosity if the suspension is then left undisturbed it regains its viscosity with time and it eventually becomes a gel again method for dissolving xanthan gum can refer to chokejaroenrat et al 2013 a brookfield lvdv3t viscometer was used to measure the viscosity of the remediation agent the shear rate range used for viscosity measurements was between 0 1 s 1 and 135 s 1 mackinnon and thomson 2002 the xanthan solutions are shear thinning fluids and the measured apparent viscosity shear rate relationships are shown in fig 3 all polymer solutions were filtered through a 0 6 μm membrane prior to injection to remove microgels that may have been present in solution chauveteau and kohler 1984 two sets of parallel experiments for each experiment with an error range within 15 2 2 quantitative characterization parameters to study the expansion and mixing of the remediation agent and the spread of the contamination plume the following parameters are defined for quantitative characterization fig 4 is the schematic diagram of

additionally used as the basis for further analysis using the topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method the topsis method is a commonly used multi objective decision making method that calculates the distance between the evaluated object and the ideal solution and the negative ideal solution which used to derive optimal remediation agent injection conditions zhou and jiang 2012 in this study the method is based on the theory that the distance between the best solution and the most ideal solution is the shortest this assumes that if each attribute exhibits as a monotonically increasing or decreasing variation then it is easy to define an ideal solution the goal is then to propose a solution which has the shortest distance from the ideal solution in euclidean space tzeng and huang 2010 shanian and savadogo 2006 the topsis method calculates the magnitude of the influence of each evaluation object on the results by calculating the euclidean distance there are several different parameters in this study each of which can affect the expansion of contamination plumes separately the total effect of several different parameters on contamination plumes is analyzed by the methods of the topsis firstly each parameter is converted into a monotonically increasing change that is the larger the parameter is the greater the impact of the experimental conditions on the contamination plume then use the normalization method to convert the parameter to a number of 0 1 finally the best solution is obtained by calculating the euclidean distance ci between each experimental condition and the ideal solution among them the ideal solution is each the experimental condition that has the least influence on the expansion of contamination plumes each parameter of the ideal solution is 0 it may come from different groups of experiments the best solution only comes from one group of experiments which represents that the experimental conditions of this group have the least influence on the contamination plume in all experiments the value of ci is the smallest the topsis method steps are as follows normalize the decision matrix the normalization of the decision matrix is performed using the following transformation 5 η ij r ij σ i 1 m r ij 2 j 1 2 n i 1 2 m where r ij represents the value of the jth attribute of the i th target η ij is the r ij after normalization multiply the columns of the normalized decision matrix by the associated weight and the result is v ij 6 v ij η ij ω j j 1 2 n i 1 2 m where ω j represents the weight of the jth attribute determine the ideal and nadir ideal solutions the ideal and the nadir value sets are determined respectively as follows 7 v 1 v 2 v n max i v ij j k min i v ij j k i 1 2 m 8 v 1 v 2 v n min i v ij j k max i v ij j k i 1 2 m where i is the index set of the benefit criteria and i is the index set of the cost criteria measure distances from the ideal and nadir solutions the two euclidean

discussion 3 1 experiment set 1 injection pressures for implementing isco injection pressure is an important design variable the injection pressure range was determined to be 15 45 cm of water head through preliminary experiments and then the experiment in exp 1 table 2 was conducted to study the influence of the injection pressure on the contamination plumes the main observations were the growth of the area of the agent a r and contamination plume a c and its transverse d t and longitudinal migration d l the remediation agent was injected into the centre injection port and photographs were taken at 10 s intervals the results are shown in fig 5 and the experiment photos are shown in fig 6 the d rt and d rl values are combined to characterize the migration of the remediation agent in the groundwater a r is used to characterize the effective remediation area the results are shown in fig 5 a c it can be seen from fig 5 that d rt and the d rl are synchronized at the initial stage but as the remediation agent is continuously injected d rl becomes greater than d rt at the same time the speed at which the remediation agent approaches forward is proportional to the injection pressure under the condition that the internal pore conditions of the medium are similar the main influencing factors of convection and dispersion are the external forces of the soil solution the migration distance of the remediation agent is related to the velocity of groundwater in the early stages of injection the convection effect is dominant and the strength of the convection is affected by the injection rate injection pressure of the remediation agent higher pressures lead to faster migration rates of the agent dispersion is dominant in the late injection stage considering the influence of the groundwater flow rate on the direction of the extension flow the migration distance in the longitudinal direction is greater than that in the transverse direction the experimental results are in agreement with this conclusion and can be confirmed by the theory of convective dispersion mentioned in previous studies peters and smith 2010 sahimi et al 1986 the effects of injection pressure on the contamination plume is not well understood based previous studies d cl and d ct are combined to characterize the migration of the contamination plume in the groundwater a c is used to characterize the expansion of the contamination plume the experimental results are shown by the other two lines in fig 5 a c and in the column chart d taylor taylor 1953 found that the dispersion and transport of solutes in a circular tube can be described by the convection dispersion equation however the dispersion coefficient is not a constant but increases geometrically with the flow velocity at the same time the dispersion coefficient has a certain scale effect with an increase in the transport distance the dispersion coefficient also increases the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dl m2 s 1 and the transverse hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dt are traditionally defined as bear 1972 schincariol and rowe 2001 olsson and grathwohl 2007 12 d l d p α l ν a 13 d t d p α t ν a where d p m2 s 1 is the pore diffusion coefficient ν is the flow velocity and a 1 2 freeze and cherry 1979 α l and α t m denote the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity respectively which are representative properties of the porous medium d p can be estimated from following empirical relationship grathwohl 1998 boving and grathwohl 2001 14 d p d aq f where d aq m2 s 1 is the aqueous diffusion coefficient and ϕ is the porosity when the injection pressure increases the forward approach speed of the remediation agent increases increasing the d aq value of the contamination and then strengthens the dispersion effect when the injection pressure is 20 cm of water head d cl is 39 2 greater than d ct and with 30 cm and 40 cm of water head d cl increases by 27 9 and 23 3 respectively the difference between d cl and d ct can be explained by αl αt bear and verruijt 1987 found ratios of αl αt of 5 1 to 100 1 injection pressure affects the expansion of the contamination plume when the injection pressure is doubled from 20 cm to 40 cm of water head a c increases by 17 96 which greatly affects the remediation effect 3 2 experiment set 2 particle size three porous media with different particle sizes were selected and injection tests were conducted using the same injection pressure 35 cm of water head fig 7 depicts the distribution characteristics of the remediation reagent and the plume in the medium the effect of particle size on the remediation agent is shown by d rt and d rl lines in fig 7 a c the migration rate of the remediation agent in coarse sand is fast while that in fine sand is slow d rt and d rl in fine sand show obvious consistency while coarse sand and medium sand remain synchronous in the initial stage however with the passage of time d rl gradually becomes larger than d rt and in coarse sand d rl and d rt values diverge even more the particle size of the medium can affect the migration rate of the remediation agent in the medium due to the change of pore structure and the porosity of the medium for the case of high flow rates mechanical dispersion plays a dominant role while molecular diffusion plays a dominant role for the case of low flow rates therefore solute in a medium will move along the longitudinal direction and the transverse direction the former is the longitudinal dispersion caused by mechanical dispersion and the latter is the transverse dispersion caused by molecular diffusion the application of this theory can explain the phenomenon that the migration synchronization of remediation agent in fine sand is better than that in coarse sand the effect of the particle size on the contamination plume is shown as the other two lines in fig 7 a c and in the column chart d fine sand can inhibit the expansion of the contamination plume and the front of the contamination plume in coarse sand moves forward rapidly when the particle size increases the effective porosity increases formula 13 shows that the porosity affects daq which in turn affects the dispersion in the medium and the increase in the permeability coefficient k increases the convection effect when the particle size of the medium is increased from 40 to 70 mesh 0 36 mm average grain size to 10 20 mesh 0 72 mm a c increases by 28 45 3 3 experiment set 3 agent viscosity the polymer viscosity range is determined by pre experiment because high viscosities block the injection port to obtain the effects of injected agent viscosity on the hydrodynamic dispersion of the contamination plume 0 1 pv agent was injected into the pce plume through the injection port and experimental values of 0 025 0 05 0 075 and 0 1 pv were selected to plot the results as shown in fig 8 a total of four concentrations of polymer additives were selected including 0 200 400 and 800 mg l the mixed remediation solutions were injected under the same injection pressure 40 cm water head the presence of the polymer causes the lateral and longitudinal migration of the agent to be more uniform and the lateral flow of the agent is significantly enhanced compared to lateral flow in the absence of the polymer in addition the higher viscosity of the remediation agent the better the synchronization effect of d rt and d rl the presence of the polymer keeps d rt and d rl synchronized increases the transverse flow of the remediation agent and causes more uniform remediation the higher the viscosity the better the synchronization effect the reduced mobility i e the increased resistance to flow within the more permeable strata promotes enhanced transverse fluid movement i e cross flow into adjacent lower permeability strata mitigating preferential flow and the bypassing of lower permeability strata that often limits the effectiveness of remediation treatments silva et al 2017 the synchronization between d rt and d rl reaches 99 4 which is higher than the 91 6 that is achieved when no polymer is added adding a polymer to potassium permanganate can reduce the outward expansion of the contamination plume during injection the mixture of a polymer and the remediation agent changes the viscosity of the mixture and further affects the permeability coefficient thus affecting convection and dispersion adding 400 mg l of polymer can effectively reduce a c by 18 6 compared with no addition of polymer however the effects of the polymer remediation agent with different viscosities on the outward expansion of the contamination plume are also different fig 9 shows that a polymer solution with a concentration of 800 mg l produces a driving effect stronger than a solution of 800 mg l concentration in the later stages the reason is that when the polymer solution with 800 mg l concentration is injected the polymer solution is wrapped on the surface of the medium and will change the properties of the medium which affects the permeability thus affecting the convection and dispersion of subsequent injections this is consistent with the polymer acceleration mechanisms inaccessible pore volume ipv and surface exclusion effects described by silva et al 2013 the experimental results show that the application of polymer needs a certain viscosity range and there must be the most suitable injection viscosity in order to avoid the high viscosity polymer solution blocking the injection port or further increasing the risk of contamination plume expansion it is necessary to determine the viscosity range of the remediation agent injection through pre test when the polymer is used for site remediation 3 4 comprehensive analysis initial area ratios ki of 0 025 pv 0 05 pv 0 075 pv and 0 1 pv were selected to analyse expansion of the contamination plume figs 5 d 7 d and 9 respectively represent the effects of injection pressure medium particle size and viscosity of the injection solution on the driving action of the contamination plume ki characterizes the degree of expansion of the contamination plume which is negatively correlated with expansion of contamination plume the driving effect refers to the action of the driving force when the remediation agent is injected on the contamination plume causing the contamination plume moves forward the larger the ki value is the weaker the driving effect of the contamination plume the order of influence of the injection pressure on the driving effect of the contamination plume is 40 cm 30 cm 20 cm for particle size coarse sand medium sand fine sand and for agent viscosity no added polymer added polymer 200 mg l added polymer 800 mg l added polymer 400 mg l the optimal polymer addition amount is 400 mg l when the remediation agent is injected into the contamination plume since the contamination degradation reaction occurs only where the agent and the contamination plume overlap mixing of the agent and the contamination plume is a necessary condition for a reaction to occur ottino 1989 the area ratio k a when the plume reaches the maximum and the spreading speed difference ssd are the two parameters we have defined to measure the mixing effect to ensure the accuracy of the evaluation effect we added two parameters the quantitative longitudinal migration distance ratio k dl and the transverse migration distance ratio k dt the topsis analysis method was used to comprehensively analyse the characterization parameters table 3 and the remediation effect for three pressures was obtained the value of c reflects the influence of the mixing effect for each condition the results of the topsis analyses show that the values of c1 c2 and c3 are 0 22049 0 17752 and 0 16418 respectively since c1 c2 c3 the best mixing pressure is that with a head height of 20 cm the values of c4 c5 and c6 are 0 9464 0 16922 and 0 12173 respectively and they represent the effect of particle size on the mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume the optimum particle size is 10 20 mesh due to c4 c5 c6 average particle size is 0 72 mm the values of c3 c7 c8 and c9 are 0 16418 0 23700 0 35390 and 0 06815 respectively since c8 c7 c3 c9 the best concentration of polymer is 400 mg l xanthan gum for potassium permanganate remediation agent when a remediation agent is injected into an actual contaminated site ensuring that the mixing is enhanced without increasing the expansion of the contamination plume is very important the topsis analysis method is used to comprehensively analyse the optimal agent injection conditions and two evaluation indexes are selected ki characterizes the expansion of the contamination plume and ka represents the mixing effect between the remediation agent and contamination plume the calculation results are shown in table 4 the results show that the best order is 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm coarse sand fine sand medium sand and added polymer 400 mg l added polymer 200 mg l no added polymer added polymer 800 mg l the above results show that the injection effects of fine sand are better than those of coarse sand but in actual site remediation fine sand is difficult to inject due to its poor permeability to make the research have greater value for the actual isco we introduce the injection time t to characterize the degree of injection difficulty and to further optimize the evaluation method as an evaluation index the injection time can be calculated using formula 15 and formula 16 is used to correct 15 t t t m 16 t 1 t where t s is the initial injection time under 0 1 pv conditions and t m s is the maximum injection time for all experiments the calculation results are shown in table 5 the results show that the best order is 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm coarse sand medium sand fine sand and added polymer 400 mg l no polymer added added polymer 800 mg l added polymer 1600 mg l the optimum injection conditions are thus injection pressure 20 cm water head a coarse sand medium and added polymer at 400 mg l the results of using topsis analysis are consistent with the results of the experimental observations topsis can be used to analyse the optimal injection conditions under the influence of various factors but there are still limitations in this study in this paper we only start with a single homogeneous porous medium the complex underground porous medium conditions are not considered especially whether the formation of mno2 will change the medium conditions during the injection process one of the purposes of this study is to use the six parameters migration distance migration area initial area ratio rate ratio area ratio and migration distance ratio to quantitatively characterize the complex solute transport in groundwater environment from this point of view it is feasible and meaningful to propose six parameters and combine them with topsis to solve practical problems 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to explore the interaction between remediation agent injection and the drive and dispersion of the agent and the contamination plume which adds new considerations to in situ chemical techniques for groundwater remediation the conclusions are as follows the parameters migration distance d m migration area a m and initial area ratio k i can be used to characterize the remediation agent and the contamination plume forward approach the spreading speed difference ssd area ratio k a and migration distance ratio k d jointly characterize the mixing of the remediation agent in the contamination plume the order of the injection pressure for increasing the expansion of contaminated plumes is 40 cm 30 cm 20 cm for particle size coarse sand medium sand fine sand for polymer concentrations no added polymer added polymer 200 mg l added polymer 800 mg l added polymer 400 mg l when studying the mixing of the agent and the contamination plume the effect of particle size is much greater than injection pressure and agent viscosity among the three particle sizes coarse sand has clear advantages for mixing for viscosity the addition of a low viscosity polymer effectively increases the mixing effect in the media with a slightly greater effect than the injection pressure on the mixing when injecting the remediation agent into an actual site the above six parameters should be analyzed together to ensure that mixing is increased without increasing the expansion of the plume through a comprehensive analysis with topsis the optimal injection conditions under the influence of three different influencing factors are obtained and are an injection pressure of 20 cm water head a coarse sand medium and a polymer added at 400 mg l the results of using topsis analysis are consistent with the results of the experimental observations and the experimental observations and topsis analysis show that the setting of this parameter is feasible together we propose a way to translate image information into analyzable data by setting parameters declaration of

1526,artificial freshwater recharge has been considered as a feasible and effective procedure to mitigate seawater intrusion in coastal regions the efficiency of freshwater infiltration through a check dam reservoir on saltwater recession swr is investigated using two physical models the results demonstrate the apparent tendency of recharge freshwater to move horizontally toward the boundaries rather than flowing downward to influence saltwater wedge toe thereby it would affect the saltwater wedge tip instead of its toe due to the new establishment of a positive hydraulic gradient from a dam reservoir to the boundaries moreover numerical dispersive simulations have been carried out on a large scale aquifer to find the optimum location of the dam as well as the aquifer characteristics impacts on swr efficiency the results show that the best location to construct a check dam is immediately above the saltwater wedge toe it is found that when saltwater head declines the steeper hydraulic gradient between boundaries is established and the efficiency of recharge performance will be improved moreover the reduction of hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction improves swr while higher hydraulic conductivity in the homogeneous cases only accelerates the infiltration rate but has no meaningful effect in the long term the considered recharge method also works better in scenarios with higher dispersivity however the construction of check dams on floodways might be a practical and low cost solution but it can be concluded that as the dominant direction of the recharged freshwater is toward boundaries it cannot promptly retreat saltwater around toe position keywords check dam saltwater recession sand tank model infiltration hydraulic gradient 1 introduction population growth and development of human activities lead to increased water demand this reveals the necessity of water resources protection against contaminations in coastal aquifers seawater intrusion swi is a serious threat and high salinity more than 2 to 3 makes water improper for drinking purposes todd and mays 2005 various methods have been developed to prevent swi into coastal aquifers optimum pumping rates mantoglou et al 2004 pool and carrera 2011 ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 arrangement of pumping wells location mantoglou 2003 park

vandenbohede and lebbe 2008 vandenbohede et al 2008 seawater extraction lu et al 2013b and combined methods abd elhamid and javadi 2011 javadi et al 2012 2015 are examples of swi mitigation procedures these studies have shown the relative success of continued usage of proposed methods on saltwater recession swr most of these studies focused on the feasibility of method implementation for a real scale aquifer e g arlai and koch 2017 s study on impact of underground dams on groundwater storage on samui island thailand or the economic aspect e g minimizing the total cost of management scenario studied by koussis et al 2011 and the transient salinity mitigation have not been addressed in detail one of the methods to recharge the coastal aquifers by surface waters is the construction of check dams on waterways that would prevent freshwater runoffs toward the sea the water reserved behind the dam gradually infiltrates into the soil and leads to an increased volume of groundwater together with the recession of intruded seawater regarding the effect of natural or artificial ponds christy and lakshmanan 2017 assessed the feasibility of a pond construction on a natural saline aquifer in india by application of electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar methods they showed that due to the low cost and construction simplicity of ponds these water bodies could be used as an effective tool to control the swi besides for better water penetration they suggested that the dimensions of ponds could be increased or an injection vertical shaft could be used for faster penetration the shaft can raise the efficiency of the procedure as freshwater dilutes the saltwater in depth lu et al 2017 studied the effects of pond shape on recharge rate and swr using the analytical simplified equations the results of their investigation illustrated that the injection well and the pond perform equally when the pond is dug outside of the saltwater region of unconfined coastal aquifers moreover they showed that the elliptical shape of the injection pond would cause the maximum infiltration flow rate atlabachew et al 2018 conducted experiments and numerical dispersive simulations to show the effects of different hydraulic gradient artificial recharge and pumping rate variations on the transmission of salinity in a sand tank freshwater recharge in their experiments constitutes a narrow strip that lays on the width of a sand tank they demonstrated that artificial recharge increases the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in both longitudinal and transverse directions thus the injection of freshwater with a constant rate leads to the expansion of salinity plume in both directions they also showed that increasing the hydraulic gradient or saltwater pumping rate would create an elliptical plume while by artificial recharge the salinity plume has been considerably stretched in the horizontal direction for real cases yang et al 2019 examined numerically the weir construction in an existing canal which is hydraulically connected to a coastal aquifer of bremerhaven in northern germany under different future sea level rise and weir height scenarios they showed that under the considered height of weir i e 0 8 m and a maximum 8 mm year sea level rise the complete impact of the weir construction takes almost 100 years as a drawback they demonstrated that the combination of weir construction and sea level rise will inundate usable lands by making new ponds the results of previous studies show that although many researchers have proposed the artificial recharge as a solution for swi prevention the limitation for the provision of injected freshwater has not been considered on the other hand the cost of freshwater supply has not been taken into account in cases where freshwater is not naturally available in the infected areas of coastal aquifers the use of desalination plants is also costly and the brackish wastewater disposal may jeopardize the ocean and coast environmental health the use of treated wastewater as a recharge source is usually expensive and in cases with excessive pumping it rarely is effective the artificial recharge by the pond is not welcomed in some countries due to its large space occupation therefore the construction of check dams on floodways and the use of freshwater flow in their reservoir for infiltration purposes is a practical and low cost solution especially in coastal regions with coarse topography where a gorge can be found the constructed alkhod dam in the mountainous region of oman sea coast can be considered as an example abdalla and al rawahi 2013 moreover check dams are often short have small reservoirs and occupy only riverbed and its riparian zone and can be built sequentially and easily with local materials that may lead to the least social tensions investigations are required on this subject to extend the current knowledge to the system involving the efficiency of the method and the best location of dam construction in this study the swr stage and behavior are firstly visualized experimentally considering the artificial reservoir of a check dam on top of the aquifer numerical simulation of physical models was then undertaken to check the validity of mathematical code afterward a large scale aquifer is selected and numerical simulations are applied to analyze the optimal location of dams and the length of its reservoir sensitivity analysis is then carried out to understand the impact of porous media properties on swr the flowchart of the study procedure is presented in fig 1 the results of this study provide a guide to remedy polluted coastal aquifers through the strategy of natural freshwater recharge 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental settings the experimental conditions in this research are adopted from the conditions used in the study of mehdizadeh et al 2014 uniform natural sand is selected to simulate the unconfined aquifer sieve analysis is carried out and the darcy column test is applied to determine the hydraulic conductivity k l t the grain sizes for d 10 d 50 and d 60 were 0 91 1 52 and 1 63 mm that produce the uniformity value d 60 d 10 as 1 79 the darcy s test repeated at least three times and the mean value i e 27 cm min is implemented for numerical simulation to establish the k value it is also calculated in the sand tank using darcy s law and by setting arbitrary heads at the boundaries and measuring the outflow discharge the porosity n was measured using a water saturation method fetter 2001 and obtained as 0 35 since the impact of specific yield s y in the unconfined aquifers is tangible than the specific storage coefficient s s l 1 the s y is determined using the drainage saturation method johnson 1966 and obtained as 0 29 two different experiments with different aquifer height and hydraulic gradients are conducted in this study the experiments are carried out in a sand tank with 100 cm length 100 cm height and 30 cm width the walls of the tank are made of transparent plate glass with 1 5 cm thickness to strengthen the tank the system is supported and braced by a steel frame twenty circular holes with inlet outlet taps are embedded at each side of the tank in two columns with a 10 cm interval along with it fine steel mesh with a diameter lower than the average diameter of the sand is also installed inside each tap to prevent sand flushing the saturation procedure is adopted from the study of ataie ashtiani 1998 to provide uniform sand compaction with minimum air bubbles the tank is connected to mariotte bottles via pvc pipes similar to the test performed by klute and dirksen 1986 each bottle contains 20 l of freshwater or saltwater images of the experiments are recorded by a digital camera laterally the 30 cm width of the tank may alter the aquifer to a semi three dimensional laboratory model and the saltwater movement inside the aquifer may vary in comparison to photos hence the 5 mm sample tubes are placed inside the sand tank according to fig 2 during the transient modeling the water is extracted by a syringe and salinity is determined using electrical conductivity ec meter milwaukee ec60 four mariotte bottles i e 80 l provide freshwater and three mariotte bottles corresponded as saltwater chambers the aquifer height is 80 cm in the first experiment while the check dam reservoir contained 14 l of freshwater in the second model the aquifer height is reduced to 40 cm and the volume of freshwater in the dam reservoir is limited to 9 l highly pure industrial sodium chloride laboratory usp reagent neutron pharmachemical company iran is used as the source of salinity rhodamine type b merck millipore germany is used for visual monitoring of saltwater wedge it is anticipated that the color dye must not change the density of water type and should not be absorbed by grains surface rhodamine b has been successfully used for natural sands by previous researchers e g schincariol and schwartz 1990 simmons et al 2002 werner et al 2009 shi et al 2011 mehdizadeh et al 2014 badaruddin et al 2015 however a negligible absorption was also reported in the current study the concentration of rhodamine is 500 mg l a minor difference in ec of saltwater also occurred which is corrected using a correction factor the algorithm presented by fofonoff and millard jr 1983 is used to convert the ec into salt concentration at the laboratory temperature of 25 c the ec of the mixture dissolution i e salt rhodamine in the saltwater chamber is measured as 57 5 and 39 0 ms cm respectively at the first and second experiments the concentration of saltwater is calculated as 37 9 and 24 4 kg m3 accordingly parameters of experiments are summarized in table 1 in the first experiment freshwater enters the tank through f1r l to f8r l taps while f2r and f7l are used as manometers the saltwater is delivered to the tank through s1r l to s5r l ports and s2l and s5r play the manometers role the brackish waters leave the system from s6r l s7r l and s8r l taps the freshwater and saltwater head at boundaries is constant during the experiment and is measured by the attached manometers as 690 and 672 mm respectively in the second experiment freshwater flows into the tank through f1r l to f4r l taps while f2r is used as a manometer the saltwater flows into the tank through s1r l and s3r l ports with s2l as a manometer the brackish water leaves the system from s4r l taps the constant boundary head is adjusted to 361 and 351 mm respectively for freshwater and saltwater the rectangular dam reservoir has a 20 cm width and placed 40 cm apart from each boundary before the commencement of experiments all taps at the saltwater side are closed and freshwater intruded through the system via freshwater ports to assure the aquifer saturation the steady experiments are then initiated when the saltwater taps are opened and heads at boundaries reach constant values the stagnation of saltwater wedge movement and constant outflow discharge are chosen as the steady state condition criteria the transient stage is then started by letting the freshwater of the dam reservoir penetrate the aquifer and the experiment continued until the mariotte bottles become empty nevertheless the total time of the swr process is included in transient experiments the size of two aquifer physical models i e maximum constant head at boundaries to aquifer length is in agreement with previous experimental studies e g goswami and clement 2007 chang and clement 2012 2 2 large scale aquifer precise analysis of swr behavior under different hydraulic conditions or soil properties requires numerous physical models moreover it is difficult to observe characteristics of swr e g mixing zone thickness under rapid circumstances of recharge carried out in the laboratory hence simulation representing large scale coastal aquifer is undertaken next to investigate the sensitivity of reservoir relevant parameters i e the distance of dam body to the coastline x l reservoir length l l and water depth in the reservoir in the vicinity of dam body h l on the swr the l l is not usually a decision variable for check dam design as it depends on the slope of the coastal plain and water inflow but it is necessary to find out that the longest reservoir would provide the best swr or not the aquifer geometry and physical properties are adopted from the conceptual model presented by werner and simmons 2009 and followed by chang et al 2011 the length of the aquifer is 1000 m and its height at the seaside is 30 m two different landward boundary conditions constant head constant flux are applied to the model table 2 provides different scenarios in the table ch and cf refer to a constant head and constant flux respectively k h and k v represent the k in horizontal and vertical directions respectively the term α l is longitudinal dispersivity the porosity value in all models is 0 35 for all ch boundary models the freshwater and seawater head h f0 h s0 are 31 and 30 m respectively except the first scenario where h s0 is considered as 29 m the constant flux for the cf case is 0 15 m2 d ultimately uniform rainfall recharge rate was set to 5 10 5 m day in all models 23 transient simulations have been introduced to analyze the sensitivity of swr to x l l l and h l according to table 3 increasing the number of models that are defined in table 2 to analyze recharge efficiency under different circumstances of aquifer properties will increase the number of runs and their comparison according to table 3 further research may require to examine this recharge procedure application for multi layered or fully heterogeneous coastal aquifers 2 3 density dependent modeling settings seawat modeling code langevin et al 2008 is developed for simulating the density dependent flow and solute transport in saturated porous media seawat has been used by many researchers in recent years successfully e g post et al 2013 mehdizadeh et al 2014 badaruddin et al 2015 in seawat the flow equation is solved with the finite difference modflow model harbaugh 2005 and the solute transport equation is solved by mt3dms model zheng and wang 1999 seawat couples the flow and transport equations through fluid density term the empirical equation of xu and eckstein todd and mays 2005 is used to estimate the α l and the value obtained as 0 25 cm for physical models the conducted sensitivity analysis demonstrates that due to the fast occurrence of reservoir impact in transient simulations a slight tolerance in α l will not affect the results significantly the transverse dispersivity is assumed as one tenth of longitudinal dispersivity this coefficient is usually 0 05 to 0 17 of α l jakovovic et al 2011 the molecular diffusion is considered as zero to choose the proper grid size it is necessary to use the criterion for simulation accuracy and mixing zone thickness precision goswami and clement 2007 to achieve the goal the peclet number p e should be less than 4 voss and souza 1987 δx 1 0 cm and δz 0 5 cm satisfied the grid size criterion for experimental models time steps for groundwater flow and solute transport equations are 15 and 5 s respectively in the laboratory the time took to reach the steady state condition before freshwater recharge via reservoir was 260 and 200 min respectively for the first and second experiments then the transient experiments last for 21 and 15 min respectively the recharge effect was finished prior these times as it is observed that the saltwater wedge started to intrude again by seawat the transient simulations are continued to 100 min for the first and 70 min for the second case until a new steady state condition is reached this new steady state condition helped us to check the salt wedge went to its initial position lake package at modflow is used to simulate the dam reservoir the package is an alternative to the typical approach of the general head boundary ghb condition the initial water stage in the reservoir and leakance of the riverbed are assigned to topmost cells of the models and the transient stage is computed automatically based on the water budget the leakance parameter represents the leakance of the reservoir bed sediments it is calculated by reservoir bed sediment hydraulic conductivity divided to sediment thickness in the current experiments the bottom of the reservoir is directly put on the soil so it was almost 12 and 5 cm above the water table respectively for the first and second experiments in these cases it can be assumed that the k of reservoir bed sediments is 27 cm min and therefore the leakance will be 2 3 and 5 4 min 1 respectively it is found that seawat result is not sensitive to such high number of leakance term as it produces minimal resistance to flow for the large scale aquifer according to peclet number restriction the cell sizes δx δz are selected as 2 0 5 m salt concentration which represents the salinity of the sea is 35 kg m3 for coastline boundary cells freshwater and seawater densities are 1000 and 1025 kg m3 respectively in the transient simulation n and s y are assumed to be 0 3 and 0 2 respectively flow and solute equations are explicitly coupled and the courant number is set to be 0 75 time steps for groundwater flow and solute transport equations are 5 and 2 days respectively the required time to reach the steady state condition before initiating the check dam effect depending on each model condition is varied from 100 years models 1 and 4 to 300 years model 3 and 7 all transient simulations last for 5 years for simplicity and accurate simulation of the saturated zone only it is assumed that the reservoir will be filled once only at the beginning of the first year the evaporation is also neglected and therefore the whole reservoir water is assumed to penetrate the aquifer water infiltration by dam is mostly common in coastal areas with seasonal or ephemeral stream thus it is assumed that the main channel does not contain permanent water and so there is no recharge resulting from it the leakance term is set to 2 0 1 day since the lakebed longitudinal slope causes changes in water depth along the reservoir the total length of the reservoir is subdivided into at least five parts while the water depth is assumed constant in each of these subsections see fig 3 2 4 method of swr assessment three parameters are measured to evaluate the recharge effect on swr 1 saltwater wedge toe position x t l which is the intersection position of 0 05c 0 salinity contour line in the aquifer bed from sea boundary 2 the saltwater volume that remains in the aquifer vs l3 where salinity is greater than 0 05c 0 kaleris and ziogas 2013 used a less than 0 014c 0 criterion as an index to define freshwater this extent is a conservative index for potable water for agricultural purposes salinity might increase to 2 0 kg m3 depending on the type of crop skogerboe et al 1979 thus the criterion greater than 5 of the saltwater chamber in the experiments or seawater for field scale cases is a reasonable index for saltwater determination in seawat the number of cells with salinity greater than 0 5c 0 is multiplied at the area of each cell i e δx δz to calculate vs per width of the aquifer 3 percentage of saltwater volume reduction p r is calculated according to the volume of saltwater before and after the construction of a check dam in time i using the following equation 1 p r 100 v si v so v so where p r is the reduction percentage v si is the volume of saltwater at time i after the recharge and v s0 is the volume of saltwater within the aquifer before applying the infiltration via the reservoir 3 results and discussions 3 1 assessment of numerical and experimental simulation salinities of extracted waters measured in the laboratory are first compared with seawat results extracted water with salinity less than 5 of saltwater chambers is ignored for this comparison the differences are highlighted in the first experiment so that the maximum difference equals to 108 at s5 position after 9 min of transient state initiation 15 8 kg m3 in seawat and 32 9 kg m3 in a sand tank the minimum difference of 3 is observed in s1 location at the end of the steady state condition and before recharge penetration 37 9 kg m3 in seawat and 36 7 kg m3 in the sand tank salinities extracted at sample points are shown in fig 4 several reasons can be discussed for this discrepancy 1 heterogeneity and anisotropy in some parts of the aquifer are inevitable in the laboratory even though the soil compaction is performed with high precision 2 minor cohesion of rhodamine to sand grains is observed 3 the proper performance of mariotte bottles to establish and preserve the constant heads in boundaries leads to time lag it is observed that in the first experiment freshwater penetration through the reservoir could not change the toe position and it remains constant as 85 5 cm similar behavior resulted in numerical modeling with x t value as 91 cm in the second experiment with the lower aquifer height the recharge effect on swr is more tangible in the second physical model the toe position is 32 cm apart from the saltwater boundary under steady state condition then the toe position reaches to 29 cm in nine minutes and remains constant the saltwater volume is derived for experiments using image processing analysis and defining a color threshold as saltwater the minimum pixel numbers reached to 2290 and 2105 respectively in width and height after cropping the margin of each image the extracted values per width of the sand tank for both cases are presented in fig 5 a and b as an example flow streamlines and the associated experimental and numerical saltwater wedge is presented in fig 5 c and d after 7 min under transient simulation for the second test according to the figure in the first experiment after 8 min vs reaches its minimum value by the two approaches the vs value at this time is 2005 and 2325 cm2 respectively for the experiment and seawat with a 14 difference the recharge water is then finished and consequently the vs value goes to almost its initial magnitude for the second experiment the vs gets its minimum value after nine minutes of freshwater infiltration initiation in the laboratory i e 449 cm2 while it reaches its minimum value i e 507 cm2 after five minutes via seawat modeling it is shown that the obtained experimental saltwater volume follows the same trend as produced in the numerical model however the swr characteristics including vs are underestimated in comparison to seawat results implementing image analysis similar to the studies presented by robinson et al 2015 2016 to measure the precise mixing zone area in the laboratory might approach the results fig 6 demonstrates the saltwater wedge shape for both tests before and after recharge from a dam reservoir at the beginning of transient modeling the hydraulic freshwater head of the dam reservoir becomes greater than heads in boundaries that makes a positive and intensive hydraulic gradient toward the boundaries as a result the freshwater and seawater that are delivered from mariotte bottles will be ceased for seconds small fluctuations are also observed in freshwater boundary heads during these seconds in addition for the first experiment due to the limitation on dimensions of experimental appurtenance the horizontal path to exit points is shorter than aquifer height thus most of the recharge freshwater tends to move horizontally to the discharge area rather than flowing downward to influence the saltwater wedge toe the dashed lines in fig 6 a prove that the recharge freshwater influence the saltwater wedge around its tip this will lead to an insignificant influence of infiltration via the reservoir on swr especially on toe position moreover an elevated head below the check dam increases heads throughout the cross section of the aquifer in case of horizontal flow that also leads leaky freshwater reluctant to move vertically toward the toe 3 2 swr in a large scale coastal aquifer to assess the variation of dam location and reservoir size on swr models 3 5 and 7 with different scenarios under large scale aquifer framework presented in table 3 are selected the saltwater wedge toe position in model 3 is at the distance of 279 m from the sea boundary at the end of the steady state condition in the first scenario t3 1 the dam body and most parts of reservoir length are located on the saltwater wedge and in the second scenario t3 2 the dam is placed upstream of the saltwater wedge before its toe position see table 3 fig 7 a presents the saltwater amount during the transient simulation of model 3 the steady x t before freshwater recharge for models 5 and 7 is at 405 m and 449 m respectively the vs extent over time is shown in fig 7 b and 7 c for these two models according to graphs contrary to expectation the volume of saltwater is slightly increased at initial days that could be attributed to the significant release of freshwater volume at early times that causes a broad mixing zone due to significant dilution of freshwater with saltwater it then follows a downward trend a steady trend is observed after two years of a transient simulation of models 5 and 7 that is attributed to the gradual reservoir freshwater decline that will minimize the recharge effect it is also demonstrated that in some scenarios e g t5 3 the vs gradually goes to it is initial value during the selected period of simulation moreover t3 1 t5 3 and t7 3 models correspond to the maximum swr among other scenarios thus the longest reservoir would not necessarily provide the best efficiency since it gets closer to the land boundary and the recharge freshwater flows on the inverse direction nevertheless as the water depth increases in the reservoir the vs value has fallen accordingly timescale is often defined when the condition reaches to the new steady state condition timescale is important in evaluating the temporal efficiency of remediation activities lu and werner 2013 discussed it in detail based on the interface toe when an instantaneous or gradual change of land boundary head occurs in the present study based on vs values the points of inflection in fig 7 b and c demonstrate that check dam properties including dam height its position and reservoir length do not sensitively change the timescale it is observed that in scenarios t3 2 t5 3 and t7 3 which are received the maximum effect the p r extent is 8 7 2 and 8 2 respectively the dam body in these scenarios is located close to the saltwater wedge it should be highlighted that surprisingly the volume of freshwater in the reservoir for these scenarios is less than some other scenarios defined at each model the conducted numerical simulations affirm the experimental results the proximity of reservoir to sea boundary and or land boundary creates a positive hydraulic gradient toward boundaries causing the recharged freshwater moving to the outlet this occurrence is against the dominant idea of flowing downward of recharged freshwater for instance the x l in t5 2 t5 3 and t5 4 scenarios is 150 400 and 400 m far from sea boundary respectively while the l l is 400 250 and 400 m in these three scenarios the maximum p r values in these scenarios are 3 2 7 1 and 4 2 respectively while the volume of recharged freshwater in these scenarios is 1000 625 and 1000 m3 due to this evidence we concluded that the best location to construct the check dams is immediately above the saltwater wedge toe the low p r is directly related to the volume of freshwater recharge and its proportion to the volume of saltwater available inside the aquifer before applying the reservoir to clarify this issue in this study the maximum ratio of freshwater volume penetrated from a dam reservoir to the volume of existing saltwater in the aquifer i e before dam implementation is respectively 11 6 15 and 13 for models 3 5 and 7 3 3 sensitivity analysis 3 3 1 hydraulic gradients two scenarios of t1 1 and t2 1 are selected with hydraulic gradients of 0 002 and 0 001 respectively other conditions of the aquifer are kept identical according to fig 8 a when the hydraulic gradient is increased the efficiency of recharge performance has significantly improved as seawater level declines a steeper hydraulic gradient from the reservoir to the sea boundary will establish this would deliver freshwater from the dam reservoir into the brackish water area rather than freshwater boundary and hence elevates the recharge procedure efficiency this conclusion is also in agreement with the numerical simulations of atlabachew et al 2018 s experimental setup streamlines in their study demonstrated that most parts of recharge water travel to sea boundary for a high hydraulic gradient scenario 3 3 2 hydraulic conductivity scenarios t2 1 with k of 10 m d and t3 1 with k of 1 m d are selected for comparison according to fig 8 b at initial times the t2 1 scenario has been more successful higher permeability in this scenario causes faster freshwater transmission however in the long term the performance of these two scenarios is almost equivalent that would conclude that the magnitude of k has roughly no meaningful impact when the dam reservoir approaches to its normal function in the long term i e approaches to steady state function the independence of saltwater wedge characteristics to k magnitude in the steady state condition of systems contains constant heads at boundaries is also approved by previous studies e g lu et al 2013a 3 3 3 longitudinal dispersivity three scenarios of t2 2 t4 1 and t5 2 with respectively 4 12 and 1 m of α l are compared in this section as expected the increase of longitudinal dispersivity produces a thicker mixing zone the area of mixing zone at the end of steady state condition for these scenarios is 5294 5501 and 4037 m2 respectively according to fig 9 at this stage the vs value obtained as 6494 5669 and 6680 m3 respectively for these three scenarios that is the evidence that larger α l could not necessarily result in greater saltwater volume inside the aquifer however as it is clear in the figure the thickness of the mixing zone is much broader for the greatest α l model when the freshwater recharge is applied as discussed in previous sections the recharge freshwater tends to move horizontally through the exit area rather than encountering the water in saltwater wedge neighbor the freshwater flow dilutes brackish water around wedge tip at the discharge area and amplifies the p r amount of scenarios with higher α l 3 3 4 anisotropy p r values of two scenarios t5 3 k h k v 1 and t6 1 k h k v 10 is presented in fig 10 a it has been noted that the reduction of k in vertical direction leads to improved recharge performance less permeability in the vertical direction leads to the movement of freshwater toward the boundaries including the discharge area more water dilution will occur at saltwater wedge tip fig 10 b while during that time the swr near the toe position remained negligible for both cases manipulating permeability or dispersivity in the specified coastal field is not feasible but the results could be useful to decide if check dams should be deployed or not 3 3 5 type of land boundary condition fig 11 a compares two scenarios of t5 3 and t7 3 with ch and cf land boundary type both cases produced similar swi at the steady state condition it is observed that changing the boundary conditions does not have a significant effect on the results however continues freshwater inflow in cf freshwater boundary improves swr for the cf cases after two years of transient simulation this is in spite of the ch condition where freshwater entrance is terminated for a while because of the inverse hydraulic gradient from the dam reservoir toward the inland fig 11 b 4 conclusion this study deals with swr behavior in coastal aquifers when freshwater is recharged from a check dam reservoir analyses have been carried out through the sand tank experiments and numerical model of a field scale aquifer to meet the objectives of the research including evaluating the efficiency of the suggested recharge method finding the optimum check dam location and the effect of aquifer properties on swr the numerical simulation of swr is conducted by dispersive seawat code by laboratory experiments it is found that the hydraulic freshwater head of the dam reservoir is greater than heads in boundaries that directs the freshwater streamlines toward the borders where the diluted saltwater can be discharged through the system and therefore leads to an insignificant impact on saltwater wedge toe dispersive simulations of experimental set up were in good agreement with laboratory observation and hence used as mathematical modeling validation for most of the scenarios introduced in the large scale aquifer the saltwater volume is increased early after infiltration is commenced via the dam reservoir due to the dispersivity effect following experimental results the best location of the dam body is concluded to be immediately above the saltwater wedge toe the appropriate distance from sea boundary provides an opportunity for recharge freshwater to travel the longer path to outlet area and therefore more parts of the saltwater wedge can receive its impact it is shown that when seawater level declines in the sea and steeper hydraulic gradient from the reservoir to the sea boundary establishes recharge function is enhanced due to transmission of higher freshwater flow rate to saltwater wedge tip area moreover it is observed that higher hydraulic conductivity precipitates the swr and scenarios with higher dispersivity values are more profited by recharged freshwater as it can dilute more brackish water at saltwater wedge tip similarly in anisotropic aquifers where vertical permeability is less than the horizontal one recharge flow is directed horizontally to interact with saltwater wedge tip rather than its toe our findings in the present study highlight the significant role of check dam location on saltwater wedge repulsion behavior to ascertain the best efficiency more researches might be required applying check dams on real cases where the reservoir is exposed to several periods of fill and empty timescale and evaluating the required time under different circumstances of aquifer properties or boundary conditions are also important from the aquifer management point of view and needs further study declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1526,artificial freshwater recharge has been considered as a feasible and effective procedure to mitigate seawater intrusion in coastal regions the efficiency of freshwater infiltration through a check dam reservoir on saltwater recession swr is investigated using two physical models the results demonstrate the apparent tendency of recharge freshwater to move horizontally toward the boundaries rather than flowing downward to influence saltwater wedge toe thereby it would affect the saltwater wedge tip instead of its toe due to the new establishment of a positive hydraulic gradient from a dam reservoir to the boundaries moreover numerical dispersive simulations have been carried out on a large scale aquifer to find the optimum location of the dam as well as the aquifer characteristics impacts on swr efficiency the results show that the best location to construct a check dam is immediately above the saltwater wedge toe it is found that when saltwater head declines the steeper hydraulic gradient between boundaries is established and the efficiency of recharge performance will be improved moreover the reduction of hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction improves swr while higher hydraulic conductivity in the homogeneous cases only accelerates the infiltration rate but has no meaningful effect in the long term the considered recharge method also works better in scenarios with higher dispersivity however the construction of check dams on floodways might be a practical and low cost solution but it can be concluded that as the dominant direction of the recharged freshwater is toward boundaries it cannot promptly retreat saltwater around toe position keywords check dam saltwater recession sand tank model infiltration hydraulic gradient 1 introduction population growth and development of human activities lead to increased water demand this reveals the necessity of water resources protection against contaminations in coastal aquifers seawater intrusion swi is a serious threat and high salinity more than 2 to 3 makes water improper for drinking purposes todd and mays 2005 various methods have been developed to prevent swi into coastal aquifers optimum pumping rates mantoglou et al 2004 pool and carrera 2011 ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 arrangement of pumping wells location mantoglou 2003 park

these studies have shown the relative success of continued usage of proposed methods on saltwater recession swr most of these studies focused on the feasibility of method implementation for a real scale aquifer e g arlai and koch 2017 s study on impact of underground dams on groundwater storage on samui island thailand or the economic aspect e g minimizing the total cost of management scenario studied by koussis et al 2011 and the transient salinity mitigation have not been addressed in detail one of the methods to recharge the coastal aquifers by surface waters is the construction of check dams on waterways that would prevent freshwater runoffs toward the sea the water reserved behind the dam gradually infiltrates into the soil and leads to an increased volume of groundwater together with the recession of intruded seawater regarding the effect of natural or artificial ponds christy and lakshmanan 2017 assessed the feasibility of a pond construction on a natural saline aquifer in india by application of electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar methods they showed that due to the low cost and construction simplicity of ponds these water bodies could be used as an effective tool to control the swi besides for better water penetration they suggested that the dimensions of ponds could be increased or an injection vertical shaft could be used for faster penetration the shaft can raise the efficiency of the procedure as freshwater dilutes the saltwater in depth lu et al 2017 studied the effects of pond shape on recharge rate and swr using the analytical simplified equations the results of their investigation illustrated that the injection well and the pond perform equally when the pond is dug outside of the saltwater region of unconfined coastal aquifers moreover they showed that the elliptical shape of the injection pond would cause the maximum infiltration flow rate atlabachew et al 2018 conducted experiments and numerical dispersive simulations to show the effects of different hydraulic gradient artificial recharge and pumping rate variations on the transmission of salinity in a sand tank freshwater recharge in their experiments constitutes a narrow strip that lays on the width of a sand tank they demonstrated that artificial recharge increases the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in both longitudinal and transverse directions thus the injection of freshwater with a constant rate leads to the expansion of salinity plume in both directions they also showed that increasing the hydraulic gradient or saltwater pumping rate would create an elliptical plume while by artificial recharge the salinity plume has been considerably stretched in the horizontal direction for real cases yang et al 2019 examined numerically the weir construction in an existing canal which is hydraulically connected to a coastal aquifer of bremerhaven in northern germany under different future sea level rise and weir height scenarios they showed that under the considered height of weir i e 0 8 m and a maximum 8 mm year sea level rise the complete impact of the weir construction takes almost 100 years as a drawback they demonstrated that the combination of weir construction and sea level rise will inundate usable lands by making new ponds the results of previous studies show that although many researchers have proposed the artificial recharge as a solution for swi prevention the limitation for the provision of injected freshwater has not been considered on the other hand the cost of freshwater supply has not been taken into account in cases where freshwater is not naturally available in the infected areas of coastal aquifers the use of desalination plants is also costly and the brackish wastewater disposal may jeopardize the ocean and coast environmental health the use of treated wastewater as a recharge source is usually expensive and in cases with excessive pumping it rarely is effective the artificial recharge by the pond is not welcomed in some countries due to its large space occupation therefore the construction of check dams on floodways and the use of freshwater flow in their reservoir for infiltration purposes is a practical and low cost solution especially in coastal regions with coarse topography where a gorge can be found the constructed alkhod dam in the mountainous region of oman sea coast can be considered as an example abdalla and al rawahi 2013 moreover check dams are often short have small reservoirs and occupy only riverbed and its riparian zone and can be built sequentially and easily with local materials that may lead to the least social tensions investigations are required on this subject to extend the current knowledge to the system involving the efficiency of the method and the best location of dam construction in this study the swr stage and behavior are firstly visualized experimentally considering the artificial reservoir of a check dam on top of the aquifer numerical simulation of physical models was then undertaken to check the validity of mathematical code afterward a large scale aquifer is selected and numerical simulations are applied to analyze the optimal location of dams and the length of its reservoir sensitivity analysis is then carried out to understand the impact of porous media properties on swr the flowchart of the study procedure is presented in fig 1 the results of this study provide a guide to remedy polluted coastal aquifers through the strategy of natural freshwater recharge 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental settings the experimental conditions in this research are adopted from the conditions used in the study of mehdizadeh et al 2014 uniform natural sand is selected to simulate the unconfined aquifer sieve analysis is carried out and the darcy column test is applied to determine the hydraulic conductivity k l t the grain sizes for d 10 d 50 and d 60 were 0 91 1 52 and 1 63 mm that produce the uniformity value d 60 d 10 as 1 79 the darcy s test repeated at least three times and the mean value i e 27 cm min is implemented for numerical simulation to establish the k value it is also calculated in the sand tank using darcy s law and by setting arbitrary heads at the boundaries and measuring the outflow discharge the porosity n was measured using a water saturation method fetter 2001 and obtained as 0 35 since the impact of specific yield s y in the unconfined aquifers is tangible than the specific storage coefficient s s l 1 the s y is determined using the drainage saturation method johnson 1966 and obtained as 0 29 two different experiments with different aquifer height and hydraulic gradients are conducted in this study the experiments are carried out in a sand tank with 100 cm length 100 cm height and 30 cm width the walls of the tank are made of transparent plate glass with 1 5 cm thickness to strengthen the tank the system is supported and braced by a steel frame twenty circular holes with inlet outlet taps are embedded at each side of the tank in two columns with a 10 cm interval along with it fine steel mesh with a diameter lower than the average diameter of the sand is also installed inside each tap to prevent sand flushing the saturation procedure is adopted from the study of ataie ashtiani 1998 to provide uniform sand compaction with minimum air bubbles the tank is connected to mariotte bottles via pvc pipes similar to the test performed by klute and dirksen 1986 each bottle contains 20 l of freshwater or saltwater images of the experiments are recorded by a digital camera laterally the 30 cm width of the tank may alter the aquifer to a semi three dimensional laboratory model and the saltwater movement inside the aquifer may vary in comparison to photos hence the 5 mm sample tubes are placed inside the sand tank according to fig 2 during the transient modeling the water is extracted by a syringe and salinity is determined using electrical conductivity ec meter milwaukee ec60 four mariotte bottles i e 80 l provide freshwater and three mariotte bottles corresponded as saltwater chambers the aquifer height is 80 cm in the first experiment while the check dam reservoir contained 14 l of freshwater in the second model the aquifer height is reduced to 40 cm and the volume of freshwater in the dam reservoir is limited to 9 l highly pure industrial sodium chloride laboratory usp reagent neutron pharmachemical company iran is used as the source of salinity rhodamine type b merck millipore germany is used for visual monitoring of saltwater wedge it is anticipated that the color dye must not change the density of water type and should not be absorbed by grains surface rhodamine b has been successfully used for natural sands by previous researchers e g schincariol and schwartz 1990 simmons et al 2002 werner et al 2009 shi et al 2011 mehdizadeh et al 2014 badaruddin et al 2015 however a negligible absorption was also reported in the current study the concentration of rhodamine is 500 mg l a minor difference in ec of saltwater also occurred which is corrected using a correction factor the algorithm presented by fofonoff and millard jr 1983 is used to convert the ec into salt concentration at the laboratory temperature of 25 c the ec of the mixture dissolution i e salt rhodamine in the saltwater chamber is measured as 57 5 and 39 0 ms cm respectively at the first and second experiments the concentration of saltwater is calculated as 37 9 and 24 4 kg m3 accordingly parameters of experiments are summarized in table 1 in the first experiment freshwater enters the tank through f1r l to f8r l taps while f2r and f7l are used as manometers the saltwater is delivered to the tank through s1r l to s5r l ports and s2l and s5r play the manometers role the brackish waters leave the system from s6r l s7r l and s8r l taps the freshwater and saltwater head at boundaries is constant during the experiment and is measured by the attached manometers as 690 and 672 mm respectively in the second experiment freshwater flows into the tank through f1r l to f4r l taps while f2r is used as a manometer the saltwater flows into the tank through s1r l and s3r l ports with s2l as a manometer the brackish water leaves the system from s4r l taps the constant boundary head is adjusted to 361 and 351 mm respectively for freshwater and saltwater the rectangular dam reservoir has a 20 cm width and placed 40 cm apart from each boundary before the commencement of experiments all taps at the saltwater side are closed and freshwater intruded through the system via freshwater ports to assure the aquifer saturation the steady experiments are then initiated when the saltwater taps are opened and heads at boundaries reach constant values the stagnation of saltwater wedge movement and constant outflow discharge are chosen as the steady state condition criteria the transient stage is then started by letting the freshwater of the dam reservoir penetrate the aquifer and the experiment continued until the mariotte bottles become empty nevertheless the total time of the swr process is included in transient experiments the size of two aquifer physical models i e maximum constant head at boundaries to aquifer length is in agreement with previous experimental studies e g goswami and clement 2007 chang and clement 2012 2 2 large scale aquifer precise analysis of swr behavior under different hydraulic conditions or soil properties requires numerous physical models moreover it is difficult to observe characteristics of swr e g mixing zone thickness under rapid circumstances of recharge carried out in the laboratory hence simulation representing large scale coastal aquifer is undertaken next to investigate the sensitivity of reservoir relevant parameters i e the distance of dam body to the coastline x l reservoir length l l and water depth in the reservoir in the vicinity of dam body h l on the swr the l l is not usually a decision variable for check dam design as it depends on the slope of the coastal plain and water inflow but it is necessary to find out that the longest reservoir would provide the best swr or not the aquifer geometry and physical properties are adopted from the conceptual model presented by werner and simmons 2009 and followed by chang et al 2011 the length of the aquifer is 1000 m and its height at the seaside is 30 m two different landward boundary conditions constant head constant flux are applied to the model table 2 provides different scenarios in the table ch and cf refer to a constant head and constant flux respectively k h and k v represent the k in horizontal and vertical directions respectively the term α l is longitudinal dispersivity the porosity value in all models is 0 35 for all ch boundary models the freshwater and seawater head h f0 h s0 are 31 and 30 m respectively except the first scenario where h s0 is considered as 29 m the constant flux for the cf case is 0 15 m2 d ultimately uniform rainfall recharge rate was set to 5 10 5 m day in all models 23 transient simulations have been introduced to analyze the sensitivity of swr to x l l l and h l according to table 3 increasing the number of models that are defined in table 2 to analyze recharge efficiency under different circumstances of aquifer properties will increase the number of runs and their comparison according to table 3 further research may require to examine this recharge procedure application for multi layered or fully heterogeneous coastal aquifers 2 3 density dependent modeling settings seawat modeling code langevin et al 2008 is developed for simulating the density dependent flow and solute transport in saturated porous media seawat has been used by many researchers in recent years successfully e g post et al 2013 mehdizadeh et al 2014 badaruddin et al 2015 in seawat the flow equation is solved with the finite difference modflow model harbaugh 2005 and the solute transport equation is solved by mt3dms model zheng and wang 1999 seawat couples the flow and transport equations through fluid density term the empirical equation of xu and eckstein todd and mays 2005 is used to estimate the α l and the value obtained as 0 25 cm for physical models the conducted sensitivity analysis demonstrates that due to the fast occurrence of reservoir impact in transient simulations a slight tolerance in α l will not affect the results significantly the transverse dispersivity is assumed as one tenth of longitudinal dispersivity this coefficient is usually 0 05 to 0 17 of α l jakovovic et al 2011 the molecular diffusion is considered as zero to choose the proper grid size it is necessary to use the criterion for simulation accuracy and mixing zone thickness precision goswami and clement 2007 to achieve the goal the peclet number p e should be less than 4 voss and souza 1987 δx 1 0 cm and δz 0 5 cm satisfied the grid size criterion for experimental models time steps for groundwater flow and solute transport equations are 15 and 5 s respectively in the laboratory the time took to reach the steady state condition before freshwater recharge via reservoir was 260 and 200 min respectively for the first and second experiments then the transient experiments last for 21 and 15 min respectively the recharge effect was finished prior these times as it is observed that the saltwater wedge started to intrude again by seawat the transient simulations are continued to 100 min for the first and 70 min for the second case until a new steady state condition is reached this new steady state condition helped us to check the salt wedge went to its initial position lake package at modflow is used to simulate the dam reservoir the package is an alternative to the typical approach of the general head boundary ghb condition the initial water stage in the reservoir and leakance of the riverbed are assigned to topmost cells of the models and the transient stage is computed automatically based on the water budget the leakance parameter represents the leakance of the reservoir bed sediments it is calculated by reservoir bed sediment hydraulic conductivity divided to sediment thickness in the current experiments the bottom of the reservoir is directly put on the soil so it was almost 12 and 5 cm above the water table respectively for the first and second experiments in these cases it can be assumed that the k of reservoir bed sediments is 27 cm min and therefore the leakance will be 2 3 and 5 4 min 1 respectively it is found that seawat result is not sensitive to such high number of leakance term as it produces minimal resistance to flow for the large scale aquifer according to peclet number restriction the cell sizes δx δz are selected as 2 0 5 m salt concentration which represents the salinity of the sea is 35 kg m3 for coastline boundary cells freshwater and seawater densities are 1000 and 1025 kg m3 respectively in the transient simulation n and s y are assumed to be 0 3 and 0 2 respectively flow and solute equations are explicitly coupled and the courant number is set to be 0 75 time steps for groundwater flow and solute transport equations are 5 and 2 days respectively the required time to reach the steady state condition before initiating the check dam effect depending on each model condition is varied from 100 years models 1 and 4 to 300 years model 3 and 7 all transient simulations last for 5 years for simplicity and accurate simulation of the saturated zone only it is assumed that the reservoir will be filled once only at the beginning of the first year the evaporation is also neglected and therefore the whole reservoir water is assumed to penetrate the aquifer water infiltration by dam is mostly common in coastal areas with seasonal or ephemeral stream thus it is assumed that the main channel does not contain permanent water and so there is no recharge resulting from it the leakance term is set to 2 0 1 day since the lakebed longitudinal slope causes changes in water depth along the reservoir the total length of the reservoir is subdivided into at least five parts while the water depth is assumed constant in each of these subsections see fig 3 2 4 method of swr assessment three parameters are measured to evaluate the recharge effect on swr 1 saltwater wedge toe position x t l which is the intersection position of 0 05c 0 salinity contour line in the aquifer bed from sea boundary 2 the saltwater volume that remains in the aquifer vs l3 where salinity is greater than 0 05c 0 kaleris and ziogas 2013 used a less than 0 014c 0 criterion as an index to define freshwater this extent is a conservative index for potable water for agricultural purposes salinity might increase to 2 0 kg m3 depending on the type of crop skogerboe et al 1979 thus the criterion greater than 5 of the saltwater chamber in the experiments or seawater for field scale cases is a reasonable index for saltwater determination in seawat the number of cells with salinity greater than 0 5c 0 is multiplied at the area of each cell i e δx δz to calculate vs per width of the aquifer 3 percentage of saltwater volume reduction p r is calculated according to the volume of saltwater before and after the construction of a check dam in time i using the following equation 1 p r 100 v si v so v so where p r is the reduction percentage v si is the volume of saltwater at time i after the recharge and v s0 is the volume of saltwater within the aquifer before applying the infiltration via the reservoir 3 results and discussions 3 1 assessment of numerical and experimental simulation salinities of extracted waters measured in the laboratory are first compared with seawat results extracted water with salinity less than 5 of saltwater chambers is ignored for this comparison the differences are highlighted in the first experiment so that the maximum difference equals to 108 at s5 position after 9 min of transient state initiation 15 8 kg m3 in seawat and 32 9 kg m3 in a sand tank the minimum difference of 3 is observed in s1 location at the end of the steady state condition and before recharge penetration 37 9 kg m3 in seawat and 36 7 kg m3 in the sand tank salinities extracted at sample points are shown in fig 4 several reasons can be discussed for this discrepancy 1 heterogeneity and anisotropy in some parts of the aquifer are inevitable in the laboratory even though the soil compaction is performed with high precision 2 minor cohesion of rhodamine to sand grains is observed 3 the proper performance of mariotte bottles to establish and preserve the constant heads in boundaries leads to time lag it is observed that in the first experiment freshwater penetration through the reservoir could not change the toe position and it remains constant as 85 5 cm similar behavior resulted in numerical modeling with x t value as 91 cm in the second experiment with the lower aquifer height the recharge effect on swr is more tangible in the second physical model the toe position is 32 cm apart from the saltwater boundary under steady state condition then the toe position reaches to 29 cm in nine minutes and remains constant the saltwater volume is derived for experiments using image processing analysis and defining a color threshold as saltwater the minimum pixel numbers reached to 2290 and 2105 respectively in width and height after cropping the margin of each image the extracted values per width of the sand tank for both cases are presented in fig 5 a and b as an example flow streamlines and the associated experimental and numerical saltwater wedge is presented in fig 5 c and d after 7 min under transient simulation for the second test according to the figure in the first experiment after 8 min vs reaches its minimum value by the two approaches the vs value at this time is 2005 and 2325 cm2 respectively for the experiment and seawat with a 14 difference the recharge water is then finished and consequently the vs value goes to almost its initial magnitude for the second experiment the vs gets its minimum value after nine minutes of freshwater infiltration initiation in the laboratory i e 449 cm2 while it reaches its minimum value i e 507 cm2 after five minutes via seawat modeling it is shown that the obtained experimental saltwater volume follows the same trend as produced in the numerical model however the swr characteristics including vs are underestimated in comparison to seawat results implementing image analysis similar to the studies presented by robinson et al 2015 2016 to measure the precise mixing zone area in the laboratory might approach the results fig 6 demonstrates the saltwater wedge shape for both tests before and after recharge from a dam reservoir at the beginning of transient modeling the hydraulic freshwater head of the dam reservoir becomes greater than heads in boundaries that makes a positive and intensive hydraulic gradient toward the boundaries as a result the freshwater and seawater that are delivered from mariotte bottles will be ceased for seconds small fluctuations are also observed in freshwater boundary heads during these seconds in addition for the first experiment due to the limitation on dimensions of experimental appurtenance the horizontal path to exit points is shorter than aquifer height thus most of the recharge freshwater tends to move horizontally to the discharge area rather than flowing downward to influence the saltwater wedge toe the dashed lines in fig 6 a prove that the recharge freshwater influence the saltwater wedge around its tip this will lead to an insignificant influence of infiltration via the reservoir on swr especially on toe position moreover an elevated head below the check dam increases heads throughout the cross section of the aquifer in case of horizontal flow that also leads leaky freshwater reluctant to move vertically toward the toe 3 2 swr in a large scale coastal aquifer to assess the variation of dam location and reservoir size on swr models 3 5 and 7 with different scenarios under large scale aquifer framework presented in table 3 are selected the saltwater wedge toe position in model 3 is at the distance of 279 m from the sea boundary at the end of the steady state condition in the first scenario t3 1 the dam body and most parts of reservoir length are located on the saltwater wedge and in the second scenario t3 2 the dam is placed upstream of the saltwater wedge before its toe position see table 3 fig 7 a presents the saltwater amount during the transient simulation of model 3 the steady x t before freshwater recharge for models 5 and 7 is at 405 m and 449 m respectively the vs extent over time is shown in fig 7 b and 7 c for these two models according to graphs contrary to expectation the volume of saltwater is slightly increased at initial days that could be attributed to the significant release of freshwater volume at early times that causes a broad mixing zone due to significant dilution of freshwater with saltwater it then follows a downward trend a steady trend is observed after two years of a transient simulation of models 5 and 7 that is attributed to the gradual reservoir freshwater decline that will minimize the recharge effect it is also demonstrated that in some scenarios e g t5 3 the vs gradually goes to it is initial value during the selected period of simulation moreover t3 1 t5 3 and t7 3 models correspond to the maximum swr among other scenarios thus the longest reservoir would not necessarily provide the best efficiency since it gets closer to the land boundary and the recharge freshwater flows on the inverse direction nevertheless as the water depth increases in the reservoir the vs value has fallen accordingly timescale is often defined when the condition reaches to the new steady state condition timescale is important in evaluating the temporal efficiency of remediation activities lu and werner 2013 discussed it in detail based on the interface toe when an instantaneous or gradual change of land boundary head occurs in the present study based on vs values the points of inflection in fig 7 b and c demonstrate that check dam properties including dam height its position and reservoir length do not sensitively change the timescale it is observed that in scenarios t3 2 t5 3 and t7 3 which are received the maximum effect the p r extent is 8 7 2 and 8 2 respectively the dam body in these scenarios is located close to the saltwater wedge it should be highlighted that surprisingly the volume of freshwater in the reservoir for these scenarios is less than some other scenarios defined at each model the conducted numerical simulations affirm the experimental results the proximity of reservoir to sea boundary and or land boundary creates a positive hydraulic gradient toward boundaries causing the recharged freshwater moving to the outlet this occurrence is against the dominant idea of flowing downward of recharged freshwater for instance the x l in t5 2 t5 3 and t5 4 scenarios is 150 400 and 400 m far from sea boundary respectively while the l l is 400 250 and 400 m in these three scenarios the maximum p r values in these scenarios are 3 2 7 1 and 4 2 respectively while the volume of recharged freshwater in these scenarios is 1000 625 and 1000 m3 due to this evidence we concluded that the best location to construct the check dams is immediately above the saltwater wedge toe the low p r is directly related to the volume of freshwater recharge and its proportion to the volume of saltwater available inside the aquifer before applying the reservoir to clarify this issue in this study the maximum ratio of freshwater volume penetrated from a dam reservoir to the volume of existing saltwater in the aquifer i e before dam implementation is respectively 11 6 15 and 13 for models 3 5 and 7 3 3 sensitivity analysis 3 3 1 hydraulic gradients two scenarios of t1 1 and t2 1 are selected with hydraulic gradients of 0 002 and 0 001 respectively other conditions of the aquifer are kept identical according to fig 8 a when the hydraulic gradient is increased the efficiency of recharge performance has significantly improved as seawater level declines a steeper hydraulic gradient from the reservoir to the sea boundary will establish this would deliver freshwater from the dam reservoir into the brackish water area rather than freshwater boundary and hence elevates the recharge procedure efficiency this conclusion is also in agreement with the numerical simulations of atlabachew et al 2018 s experimental setup streamlines in their study demonstrated that most parts of recharge water travel to sea boundary for a high hydraulic gradient scenario 3 3 2 hydraulic conductivity scenarios t2 1 with k of 10 m d and t3 1 with k of 1 m d are selected for comparison according to fig 8 b at initial times the t2 1 scenario has been more successful higher permeability in this scenario causes faster freshwater transmission however in the long term the performance of these two scenarios is almost equivalent that would conclude that the magnitude of k has roughly no meaningful impact when the dam reservoir approaches to its normal function in the long term i e approaches to steady state function the independence of saltwater wedge characteristics to k magnitude in the steady state condition of systems contains constant heads at boundaries is also approved by previous studies e g lu et al 2013a 3 3 3 longitudinal dispersivity three scenarios of t2 2 t4 1 and t5 2 with respectively 4 12 and 1 m of α l are compared in this section as expected the increase of longitudinal dispersivity produces a thicker mixing zone the area of mixing zone at the end of steady state condition for these scenarios is 5294 5501 and 4037 m2 respectively according to fig 9 at this stage the vs value obtained as 6494 5669 and 6680 m3 respectively for these three scenarios that is the evidence that larger α l could not necessarily result in greater saltwater volume inside the aquifer however as it is clear in the figure the thickness of the mixing zone is much broader for the greatest α l model when the freshwater recharge is applied as discussed in previous sections the recharge freshwater tends to move horizontally through the exit area rather than encountering the water in saltwater wedge neighbor the freshwater flow dilutes brackish water around wedge tip at the discharge area and amplifies the p r amount of scenarios with higher α l 3 3 4 anisotropy p r values of two scenarios t5 3 k h k v 1 and t6 1 k h k v 10 is presented in fig 10 a it has been noted that the reduction of k in vertical direction leads to improved recharge performance less permeability in the vertical direction leads to the movement of freshwater toward the boundaries including the discharge area more water dilution will occur at saltwater wedge tip fig 10 b while during that time the swr near the toe position remained negligible for both cases manipulating permeability or dispersivity in the specified coastal field is not feasible but the results could be useful to decide if check dams should be deployed or not 3 3 5 type of land boundary condition fig 11 a compares two scenarios of t5 3 and t7 3 with ch and cf land boundary type both cases produced similar swi at the steady state condition it is observed that changing the boundary conditions does not have a significant effect on the results however continues freshwater inflow in cf freshwater boundary improves swr for the cf cases after two years of transient simulation this is in spite of the ch condition where freshwater entrance is terminated for a while because of the inverse hydraulic gradient from the dam reservoir toward the inland fig 11 b 4 conclusion this study deals with swr behavior in coastal aquifers when freshwater is recharged from a check dam reservoir analyses have been carried out through the sand tank experiments and numerical model of a field scale aquifer to meet the objectives of the research including evaluating the efficiency of the suggested recharge method finding the optimum check dam location and the effect of aquifer properties on swr the numerical simulation of swr is conducted by dispersive seawat code by laboratory experiments it is found that the hydraulic freshwater head of the dam reservoir is greater than heads in boundaries that directs the freshwater streamlines toward the borders where the diluted saltwater can be discharged through the system and therefore leads to an insignificant impact on saltwater wedge toe dispersive simulations of experimental set up were in good agreement with laboratory observation and hence used as mathematical modeling validation for most of the scenarios introduced in the large scale aquifer the saltwater volume is increased early after infiltration is commenced via the dam reservoir due to the dispersivity effect following experimental results the best location of the dam body is concluded to be immediately above the saltwater wedge toe the appropriate distance from sea boundary provides an opportunity for recharge freshwater to travel the longer path to outlet area and therefore more parts of the saltwater wedge can receive its impact it is shown that when seawater level declines in the sea and steeper hydraulic gradient from the reservoir to the sea boundary establishes recharge function is enhanced due to transmission of higher freshwater flow rate to saltwater wedge tip area moreover it is observed that higher hydraulic conductivity precipitates the swr and scenarios with higher dispersivity values are more profited by recharged freshwater as it can dilute more brackish water at saltwater wedge tip similarly in anisotropic aquifers where vertical permeability is less than the horizontal one recharge flow is directed horizontally to interact with saltwater wedge tip rather than its toe our findings in the present study highlight the significant role of check dam location on saltwater wedge repulsion behavior to ascertain the best efficiency more researches might be required applying check dams on real cases where the reservoir is exposed to several periods of fill and empty timescale and evaluating the required time under different circumstances of aquifer properties or boundary conditions are also important from the aquifer management point of view and needs further study declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1527,degradation of chlorinated ethenes ces in low conductivity layers of aquifers reduces pollution plume tailing and accelerates natural attenuation timeframes the degradation pathways involved are often different from those in the higher conductive layers and might go undetected when only highly conductive layers are targeted in site assessments reactive transport model simulations pht3d in flopy were executed to assess the performance of dual carbon and chlorine compound specific stable isotope analysis csia in degradation pathway identification and quantification in a coupled physical chemical heterogeneous virtual aquifer degradation rate constants were assumed correlated to the hydraulic conductivity positively for oxidative transformation higher oxygen availability in coarser sands and negatively for chemical reduction higher content of reducing solids in finer sediments predicted carbon isotope ratios were highly heterogeneous they generally increased downgradient of the pollution source but the large variation across depth illustrates that monotonously increasing isotope ratios downgradient as were associated with the oxidative component are not necessarily a common situation when degradation is favorable in low conductivity layers dual carbon chlorine csia performed well in assessing the occurrence of the spatially separated degradation pathways and the overall degradation provided appropriate enrichment factors were known and sufficiently different however pumping to obtain groundwater samples especially from longer well screens causes a bias towards overestimation of the contribution of oxidative transformation associated with the higher conductive zones as degradation was less intense in these highly conductive zones under the simulated conditions overall degradation was underestimated in contrast in the usual case of limited csia data dual csia plots may rather indicate dominance of chemical reduction while oxidative transformation could go unnoticed despite being an equally important degradation pathway 1 introduction the potential degradation of chlorinated ethenes ces through both biotic and abiotic redox sensitive pathways in groundwater vogel et al 1987 opened opportunities for monitored natural attenuation mna as an alternative to invasive energy intensive technologies for the remediation of polluted sites until recently mna was focused on biotic reductive dechlorination brd of tce recent studies suspect that chloroethene degradation in the presence of iron ii minerals might have been underestimated at field sites including at sites where degradation occurs through simultaneous abiotic and biotic degradation brown et al 2007 one of the reasons would be the general lack of detection of degradation products either due to being indiscernible from the background concentrations or simply because they are not measured he et al 2009 for instance when trichloroethylene tce is in contact with the iron hydroxides green rust or magnetite the daughter products acetylene ethene and ethane are likely to degrade further in aquifers berns et al 2019 han et al 2012 jeong and kim 2007 lee and batchelor 2002 liang et al 2009 for similar reasons the aerobic cometabolism of tce which ultimately produces co2 and cl could have been overlooked compound specific stable isotope analysis csia has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for determining ce degradation pathways and extent of degradation bloom et al 2000 clark et al 2016 palau et al 2014 sherwood lollar et al 1999 for instance during tce degradation the bond containing a heavy carbon isotope is cleaved slightly slower than the bond containing a light carbon isotope the resulting carbon isotope fractionation depends on the extent of tce degradation and on the fractionation potential of the reaction characterized by the process specific enrichment factor ε hunkeler et al 2002 both degradation by iron ii minerals and the aerobic cometabolism of tce are associated with a large range large carbon isotope enrichment factors respectively from 9 to 33 for chemical reduction liang and dong 2007 zwank et al 2005 and from 1 to 20 for aerobic cometabolism barth et al 2002 chu et al 2004 and could be detected and quantified at field sites using csia when two degradation pathways are co occurring at a site the csia data of a unique element does not allow a proper attribution of degradation to the one or the other pathway höyng et al 2015 dual carbon chlorine csia c cl csia is specifically promising for the study of co existing degradation pathways of ces at field sites as the relative extent of c and cl isotope fractionation depends on the reaction mechanism where several processes were likely to occur c cl csia slopes have helped in selecting the main degradation pathway badin et al 2016 clark et al 2016 hunkeler et al 2011 provided that the enrichment factors of each reaction pathway are known and the relative chlorine to carbon isotope enrichments εcl εc are sufficiently different the respective participation of each of the two different degradation pathways to overall degradation as well as the extent of overall degradation can be determined based on a c cl csia dataset van breukelen 2007 physical and chemical heterogeneities of aquifers directly impact reactive transport of pollutants physical heterogeneities induce preferential flow and therefore mixing of reactive components geochemical heterogeneity induces zones of either abundance or scarcity of reactive minerals and sedimentary organic matter it is likely that zones of low conductivity will be more reductive while conductive zones where oxygen can be transported faster than it is consumed will be more oxic additionally different geological layers might present different mineralogy specific surface areas or host different microbial groups inducing an additional correlation between hydraulic conductivity and reactivity for example at a field site sampled with high resolution the reduction and therefore the immobilization of uranium was higher in low permeability zones than in permeable sediments resulting from both abiotic and biotic processes janot et al 2015 however hydraulic conductivity is not the only parameter expected to be correlated with reactivity for instance the ferrous mineral content seemed to be an important parameter to explain the difference of reactivity of two clayey soils in the abiotic degradation of chlorinated ethenes schaefer et al 2017 in both low conductivity zones and in conductive zones availability of substrate and bacterial activity plays a role in the biotic reduction or oxidation of pollutants berns et al 2019 mcmahon 2001 wanner et al 2018a yan et al 2016 with time reduced conditions develop in chlorinated solvent plumes christensen et al 2000 such additional conditions influence reactivity while being potentially uncorrelated to the hydraulic conductivity and were addressed in previous modeling studies atchley et al 2014 jang et al 2017 sanz prat et al 2016 despite those additional complexities heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity in aquifers plays a major role in degradation jang et al 2017 well characterized aquifers are rare and aquifers are often considered as black boxes in which the degradation and transport patterns of ces must be determined through spatially and temporally sparse datasets in this context synthetic data sets created using models combining reactive transport with isotope fractionation are employed for advising practitioners on the optimal csia sampling strategies höyng et al 2015 xu et al 2017 the effects of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on resulting c csia patterns of toluene degrading with various electron acceptors was assessed before by reactive transport modeling of aquifer analogs höyng et al 2015 using such a similar approach the present study investigates whether dual c cl csia could detect tce degradation through two different reaction pathways when those pathways occur dominantly in different conductivity zones low permeability sediments such as clay lenses are more likely to present reductive conditions susceptible to host biotic reductive dechlorination of ces damgaard et al 2013 takeuchi et al 2011 wanner et al 2018b and might offer large reactive iron mineral contents and surfaces schaefer et al 2017 high conductivity zones as permeable sands are more likely to be aerobic and therefore can host tce biotic oxidation either directly or through aerobic cometabolism applying a simple correlation between the hydraulic conductivity and the two degradation rate constants of tce aerobic transformation and chemical reduction alike the approach of cunningham and fadel 2007 we investigate the resulting spatially heterogeneous carbon and chlorine isotope ratio patterns of tce and the implications for polluted site investigation the main objectives of this study are 1 to understand how spatially heterogeneous csia patterns evolve from physical chemical heterogeneous conditions 2 to assess the performance of dual c cl csia in detecting the occurrence of both degradation pathways and in calculating overall degradation under these conditions and 3 to assess the effect of pumping preferentially from the more permeable zones on degradation assessment 2 methodology 2 1 general setup of model the multicomponent transport and degradation is modeled with pht3d prommer et al 2001 which combines the 3 d multicomponent transport model mt3dms with the geochemical model phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 1999 pht3d was accessed through the python interface flopy bakker et al 2016 the third order total variation diminishing tvd solution scheme was used for the advective term which tends to minimize numerical dispersion and artificial oscillation model run time on a computer with an intel cpu at 2 5 ghz and 4 gb of ram was about 9400 min and the produced data file size was of about 5 gb a tce source with a thickness of 4 m is set at the upgradient boundary of the aquifer the source includes a non degradative tracer with otherwise similar characteristics to tce the degradation rate constants of aerobic cometabolism and chemical reduction of tce are either positively oxidation or negatively chemical reduction correlated to the hydraulic conductivity k the first order degradation rate constants range between 0 and 10 y 1 discussed in detail later the simulated 2d aquifer domain is 100 m long and 10 m thick with a homogeneous rectangular discretization of 0 5 m in the x spreading direction and 0 05 in the z depth direction for simplicity the porosity was set homogeneously to 0 35 across the aquifer this value is typical for unconsolidated sands the dry bulk density was set to 1 855 kg l 1 throughout the aquifer system the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field was obtained using the field generator available in modflow chiang 2013 which is based on mejia s algorithm which was previously used for hydrogeological modeling studies zammouri and ribeiro 2017 in our model the mean of the log normally distributed k was set to 3 3 10 4 m s 1 with a standard deviation for ln k of 1 5 in line with prior modeling studies atchley et al 2014 uçankuş and ünlü 2008 and field data gelhar and welty 1992 heterogeneity is supposedly lesser in the horizontal than in the vertical direction in sediment layers which is obtain in the generated k field by setting correlation lengths to 7 m

horizontal direction 0 07 0 34 m in the vertical direction maghrebi et al 2015 those input parameters yield a medium heterogeneous aquifer see fig 1 with hydraulic conductivities corresponding to a sandy aquifer gelhar and welty 1992 and are in line with prior modeling studies atchley et al 2014 uçankuş and ünlü 2008 the simulated conductivity field is presented in fig 2a and the distribution of k is presented in fig 1 the flow direction is from left to right with an imposed average hydraulic gradient of 0 0033 m m 1 calculated to achieve an average groundwater velocity of 30 m y 1 based on the geometric mean of the simulated hydraulic conductivity of 3 2 103 m y 1 the simulation duration is of 6 years at which steady state is reached the longitudinal and vertical dispersivities were set to 1 m and 5 mm respectively the selected grid spacing mentioned above and time step 1 1 days ensure limited numerical dispersion tce aqueous diffusion coefficient d w was set to 5 1 10 5 m2 d 1 calculated after worch 1993 to account for tortuosity the effective diffusion coefficient was calculated as d eff d w τ app where τ app is the apparent tortuosity which was taken equal to the porosity therefore τ app 0 35 this value is in the low range for τ app values carey et al 2016 diffusion effects on tce isotope fractionation in a heterogeneous aquifer are likely to be more important at the plume fringe in case of plume fringe degradation van breukelen et al 2005 whereas in the present model only core degradation is simulated additionally such isotope effects are best captured by short wells screens thouement et al 2019 van breukelen et al 2005 in this study the effects of diffusion were expected to go undetected as sampling is simulated through long screens in the core of the plume diffusion related isotope effects were therefore not simulated diffusion was expected to have negligible effects on tce isotope fractionation under the simulated conditions similarly sorption is likely to influence isotope ratios only on the spreading front of pollution plumes and was not further simulated 2 2 correlation between hydraulic conductivity and degradation rates the modeling study relies on the hypothesis is that the spatial distribution of degradation pathways is connected to the hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer recent detailed studies of subsurface sediments in the netherlands show that clays present a generally higher potential reactivity than sands with notably higher contents of reactive iron pyrite and organic matter in clays versus sands griffioen et al 2016 griffioen et al 2012 the more reduced clay zones are therefore likely to provide the necessary reactive iron minerals such as pyrite required for abiotic reductive dechlorination lee and batchelor 2002 liang et al 2009 weerasooriya and dharmasena 2001 biotic reductive dechlorination of ces has often been detected in reductive high permeability zones when occurring in clay biotic degradation of ces might profit from elevated contents of organic matter which serve as substrate to the bacterial population wanner et al 2018b to the point that biotic degradation is favorable in the low conductive zones compared to the conductive zones wanner et al 2016 finally tce aerobic co metabolism for instance on methane fogel et al 1986 requires the presence of oxygen but might benefit from the vicinity of low permeability layers provided they act as substrate source for the microbial population in the otherwise less reactive sand zones mcmahon 2001 we assume that more permeable parts of the aquifer tend to contain higher levels of oxygen and thus may entail higher rates of aerobic co metabolism in this paper the first order degradation rate constants were therefore correlated to the spatially varying hydraulic conductivity following cunningham and fadel 2007 despite the simplification of a perfect correlation we expect that the employed correlation is sufficient for addressing our research objectives the first order rate constant of tce oxidation ox k ox positively correlated with the hydraulic conductivity is such as ln k ox f ln k the first order rate constant of chemical reduction cr k cr negatively correlated to the hydraulic conductivity is such as ln k cr f ln k for the rate constants to evolve between 0 y 1 and 10 y 1 they were then defined at the aquifer scale such as lnk ox a ox ln k b ox and lnk cr a cr ln k b cr with each pair of a and b values being calculated as follows 1 a ox 10 max ln k min ln k 2 b ox a ox m i n l n k 3 a cr 10 max ln k min ln k 4 b cr a cr m i n ln k where minln k min ln k and max ln k max ln k represent respectively the minimums and the maximums of the values of the ln k permeability field and of ln k the resulting distribution of the rate constants k ox and k cr are presented in fig 2b and c respectively and in relation with k in fig 1 across the simulated aquifer the average and median of the pathways rate constants are of the same order of magnitude not shown tce chemical reduction is slightly more favorable than oxidation due to the skewness of the k values distribution fig 1 although the model assumptions based on cunningham and fadel 2007 lead to co existence of reduction and oxidation always one pathway strongly dominates only at the median permeability they occur at equal but very low rates note that we simulated a medium heterogeneous sand aquifer which not specifically included clay lenses but finer grained and more impermeable sections assumed to have a similar reactivity for cr as clay silts as known from the literature as a heterogeneous sandy aquifer was modeled it was chosen not to increase the standard deviation and or to lower the mean of k to produce zones with k values closer to clay hydraulic conductivity as this would also have yielded more zones with k values representative of gravel the outcomes of this study are not expected to change by this assumption 2 3 simulation of isotope fractionation the tce source is modeled as a constant tce concentration at the upgradient aquifer boundary the initial tce concentration is set to about half the solubility i e 600 mg l 1 the initial tce carbon and chlorine isotope ratios are 30 and 2 5 respectively which corresponds to the isotope signature of industrially produced tce shouakar stash et al 2003 the initial concentration of each carbon and chlorine isotope is calculated following hunkeler et al 2009 as presented in the appendix in section a1 concentrations below the usual isotope quantification limit 1 μg l are not reported first order degradation kinetics was applied to both reaction pathways both carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation were modeled independently through the bulk isotope method for each isotopic element c and cl both the light ltce and heavy htce isotopes in the tce molecule were simulated the difference in degradation rate constants associated with the heavy and the light isotopes h k bulk and l k bulk respectively is described by the kinetic isotope fractionation factor α k h k bulk l k bulk where α k ε 1 isotope fractionation is incorporated in the reactive transport model by setting the degradation rate constants of the heavy and the light isotopes h r and l r respectively as follows van breukelen et al 2005 5 r l r t l ce tce 6 r h r t h ce tce α k where r is the overall first order degradation rate of tce associated with a specific process 7 r k tce where k is the first order tce degradation rate constant of a specific process the magnitude of degradation induced isotope effects is reported as the bulk effect i e the average of all reactive and non reactive positions of a molecule bulk isotope fractionation is sufficient for simulating isotope enrichment of parent compounds badin et al 2018 cretnik et al 2014 hunkeler et al 2002 van breukelen et al 2017 2005 bulk isotope enrichment factors of tce cr were set to εc cr 15 and εcl cr 2 5 for carbon and chlorine respectively audí miró et al 2013 which corresponds to degradation by zero valent iron for tce ox bulk isotope enrichment factors were set to εc ox 11 5 and εcl ox 0 3 gafni et al 2018 which corresponds to tce aerobic cometabolism by the toluene degrader pseudomonas putida f1 these values correspond to εcl εc slopes of 0 16 for tce cr and 0 03 for tce ox different εcl εc slopes associated with each pathway as selected here are necessary to enable pathway identification with dual c cl csia van breukelen 2007 the slightly lower degradation rates of the heavy isotopes results in the total summed rate of all isotopes to be somewhat lower than the intended degradation rate of the molecule as the reaction networks for carbon and chlorine isotopes are independent the predicted c cl csia slopes gradually deviate from reality over time following van breukelen et al 2017 a correction factor was applied to each isotope reaction rate in order to align the two independent isotope networks with the overall reaction progress appendix section a2 2 4 post simulation calculations 2 4 1 virtual groundwater samples the tce concentrations and isotope ratios were calculated for virtual groundwater samples obtained from various virtual monitoring well networks the concentration of tce or of the tracer in each virtual sample c sample were calculated as the pumping flow rate weighted mean concentrations of the model grid cells representing the immediate surroundings around the well screen höyng et al 2015 it was assumed that the pumping local flow rate was proportional to the local hydraulic conductivity this method takes into account the influence of the local hydraulic conductivity on the groundwater flux into the well screen during pumping 8 c s a m p l e c i k i k i where c i is the concentration of the compound and k i the hydraulic conductivity of a grid cell i the isotope ratio of element e in this study carbon or chlorine in the sample is weighted according to the respective concentrations of tce in each grid cell 9 δ sample c i δ i k i c i k i where δ sample and δ i are the heavy to light isotope ratio of the element e of the sample and of a cell i respectively expressed in the δ notation δ sample r sample r 0 r 0 and where r sample and r 0 are the ratios of the heavy to light isotope concentrations of an element e in a sample and of the international standard respectively 2 4 2 degradation estimates and rate ratio degradation estimates were obtained using the previously developed modified rayleigh equation for assessing degradation through two different processes using dual isotope analysis van breukelen 2007 with this concept degradation can be attributed to the one or the other pathway or to a combination of those based on the dual c cl csia data provided that their respective carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors εc and εcl are known the proportion of the influence of the one pathway over the other is quantified through the rate ratio f as defined in van breukelen 2007 the derivation of the modified rayleigh equation is briefly summarized below we refer to van breukelen 2007 for the details based on the commonly used rayleigh equation the isotopic shift of an element e δ is calculated as follows 10 ln δ sample 1 δ source 1 δ ε ln f where δ source and δ sample are the initial isotope ratio of the element e in the source and a downgradient sample respectively ε is the enrichment factor for the element e for a given reaction pathway and f is the fraction of remaining non degraded tce the ratio of the apparent enrichment factors φ is estimated based on the ratios of the isotopic shifts 11 φ δ 13 c δ 37 cl for our study the rate ratio f of our two competing pathways is calculated as 12 f φ ε c cr ε cl cr ε cl ox ε cl cr φ ε c ox ε c cr where εc cr εc ox εcl cr and εcl ox are the carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors of the chemical reduction and the aerobic cometabolism pathways respectively the distribution of the two degradation pathways can therefore be directly obtained from the relative isotopic shifts and from the enrichment factors of the two pathways provided they are known the apparent carbon isotope enrichment factor εc app is calculated as follows 13 ε c app f ε c ox 1 f ε c cr the modified rayleigh equation to quantify the remaining tce fraction f using dual c cl csia is then 14 f δ 13 c sample 1 δ 13 c s o u r c e 1 1 ε c app the estimate of degradation based on the c cl csia data d rayleigh is calculated as d rayleigh 1 f d rayleigh is usually smaller than the true extent of degradation d true the ratio of tce to the concentration of the non degradative tracer i e d true tce tracer 3 results and discussion 3 1 general patterns fig 3 illustrates the impact of the coupled physical and chemical heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of the tce concentrations the carbon and chlorine isotope ratios and the degree of overall degradation within the plume at steady state tce concentrations are the highest in the high conductivity zones which induce preferential flow fig 3b tce carbon and chlorine isotope ratios show limited enrichment in the high conductivity zones compared to the low conductivity zones due to relatively lower residence times fig 3d e both carbon and chlorine isotopes display a net mean increase with distance but with a large variation with depth fig 4a the observed patterns differ from a prior study of heterogeneous toluene degradation where degradation and consequently isotope enrichment was concentrated at the fringes of the plume höyng et al 2015 similar results were obtained in the case co existence of reductive and oxidative processes was not allowed i e by putting the rate of the minor process to zero results not shown two additional simulations in which either tce chemical reduction cr or tce oxidation ox occurs reveal a major difference in associated isotope patterns fig 4bc while the standard deviation of δ13c values at a certain depth profile for tce ox is smaller than 0 5 regardless of the travel distance fig 4b for tce cr the standard deviation is large and varies between 2 and 10 fig 4c interestingly despite the heterogeneity of tce ox degradation rate constants isotope patterns for tce ox fig 4b are similar to the monotonous enrichment expected in case of uniform degradation in the aquifer hunkeler et al 1999 the contrasting large depth variation of isotope ratios associated with tce cr is sustained by the inverse correlation of k cr with the hydraulic conductivity the implications are broader as this pattern might be observed when any degradation pathway yielding large isotope enrichment for instance biotic reductive dechlorination is favorable in the lesser permeability layers as degradation mostly occurs in the low conductivity zones those zones will show high isotope enrichments especially when conductivity is relatively low and contaminants reside there for a long time in contrast limited isotope enrichment is observed in the connecting high permeability zones where degradation by cr is limited the correlation between the chemical and the physical heterogeneity plays thus a determining role in the distribution of isotope enrichment using the synthetic datasets the true state of tce degradation d true is calculated at the point scale d true shows a pattern similar to the pattern of carbon and chlorine isotope ratios fig 3c in the conductive zones of the aquifer d true increases gradually with distance from the source reaching up to 40 degradation while low conductivity zones are hotspots of intense degradation with d true varying from 60 to 80 the share of tce degraded through oxidation versus reduction is estimated using the rate ratio f calculated using the isotope ratios δ13c and δ37cl for each point of the model through eq 10 to 12 the rate ratio f varies between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating that tce degradation is entirely attributed to cr and 1 that tce is entirely degraded through ox at the source zone the limited carbon isotope enrichment 0 5 did not allow for calculating f despite zones of intense tce oxidation f reaches at most 0 73 in the simulated domain f approaches 0 only in the upgradient zone of the aquifer where the aquifer is relatively impermeable and cr dominates downgradient f bears the influence of the alternation of cr and ox across the aquifer and presents no extreme values as f varies approximately between 0 2 and 0 7 f as calculated from the isotope ratios poorly compares to the real local rate ratio k ox k ox k cr which was set as input fig 5b f is therefore not an indicator of the local conditions of degradation but rather an integrator of the degradation processes acting on the pollutant from the source zone until the sampling location 3 2 sampling effect field investigation often relies on water samples obtained through pumping from long well screens this approach might induce an overestimation of the importance of the degradation pathway dominantly occurring in the high permeability zones as relatively more water is pumped from these zones compared to the low permeability zones under the assumption that the obtained synthetic dataset is representative of realistic transport and degradation behavior of tce both the degradation extent and the contribution of each degradation pathway to tce degradation were evaluated from synthetic sample csia data dual c cl csia data plots are commonly used to determine degradation pathways likely to occur at field sites the proportion of isotope enrichment of dual csia data is compared to compiled laboratory enrichment factors in order to identify which pathway s may be taking place dual c cl csia data are plotted for each of the 6 monitoring networks each consisting of 5 wells placed at equal depth and with 20 m spacing differing in their start position from the source 10 m or 20 m and well screen elevation 3 m 5 m or 7 m fig 6 the slopes of δ37cl δ13c linear regressions at each of the monitoring networks 0 04 to 0 12 are always larger than the theoretical εcl εc slope of tce ox 0 03 a first result is that independently from the positioning of the monitoring network the sampled c cl csia data are not only influenced by the process occurring in the high but also by the process in the low conductivity zones and this despite the preferential flow through the high conductivity zones for practitioners this implies that the presence of a degradation process occurring in low permeability zones might be revealed by a more or less randomly set monitoring network on the condition that the long contact time in low permeability zones does not lead to complete degradation a potential drawback for the assessment of degradation is that the small positive inverse chlorine isotope enrichment factor 0 3 associated with tce ox is overridden by the normal chlorine isotope enrichment factor 2 5 induced by tce cr fig 6 and fig 4a each set of csia data displays strong chlorine isotope enrichment which could result in tce ox going undetected for instance the slope of the network presented in fig 5d 0 12 0 04 is not significantly different from the εcl εc slope for tce chemical reduction 0 16 the slopes values are in the range of recently published tce εcl εc slopes during biotic reductive dechlorination brd obtained after the microorganisms were precultivated on lesser chlorinated ces in a laboratory experiment range 0 05 0 11 published as εc εcl slopes of 9 0 1 1 to 18 2 4 3 lihl et al 2019 those growth conditions and therefore the small slopes are not expected to be common at field site however when the observed slopes are lower than the previously published sets of εcl εc values both for tce biotic and abiotic reductive degradation fig 6 co occurrence of oxidation and chemical reduction pathways may be suspected the present simulation shows that the resulting εcl εc slope is in between the slopes of the reductive and the oxidative pathway brd as met so far at field sites has a much larger εcl εc slope than cr a similar scenario with brd in the low conductivity layers could produce δ 37 cl δ 13 c slopes in the range of published εcl εc slopes of cr or the lower end of brd in that case dual c cl csia would not be suitable for pathway distinction the formation of the metabolites dce and vc might inform that biotic degradation occurs unless they are consumed by oxidation additionally this underlines that the εcl εc slopes of the degradation pathways must be sufficiently different to be able to use c cl csia data for pathway distinction as pointed out in van breukelen 2007 currently natural attenuation through aerobic cometabolism of tce is considered to be limited but could have been overlooked due to the lack of specific degradation products in the line of recent research to determine lines of evidence of tce aerobic cometabolism and rate constants characterization wilson et al 2019 dual c cl csia might be an additional line of evidence for judging of the relevance of tce aerobic degradation at a field site moreover this approach could be applied to other compounds which can degrade through both aerobic and anaerobic conditions such as btex compounds or the tce daughter compounds dce and vc in order to illustrate the potential of dual csia data to inform on the importance of the two pathways occurring at the field site the calculated rate ratio f as obtained from simulated flow rate weighted well data f sample is compared to the average of f in the pore water along the well screen f core the values are compared at two selected distances 50 and 90 m and for two well screen sizes 1 m and 4 m fig 7c 7d when sampling through long well screens the importance of tce oxidation in the aquifer was overestimated as result of sampling f sample f core as groundwater is preferentially abstracted from the more permeable layers overestimation was the most at the lower plume fringe in zones of low conductivity bottom long wells fig 3 and was the least at the top wells screens which are set in the core of the tce plume and in high conductivity zones top long wells fig 3 fig 7c 7d despite the overestimation the f sample values 1 always indicate some co occurrence of tce cr fig 5 7c 7d for short wells f sample matches well with f core interestingly some limited underestimation f sample f core can be noticed for the top short well screen at 90 m from the source fig 7d likely due to tce back diffusing from a low conductivity zone a few meters upgradient from the screen fig 3 in this modeling study the virtual samples correspond to optimal sampling conditions under real conditions insufficient pumping rates or durations might lead to the abstracted water to originate even more from the high conductivity zones mcmillan et al 2014 in which case overestimation of the importance of degradation processes associated with high conductivity zones when sampling across low conductivity zones is likely the rule the csia based extent of degradation at point scale in the aquifer d rayleigh is calculated from applying eq 9 to 12 to the local δ13c and δ37cl values when plotting d rayleigh against depth the d rayleigh curves slightly underestimate d true fig 7e 7f the underestimation is a result of dispersion which fades the isotope ratio gradients resulting from degradation abe and hunkeler 2006 van breukelen and prommer 2008 for the presented cross sections the underestimation of d true is in the range of the previously estimated underestimations at field sites and of less than 5 abe and hunkeler 2006 the limited difference between d rayleigh and d true suggests that flow segregation as described in kopinke et al 2005 had little impact on the results as flow segregation limits the applicability of csia for degradation estimation a similar simulation with larger reactive zones or rate constants is likely to exemplify flow segregation in which case csia based degradation estimates would underestimate degradation kopinke et al 2005 the overestimation of the occurrence of tce ox in the sample illustrated by f sample f core fig 7e 7h suggested that the εc app calculated for the groundwater sample εc app sample would be biased towards εc ox as εc ox εc rd εc app sample is expected smaller in absolute value than εc app calculated from the average pore water isotope values εc app core such underestimation of εc app would overestimate degradation extent d rayleigh sample d true core of which the opposite is observed as also the difference in isotope enrichment between the groundwater sample and the pore water needs to be taken into account with the example of the deepest long well at 90 m from the source which shows the most contrast between the sample and the core degradation values fig 7 h the sampled isotope values δ 13 c sample 23 1 fig 7c δ 37 cl sample 3 1 yield a εc app sample of 13 3 in comparison the apparent enrichment value for pore water is indeed slightly larger with εc app core 13 6 however the carbon isotope ratio in the sample 23 1 is notably less enriched than in the core δ 13 c core 21 4 when applying the smaller εc app sample to the less enriched δ 13 c sample the resulting d rayleigh sample is underestimating degradation as occurred in the pore water d core 52 d rayleigh sample 41 the underestimation reflects the lesser degradation in the highly conductive zones degradation of 30 to 40 compared to the lesser conductive zones up to 70 as shown by the depth profiles at 80 m from the source fig 7h the conductivity field is given in fig 3a if degradation would be more intense in the highly conductive zones compared to the lesser conductive zones pore scale degradation would be overestimated finally the slight underestimation of d true sample by d rayleigh sample is of 3 in the range of the underestimation seen for the depth profiles d true and d rayleigh the underestimation is likely due to dispersion as shown by the smaller difference between d rayleigh sample and d true core for smaller well screens or for the top long well fig 7h the ability to describe degradation in the aquifer depends strongly on the sample method and the lithology crossed by the well screen 4 conclusion and implications this simulation study illustrates that reductive degradation of ces in low permeability zones might be detected using dual carbon c and chlorine cl csia also when tce oxidation occurs in highly conductive zones simulated degradation extent and isotope enrichments were heterogeneous with the lesser conductive zone forming pockets of more intense degradation compared to the more conductive zones when heterogeneous aquifers are sampled large variations of c csia values across depth and non linear increase with distance could indicate that degradation is favorable in the less permeable layers the δ 37 cl δ 13 c slopes of the various virtual monitoring networks were intermediate between the published sets of εcl εc slopes for tce chemical reductive dechlorination and tce oxidation when the εcl εc slopes of the pathways occurring at the site are known and sufficiently different the contrast with the sampled data could point towards the presence of two degradation pathways that are simultaneously occurring the results could be extended to other degradation pathways for instance in the case of favorable biotic reductive dechlorination in the low permeability zones instead of chemical reduction biotic reduction of tce is associated with larger εcl εc compared to chemical reduction the resulting δ 37 cl δ 13 c from the combination of oxidative and reductive biotic pathways could match previously published εcl εc slopes for chemical reduction and may prevent pathway distinction additionally the effect of sampling bias should not be neglected the preferential abstraction from the more conductive layers led to the overestimation of tce oxidation to overall tce degradation in the aquifer despite this wrong attribution of degradation dual csia from the sampled data provides a good estimate of the degradation state of the sampled tce provided εc and εcl of both occurring pathways are known limiting sampling across layers of difference conductivities is critical to obtain a good estimate of degradation at the pore scale degradation might otherwise be over or under estimated depending on whether the conductive layers are more or less reactive than the lesser conductive zones in practice the bias induced either by the sampling method or by a limited amount of csia data should be taken into account when designing sampling campaigns or interpreting data in view of determining to which extent various degradation pathways are taking place declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

1527,degradation of chlorinated ethenes ces in low conductivity layers of aquifers reduces pollution plume tailing and accelerates natural attenuation timeframes the degradation pathways involved are often different from those in the higher conductive layers and might go undetected when only highly conductive layers are targeted in site assessments reactive transport model simulations pht3d in flopy were executed to assess the performance of dual carbon and chlorine compound specific stable isotope analysis csia in degradation pathway identification and quantification in a coupled physical chemical heterogeneous virtual aquifer degradation rate constants were assumed correlated to the hydraulic conductivity positively for oxidative transformation higher oxygen availability in coarser sands and negatively for chemical reduction higher content of reducing solids in finer sediments predicted carbon isotope ratios were highly heterogeneous they generally increased downgradient of the pollution source but the large variation across depth illustrates that monotonously increasing isotope ratios downgradient as were associated with the oxidative component are not necessarily a common situation when degradation is favorable in low conductivity layers dual carbon chlorine csia performed well in assessing the occurrence of the spatially separated degradation pathways and the overall degradation provided appropriate enrichment factors were known and sufficiently different however pumping to obtain groundwater samples especially from longer well screens causes a bias towards overestimation of the contribution of oxidative transformation associated with the higher conductive zones as degradation was less intense in these highly conductive zones under the simulated conditions overall degradation was underestimated in contrast in the usual case of limited csia data dual csia plots may rather indicate dominance of chemical reduction while oxidative transformation could go unnoticed despite being an equally important degradation pathway 1 introduction the potential degradation of chlorinated ethenes ces through both biotic and abiotic redox sensitive pathways in groundwater vogel et al 1987 opened opportunities for monitored natural attenuation mna as an alternative to invasive energy intensive technologies for the remediation of polluted sites until recently mna was focused on biotic reductive dechlorination brd of tce recent studies suspect that chloroethene degradation in the presence of iron ii minerals might have been underestimated at field sites including at sites where degradation occurs through simultaneous abiotic and biotic degradation brown et al 2007 one of the reasons would be the general lack of detection of degradation products either due to being indiscernible from the background concentrations or simply because they are not measured he et al 2009 for instance when trichloroethylene tce is in contact with the iron hydroxides green rust or magnetite the daughter products acetylene ethene and ethane are likely to degrade further in aquifers berns et al 2019 han et al 2012 jeong and kim 2007 lee and batchelor 2002 liang et al 2009 for similar reasons the aerobic cometabolism of tce which ultimately produces co2 and cl could have been overlooked compound specific stable isotope analysis csia has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for determining ce degradation pathways and extent of degradation bloom et al 2000 clark et al 2016 palau et al 2014 sherwood lollar et al 1999 for instance during tce degradation the bond containing a heavy carbon isotope is cleaved slightly slower than the bond containing a light carbon isotope the resulting carbon isotope fractionation depends on the extent of tce degradation and on the fractionation potential of the reaction characterized by the process specific enrichment factor ε hunkeler et al 2002 both degradation by iron ii minerals and the aerobic cometabolism of tce are associated with a large range large carbon isotope enrichment factors respectively from 9 to 33 for chemical reduction liang and dong 2007 zwank et al 2005 and from 1 to 20 for aerobic cometabolism barth et al 2002 chu et al 2004 and could be detected and quantified at field sites using csia when two degradation pathways are co occurring at a site the csia data of a unique element does not allow a proper attribution of degradation to the one or the other pathway höyng et al 2015 dual carbon chlorine csia c cl csia is specifically promising for the study of co existing degradation pathways of ces at field sites as the relative extent of c and cl isotope fractionation depends on the reaction mechanism where several processes were likely to occur c cl csia slopes have helped in selecting the main degradation pathway badin et al 2016 clark et al 2016 hunkeler et al 2011 provided that the enrichment factors of each reaction pathway are known and the relative chlorine to carbon isotope enrichments εcl εc are sufficiently different the respective participation of each of the two different degradation pathways to overall degradation as well as the extent of overall degradation can be determined based on a c cl csia dataset van breukelen 2007 physical and chemical heterogeneities of aquifers directly impact reactive transport of pollutants physical heterogeneities induce preferential flow and therefore mixing of reactive components geochemical heterogeneity induces zones of either abundance or scarcity of reactive minerals and sedimentary organic matter it is likely that zones of low conductivity will be more reductive while conductive zones where oxygen can be transported faster than it is consumed will be more oxic additionally different geological layers might present different mineralogy specific surface areas or host different microbial groups inducing an additional correlation between hydraulic conductivity and reactivity for example at a field site sampled with high resolution the reduction and therefore the immobilization of uranium was higher in low permeability zones than in permeable sediments resulting from both abiotic and biotic processes janot et al 2015 however hydraulic conductivity is not the only parameter expected to be correlated with reactivity for instance the ferrous mineral content seemed to be an important parameter to explain the difference of reactivity of two clayey soils in the abiotic degradation of chlorinated ethenes schaefer et al 2017 in both low conductivity zones and in conductive zones availability of substrate and bacterial activity plays a role in the biotic reduction or oxidation of pollutants berns et al 2019 mcmahon 2001 wanner et al 2018a yan et al 2016 with time reduced conditions develop in chlorinated solvent plumes christensen et al 2000 such additional conditions influence reactivity while being potentially uncorrelated to the hydraulic conductivity and were addressed in previous modeling studies atchley et al 2014 jang et al 2017 sanz prat et al 2016 despite those additional complexities heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity in aquifers plays a major role in degradation jang et al 2017 well characterized aquifers are rare and aquifers are often considered as black boxes in which the degradation and transport patterns of ces must be determined through spatially and temporally sparse datasets in this context synthetic data sets created using models combining reactive transport with isotope fractionation are employed for advising practitioners on the optimal csia sampling strategies höyng et al 2015 xu et al 2017 the effects of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on resulting c csia patterns of toluene degrading with various electron acceptors was assessed before by reactive transport modeling of aquifer analogs höyng et al 2015 using such a similar approach the present study investigates whether dual c cl csia could detect tce degradation through two different reaction pathways when those pathways occur dominantly in different conductivity zones low permeability sediments such as clay lenses are more likely to present reductive conditions susceptible to host biotic reductive dechlorination of ces damgaard et al 2013 takeuchi et al 2011 wanner et al 2018b and might offer large reactive iron mineral contents and surfaces schaefer et al 2017 high conductivity zones as permeable sands are more likely to be aerobic and therefore can host tce biotic oxidation either directly or through aerobic cometabolism applying a simple correlation between the hydraulic conductivity and the two degradation rate constants of tce aerobic transformation and chemical reduction alike the approach of cunningham and fadel 2007 we investigate the resulting spatially heterogeneous carbon and chlorine isotope ratio patterns of tce and the implications for polluted site investigation the main objectives of this study are 1 to understand how spatially heterogeneous csia patterns evolve from physical chemical heterogeneous conditions 2 to assess the performance of dual c cl csia in detecting the occurrence of both degradation pathways and in calculating overall degradation under these conditions and 3 to assess the effect of pumping preferentially from the more permeable zones on degradation assessment 2 methodology 2 1 general setup of model the multicomponent transport and degradation is modeled with pht3d prommer et al 2001 which combines the 3 d multicomponent transport model mt3dms with the geochemical model phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 1999 pht3d was accessed through the python interface flopy bakker et al 2016 the third order total variation diminishing tvd solution scheme was used for the advective term which tends to minimize numerical dispersion and artificial oscillation model run time on a computer with an intel cpu at 2 5 ghz and 4 gb of ram was about 9400 min and the produced data file size was of about 5 gb a tce source with a thickness of 4 m is set at the upgradient boundary of the aquifer the source includes a non degradative tracer with otherwise similar characteristics to tce the degradation rate constants of aerobic cometabolism and chemical reduction of tce are either positively oxidation or negatively chemical reduction correlated to the hydraulic conductivity k the first order degradation rate constants range between 0 and 10 y 1 discussed in detail later the simulated 2d aquifer domain is 100 m long and 10 m thick with a homogeneous rectangular discretization of 0 5 m in the x spreading direction and 0 05 in the z depth direction for simplicity the porosity was set homogeneously to 0 35 across the aquifer this value is typical for unconsolidated sands the dry bulk density was set to 1 855 kg l 1 throughout the aquifer system the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field was obtained using the field generator available in modflow chiang 2013 which is based on mejia s algorithm which was previously used for hydrogeological modeling studies zammouri and ribeiro 2017 in our model the mean of the log normally distributed k was set to 3 3 10 4 m s 1 with a standard deviation for ln k of 1 5 in line with prior modeling studies atchley et al 2014 uçankuş and ünlü 2008 and field data gelhar and welty 1992 heterogeneity is supposedly lesser in the horizontal than in the vertical direction in sediment layers which is obtain in the generated k field by setting correlation lengths to 7 m longitudinally and 1 m vertically those values are in of the order of magnitude of published correlation lengths at the as relatively homogeneous considered the borden site 0 91 8 3 m in the horizontal direction 0 07 0 34 m in the vertical direction maghrebi et al 2015 those input parameters yield a medium heterogeneous aquifer see fig 1 with hydraulic conductivities corresponding to a sandy aquifer gelhar and welty 1992 and are in line with prior modeling studies atchley et al 2014 uçankuş and ünlü 2008 the simulated conductivity field is presented in fig 2a and the distribution of k is presented in fig 1 the flow direction is from left to right with an imposed average hydraulic gradient of 0 0033 m m 1 calculated to achieve an average groundwater velocity of 30 m y 1 based on the geometric mean of the simulated hydraulic conductivity of 3 2 103 m y 1 the simulation duration is of 6 years at which steady state is reached the longitudinal and vertical dispersivities were set to 1 m and 5 mm respectively the selected grid spacing mentioned above and time step 1 1 days ensure limited numerical dispersion tce aqueous diffusion coefficient d w was set to 5 1 10 5 m2 d 1 calculated after worch 1993 to account for tortuosity the effective diffusion coefficient was calculated as d eff d w τ app where τ app is the apparent tortuosity which was taken equal to the porosity therefore τ app 0 35 this value is in the low range for τ app values carey et al 2016 diffusion effects on tce isotope fractionation in a heterogeneous aquifer are likely to be more important at the plume fringe in case of plume fringe degradation van breukelen et al 2005 whereas in the present model only core degradation is simulated additionally such isotope effects are best captured by short wells screens thouement et al 2019 van breukelen et al 2005 in this study the effects of diffusion were expected to go undetected as sampling is simulated through long screens in the core of the plume diffusion related isotope effects were therefore not simulated diffusion was expected to have negligible effects on tce isotope fractionation under the simulated conditions similarly sorption is likely to influence isotope ratios only on the spreading front of pollution plumes and was not further simulated 2 2 correlation between hydraulic conductivity and degradation rates the modeling study relies on the hypothesis is that the spatial distribution of degradation pathways is connected to the hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer recent detailed studies of subsurface sediments in the netherlands show that clays present a generally higher potential reactivity than sands with notably higher contents of reactive iron pyrite and organic matter in clays versus sands griffioen et al 2016 griffioen et al 2012 the more reduced clay zones are therefore likely to provide the necessary reactive iron minerals such as pyrite required for abiotic reductive dechlorination lee and batchelor 2002 liang et al 2009 weerasooriya and dharmasena 2001 biotic reductive dechlorination of ces has often been detected in reductive high permeability zones when occurring in clay biotic degradation of ces might profit from elevated contents of organic matter which serve as substrate to the bacterial population wanner et al 2018b to the point that biotic degradation is favorable in the low conductive zones compared to the conductive zones wanner et al 2016 finally tce aerobic co metabolism for instance on methane fogel et al 1986 requires the presence of oxygen but might benefit from the vicinity of low permeability layers provided they act as substrate source for the microbial population in the otherwise less reactive sand zones mcmahon 2001 we assume that more permeable parts of the aquifer tend to contain higher levels of oxygen and thus may entail higher rates of aerobic co metabolism in this paper the first order degradation rate constants were therefore correlated to the spatially varying hydraulic conductivity following cunningham and fadel 2007 despite the simplification of a perfect correlation we expect that the employed correlation is sufficient for addressing our research objectives the first order rate constant of tce oxidation ox k ox positively correlated with the hydraulic conductivity is such as ln k ox f ln k the first order rate constant of chemical reduction cr k cr negatively correlated to the hydraulic conductivity is such as ln k cr f ln k for the rate constants to evolve between 0 y 1 and 10 y 1 they were then defined at the aquifer scale such as lnk ox a ox ln k b ox and lnk cr a cr ln k b cr with each pair of a and b values being calculated as follows 1 a ox 10 max ln k min ln k 2 b ox a ox m i n l n k 3 a cr 10 max ln k min ln k 4 b cr a cr m i n ln k where minln k min ln k and max ln k max ln k represent respectively the minimums and the maximums of the values of the ln k permeability field and of ln k the resulting distribution of the rate constants k ox and k cr are presented in fig 2b and c respectively and in relation with k in fig 1 across the simulated aquifer the average and median of the pathways rate constants are of the same order of magnitude not shown tce chemical reduction is slightly more favorable than oxidation due to the skewness of the k values distribution fig 1 although the model assumptions based on cunningham and fadel 2007 lead to co existence of reduction and oxidation always one pathway strongly dominates only at the median permeability they occur at equal but very low rates note that we simulated a medium heterogeneous sand aquifer which not specifically included clay lenses but finer grained and more impermeable sections assumed to have a similar reactivity for cr as clay silts as known from the literature as a heterogeneous sandy aquifer was modeled it was chosen not to increase the standard deviation and or to lower the mean of k to produce zones with k values closer to clay hydraulic conductivity as this would also have yielded more zones with k values representative of gravel the outcomes of this study are not expected to change by this assumption 2 3 simulation of isotope fractionation the tce source is modeled as a constant tce concentration at the upgradient aquifer boundary the initial tce concentration is set to about half the solubility i e 600 mg l 1 the initial tce carbon and chlorine isotope ratios are 30 and 2 5 respectively which corresponds to the isotope signature of industrially produced tce shouakar stash et al 2003 the initial concentration of each carbon and chlorine isotope is calculated following hunkeler et al 2009 as presented in the appendix in section a1 concentrations below the usual isotope quantification limit 1 μg l are not reported first order degradation kinetics was applied to both reaction pathways both carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation were modeled independently through the bulk isotope method for each isotopic element c and cl both the light ltce and heavy htce isotopes in the tce molecule were simulated the difference in degradation rate constants associated with the heavy and the light isotopes h k bulk and l k bulk respectively is described by the kinetic isotope fractionation factor α k h k bulk l k bulk where α k ε 1 isotope fractionation is incorporated in the reactive transport model by setting the degradation rate constants of the heavy and the light isotopes h r and l r respectively as follows van breukelen et al 2005 5 r l r t l ce tce 6 r h r t h ce tce α k where r is the overall first order degradation rate of tce associated with a specific process 7 r k tce where k is the first order tce degradation rate constant of a specific process the magnitude of degradation induced isotope effects is reported as the bulk effect i e the average of all reactive and non reactive positions of a molecule bulk isotope fractionation is sufficient for simulating isotope enrichment of parent compounds badin et al 2018 cretnik et al 2014 hunkeler et al 2002 van breukelen et al 2017 2005 bulk isotope enrichment factors of tce cr were set to εc cr 15 and εcl cr 2 5 for carbon and chlorine respectively audí miró et al 2013 which corresponds to degradation by zero valent iron for tce ox bulk isotope enrichment factors were set to εc ox 11 5 and εcl ox 0 3 gafni et al 2018 which corresponds to tce aerobic cometabolism by the toluene degrader pseudomonas putida f1 these values correspond to εcl εc slopes of 0 16 for tce cr and 0 03 for tce ox different εcl εc slopes associated with each pathway as selected here are necessary to enable pathway identification with dual c cl csia van breukelen 2007 the slightly lower degradation rates of the heavy isotopes results in the total summed rate of all isotopes to be somewhat lower than the intended degradation rate of the molecule as the reaction networks for carbon and chlorine isotopes are independent the predicted c cl csia slopes gradually deviate from reality over time following van breukelen et al 2017 a correction factor was applied to each isotope reaction rate in order to align the two independent isotope networks with the overall reaction progress appendix section a2 2 4 post simulation calculations 2 4 1 virtual groundwater samples the tce concentrations and isotope ratios were calculated for virtual groundwater samples obtained from various virtual monitoring well networks the concentration of tce or of the tracer in each virtual sample c sample were calculated as the pumping flow rate weighted mean concentrations of the model grid cells representing the immediate surroundings around the well screen höyng et al 2015 it was assumed that the pumping local flow rate was proportional to the local hydraulic conductivity this method takes into account the influence of the local hydraulic conductivity on the groundwater flux into the well screen during pumping 8 c s a m p l e c i k i k i where c i is the concentration of the compound and k i the hydraulic conductivity of a grid cell i the isotope ratio of element e in this study carbon or chlorine in the sample is weighted according to the respective concentrations of tce in each grid cell 9 δ sample c i δ i k i c i k i where δ sample and δ i are the heavy to light isotope ratio of the element e of the sample and of a cell i respectively expressed in the δ notation δ sample r sample r 0 r 0 and where r sample and r 0 are the ratios of the heavy to light isotope concentrations of an element e in a sample and of the international standard respectively 2 4 2 degradation estimates and rate ratio degradation estimates were obtained using the previously developed modified rayleigh equation for assessing degradation through two different processes using dual isotope analysis van breukelen 2007 with this concept degradation can be attributed to the one or the other pathway or to a combination of those based on the dual c cl csia data provided that their respective carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors εc and εcl are known the proportion of the influence of the one pathway over the other is quantified through the rate ratio f as defined in van breukelen 2007 the derivation of the modified rayleigh equation is briefly summarized below we refer to van breukelen 2007 for the details based on the commonly used rayleigh equation the isotopic shift of an element e δ is calculated as follows 10 ln δ sample 1 δ source 1 δ ε ln f where δ source and δ sample are the initial isotope ratio of the element e in the source and a downgradient sample respectively ε is the enrichment factor for the element e for a given reaction pathway and f is the fraction of remaining non degraded tce the ratio of the apparent enrichment factors φ is estimated based on the ratios of the isotopic shifts 11 φ δ 13 c δ 37 cl for our study the rate ratio f of our two competing pathways is calculated as 12 f φ ε c cr ε cl cr ε cl ox ε cl cr φ ε c ox ε c cr where εc cr εc ox εcl cr and εcl ox are the carbon and chlorine isotope enrichment factors of the chemical reduction and the aerobic cometabolism pathways respectively the distribution of the two degradation pathways can therefore be directly obtained from the relative isotopic shifts and from the enrichment factors of the two pathways provided they are known the apparent carbon isotope enrichment factor εc app is calculated as follows 13 ε c app f ε c ox 1 f ε c cr the modified rayleigh equation to quantify the remaining tce fraction f using dual c cl csia is then 14 f δ 13 c sample 1 δ 13 c s o u r c e 1 1 ε c app the estimate of degradation based on the c cl csia data d rayleigh is calculated as d rayleigh 1 f d rayleigh is usually smaller than the true extent of degradation d true the ratio of tce to the concentration of the non degradative tracer i e d true tce tracer 3 results and discussion 3 1 general patterns fig 3 illustrates the impact of the coupled physical and chemical heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of the tce concentrations the carbon and chlorine isotope ratios and the degree of overall degradation within the plume at steady state tce concentrations are the highest in the high conductivity zones which induce preferential flow fig 3b tce carbon and chlorine isotope ratios show limited enrichment in the high conductivity zones compared to the low conductivity zones due to relatively lower residence times fig 3d e both carbon and chlorine isotopes display a net mean increase with distance but with a large variation with depth fig 4a the observed patterns differ from a prior study of heterogeneous toluene degradation where degradation and consequently isotope enrichment was concentrated at the fringes of the plume höyng et al 2015 similar results were obtained in the case co existence of reductive and oxidative processes was not allowed i e by putting the rate of the minor process to zero results not shown two additional simulations in which either tce chemical reduction cr or tce oxidation ox occurs reveal a major difference in associated isotope patterns fig 4bc while the standard deviation of δ13c values at a certain depth profile for tce ox is smaller than 0 5 regardless of the travel distance fig 4b for tce cr the standard deviation is large and varies between 2 and 10 fig 4c interestingly despite the heterogeneity of tce ox degradation rate constants isotope patterns for tce ox fig 4b are similar to the monotonous enrichment expected in case of uniform degradation in the aquifer hunkeler et al 1999 the contrasting large depth variation of isotope ratios associated with tce cr is sustained by the inverse correlation of k cr with the hydraulic conductivity the implications are broader as this pattern might be observed when any degradation pathway yielding large isotope enrichment for instance biotic reductive dechlorination is favorable in the lesser permeability layers as degradation mostly occurs in the low conductivity zones those zones will show high isotope enrichments especially when conductivity is relatively low and contaminants reside there for a long time in contrast limited isotope enrichment is observed in the connecting high permeability zones where degradation by cr is limited the correlation between the chemical and the physical heterogeneity plays thus a determining role in the distribution of isotope enrichment using the synthetic datasets the true state of tce degradation d true is calculated at the point scale d true shows a pattern similar to the pattern of carbon and chlorine isotope ratios fig 3c in the conductive zones of the aquifer d true increases gradually with distance from the source reaching up to 40 degradation while low conductivity zones are hotspots of intense degradation with d true varying from 60 to 80 the share of tce degraded through oxidation versus reduction is estimated using the rate ratio f calculated using the isotope ratios δ13c and δ37cl for each point of the model through eq 10 to 12 the rate ratio f varies between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating that tce degradation is entirely attributed to cr and 1 that tce is entirely degraded through ox at the source zone the limited carbon isotope enrichment 0 5 did not allow for calculating f despite zones of intense tce oxidation f reaches at most 0 73 in the simulated domain f approaches 0 only in the upgradient zone of the aquifer where the aquifer is relatively impermeable and cr dominates downgradient f bears the influence of the alternation of cr and ox across the aquifer and presents no extreme values as f varies approximately between 0 2 and 0 7 f as calculated from the isotope ratios poorly compares to the real local rate ratio k ox k ox k cr which was set as input fig 5b f is therefore not an indicator of the local conditions of degradation but rather an integrator of the degradation processes acting on the pollutant from the source zone until the sampling location 3 2 sampling effect field investigation often relies on water samples obtained through pumping from long well screens this approach might induce an overestimation of the importance of the degradation pathway dominantly occurring in the high permeability zones as relatively more water is pumped from these zones compared to the low permeability zones under the assumption that the obtained synthetic dataset is representative of realistic transport and degradation behavior of tce both the degradation extent and the contribution of each degradation pathway to tce degradation were evaluated from synthetic sample csia data dual c cl csia data plots are commonly used to determine degradation pathways likely to occur at field sites the proportion of isotope enrichment of dual csia data is compared to compiled laboratory enrichment factors in order to identify which pathway s may be taking place dual c cl csia data are plotted for each of the 6 monitoring networks each consisting of 5 wells placed at equal depth and with 20 m spacing differing in their start position from the source 10 m or 20 m and well screen elevation 3 m 5 m or 7 m fig 6 the slopes of δ37cl δ13c linear regressions at each of the monitoring networks 0 04 to 0 12 are always larger than the theoretical εcl εc slope of tce ox 0 03 a first result is that independently from the positioning of the monitoring network the sampled c cl csia data are not only influenced by the process occurring in the high but also by the process in the low conductivity zones and this despite the preferential flow through the high conductivity zones for practitioners this implies that the presence of a degradation process occurring in low permeability zones might be revealed by a more or less randomly set monitoring network on the condition that the long contact time in low permeability zones does not lead to complete degradation a potential drawback for the assessment of degradation is that the small positive inverse chlorine isotope enrichment factor 0 3 associated with tce ox is overridden by the normal chlorine isotope enrichment factor 2 5 induced by tce cr fig 6 and fig 4a each set of csia data displays strong chlorine isotope enrichment which could result in tce ox going undetected for instance the slope of the network presented in fig 5d 0 12 0 04 is not significantly different from the εcl εc slope for tce chemical reduction 0 16 the slopes values are in the range of recently published tce εcl εc slopes during biotic reductive dechlorination brd obtained after the microorganisms were precultivated on lesser chlorinated ces in a laboratory experiment range 0 05 0 11 published as εc εcl slopes of 9 0 1 1 to 18 2 4 3 lihl et al 2019 those growth conditions and therefore the small slopes are not expected to be common at field site however when the observed slopes are lower than the previously published sets of εcl εc values both for tce biotic and abiotic reductive degradation fig 6 co occurrence of oxidation and chemical reduction pathways may be suspected the present simulation shows that the resulting εcl εc slope is in between the slopes of the reductive and the oxidative pathway brd as met so far at field sites has a much larger εcl εc slope than cr a similar scenario with brd in the low conductivity layers could produce δ 37 cl δ 13 c slopes in the range of published εcl εc slopes of cr or the lower end of brd in that case dual c cl csia would not be suitable for pathway distinction the formation of the metabolites dce and vc might inform that biotic degradation occurs unless they are consumed by oxidation additionally this underlines that the εcl εc slopes of the degradation pathways must be sufficiently different to be able to use c cl csia data for pathway distinction as pointed out in van breukelen 2007 currently natural attenuation through aerobic cometabolism of tce is considered to be limited but could have been overlooked due to the lack of specific degradation products in the line of recent research to determine lines of evidence of tce aerobic cometabolism and rate constants characterization wilson et al 2019 dual c cl csia might be an additional line of evidence for judging of the relevance of tce aerobic degradation at a field site moreover this approach could be applied to other compounds which can degrade through both aerobic and anaerobic conditions such as btex compounds or the tce daughter compounds dce and vc in order to illustrate the potential of dual csia data to inform on the importance of the two pathways occurring at the field site the calculated rate ratio f as obtained from simulated flow rate weighted well data f sample is compared to the average of f in the pore water along the well screen f core the values are compared at two selected distances 50 and 90 m and for two well screen sizes 1 m and 4 m fig 7c 7d when sampling through long well screens the importance of tce oxidation in the aquifer was overestimated as result of sampling f sample f core as groundwater is preferentially abstracted from the more permeable layers overestimation was the most at the lower plume fringe in zones of low conductivity bottom long wells fig 3 and was the least at the top wells screens which are set in the core of the tce plume and in high conductivity zones top long wells fig 3 fig 7c 7d despite the overestimation the f sample values 1 always indicate some co occurrence of tce cr fig 5 7c 7d for short wells f sample matches well with f core interestingly some limited underestimation f sample f core can be noticed for the top short well screen at 90 m from the source fig 7d likely due to tce back diffusing from a low conductivity zone a few meters upgradient from the screen fig 3 in this modeling study the virtual samples correspond to optimal sampling conditions under real conditions insufficient pumping rates or durations might lead to the abstracted water to originate even more from the high conductivity zones mcmillan et al 2014 in which case overestimation of the importance of degradation processes associated with high conductivity zones when sampling across low conductivity zones is likely the rule the csia based extent of degradation at point scale in the aquifer d rayleigh is calculated from applying eq 9 to 12 to the local δ13c and δ37cl values when plotting d rayleigh against depth the d rayleigh curves slightly underestimate d true fig 7e 7f the underestimation is a result of dispersion which fades the isotope ratio gradients resulting from degradation abe and hunkeler 2006 van breukelen and prommer 2008 for the presented cross sections the underestimation of d true is in the range of the previously estimated underestimations at field sites and of less than 5 abe and hunkeler 2006 the limited difference between d rayleigh and d true suggests that flow segregation as described in kopinke et al 2005 had little impact on the results as flow segregation limits the applicability of csia for degradation estimation a similar simulation with larger reactive zones or rate constants is likely to exemplify flow segregation in which case csia based degradation estimates would underestimate degradation kopinke et al 2005 the overestimation of the occurrence of tce ox in the sample illustrated by f sample f core fig 7e 7h suggested that the εc app calculated for the groundwater sample εc app sample would be biased towards εc ox as εc ox εc rd εc app sample is expected smaller in absolute value than εc app calculated from the average pore water isotope values εc app core such underestimation of εc app would overestimate degradation extent d rayleigh sample d true core of which the opposite is observed as also the difference in isotope enrichment between the groundwater sample and the pore water needs to be taken into account with the example of the deepest long well at 90 m from the source which shows the most contrast between the sample and the core degradation values fig 7 h the sampled isotope values δ 13 c sample 23 1 fig 7c δ 37 cl sample 3 1 yield a εc app sample of 13 3 in comparison the apparent enrichment value for pore water is indeed slightly larger with εc app core 13 6 however the carbon isotope ratio in the sample 23 1 is notably less enriched than in the core δ 13 c core 21 4 when applying the smaller εc app sample to the less enriched δ 13 c sample the resulting d rayleigh sample is underestimating degradation as occurred in the pore water d core 52 d rayleigh sample 41 the underestimation reflects the lesser degradation in the highly conductive zones degradation of 30 to 40 compared to the lesser conductive zones up to 70 as shown by the depth profiles at 80 m from the source fig 7h the conductivity field is given in fig 3a if degradation would be more intense in the highly conductive zones compared to the lesser conductive zones pore scale degradation would be overestimated finally the slight underestimation of d true sample by d rayleigh sample is of 3 in the range of the underestimation seen for the depth profiles d true and d rayleigh the underestimation is likely due to dispersion as shown by the smaller difference between d rayleigh sample and d true core for smaller well screens or for the top long well fig 7h the ability to describe degradation in the aquifer depends strongly on the sample method and the lithology crossed by the well screen 4 conclusion and implications this simulation study illustrates that reductive degradation of ces in low permeability zones might be detected using dual carbon c and chlorine cl csia also when tce oxidation occurs in highly conductive zones simulated degradation extent and isotope enrichments were heterogeneous with the lesser conductive zone forming pockets of more intense degradation compared to the more conductive zones when heterogeneous aquifers are sampled large variations of c csia values across depth and non linear increase with distance could indicate that degradation is favorable in the less permeable layers the δ 37 cl δ 13 c slopes of the various virtual monitoring networks were intermediate between the published sets of εcl εc slopes for tce chemical reductive dechlorination and tce oxidation when the εcl εc slopes of the pathways occurring at the site are known and sufficiently different the contrast with the sampled data could point towards the presence of two degradation pathways that are simultaneously occurring the results could be extended to other degradation pathways for instance in the case of favorable biotic reductive dechlorination in the low permeability zones instead of chemical reduction biotic reduction of tce is associated with larger εcl εc compared to chemical reduction the resulting δ 37 cl δ 13 c from the combination of oxidative and reductive biotic pathways could match previously published εcl εc slopes for chemical reduction and may prevent pathway distinction additionally the effect of sampling bias should not be neglected the preferential abstraction from the more conductive layers led to the overestimation of tce oxidation to overall tce degradation in the aquifer despite this wrong attribution of degradation dual csia from the sampled data provides a good estimate of the degradation state of the sampled tce provided εc and εcl of both occurring pathways are known limiting sampling across layers of difference conductivities is critical to obtain a good estimate of degradation at the pore scale degradation might otherwise be over or under estimated depending on whether the conductive layers are more or less reactive than the lesser conductive zones in practice the bias induced either by the sampling method or by a limited amount of csia data should be taken into account when designing sampling campaigns or interpreting data in view of determining to which extent various degradation pathways are taking place declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

1528,to determine the diffusion and sorption properties of radionuclides in intact crystalline rocks a new electromigration device was built and tested by running with i and se iv ions by introducing a potentiostat to impose a constant voltage over the studied rock sample the electromigration device can give more stable and accurate experimental results than those from the traditional electromigration devices in addition the variation in the ph of the background electrolytes was minimised by adding a small amount of nahco3 as buffers to interpret the experimental results with more confidence an advection dispersion model was also developed in this study which accounts for the most important mechanisms governing ionic transport in the electromigration experiments data analysis of the breakthrough curves by the advection dispersion model instead of the traditional ideal plug flow model suggest that the effective diffusivities of i and se iv are 1 15 0 06 10 13 m2 s and 3 50 0 86 10 14 m2 s respectively the results also show that i is more mobile than se iv ions when migrating through the same intact rock sample and that their sorption properties are almost identical

repositories in many countries de cannière et al 2010 ewing 2015 posiva 2013 a multiple barrier system including both engineered and natural is normally employed to ensure the safety of the disposal low porous crystalline rock such as granite is therefore the final natural barrier to provide retardation of radionuclides from migrating into groundwater in most nuclear waste disposal concepts muuri 2015 posiva 2012 söderlund 2016 the sorption on the pore surfaces of the bedrock and the diffusion into the low porous rock matrix are the two most significant processes that retard radionuclides

carried out to determine the sorption and diffusion properties of dominant radionuclides existing in nuclear waste such as cs sr2 i and seo3 2 by batch sorption experiments li et al 2018 söderlund et

et al 2009a löfgren and neretnieks 2006 puukko et al 2018 and he gas through diffusion experiments kuva et al 2015 2016 among these experimental methods electromigration is getting more attention in the last two decades this method can provide parameters like effective diffusion coefficient de distribution coefficient kd and formation factor ff for an intact crystalline rock sample in a much faster way than the traditional through diffusion experiments in water phase which might take several months tachi et al 2015 typically the porosity of the bedrock is in the order of 10 3 while the apertures of its micropores are in the order of 10 6 m möri et al 2003 as a result the permeability of the rock matrix is very small and the pore water in the rock matrix could be considered as stagnant due to the low porosity and tortuous pores the diffusion experiments are very time consuming in water saturated rock matrix in order to reduce the experimental time by accelerating the transport of charged ions applications of hydraulic pressure electric field over the rock sample electromigration and gas phase experiments are normally used because of the low permeability of the rock sample extremely high hydraulic pressure is often required to accelerate the movement of tracer ions in rock matrix gas phase through diffusion experiments using he atom as a tracer can reduce the experimental time for about 11 000 times kuva et al 2015 2016 however water based experiments can normally provide more reliable and accurate results because in the gas phase experiments the chemical effects and other water phase related interactions e g solute mineral surface interactions must be ignored by contrast the electromigration method is more advantage because a small electrical field is efficient enough to accelerate the migration of ions in pore water inside a low permeability granitic rock core maes et al 1999 mitchell and soga 2005 under the electrical potential gradient the charged particles and ions can migrate in low porous rock sample about 1000 times faster than elements in water saturated rock depending on the strength of the electric field as a result the experimental time could be reduced significantly to several days another advantage of utilizing electromigration method is that the kd equivalently the retardation factor r values of intact rock samples could also be determined conveniently in the batch sorption experiments which is a traditional way of measuring kd values samples are normally crushed which increases significantly the specific surface area of the samples and may give access to otherwise isolated pores as a consequence the kd values determined from crushed rock samples will generally be overestimated andré et al 2009b puukko et al 2018 to address this problem conservative estimates of the upscaling factors have been performed prior to use the kd values in a performance and safety assessment of a geological repository puukko et al 2018 in the electromigration experiments however the retardation of sorptive radionuclides for an intact rock sample can directly be evaluated by analysing the mass balance over the rock sample andré et al 2009a puukko et al 2018 with this understanding löfgren and andré designed an electromigration device and tested the migration behaviour of i and cs ions andré 2009

applied potential gradient of 20 v m or 1000 v m whereas the effective diffusion coefficients were estimated to be 4 0 10 13 m2 s for i and 3 0 10 13 m2 s for cs respectively andré et al 2009a 2009b

controlling system which may cause large experimental errors in long term studies and even give wrong results moreover the traditional modelling method for analysing results from electromigration experiments involves many unrealistic assumptions and simplifications the model could only give a rough estimate of the de and kd parameters which normally contain large uncertainties the purpose of this work is to update the electromigration experimental setup and to develop an advection dispersion model for more accurate analysis of the experimental results the modified device will have the abilities of voltage self controlling continuous current recording and solution ph stabilization two anions i and seo3 2 were studied with the updated electromigration setup under different potential gradients the advection dispersion model will as detailed in our companion paper meng et al 2019 account for the most important mechanisms governing ionic transport through an intact rock core which is subject to an electric field it enables to give a reliable estimate of the diffusion and sorption properties of the tracer ions in low permeable granitic rock 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation the rock sample used in the electromigration experiment was collected from äspö underground laboratory borehole klx11f 17 m depth in collaboration with linnaeus university the length of the rock sample was 1 12 cm as measured by a caliper and the diameter was 5 cm the lithology distribution of the rock sample was quartz monzodiorite 95 5 and fine grained granite 4 5 it was saturated with synthetic groundwater and vacuum packed in a tight vessel before using in the experiment more detailed information could be found in the report by mattsson et al 2007 the rock samples were dried at 105 c in a vacuum thermostat oven for at least 4 days to achieve complete dryness after that the samples were stored in a desiccator until normal temperature the dry weights of the samples were then measured afterwards the samples were water saturated with the vacuum method as described by ohlsson 2000 and löfgren 2005 first the samples were placed in a desiccator above 0 2 m nacl solution the air in the desiccator was evacuated with a pump and water vapor diffused at low pressure into the sample and saturated the connected micropores of the rock sample the evacuation process was repeated twice per hour for at least 6 h to get rid of the air leak from the rock sample in the desiccator thereafter the sample was shaken off into the nacl electrolyte and totally immersed in it the pressure in the desiccator was then increased slowly until atmospheric pressure in more than 1 day after achieving atmospheric pressure the sample was stored in the electrolyte to achieve fully saturation before used in the electromigration experiments 2 2 modification of the electromigration experimental setup 2 2 1 basic design of the electromigration device as schematically shown in fig 1 the electromigration device could be seen as a further implementation of the traditional through diffusion method the different is that a constant voltage is applied over the rock sample which is placed between two chambers one holding an electrolyte with high concentration tracer the source chamber and one holding the same electrolyte initially free of the tracer the recipient chamber since electromigration is the main process of solute transport in this study only ionic tracers should be considered the potential gradients over the rock sample could be achieved by placing an electrode in each of the electrolyte solutions and simply connecting the electrodes to a direct current power supply in this manner however a ph gradient will inevitably evolve within the system as electrolysis will occur at both anode and cathode 1 anode 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 h o 2 2 cathode 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 to avoid ph change of the electrolytes caused by electrolysis löfgren and neretnieks 2006 and also andré et al 2009a 2009b placed anode and cathode in two end chambers respectively that are separated from both the source and recipient chambers resulting in four chambers in the electromigration setup as illustrated in fig 1 moreover by intermixing the anode and cathode electrolytes with two peristatic pumps the protons and hydroxyl ions that are formed at the electrode surfaces may quickly neutralize with each other as a result the ph differences between the anode and cathode electrolytes could significantly be reduced to avoid short circuiting in the mixing streams drop wise mixing is normally required in fig 1 the anode and cathode are connected to a direct current power supply through an ampere meter the potential difference over the rock sample is measured by a voltmeter that is connected to a pair of separate electrodes placed in the source and recipient chambers respectively during the experiment the tracer ions subjected to an electrical field will be forced to move towards the electrode of opposite charge as a result of coupling actions of electromigration electroosmosis and dispersion the tracer will migrate through the rock sample much faster than if only diffusion would have been the main transport mechanism 2 2 2 improvement of the electromigration setup the improvement of the electromigration setup was based on the former design of löfgren and neretnieks 2006 and also andré et al 2009 described above by considering some points that were not taken into account the modified device has the functions of voltage self controlling continuous current recording and solution ph stabilization it enables to provide more accurate and reproducible results of electromigration experiments long term running of the device also becomes possible because the voltage over the rock sample will be adjusted automatically by the device itself to keep a constant value whenever the resistance of the rock sample changes the change in resistance is a result of the concentration evolution of the tracer ions as well as other background ions such as h oh and na and cl as suggested by the modelling results with phreeqc code appelo 2017 the concentration distribution of different ions is changing with the electromigration experiment goes on and it is a function of the distance to the boundary of the rock sample depending on the diffusion coefficients of the ions the change of the concentrations of different ions inside the rock sample is unavoidable during the running of the electromigration device and it leads to the change of the potential difference over the rock sample if it is not carefully controlled an inaccurate and variable potential difference over the rock sample will change the transport behaviour of ions in the connective pore network of rock and finally produce large errors in the interpretation of the experimental results in order to keep a constant voltage over the rock sample we introduced a potentiostat chi 660e made by ch instruments into the system to replace the normal power source showed in fig 1 the introduction of a potentiostat brings two important advantages firstly the voltage over the rock sample can be precisely controlled 0 01 v within the experimental period by applying the four electrode function of the potentiostat fig 2 the four electrode measuring method is an advanced electrode impedance measuring technique for precise measurement of low resistance values separate pairs of electrodes are used in the measurement with four electrode technique current carrying electrodes including working electrode w and counter electrode c and voltage sensing electrodes including working sense electrode ws and reference electrode r more accurate results than the normally used two electrode setup will be achieved by applying four electrode technique with this improvement the voltage difference over the rock sample can be sensed and kept constant by ws and r electrodes and the current going through the whole device can be supplied by w and the c electrodes the whole voltage over the electromigration device and the current going through the device can therefore be adjusted by the potentiostat according to the change of the resistance of the pore solution to guarantee a constant potential gradient over the rock sample in this manner the stability of the device can be improved significantly secondly the current flowing through the rock sample can be recorded automatically and continuously since variation in the current gives information of the movement and distribution of ions inside the rock sample under an electrical field it is an important factor to be considered when analysing the experimental results the current change has not been recorded or modelled carefully in previous studies during the electromigration experiments though the electromigration device was designed to separate the electrode chambers and tracer chambers to reduce the influence of ph change on aqueous chemistry ph would still slightly change during the electromigration experiments one reason for this is that the migration of h and oh which generate at the electrodes as a result of electrolysis eqs 1 and 2 are much faster than the migration of other ions in the background solutions like na cl and the studied tracer ions according to the phreeqc bat database file of phreeqc computer program appelo and postma 2004 h diffuses 7 times faster than na and about twice faster than oh this means that much more amount of h and oh would migrate into the tracer chambers than the amounts of other ions into the recipient chamber in addition the dissolution or precipitation of the minerals in the rock matrix would also cause the ph change of the background electrolytes the evolution of the ph gradient over the rock sample could cause a number of problems in the electromigration experiments some ionic tracers for example seo3 2 may become protonated hseo3 and deprotonated if the ph changes this will change the overall charge of the se iv ions under strong acidic or basic ph conditions the precipitation and dissolution of minerals will become severe and this may affect the transport properties of the rock sample in addition the efficiency of transferring current from the electrodes to electrolytes decreases if ph changes are allowed in the electrolytes to stabilize ph values of the background electrolytes during the running of electromigration experiments we buffered the solution by replacing the nacl solution which was commonly used as background electrolyte in previous studies by 0 2 m nacl and 0 002 m nahco3 solutions the ph values of which were adjusted to be 8 5 before using the addition of nahco3 has two functions firstly nahco3 simulates the ph level of real groundwater while the concentration of nacl simulates the ionic strength secondly hco3 co3 2 in the solution is a ph buffer pair even if some amount of h or oh migrate into the tracer chambers from the electrode chamber they would not cause significant changes in the ph value because of the buffer effect of hco3 co3 2 pair 2 3 electromigration experiments 2 3 1 porosity measurement the porosity of the rock sample was measured by a water gravimetry method melnyk and skeet 1986 ohlsson 2000 after achieving fully saturation in a specific nacl electrolyte the weight of the rock sample as a function time was recorded continuously during the drying process this allows us to determine the surface dry weight of the rock sample from the intersection between two lines on the time based drying curve the intersection point was interpreted as the weight of sample with totally dry surface when evaporation of the pore water has been ceased see section 3 1 fig 4 the volume of the rock sample was determined by immersing it into 0 2 m nacl electrolyte and measuring the weight difference before and after the immersing procedure the density of the electrolyte was determined by measuring the weight of a specific volume of the liquid the volume of the pores in the rock sample can thus be calculated by the weight difference between the saturated and dried rock sample together with the density of the electrolyte the ratio of the pore volume to the rock sample volume gives the porosity of the rock sample 2 3 2 electromigration setup as shown in fig 3 the new electromigration setup was built in accordance with the modification ideas discussed in section 2 1 the material used for the updated electromigration device is poly methyl methacrylate pmma which is both transparent and hard this material facilitates the observation of the running conditions inside the cells and it is hard enough to ensure tightness the volume of the source and recipient chambers is 152 ml while the volume of the two electrode chambers at both ends is 250 ml the four electrode plates with a dimension of 1 cm 2 cm is made of titanium metal a copper string was used to connect the titanium electrodes and voltage and ampere meters were used to observe the instant voltage over the rock sample and the current going through the whole device respectively the amperometric i t curve technique i t of the potentiostat was used to control the four electrode system a constant potential of 2 v or 4 v was applied over the rock sample and the current going through the device was recorded continuously as a function of experimental time the sample was fitted in a pmma cylindrical shell which has the same inner diameter as the diameter of the rock sample before inserting the sample inside the cylindrical shell both the outer surface of the sample and the inner surface of the cylindrical shell were glued with epoxy loctite dry in 5 min full strength in 24 h to tightly glue them together the purpose is to make sure that all the tracer ions can only migrate through the rock sample by its micropores then the sample holder was left in the open air for 30 h before it was placed in the electromigration device to guarantee total strength of the epoxy the other two rock samples with the length of 1 cm were used as filters to separate the electrolyte in the two electrode chambers from the electrolyte in the tracer chambers the mineralogical compositions of the two filters were similar with the rock sample tested in electromigration experiments the holders for the two filters were made in the same way as that for the sample holder 2 3 3 electromigration measurements three tracers were tested separately with the electromigration device quinoxaline sigma aldrich 99 for electroosmosis measurements na2seo3 for se iv diffusion tests and nai for i diffusion tests iodide is known to be a non sorbing ion on mineral surfaces ikonen et al 2016a while the se iv ions seo3 2 or hseo3 are believed to be slightly sorbing on mineral surfaces under the low saline groundwater conditions ikonen et al 2016b li et al 2018 the background electrolyte was 0 2 m nacl and buffered by 0 002 m nahco3 as shown in section 2 2 the voltage over the rock sample was set to be 2 v or 4 v and was kept constant by the potentiostat before running the electromigration experiments with tracers the device was stabilized by running it with background electrolyte under the applied voltage for 3 days to saturate the rock sample with background electrolyte the stabilization of the device can be observed by the recorded current data when a stable state is seemingly reached after stabilization tracers quinoxaline or na2seo3 or nai chemicals were added into the source chamber resulting in the final concentration of the tracers being 0 1 m to balance the ionic strength throughout the through electromigration cell nacl with the same ionic strength as the tracer was immediately added into the recipient chamber the initial conditions of the electromigration experiments are summarized in table 1 after addition of the tracers the source and recipient chambers were both stirred for 5 min by magnetic stirrers at the same time two samples of 2 ml were taken from the chambers to determine the original concentration of the tracer ions in the beginning of the experiment after sampling the same amount of background electrolyte was added into the chambers to keep the hydraulic pressure and the volume of solutions to be constant during the experiments the source and recipient chambers were stirred by magnetic stirrers all the time at a speed of 250 rpm the concentrations of tracers in the recipient chamber were followed by sampling and adding the same amount of background electrolyte the concentrations of quinoxaline were measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 10s uv vis according to the spectrum nist chemistry webbook srd 69 2018 the highest peak of quinoxaline spectrum appears at 270 nm and this peak was used to analyse the concentration of quinoxaline the concentrations of se and i were analysed by icp ms agilent 7800 all the samples were stored in acid washed tubes after dilution and filtration se samples were acidified by adding strong suprapure hno3 romil until 0 5 m and the concentration of se was analysed by isotope 82se because of high volatility of iodine at low ph conditions 5 tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah was used as background electrolyte for i concentration measurements by icp ms the concentration of i was analysed by detecting the concentration of isotope 127i the detection limit of 0 006 μg g in pure solution was validated using helium as a reaction gas in the reaction chamber ikonen 2017 ikonen et al 2016a 2 4 update of data analysis approach by following the concentration change of the tracer ions in the recipient chamber a breakthrough curve which is used to estimate the diffusion and sorption properties of the tracer ions can be obtained from the experiment to interpret the breakthrough curve data a model that can account for the most important mechanisms governing ionic transport in the electromigration experiments is required in the following section the traditional ideal plug flow model and newly developed advection dispersion model are shortly presented 2 4 1 ideal plug flow model due to the simplicity of its use the ideal plug flow model has been recently applied to interpret the experimental results of electromigration andré et al 2009 it accounts only for the effect of electromigration the most important mechanism on ionic transport in electrical field the contributions of electroosmosis and dispersion are however entirely omitted meng et al 2019 as a result one only needs to make a linear regression of the late time breakthrough curve over which the tracer concentration increases seemingly in a constant rate andré et al 2009 the intercept of the regression line with the time coordinate gives an estimate of the apparent advection time whereas the slope of the regression line approximates the rate of change of the tracer concentration in the recipient chamber from which the effective convection velocity or the effective mass flux can be estimated the use of the law of einstein atkins and paula 2009 for the relation between diffusivity and ionic mobility allows the effective diffusion coefficient de to be estimated from the slope dc dt of the regression line by andré et al 2009 3 d e v k t dc dt a c t e z d ϕ dx where v m3 is the volume of the recipient chamber k m2 kg s 2 k 1 is the boltzmann constant a m2 is the cross section area of the rock sample ct mol m3 is the test concentration in the supply chamber e c is the electron charge and dφ dx v m is the electrical potential gradient applied to the rock sample moreover the ideal plug flow model used by andré et al 2009 implicitly assumes that the tracer flux into the rock sample is constant during the experiment and that the rock sample has been fully in equilibrium with the tracer concentration in the source chamber after the breakthrough time this is not the real case but it facilitates evaluation of the kd value of the test tracer by making a mass balance of the tracer ions over the rock sample giving 4 k d v dc dt t br v r ε t c t m c t where tbr s is the breakthrough time determined by the intercept of the linear regression line with the time axis of the breakthrough curve vr m3 is the volume of the rock sample ct mol m3 is the source concentration of the tracer ions in the supply chamber and m kg is the mass of the sample it follows that the retardation factor defined as 5 r 1 ρ k d ε ts can also be determined where ρ is the dry bulk density of the rock sample and ε ts is the connective porosity available for the tracer ions it should however be noted that the above three expressions are valid only under the assumption that the tracer concentration in the source chamber ct remains constant during the running of the experiments since in practice only 1 105or 1 106 fraction of the tracer ions may migrate through the rock sample within the limited experimental time we can reasonably ignore the change of the source concentration so as to simply apply eqs 3 5 for data analysis 2 4 2 advection dispersion model to interpret the experimental results more accurately with great confidence we developed an advection dispersion model that well simulates the important processes in the through electromigration experiment it accounts for not only the dominant effect of electromigration but also the contributions of electroosmosis and dispersion on ionic transport as detailed in our companion paper meng et al 2019 the advection dispersion model was formulated on the basis of the equation of continuity describing the mass balance of the tracer ions over a rock sample perpendicular to the direction of mass transport i e 6 ε ts r c t v c e c x d e 2 c x 2 where v c e is the effective convection velocity compose of the contributions of both electromigration and electroosmosis and d e is the effective dispersion coefficient which can be approximated by beauwens et al 2005 7 d e α v c e d e where α is the dispersion length for the electromigration experiments under consideration the full solution of the advection dispersion model can be written in the laplace domain as 8 c r exp pe 2 scsch s pe 1 2 β l s scoth s pe 1 2 β r s scoth s pe scsch s pe 2 β l c 0 with 9 pe v c e l d e and 10 s pe 2 1 4 τ a s pe where s is the laplace variable and τ a is a characteristic advection time i e 11 τ a ε ts rl v c e the inverse laplace transform of eq 8 would then give the tracer concentration c r at the recipient chamber and it can for a given experimental setup be generally written as 12 c r f v c e d e ε ts r c 0 t this result indicates that the numerical solution of c r obtained by use of e g de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 to numerically transform eq 8 back to the time domain would depend only on v c e d e and ε ts r as a consequence these parameters can readily be evaluated by fitting the numerical solution c r to the measured data of the breakthrough curve using e g a nonlinear least squares algorithm meng et al 2019 supplemented with suitable lower and upper bounds 3 results 3 1 porosity the drying curve obtained as described in section 2 2 is shown in fig 4 the two linear lines represent the evaporation of water from the sample surface and the evaporation of water from the pore space respectively the interaction of the two lines indicates the weight of rock sample with totally dry surface while fully saturated pore space with the data presented in fig 4 we estimated that the porosity of the rock sample used in our experiments is 0 7 0 4 the assumption here is that the connected porosity of the cm scale rock sample is determined by water gravimetry the total porosity which here means the connected porosity is equal to the diffusion porosity in the sample type used in this work the sample is fine to medium grained granitic rock without cm scale micro fractures in it the porosity including flow diffusion and residual parts is defined by norton and knapp 1977 here we do not have the flow porosity and the residual porosity is not taken into account since it can not be revealed by water gravimetry method thus we assume that the water gravimetry result of porosity 0 7 0 4 is fully usable in the diffusion process and the result will be used in the following modelling exercises however we also agree that more sophisticated modelling approaches need more detailed porosity data such as pore apertures tortuosity and constrictivity mineral specific porosity and heterogeneities of porosity patterns in cm scale 3 2 electroosmosis the influence of electroosmosis on ionic transport was determined by running quinoxaline through the electromigration device the measurement was performed for several times before the running of se and i tracers each experiment took 3 5 days the results did not show obvious detection of quinoxaline in the recipient chamber even after 5 days measurements the highest observation was that electroosmosis might account for 4 1 of the total electromigration process it was therefore deemed that the effect of electroosmosis was not a determining factor for the electromigration results and it can be omitted when dealing with data analysis 3 3 electromigration with nai two voltages 2 v or 4 v over the rock sample were applied in the electromigration experiments of nai using the updated device the potential gradients over the rock sample were 179 v m and 357 v m respectively the original concentration of nai in the source chamber was 0 1 m and the concentration of i in the recipient chamber was followed for about 2 days the breakthrough curves as a function of experimental time recorded by potentiostat are shown in fig 5 the two analysis approaches described in section 3 ideal plug flow model and advection dispersion model were applied for analysis of the experimental results first the traditional ideal plug flow model was tried by drawing a linear regression line with the last several data points where a pseudo steady state seemed to be established the breakthrough time for i migrating through the rock sample and the concentration change rate of the i ions in the recipient chamber can be evaluated from the intercept and the slope of the linear regression line as given in table 2 the numerical solution of the advection dispersion model in laplace domain eq 8 can be easily achieved by de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 the results show that the evolution of the tracer concentration in the recipient chamber would depend on v c e d e and ε ts r eq 12 these parameters could simultaneously be evaluated by fitting the numerical solution cr to the measured data of the breakthrough curve the de values deduced from the advection dispersion model are listed in table 2 as de the methodology for detailed analysis of the experimental results can be found in the companion paper meng et al 2019 according to earlier data reported by skagius and neretnieks skagius 1986 skagius and neretnieks 1983 the effective diffusion coefficient of i in granites and gneisses is in the range of 1 10 14 m2 s to 7 10 13 m2 s the calculated de data both from the traditional method with eq 3 and the newly developed advection dispersion model are in good agreement with the data reported in literature compared with the electromigration data reported in andré et al 2009 work in which only 1 5 h was needed to break through a 15 mm length rock sample under the potential gradient of 200 v m the breakthrough time obtained in our experiment was much longer andré et al 2009 used 0 01 m nai as the tracer and 0 99 m kcl as the background electrolyte and the de of i obtained using ideal plug flow model was 4 0 10 13 m2 s which is 5 times larger than the value estimated from our work the inconsistence between these experimental results may come from the different physical properties of the rock sample andré et al 2009 did not show the porosities and the compositions of the rock sample used in their work however the properties of the rock sample are expected to have a significant effect on the experimental results 3 4 electromigration with na2seo3 the same rock sample used for the electromigration tests of nai was also tested for na2seo3 as a tracer under the same experimental conditions the original concentration of na2seo3 in the source chamber was also 0 1 m the same voltage as in the nai tests either 2 v or 4 v was applied over the rock sample in the recipient chamber the concentration of se was followed for about 2 days the breakthrough curves as a function of experimental time recorded by the potentiostat are shown in fig 6 the breakthrough time and the slope data deduced from the linear regression line as well as the de values calculated from eq 3 and the advection dispersion model are given in table 3 the de values calculated by both methods are in the magnitude of 10 14 m2 s in consistent with the recommended values of se in granite ohlsson and neretniks 1997 more importantly we observed in figs 6 and 7 that for both tracer ions a clear breakthrough time can be identified from the measured breakthrough curve itself before the breakthrough time the concentration of tracer ions in the recipient chamber remained apparently at the background level this indicates that the electromigration device was in a good condition of tightness and thus all the tracer ions have migrated through the rock sample by the connective pore network in addition comparison of the experimental results also showed a larger breakthrough time and a smaller increase in the rate of the concentration change in the recipient chamber when 2 v was applied over the rock sample instead of 4 v in both i and se iv experiments as a conclusion it can be stated that the updated device of electromigration worked well and that the experimental results can be used confidently to determine the diffusion and sorption properties of the tracer ions however it is noted especially in fig 7 that the measured breakthrough curve shows a clear curvature at the moment around the breakthrough time which is certainly overestimated by the ideal plug flow model this signifies actually that dispersion has played a non negligible role in the ionic transport through the rock sample as a consequence application of the ideal plug flow model for parameter identification can be problematic because it ignores the effect of dispersion and uses only a small portion of the late time experimental results in some cases the selection of the experimental data for linear regression itself also causes trouble because no clear rule can be followed 3 5 current data fig 7 shows one of the examples of current evolution during the electromigration experiments it is obvious that the current going through the rock sample was changing all the time this is caused by the variation of the ion distribution inside the rock sample so that the resistances of the rock sample and the two filters are varying all the time without a potential controlling system the inconstant voltage over the rock sample would make the experimental results difficult to interpret the current data provided by the potentiostat is also valuable when we try to analyse the ion distribution and diffusion behaviour inside the rock sample the interpretation of the current data requires consideration of the electric flux of the ions the chemical and electrical reactions the individual movement of the ionic species etc which means that a reactive transport model should be developed for the interpretation of the results it should take into account not only the effects of electromigration electroosmosis and dispersion but also the effects of aqueous chemistry i e the interactions between the tracer ions and the background electrolytes and the mineral surfaces only by this reactive transport model could the current data shown in fig 7 be properly interpreted in our companion paper meng et al 2019 a reactive transport model was preliminarily developed using the phreeqc module of electromigration 4 discussions one of the key problems of performing electromigration experiments is the controlling of the voltage over the rock sample in this work we introduced a potentiostat to solve the problem by using the four electrode function of the potentiostat the voltage over the rock sample can be adjusted automatically and controlled constantly 0 01 v at the set value as a result the experimental errors were significantly reduced in our work compared with the electromigration results reported in literature andré et al 2009a löfgren et al 2009 löfgren and neretnieks 2006 the breakthrough curves as well as the de values obtained from the new designed electromigration device are more stable since our main purpose is to estimate the diffusion and sorption properties of the tracers in low porous intact granitic rock it is preferable first to develop an advection dispersion model that account for the most important mechanisms governing ionic transport but ignores the effect of aqueous chemistry the advection dispersion model developed in this work avoids the use of many unrealistic assumptions associated with the ideal plug flow model and succeeds to give reliable results with small uncertainties the ideal plug flow model should only be used to define the lower and upper bounds of the corresponding parameters like de values for more accurate analyses of the experimental results the advection dispersion model is recommended one example showing the difference of the two models is given in fig 8 the ideal plug flow model simply makes a linear regression of the data at which a steady state seems to be achieved after the breakthrough time the intercept of the regression line with the time axis gives an estimate of the advection time which was assumed to be the breakthrough time the slope of the regression line gives an estimate of the rate of the concentration change in the recipient chamber this method gives a quick but rough estimate of the parameters with large uncertainties the advection dispersion model analyses the whole breakthrough curve instead and more factors that could affect the results can be taken into account by fitting the breakthrough curve obtained from the electromigration experiments with a non linear least square algorithm in the batch sorption experiments se iv ions are considered to be slightly sorbing onto mineral surfaces the batch sorption experiments performed by li et al 2018 gave the kd values of se iv sorption onto crushed grimsel granodiorite being in the range of 1 7 4 0 10 3 m3 kg when se iv concentration ranged from 10 6 mol l to 10 3 mol l in low saline groundwater simulant however our analysis of advection dispersion modelling showed that both i and se iv ions are effectively non sorbing in the intact rock sample investigated in the experimental conditions the retardation factor calculated from the models are always equal to one and the assumption of i and se iv as sorbing species will make the curvature of the simulated breakthrough curves deviate clearly from the obtained experimental data this result is reasonable considering that the kd values reported by li et al 2018 were obtained from batch sorption experiments with crushed minerals the crushing process of the mineral will significantly increase the specific surface area of the mineral sample and give an access to the isolated pore and new surfaces inside the minerals if the kd values from the work of li et al 2018 are corrected with specific surface area as they pointed out in their work already the kd values would be in the range of 1 3 3 2 10 5 m3 kg since the values are very small selenite can be regarded as a slightly sorbing ion on intact rock samples however considering the nuclear waste repository that is hundreds of square meters scale and the existence of high sorptive clay minerals at the fracture surfaces in bedrock the retardation of the se or i still can not be neglected in the whole concept one of the advantages of electromigration experiments compared with traditional batch sorption experiments is that kd values of intact rock samples can be deduced and used directly in the safety assessment of a nuclear waste repository to use the kd values from batch sorption experiments an upscaling factor must be developed to convert the results of batch sorption experiments to use the batch kd values for the safety assessments of a nuclear waste repository in practice it has been shown that the variations of the upscaling factors are rather high which reduces the applicability of the upscaling method puukko et al 2018 in future more work should be done for the sorption studies with electromigration method taking into account factors like composition of the rock sample properties of the tracer ions and the salinity of the background electrolyte the main composition of the rock sample used in this work is quartz monzodiorite as we presented in section 2 1 on the site where the sample was taken the most dominant minerals in the sealed and open fractures are calcite chlorite and quartz the minerals that can sorb selenium effectively such as kaolinite and biotite are not present more sorption may be observed if sorptive minerals are present in the composition of the studied rock samples the diffusion of i compared to that of se iv ions is 2 or 3 times faster in the intact rock sample investigated this result is in consistent with the diffusion coefficients of them in aqueous solutions in the condition of infinite dilution the diffusion coefficient of i is 2 048 10 9 m2 s while that of selenate is 1 008 10 9 m2 s crc press 2018 the slow diffusion of se iv ions is attributed to its unsymmetrical dimensions and larger interaction with water molecules in aqueous solutions the effective hydrated radius of i was reported to be 0 331 nm yu and neretnieks 1997 while the geometrical structure of seo3 2 is more complicated since it is an oxoseleno anion the study of eklund 2014 by laxs measurements suggested that the seo bond distance in the hydrated ion is 1 709 å the ow ow distance in bulk water is 2873 å outside of the bound oxygens the proximal se ow distance is 3 87 å for distal se ow outside of the lone electron pair the distance is 4 36 å based on these data the schematic figure of hydrated seo3 2 and i ions calculated by molecular modelling in water media is shown in fig 9 the calculation was performed by evaluating the optimized structures of seo3 2 h2o 10 and i h2o 9 ions using castep i e cambridge serial total energy package clark et al 2009 code implemented into biovia materials studio 2017 r2 it was based on solving the total electronic energy and overall electronic density distribution in order to define the energetically stable structures for ions leach 2001 according to the molecular modelling results seo3 2 are slightly larger and unsymmetrical than i which would cause delay in diffusion when it migrates through the micropores of the intact rock samples 5 conclusions in this work a new electromigration device was developed and tested by running with i and se iv ions it was found that the new electromigration device can give stable and convincing experimental results due mainly to the introduction of a potentiostat which could keep the voltage over the rock sample nearly constant during the experiments by adjusting the overall voltage applied to the whole device at the same time the ph of the background solutions was also stabilized by adding nahco3 buffer these modifications improve the stability of the experimental conditions and reduce the experimental errors significantly to facilitate interpretation of the experimental results an advection dispersion model was developed in this work it accounts for not only the dominant effect of electromigration but also the contributions of electroosmosis and dispersion on ionic transport and therefore it can provide better parameter identification with smaller uncertainties than the traditional ideal plug flow model which involves many unrealistic assumptions by interpreting the breakthrough curves with both ideal plug flow model and the advection dispersion model the experimental results with quinoxaline as tracer showed that the effect of the electroosmosis can be omitted the de values deduced for i diffusion were 8 33 3 25 10 14 m2 s from ideal plug flow model and 1 15 0 60 10 13 m2 s from advection dispersion model respectively the de values for se iv ions diffusion were 3 49 2 76 10 14 m2 s from ideal plug flow model and 3 50 0 86 10 14 m2 s from advection dispersion model respectively furthermore our analysis suggested that both i and se iv ions should be considered as non sorbing ions when transporting through the studied intact rock sample the reason why se iv ions migrate relatively slow in comparison with i is attributed mainly to its smaller effective diffusion coefficient resulting from its larger and unsymmetrical dimensions the new electromigration device and the advection dispersion model developed enable rapid estimation of the de and kd values from experimental results of the intact rock sample however further studies should be applied to justify this method as an appropriate technique for studying diffusion of radionuclides under nuclear waste repository conditions here only two sets of experimental results with applied voltages of 2 v and 4 v were available for both i and se iv ions by the updated device further improvements could be done by applying 5 or more voltages applied over the rock sample to decrease the uncertainties associated with parameter evaluation of the experimental results information about the connected pore network and rock mineralogy should also be determined using methods like x ray tomography c 14 pmma autoradiography and electron microscopy to reveal the realistic pore network in the studied rock samples the

1528,to determine the diffusion and sorption properties of radionuclides in intact crystalline rocks a new electromigration device was built and tested by running with i and se iv ions by introducing a potentiostat to impose a constant voltage over the studied rock sample the electromigration device can give more stable and accurate experimental results than those from the traditional electromigration devices in addition the variation in the ph of the background electrolytes was minimised by adding a small amount of nahco3 as buffers to interpret the experimental results with more confidence an advection dispersion model was also developed in this study which accounts for the most important mechanisms governing ionic transport in the electromigration experiments data analysis of the breakthrough curves by the advection dispersion model instead of the traditional ideal plug flow model suggest that the effective diffusivities of i and se iv are 1 15 0 06 10 13 m2 s and 3 50 0 86 10 14 m2 s respectively the results also show that i is more mobile than se iv ions when migrating through the same intact rock sample and that their sorption properties are almost identical keywords electromigration advection dispersion model se iv iodide intact crystalline rock 1 introduction the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel is considered to take place in deep geological repositories in many countries de cannière et al 2010 ewing 2015 posiva 2013 a multiple barrier system including both engineered and natural is normally employed to ensure the safety of the disposal low porous crystalline rock such as granite is therefore the final natural barrier to provide retardation of radionuclides from migrating into groundwater in most nuclear waste disposal concepts muuri 2015 posiva 2012 söderlund 2016 the sorption on the pore surfaces of the bedrock and the diffusion into the low porous rock matrix are the two most significant processes that retard radionuclides migrating through the water conducting fractures of the crystalline rock dai et al 2007 grisak and pickens 1980 neretnieks 1980 posiva 2013 séby et al 1998 for this reason many studies have been carried out to determine the sorption and diffusion properties of dominant radionuclides existing in nuclear waste such as cs sr2 i and seo3 2 by batch sorption experiments li et al 2018 söderlund et al 2016a 2016b block scale diffusion experiments garcía gutiérrez et al 2006 ikonen et al 2016b through diffusion experiments puukko 2014 tachi et al 2015 electromigration experiments andré 2009 andré et al 2009a löfgren and neretnieks 2006 puukko et al 2018 and he gas through diffusion experiments kuva et al 2015 2016 among these experimental methods electromigration is getting more attention in the last two decades this method can provide parameters like effective diffusion coefficient de distribution coefficient kd and formation factor ff for an intact crystalline rock sample in a much faster way than the traditional through diffusion experiments in water phase which might take several months tachi et al 2015 typically the porosity of the bedrock is in the order of 10 3 while the apertures of its micropores are in the order of 10 6 m möri et al 2003 as a result the permeability of the rock matrix is very small and the pore water in the rock matrix could be considered as stagnant due to the low porosity and tortuous pores the diffusion experiments are very time consuming in water saturated rock matrix in order to reduce the experimental time by accelerating the transport of charged ions applications of hydraulic pressure electric field over the rock sample electromigration and gas phase experiments are normally used because of the low permeability of the rock sample extremely high hydraulic pressure is often required to accelerate the movement of tracer ions in rock matrix gas phase through diffusion experiments using he atom as a tracer can reduce the experimental time for about 11 000 times kuva et al 2015 2016 however water based experiments can normally provide more reliable and accurate results because in the gas phase experiments the chemical effects and other water phase related interactions e g solute mineral surface interactions must be ignored by contrast the electromigration method is more advantage because a small electrical field is efficient enough to accelerate the migration of ions in pore water inside a low permeability granitic rock core maes et al 1999 mitchell and soga 2005 under the electrical potential gradient the charged particles and ions can migrate in low porous rock sample about 1000 times faster than elements in water saturated rock depending on the strength of the electric field as a result the experimental time could be reduced significantly to several days another advantage of utilizing electromigration method is that the kd equivalently the retardation factor r values of intact rock samples could also be determined conveniently in the batch sorption experiments which is a traditional way of measuring kd values samples are normally crushed which increases significantly the specific surface area of the samples and may give access to otherwise isolated pores as a consequence the kd values determined from crushed rock samples will generally be overestimated andré et al 2009b puukko et al 2018 to address this problem conservative estimates of the upscaling factors have been performed prior to use the kd values in a performance and safety assessment of a geological repository puukko et al 2018 in the electromigration experiments however the retardation of sorptive radionuclides for an intact rock sample can directly be evaluated by analysing the mass balance over the rock sample andré et al 2009a puukko et al 2018 with this understanding löfgren and andré designed an electromigration device and tested the migration behaviour of i and cs ions andré 2009 andré et al 2009a löfgren 2005 löfgren et al 2009 löfgren 2015 löfgren and neretnieks 2006 the breakthrough time of i for example in a 15 mm thick sample was found to be only several hours with an applied potential gradient of 20 v m or 1000 v m whereas the effective diffusion coefficients were estimated to be 4 0 10 13 m2 s for i and 3 0 10 13 m2 s for cs respectively andré et al 2009a 2009b however some critical flaws still exist in their design of the device as well as in the modelling approaches for analysing experimental results for example their device does not include a voltage self controlling system which may cause large experimental errors in long term studies and even give wrong results moreover the traditional modelling method for analysing results from electromigration experiments involves many unrealistic assumptions and simplifications the model could only give a rough estimate of the de and kd parameters which normally contain large uncertainties the purpose of this work is to update the electromigration experimental setup and to develop an advection dispersion model for more accurate analysis of the experimental results the modified device will have the abilities of voltage self controlling continuous current recording and solution ph stabilization two anions i and seo3 2 were studied with the updated electromigration setup under different potential gradients the advection dispersion model will as detailed in our companion paper meng et al 2019 account for the most important mechanisms governing ionic transport through an intact rock core which is subject to an electric field it enables to give a reliable estimate of the diffusion and sorption properties of the tracer ions in low permeable granitic rock 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation the rock sample used in the electromigration experiment was collected from äspö underground laboratory borehole klx11f 17 m depth in collaboration with linnaeus university the length of the rock sample was 1 12 cm as measured by a caliper and the diameter was 5 cm the lithology distribution of the rock sample was quartz monzodiorite 95 5 and fine grained granite 4 5 it was saturated with synthetic groundwater and vacuum packed in a tight vessel before using in the experiment more detailed information could be found in the report by mattsson et al 2007 the rock samples were dried at 105 c in a vacuum thermostat oven for at least 4 days to achieve complete dryness after that the samples were stored in a desiccator until normal temperature the dry weights of the samples were then measured afterwards the samples were water saturated with the vacuum method as described by ohlsson 2000 and löfgren 2005 first the samples were placed in a desiccator above 0 2 m nacl solution the air in the desiccator was evacuated with a pump and water vapor diffused at low pressure into the sample and saturated the connected micropores of the rock sample the evacuation process was repeated twice per hour for at least 6 h to get rid of the air leak from the rock sample in the desiccator thereafter the sample was shaken off into the nacl electrolyte and totally immersed in it the pressure in the desiccator was then increased slowly until atmospheric pressure in more than 1 day after achieving atmospheric pressure the sample was stored in the electrolyte to achieve fully saturation before used in the electromigration experiments 2 2 modification of the electromigration experimental setup 2 2 1 basic design of the electromigration device as schematically shown in fig 1 the electromigration device could be seen as a further implementation of the traditional through diffusion method the different is that a constant voltage is applied over the rock sample which is placed between two chambers one holding an electrolyte with high concentration tracer the source chamber and one holding the same electrolyte initially free of the tracer the recipient chamber since electromigration is the main process of solute transport in this study only ionic tracers should be considered the potential gradients over the rock sample could be achieved by placing an electrode in each of the electrolyte solutions and simply connecting the electrodes to a direct current power supply in this manner however a ph gradient will inevitably evolve within the system as electrolysis will occur at both anode and cathode 1 anode 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 h o 2 2 cathode 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 to avoid ph change of the electrolytes caused by electrolysis löfgren and neretnieks 2006 and also andré et al 2009a 2009b placed anode and cathode in two end chambers respectively that are separated from both the source and recipient chambers resulting in four chambers in the electromigration setup as illustrated in fig 1 moreover by intermixing the anode and cathode electrolytes with two peristatic pumps the protons and hydroxyl ions that are formed at the electrode surfaces may quickly neutralize with each other as a result the ph differences between the anode and cathode electrolytes could significantly be reduced to avoid short circuiting in the mixing streams drop wise mixing is normally required in fig 1 the anode and cathode are connected to a direct current power supply through an ampere meter the potential difference over the rock sample is measured by a voltmeter that is connected to a pair of separate electrodes placed in the source and recipient chambers respectively during the experiment the tracer ions subjected to an electrical field will be forced to move towards the electrode of opposite charge as a result of coupling actions of electromigration electroosmosis and dispersion the tracer will migrate through the rock sample much faster than if only diffusion would have been the main transport mechanism 2 2 2 improvement of the electromigration setup the improvement of the electromigration setup was based on the former design of löfgren and neretnieks 2006 and also andré et al 2009 described above by considering some points that were not taken into account the modified device has the functions of voltage self controlling continuous current recording and solution ph stabilization it enables to provide more accurate and reproducible results of electromigration experiments long term running of the device also becomes possible because the voltage over the rock sample will be adjusted automatically by the device itself to keep a constant value whenever the resistance of the rock sample changes the change in resistance is a result of the concentration evolution of the tracer ions as well as other background ions such as h oh and na and cl as suggested by the modelling results with phreeqc code appelo 2017 the concentration distribution of different ions is changing with the electromigration experiment goes on and it is a function of the distance to the boundary of the rock sample depending on the diffusion coefficients of the ions the change of the concentrations of different ions inside the rock sample is unavoidable during the running of the electromigration device and it leads to the change of the potential difference over the rock sample if it is not carefully controlled an inaccurate and variable potential difference over the rock sample will change the transport behaviour of ions in the connective pore network of rock and finally produce large errors in the interpretation of the experimental results in order to keep a constant voltage over the rock sample we introduced a potentiostat chi 660e made by ch instruments into the system to replace the normal power source showed in fig 1 the introduction of a potentiostat brings two important advantages firstly the voltage over the rock sample can be precisely controlled 0 01 v within the experimental period by applying the four electrode function of the potentiostat fig 2 the four electrode measuring method is an advanced electrode impedance measuring technique for precise measurement of low resistance values separate pairs of electrodes are used in the measurement with four electrode technique current carrying electrodes including working electrode w and counter electrode c and voltage sensing electrodes including working sense electrode ws and reference electrode r more accurate results than the normally used two electrode setup will be achieved by applying four electrode technique with this improvement the voltage difference over the rock sample can be sensed and kept constant by ws and r electrodes and the current going through the whole device can be supplied by w and the c electrodes the whole voltage over the electromigration device and the current going through the device can therefore be adjusted by the potentiostat according to the change of the resistance of the pore solution to guarantee a constant potential gradient over the rock sample in this manner the stability of the device can be improved significantly secondly the current flowing through the rock sample can be recorded automatically and continuously since variation in the current gives information of the movement and distribution of ions inside the rock sample under an electrical field it is an important factor to be considered when analysing the experimental results the current change has not been recorded or modelled carefully in previous studies during the electromigration experiments though the electromigration device was designed to separate the electrode chambers and tracer chambers to reduce the influence of ph change on aqueous chemistry ph would still slightly change during the electromigration experiments one reason for this is that the migration of h and oh which generate at the electrodes as a result of electrolysis eqs 1 and 2 are much faster than the migration of other ions in the background solutions like na cl and the studied tracer ions according to the phreeqc bat database file of phreeqc computer program appelo and postma 2004 h diffuses 7 times faster than na and about twice faster than oh this means that much more amount of h and oh would migrate into the tracer chambers than the amounts of other ions into the recipient chamber in addition the dissolution or precipitation of the minerals in the rock matrix would also cause the ph change of the background electrolytes the evolution of the ph gradient over the rock sample could cause a number of problems in the electromigration experiments some ionic tracers for example seo3 2 may become protonated hseo3 and deprotonated if the ph changes this will change the overall charge of the se iv ions under strong acidic or basic ph conditions the precipitation and dissolution of minerals will become severe and this may affect the transport properties of the rock sample in addition the efficiency of transferring current from the electrodes to electrolytes decreases if ph changes are allowed in the electrolytes to stabilize ph values of the background electrolytes during the running of electromigration experiments we buffered the solution by replacing the nacl solution which was commonly used as background electrolyte in previous studies by 0 2 m nacl and 0 002 m nahco3 solutions the ph values of which were adjusted to be 8 5 before using the addition of nahco3 has two functions firstly nahco3 simulates the ph level of real groundwater while the concentration of nacl simulates the ionic strength secondly hco3 co3 2 in the solution is a ph buffer pair even if some amount of h or oh migrate into the tracer chambers from the electrode chamber they would not cause significant changes in the ph value because of the buffer effect of hco3 co3 2 pair 2 3 electromigration experiments 2 3 1 porosity measurement the porosity of the rock sample was measured by a water gravimetry method melnyk and skeet 1986 ohlsson 2000 after achieving fully saturation in a specific nacl electrolyte the weight of the rock sample as a function time was recorded continuously during the drying process this allows us to determine the surface dry weight of the rock sample from the intersection between two lines on the time based drying curve the intersection point was interpreted as the weight of sample with totally dry surface when evaporation of the pore water has been ceased see section 3 1 fig 4 the volume of the rock sample was determined by immersing it into 0 2 m nacl electrolyte and measuring the weight difference before and after the immersing procedure the density of the electrolyte was determined by measuring the weight of a specific volume of the liquid the volume of the pores in the rock sample can thus be calculated by the weight difference between the saturated and dried rock sample together with the density of the electrolyte the ratio of the pore volume to the rock sample volume gives the porosity of the rock sample 2 3 2 electromigration setup as shown in fig 3 the new electromigration setup was built in accordance with the modification ideas discussed in section 2 1 the material used for the updated electromigration device is poly methyl methacrylate pmma which is both transparent and hard this material facilitates the observation of the running conditions inside the cells and it is hard enough to ensure tightness the volume of the source and recipient chambers is 152 ml while the volume of the two electrode chambers at both ends is 250 ml the four electrode plates with a dimension of 1 cm 2 cm is made of titanium metal a copper string was used to connect the titanium electrodes and voltage and ampere meters were used to observe the instant voltage over the rock sample and the current going through the whole device respectively the amperometric i t curve technique i t of the potentiostat was used to control the four electrode system a constant potential of 2 v or 4 v was applied over the rock sample and the current going through the device was recorded continuously as a function of experimental time the sample was fitted in a pmma cylindrical shell which has the same inner diameter as the diameter of the rock sample before inserting the sample inside the cylindrical shell both the outer surface of the sample and the inner surface of the cylindrical shell were glued with epoxy loctite dry in 5 min full strength in 24 h to tightly glue them together the purpose is to make sure that all the tracer ions can only migrate through the rock sample by its micropores then the sample holder was left in the open air for 30 h before it was placed in the electromigration device to guarantee total strength of the epoxy the other two rock samples with the length of 1 cm were used as filters to separate the electrolyte in the two electrode chambers from the electrolyte in the tracer chambers the mineralogical compositions of the two filters were similar with the rock sample tested in electromigration experiments the holders for the two filters were made in the same way as that for the sample holder 2 3 3 electromigration measurements three tracers were tested separately with the electromigration device quinoxaline sigma aldrich 99 for electroosmosis measurements na2seo3 for se iv diffusion tests and nai for i diffusion tests iodide is known to be a non sorbing ion on mineral surfaces ikonen et al 2016a while the se iv ions seo3 2 or hseo3 are believed to be slightly sorbing on mineral surfaces under the low saline groundwater conditions ikonen et al 2016b li et al 2018 the background electrolyte was 0 2 m nacl and buffered by 0 002 m nahco3 as shown in section 2 2 the voltage over the rock sample was set to be 2 v or 4 v and was kept constant by the potentiostat before running the electromigration experiments with tracers the device was stabilized by running it with background electrolyte under the applied voltage for 3 days to saturate the rock sample with background electrolyte the stabilization of the device can be observed by the recorded current data when a stable state is seemingly reached after stabilization tracers quinoxaline or na2seo3 or nai chemicals were added into the source chamber resulting in the final concentration of the tracers being 0 1 m to balance the ionic strength throughout the through electromigration cell nacl with the same ionic strength as the tracer was immediately added into the recipient chamber the initial conditions of the electromigration experiments are summarized in table 1 after addition of the tracers the source and recipient chambers were both stirred for 5 min by magnetic stirrers at the same time two samples of 2 ml were taken from the chambers to determine the original concentration of the tracer ions in the beginning of the experiment after sampling the same amount of background electrolyte was added into the chambers to keep the hydraulic pressure and the volume of solutions to be constant during the experiments the source and recipient chambers were stirred by magnetic stirrers all the time at a speed of 250 rpm the concentrations of tracers in the recipient chamber were followed by sampling and adding the same amount of background electrolyte the concentrations of quinoxaline were measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 10s uv vis according to the spectrum nist chemistry webbook srd 69 2018 the highest peak of quinoxaline spectrum appears at 270 nm and this peak was used to analyse the concentration of quinoxaline the concentrations of se and i were analysed by icp ms agilent 7800 all the samples were stored in acid washed tubes after dilution and filtration se samples were acidified by adding strong suprapure hno3 romil until 0 5 m and the concentration of se was analysed by isotope 82se because of high volatility of iodine at low ph conditions 5 tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah was used as background electrolyte for i concentration measurements by icp ms the concentration of i was analysed by detecting the concentration of isotope 127i the detection limit of 0 006 μg g in pure solution was validated using helium as a reaction gas in the reaction chamber ikonen 2017 ikonen et al 2016a 2 4 update of data analysis approach by following the concentration change of the tracer ions in the recipient chamber a breakthrough curve which is used to estimate the diffusion and sorption properties of the tracer ions can be obtained from the experiment to interpret the breakthrough curve data a model that can account for the most important mechanisms governing ionic transport in the electromigration experiments is required in the following section the traditional ideal plug flow model and newly developed advection dispersion model are shortly presented 2 4 1 ideal plug flow model due to the simplicity of its use the ideal plug flow model has been recently applied to interpret the experimental results of electromigration andré et al 2009 it accounts only for the effect of electromigration the most important mechanism on ionic transport in electrical field the contributions of electroosmosis and dispersion are however entirely omitted meng et al 2019 as a result one only needs to make a linear regression of the late time breakthrough curve over which the tracer concentration increases seemingly in a constant rate andré et al 2009 the intercept of the regression line with the time coordinate gives an estimate of the apparent advection time whereas the slope of the regression line approximates the rate of change of the tracer concentration in the recipient chamber from which the effective convection velocity or the effective mass flux can be estimated the use of the law of einstein atkins and paula 2009 for the relation between diffusivity and ionic mobility allows the effective diffusion coefficient de to be estimated from the slope dc dt of the regression line by andré et al 2009 3 d e v k t dc dt a c t e z d ϕ dx where v m3 is the volume of the recipient chamber k m2 kg s 2 k 1 is the boltzmann constant a m2 is the cross section area of the rock sample ct mol m3 is the test concentration in the supply chamber e c is the electron charge and dφ dx v m is the electrical potential gradient applied to the rock sample moreover the ideal plug flow model used by andré et al 2009 implicitly assumes that the tracer flux into the rock sample is constant during the experiment and that the rock sample has been fully in equilibrium with the tracer concentration in the source chamber after the breakthrough time this is not the real case but it facilitates evaluation of the kd value of the test tracer by making a mass balance of the tracer ions over the rock sample giving 4 k d v dc dt t br v r ε t c t m c t where tbr s is the breakthrough time determined by the intercept of the linear regression line with the time axis of the breakthrough curve vr m3 is the volume of the rock sample ct mol m3 is the source concentration of the tracer ions in the supply chamber and m kg is the mass of the sample it follows that the retardation factor defined as 5 r 1 ρ k d ε ts can also be determined where ρ is the dry bulk density of the rock sample and ε ts is the connective porosity available for the tracer ions it should however be noted that the above three expressions are valid only under the assumption that the tracer concentration in the source chamber ct remains constant during the running of the experiments since in practice only 1 105or 1 106 fraction of the tracer ions may migrate through the rock sample within the limited experimental time we can reasonably ignore the change of the source concentration so as to simply apply eqs 3 5 for data analysis 2 4 2 advection dispersion model to interpret the experimental results more accurately with great confidence we developed an advection dispersion model that well simulates the important processes in the through electromigration experiment it accounts for not only the dominant effect of electromigration but also the contributions of electroosmosis and dispersion on ionic transport as detailed in our companion paper meng et al 2019 the advection dispersion model was formulated on the basis of the equation of continuity describing the mass balance of the tracer ions over a rock sample perpendicular to the direction of mass transport i e 6 ε ts r c t v c e c x d e 2 c x 2 where v c e is the effective convection velocity compose of the contributions of both electromigration and electroosmosis and d e is the effective dispersion coefficient which can be approximated by beauwens et al 2005 7 d e α v c e d e where α is the dispersion length for the electromigration experiments under consideration the full solution of the advection dispersion model can be written in the laplace domain as 8 c r exp pe 2 scsch s pe 1 2 β l s scoth s pe 1 2 β r s scoth s pe scsch s pe 2 β l c 0 with 9 pe v c e l d e and 10 s pe 2 1 4 τ a s pe where s is the laplace variable and τ a is a characteristic advection time i e 11 τ a ε ts rl v c e the inverse laplace transform of eq 8 would then give the tracer concentration c r at the recipient chamber and it can for a given experimental setup be generally written as 12 c r f v c e d e ε ts r c 0 t this result indicates that the numerical solution of c r obtained by use of e g de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 to numerically transform eq 8 back to the time domain would depend only on v c e d e and ε ts r as a consequence these parameters can readily be evaluated by fitting the numerical solution c r to the measured data of the breakthrough curve using e g a nonlinear least squares algorithm meng et al 2019 supplemented with suitable lower and upper bounds 3 results 3 1 porosity the drying curve obtained as described in section 2 2 is shown in fig 4 the two linear lines represent the evaporation of water from the sample surface and the evaporation of water from the pore space respectively the interaction of the two lines indicates the weight of rock sample with totally dry surface while fully saturated pore space with the data presented in fig 4 we estimated that the porosity of the rock sample used in our experiments is 0 7 0 4 the assumption here is that the connected porosity of the cm scale rock sample is determined by water gravimetry the total porosity which here means the connected porosity is equal to the diffusion porosity in the sample type used in this work the sample is fine to medium grained granitic rock without cm scale micro fractures in it the porosity including flow diffusion and residual parts is defined by norton and knapp 1977 here we do not have the flow porosity and the residual porosity is not taken into account since it can not be revealed by water gravimetry method thus we assume that the water gravimetry result of porosity 0 7 0 4 is fully usable in the diffusion process and the result will be used in the following modelling exercises however we also agree that more sophisticated modelling approaches need more detailed porosity data such as pore apertures tortuosity and constrictivity mineral specific porosity and heterogeneities of porosity patterns in cm scale 3 2 electroosmosis the influence of electroosmosis on ionic transport was determined by running quinoxaline through the electromigration device the measurement was performed for several times before the running of se and i tracers each experiment took 3 5 days the results did not show obvious detection of quinoxaline in the recipient chamber even after 5 days measurements the highest observation was that electroosmosis might account for 4 1 of the total electromigration process it was therefore deemed that the effect of electroosmosis was not a determining factor for the electromigration results and it can be omitted when dealing with data analysis 3 3 electromigration with nai two voltages 2 v or 4 v over the rock sample were applied in the electromigration experiments of nai using the updated device the potential gradients over the rock sample were 179 v m and 357 v m respectively the original concentration of nai in the source chamber was 0 1 m and the concentration of i in the recipient chamber was followed for about 2 days the breakthrough curves as a function of experimental time recorded by potentiostat are shown in fig 5 the two analysis approaches described in section 3 ideal plug flow model and advection dispersion model were applied for analysis of the experimental results first the traditional ideal plug flow model was tried by drawing a linear regression line with the last several data points where a pseudo steady state seemed to be established the breakthrough time for i migrating through the rock sample and the concentration change rate of the i ions in the recipient chamber can be evaluated from the intercept and the slope of the linear regression line as given in table 2 the numerical solution of the advection dispersion model in laplace domain eq 8 can be easily achieved by de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 the results show that the evolution of the tracer concentration in the recipient chamber would depend on v c e d e and ε ts r eq 12 these parameters could simultaneously be evaluated by fitting the numerical solution cr to the measured data of the breakthrough curve the de values deduced from the advection dispersion model are listed in table 2 as de the methodology for detailed analysis of the experimental results can be found in the companion paper meng et al 2019 according to earlier data reported by skagius and neretnieks skagius 1986 skagius and neretnieks 1983 the effective diffusion coefficient of i in granites and gneisses is in the range of 1 10 14 m2 s to 7 10 13 m2 s the calculated de data both from the traditional method with eq 3 and the newly developed advection dispersion model are in good agreement with the data reported in literature compared with the electromigration data reported in andré et al 2009 work in which only 1 5 h was needed to break through a 15 mm length rock sample under the potential gradient of 200 v m the breakthrough time obtained in our experiment was much longer andré et al 2009 used 0 01 m nai as the tracer and 0 99 m kcl as the background electrolyte and the de of i obtained using ideal plug flow model was 4 0 10 13 m2 s which is 5 times larger than the value estimated from our work the inconsistence between these experimental results may come from the different physical properties of the rock sample andré et al 2009 did not show the porosities and the compositions of the rock sample used in their work however the properties of the rock sample are expected to have a significant effect on the experimental results 3 4 electromigration with na2seo3 the same rock sample used for the electromigration tests of nai was also tested for na2seo3 as a tracer under the same experimental conditions the original concentration of na2seo3 in the source chamber was also 0 1 m the same voltage as in the nai tests either 2 v or 4 v was applied over the rock sample in the recipient chamber the concentration of se was followed for about 2 days the breakthrough curves as a function of experimental time recorded by the potentiostat are shown in fig 6 the breakthrough time and the slope data deduced from the linear regression line as well as the de values calculated from eq 3 and the advection dispersion model are given in table 3 the de values calculated by both methods are in the magnitude of 10 14 m2 s in consistent with the recommended values of se in granite ohlsson and neretniks 1997 more importantly we observed in figs 6 and 7 that for both tracer ions a clear breakthrough time can be identified from the measured breakthrough curve itself before the breakthrough time the concentration of tracer ions in the recipient chamber remained apparently at the background level this indicates that the electromigration device was in a good condition of tightness and thus all the tracer ions have migrated through the rock sample by the connective pore network in addition comparison of the experimental results also showed a larger breakthrough time and a smaller increase in the rate of the concentration change in the recipient chamber when 2 v was applied over the rock sample instead of 4 v in both i and se iv experiments as a conclusion it can be stated that the updated device of electromigration worked well and that the experimental results can be used confidently to determine the diffusion and sorption properties of the tracer ions however it is noted especially in fig 7 that the measured breakthrough curve shows a clear curvature at the moment around the breakthrough time which is certainly overestimated by the ideal plug flow model this signifies actually that dispersion has played a non negligible role in the ionic transport through the rock sample as a consequence application of the ideal plug flow model for parameter identification can be problematic because it ignores the effect of dispersion and uses only a small portion of the late time experimental results in some cases the selection of the experimental data for linear regression itself also causes trouble because no clear rule can be followed 3 5 current data fig 7 shows one of the examples of current evolution during the electromigration experiments it is obvious that the current going through the rock sample was changing all the time this is caused by the variation of the ion distribution inside the rock sample so that the resistances of the rock sample and the two filters are varying all the time without a potential controlling system the inconstant voltage over the rock sample would make the experimental results difficult to interpret the current data provided by the potentiostat is also valuable when we try to analyse the ion distribution and diffusion behaviour inside the rock sample the interpretation of the current data requires consideration of the electric flux of the ions the chemical and electrical reactions the individual movement of the ionic species etc which means that a reactive transport model should be developed for the interpretation of the results it should take into account not only the effects of electromigration electroosmosis and dispersion but also the effects of aqueous chemistry i e the interactions between the tracer ions and the background electrolytes and the mineral surfaces only by this reactive transport model could the current data shown in fig 7 be properly interpreted in our companion paper meng et al 2019 a reactive transport model was preliminarily developed using the phreeqc module of electromigration 4 discussions one of the key problems of performing electromigration experiments is the controlling of the voltage over the rock sample in this work we introduced a potentiostat to solve the problem by using the four electrode function of the potentiostat the voltage over the rock sample can be adjusted automatically and controlled constantly 0 01 v at the set value as a result the experimental errors were significantly reduced in our work compared with the electromigration results reported in literature andré et al 2009a löfgren et al 2009 löfgren and neretnieks 2006 the breakthrough curves as well as the de values obtained from the new designed electromigration device are more stable since our main purpose is to estimate the diffusion and sorption properties of the tracers in low porous intact granitic rock it is preferable first to develop an advection dispersion model that account for the most important mechanisms governing ionic transport but ignores the effect of aqueous chemistry the advection dispersion model developed in this work avoids the use of many unrealistic assumptions associated with the ideal plug flow model and succeeds to give reliable results with small uncertainties the ideal plug flow model should only be used to define the lower and upper bounds of the corresponding parameters like de values for more accurate analyses of the experimental results the advection dispersion model is recommended one example showing the difference of the two models is given in fig 8 the ideal plug flow model simply makes a linear regression of the data at which a steady state seems to be achieved after the breakthrough time the intercept of the regression line with the time axis gives an estimate of the advection time which was assumed to be the breakthrough time the slope of the regression line gives an estimate of the rate of the concentration change in the recipient chamber this method gives a quick but rough estimate of the parameters with large uncertainties the advection dispersion model analyses the whole breakthrough curve instead and more factors that could affect the results can be taken into account by fitting the breakthrough curve obtained from the electromigration experiments with a non linear least square algorithm in the batch sorption experiments se iv ions are considered to be slightly sorbing onto mineral surfaces the batch sorption experiments performed by li et al 2018 gave the kd values of se iv sorption onto crushed grimsel granodiorite being in the range of 1 7 4 0 10 3 m3 kg when se iv concentration ranged from 10 6 mol l to 10 3 mol l in low saline groundwater simulant however our analysis of advection dispersion modelling showed that both i and se iv ions are effectively non sorbing in the intact rock sample investigated in the experimental conditions the retardation factor calculated from the models are always equal to one and the assumption of i and se iv as sorbing species will make the curvature of the simulated breakthrough curves deviate clearly from the obtained experimental data this result is reasonable considering that the kd values reported by li et al 2018 were obtained from batch sorption experiments with crushed minerals the crushing process of the mineral will significantly increase the specific surface area of the mineral sample and give an access to the isolated pore and new surfaces inside the minerals if the kd values from the work of li et al 2018 are corrected with specific surface area as they pointed out in their work already the kd values would be in the range of 1 3 3 2 10 5 m3 kg since the values are very small selenite can be regarded as a slightly sorbing ion on intact rock samples however considering the nuclear waste repository that is hundreds of square meters scale and the existence of high sorptive clay minerals at the fracture surfaces in bedrock the retardation of the se or i still can not be neglected in the whole concept one of the advantages of electromigration experiments compared with traditional batch sorption experiments is that kd values of intact rock samples can be deduced and used directly in the safety assessment of a nuclear waste repository to use the kd values from batch sorption experiments an upscaling factor must be developed to convert the results of batch sorption experiments to use the batch kd values for the safety assessments of a nuclear waste repository in practice it has been shown that the variations of the upscaling factors are rather high which reduces the applicability of the upscaling method puukko et al 2018 in future more work should be done for the sorption studies with electromigration method taking into account factors like composition of the rock sample properties of the tracer ions and the salinity of the background electrolyte the main composition of the rock sample used in this work is quartz monzodiorite as we presented in section 2 1 on the site where the sample was taken the most dominant minerals in the sealed and open fractures are calcite chlorite and quartz the minerals that can sorb selenium effectively such as kaolinite and biotite are not present more sorption may be observed if sorptive minerals are present in the composition of the studied rock samples the diffusion of i compared to that of se iv ions is 2 or 3 times faster in the intact rock sample investigated this result is in consistent with the diffusion coefficients of them in aqueous solutions in the condition of infinite dilution the diffusion coefficient of i is 2 048 10 9 m2 s while that of selenate is 1 008 10 9 m2 s crc press 2018 the slow diffusion of se iv ions is attributed to its unsymmetrical dimensions and larger interaction with water molecules in aqueous solutions the effective hydrated radius of i was reported to be 0 331 nm yu and neretnieks 1997 while the geometrical structure of seo3 2 is more complicated since it is an oxoseleno anion the study of eklund 2014 by laxs measurements suggested that the seo bond distance in the hydrated ion is 1 709 å the ow ow distance in bulk water is 2873 å outside of the bound oxygens the proximal se ow distance is 3 87 å for distal se ow outside of the lone electron pair the distance is 4 36 å based on these data the schematic figure of hydrated seo3 2 and i ions calculated by molecular modelling in water media is shown in fig 9 the calculation was performed by evaluating the optimized structures of seo3 2 h2o 10 and i h2o 9 ions using castep i e cambridge serial total energy package clark et al 2009 code implemented into biovia materials studio 2017 r2 it was based on solving the total electronic energy and overall electronic density distribution in order to define the energetically stable structures for ions leach 2001 according to the molecular modelling results seo3 2 are slightly larger and unsymmetrical than i which would cause delay in diffusion when it migrates through the micropores of the intact rock samples 5 conclusions in this work a new electromigration device was developed and tested by running with i and se iv ions it was found that the new electromigration device can give stable and convincing experimental results due mainly to the introduction of a potentiostat which could keep the voltage over the rock sample nearly constant during the experiments by adjusting the overall voltage applied to the whole device at the same time the ph of the background solutions was also stabilized by adding nahco3 buffer these modifications improve the stability of the experimental conditions and reduce the experimental errors significantly to facilitate interpretation of the experimental results an advection dispersion model was developed in this work it accounts for not only the dominant effect of electromigration but also the contributions of electroosmosis and dispersion on ionic transport and therefore it can provide better parameter identification with smaller uncertainties than the traditional ideal plug flow model which involves many unrealistic assumptions by interpreting the breakthrough curves with both ideal plug flow model and the advection dispersion model the experimental results with quinoxaline as tracer showed that the effect of the electroosmosis can be omitted the de values deduced for i diffusion were 8 33 3 25 10 14 m2 s from ideal plug flow model and 1 15 0 60 10 13 m2 s from advection dispersion model respectively the de values for se iv ions diffusion were 3 49 2 76 10 14 m2 s from ideal plug flow model and 3 50 0 86 10 14 m2 s from advection dispersion model respectively furthermore our analysis suggested that both i and se iv ions should be considered as non sorbing ions when transporting through the studied intact rock sample the reason why se iv ions migrate relatively slow in comparison with i is attributed mainly to its smaller effective diffusion coefficient resulting from its larger and unsymmetrical dimensions the new electromigration device and the advection dispersion model developed enable rapid estimation of the de and kd values from experimental results of the intact rock sample however further studies should be applied to justify this method as an appropriate technique for studying diffusion of radionuclides under nuclear waste repository conditions here only two sets of experimental results with applied voltages of 2 v and 4 v were available for both i and se iv ions by the updated device further improvements could be done by applying 5 or more voltages applied over the rock sample to decrease the uncertainties associated with parameter evaluation of the experimental results information about the connected pore network and rock mineralogy should also be determined using methods like x ray tomography c 14 pmma autoradiography and electron microscopy to reveal the realistic pore network in the studied rock samples the

1529,subsurface formations often contain multiple minerals with different wettability characteristics upon contact with nonaqueous phase liquids napls constitutive relationships between microstructure heterogeneity and napl fate and transport in these formations are difficult to predict several studies have used pore scale network models with faithful representations of rock pore space topology to predict macroscopic descriptors of two phase flow however wettability is usually considered as a spatially random variable this study attempts to overcome this limitation by considering more realistic representations of rock mineralogy and wettability in these models this is especially important for heterogeneous rocks where properties vary at the pore scale the work was carried out in two phases first pore fluid occupancy maps during waterflooding were obtained by x ray microtomography to elucidate the impact of pore wall mineralogy and wettability on water preferential flow paths and napl trapping within a heterogeneous aquifer sandstone arkose then microtomography images of the rock were used to generate a hybrid pore network model pnm that incorporated both pore space topology and pore wall mineralogy in situ contact angles ca measured on the surface of different minerals were assigned to the network on a pore by pore basis to describe the exact wettability distribution of the rock pore by pore model the equivalent network was used as input in a quasi static flow model to simulate waterflooding and the predictions of residual napl saturation and relative permeabilities were compared against their experimental counterparts to examine the sensitivity of the model to the underlying fluid solid interactions we also used traditional methods of wettability characterization in the input data and assigned them randomly to the pnm wettability in this case was assessed from macroscale ca distribution of oil droplets on the surface of unpolished arkose substrates released by spontaneous imbibition of water arkose model and from pendant drop measurements on polished quartz quartz model our results revealed that the pore by pore model predicted waterflooding with the highest accuracy among all three cases the arkose model slightly overestimated napl removal whereas the quartz model failed to predict the experiments more in depth analysis of the pore by pore and arkose models showed that macroscopic transport quantities are less dependent to microstructure heterogeneity if minerals are distributed uniformly across the rock the predictions herein indicate the importance of incorporating mineralogy and wettability maps to improve the prediction capabilities of pnms especially in systems with high mineral heterogeneity where minerals are nonuniformly distributed or selective fluid mineral interactions are targeted graphical abstract unlabelled image 1 introduction the release of nonaqueous phase liquids napls such as petroleum hydrocarbons into vadose zone and groundwater is a significant environmental concern davis et al 2009 during napl infiltration through soil several natural processes result in napl mass loss these processes include the partitioning of the napl components into other phases and degradation through biochemical reactions despite this napls may still remain in the subsurface and form an immiscible liquid plume in the aquifer zone napl is variably distributed in the subsurface where it can exist in free mobile entrapped and residual forms lenhard et al 2018 improved insight into how all forms of napl are distributed in the subsurface is fundamental to developing an effective remediation strategy us epa 2004 as well as determining the potential risk to human health and the environment crc care 2015 a critical step for the remediation of an impacted site is to recover the bulk of napl through appropriate techniques waterflooding or flushing processes are often used as aquifer remediation or hydrocarbon recovery methods to displace the mobile napls from the subsurface bear 1972 the assessment design and implementation of such processes depend on the fundamental understanding of napl displacement mechanisms in porous media bennion et al 1996 for instance predictive numerical simulations are widely used to model napl transport at the field scale these platforms however most often require macroscopic multiphase flow properties of the subsurface formation e g relative permeability saturation data in order to solve mass balance equations for various components present in the subsurface lenhard et al 2018 such flow properties at the darcy scale are the manifestation of displacement physics at the pore scale which is controlled by fluid fluid and fluid rock interactions although much progress has been made in recent years to improve our understanding of such interactions a lack of fundamental knowledge in several key areas frequently hinders these efforts one such area is the impact of rock mineralogy and wettability on the fate and transport of napls in heterogeneous rocks huling and weaver 1991 these pore scale properties govern waterflooding processes and determine the residual napl saturation left behind that might be remediated by other techniques such as enhanced oil recovery eor surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear sequential napl skimming vacuum enhanced recovery and water table drawdown mercer and cohen 1990 essaid et al 2015 sookhak lari et al 2018 in some cases where complete napl remediation may not be possible in reasonable time periods and costs natural attenuation of the residual napl may be recommended provided public health and environmental risks are acceptable it is now well believed that napls at residual and entrapped saturations rapidly undergo methanogenesis resulting in biofilm formation at the surface of the grains and also bubble formation inside the pores since napls are multi component fluids compositional changes due to volatilization and dissolution significantly affect the fluid properties such as interfacial tension and viscosity and wetting characteristics of porous media lekmine et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2018b and 2019 that is to say that the longer napl remains in the subsurface the more difficult the assessment of complete remediation becomes nevertheless the heterogeneous nature of subsurface rocks in terms of pore space topology mineralogy and wettability further complicates any initial attempt to determine the post waterflood entrapped and residual napl at multiple scales which is key to develop master strategies for long term napl remediation wettability is defined as the tendency of one fluid to spread over and adhesively coat a solid surface in the presence of another fluid and is commonly expressed in terms of the advancing contact angle ca at the napl water mineral interface cassie and baxter 1944 although most minerals are naturally water wet the adsorption of surface active constituents in napl may alter their wettability to neutral or napl wet buckley 1998 the polarizable fraction of napl is often referred to as asphaltenes and consists primarily of a polydisperse mixture of molecules with different molecular weight aromaticity and heteroatom content such as oxygen nitrogen and sulfur groenzin and mullins 2000 as a result they interact differently with minerals in sandstones quartz with abundant silanol groups can form hydrogen bonds with some electronegative heteroatoms of asphaltenes and promote their adsorption in carbonates where the majority of minerals consist of calcite and or dolomite calcium ions are able to strongly bond with acidic components of asphaltenes especially at ph conditions below 9 5 when the mineral surface charge is positive morrow et al 1973 different techniques have been used in the past to characterize wettability amott 1959 dickson et al 2006 chiquet et al 2007 chalbaud et al 2009 espinoza and santamarina 2010 the most common ones consist of measuring macroscale or apparent static or dynamic contact angles on the surface of mineral substrates using rising captive bubble techniques lee et al 2003 for example smooth quartz substrates were used to represent the mineralogy of sandstones yu and buckley 1997 whereas polished marble and calcite substrates acted as proxies for carbonates leslie zhang et al 2006 sharma and mohanty 2013 in most cases substrates were cleaned pre equilibrated with brine and then aged in napl saraji et al 2013 recent studies used rock samples as substrates to better represent their properties mirchi et al 2015 the impact of water films initially adsorbed on the mineral surfaces prior to aging in napl has been taken into consideration by establishing an initial water saturation in the substrates alotaibi et al 2010 to preserve surface roughness unpolished sandstone and carbonate substrates were also adopted javanbakht and goual 2016 after immersion in brine solutions napl inside aged substrates formed small droplets on the surface due to spontaneous imbibition of brine from which contact angle distributions were obtained qin et al 2017 goual et al 2017 the ease and reproducibility of this method has made it very attractive nonetheless it is not clear if its accuracy represents the intrinsic wettability inside pores which depends on pore geometry mineralogy wall roughness and initial water saturation recent developments in high resolution pore scale imaging of immiscible fluids in three dimensional 3d porous media allowed in situ measurements of microscale quantities such as pore fluid occupancies through which cas were measured on the pore walls matthew andrew et al 2014 khishvand et al 2016a among these methods micro computed tomography is emerging as the technique of choice because it is non invasive and can achieve micron resolution iglauer et al 2010 kazmouz et al 2016 javanbakht et al 2017 arshadi et al 2018a in situ contact angles in sandstones bead packs and limestone have been measured manually on images of the plane perpendicular to the three phase contact line khishvand et al 2016b lv et al 2016 arshadi et al 2018b an automated algorithm was developed to measure extensive in situ contact angles from x ray microtomography images allowing researchers to obtain statistically more representative distributions alratrout et al 2017 this approach was successfully applied to homogeneous rocks however subsurface formations may contain different levels of heterogeneity in terms of pore space and mineralogy the latter results in local variation of rock wettability characteristics which in turn impacts the pore scale displacement and hence multiphase transport properties of napl in porous media in other words different minerals found in heterogeneous rocks have their own wetting preferences and napls such as crude oils may alter their wettability to a non uniformly wet state kumar et al 2010 recent micro ct studies on a heterogeneous aquifer rock revealed significant differences in wetting behaviors of quartz and carbonate calcite and dolomite after contact with napl confirming that wettability is a microscopic property of the rock that is heterogeneous at the pore scale javanbakht et al 2017 local variations in rock wettability further impacted the pore scale displacements of napl and the residual saturation left in the rock after waterflooding for instance removing contaminants especially dense nonaqueous phase liquids such as asphaltenes from the surface of napl wet minerals was more difficult than on mixed or water wet ones such preferences in pore scale displacements resulted in complex patterns of bypassing segmentation and trapping of napl by water according to three dimensional distribution of minerals within the rock javanbakht et al 2017 although recent advances in x ray tomography have paved the way to understanding these complexities they remain challenging costly and time consuming endeavors therefore it is important to develop reliable modeling tools that are capable of predicting microscale phenomena occurring in these systems several studies have used pore scale network modeling techniques with realistic representations of rock pore space topology to investigate the effect of wettability on the pore scale displacements and macroscopic descriptors of two phase flow e g relative permeability capillary pressure and residual fluid saturations piri and blunt 2005a sahimi 2011 gharbi and blunt 2012 wopara and iyuke 2018 pore networks provide a practical description of the porous media to model multiphase fluid flow by incorporating physically based displacement mechanisms at the pore scale dong and blunt 2009 aghaei and piri 2015 in most studies the extracted pore network model epnm retains important geometrical features of the pore space topologies affecting fluid flow behavior scheidegger 1958 however since rock mineralogy is not explicitly known in these models wettability is usually considered as a spatially random variable more specifically macroscale cas are used in the flow models as input with uniform or normal distributions these parameters inform the flow models about the underlying solid fluid interaction physics which in turn have direct impacts on the sequence of pore scale displacements and transport properties of the continuum blunt 1998 this approach has a major limitation in heterogeneous rocks where the spatial variation of mineralogy results in local variation of wettability distribution javanbakht et al 2017 this issue is more of a concern when selective surface fluid interaction characterization is required in reactive transport processes recently pore scale heterogeneity in reactive surface area of minerals within a berea sandstone miniature core was quantified in 3d using an x ray micro ct lai and krevor 2014 the volumetric and statistical information obtained from this work could be used in statistically based models of reactive transport or modeling field scale reaction rates direct pore scale simulations techniques such as the lattice boltzmann method lbm were also used to study the effect of wettability heterogeneity different napl wet solid fractions on residual trapping and relative permeability of two and three phase flow in porous media mohammadmoradi and kantzas 2016 2017 zhao et al 2018 although direct methods simulate fluid flow in real pore structures with irregular fluid solid boundaries and deformable fluid fluid interfaces at the mesoscopic scale they become computationally expensive at the core scale pore network models pnm on the other hand can overcome these limitations and are readily scalable to handle larger size rocks where heterogeneities are better captured despite this fact mineral heterogeneity has never been explicitly incorporated into pnms to improve their prediction capabilities in real reservoir rocks to our best knowledge the goal of this study was to address this limitation by considering more realistic representations of rock mineralogy and wettability in pore network models to this aim we developed a novel platform to incorporate mineralogy and wettability maps of a contaminated heterogeneous aquifer rock arkose into a quasi static pnm to improve its prediction of napl displacement during primary drainage and waterflooding in this model in situ cas determined from micro ct core flooding experiments on the same rock were assigned to the network on a pore by pore basis to describe the exact wettability distribution of the rock and generate a hybrid pore network that incorporated both pore space topology and mineral heterogeneity the pore by pore model predictions of napl pore occupancy cluster sizes residual fluid saturation and relative permeabilities were then validated against the core flooding experimental data to examine the sensitivity of the model to wettability we randomly input macroscale ca data obtained on napl aged quartz and arkose substrates hereafter referred to as quartz and arkose models and compared the predictions to those from the pore by pore model pore scale physics of displacements were used to explain the trends obtained from each wettability model emphasizing the importance of incorporating mineral heterogeneity to improve the prediction capabilities of physically based pnms novel insights developed from this study could be used to reduce uncertainties in the design and implementation of aquifer remediation processes and when the performance of petroleum reservoirs is predicted using continuum scale simulation tools 2 experimental methods 2 1 rocks several blocks of heterogeneous rock were obtained from the arkose layer of fountain formation located in east colorado and wyoming from which a 38 mm diameter core plug was drilled this formation is a heterogeneous pennsylvanian sedimentary rock consisting primarily of conglomerate sandstone or arkose fountain sediments mostly formed from the sherman granite which is an igneous formation after drying at 110 c for 24 h and cooling down to room temperature the porosity and klinkenberg corrected air permeability of the core plug were measured by using a helium porosimeter permeameter apparatus ap 608 coretest system yielding values of 17 06 and 12 47 md respectively a miniature core sample 5 mm in diameter and 47 mm in length was then drilled from the mother core plug to be used in the core flooding experiments the porosity of the miniature core sample was calculated to be 10 45 from the micro ct images the difference in porosity values was attributed to the heterogeneity of the arkose rock in terms of pore space topology and mineralogy e g clay content and limitation of the micro ct scanner in detecting the sub micron porosity within the clay cement the absolute brine permeability of the miniature core was measured to be 14 09 md by recording the pressure drop responses to different brine flow rates 2 2 quantitative evaluation of minerals the mineralogy of arkose rock was determined by using qemscan 650f manufactured by fei now thermo fisher scientific usa qemscan creates phase assemblage maps of a specimen surface scanned by a high energy accelerated electron beam along a predefined raster scan pattern low count energy dispersive x ray spectra edx are generated and provide information on the elemental composition at each measurement point the elemental composition in combination with back scattered electron bse brightness and x ray count rate information is converted into mineral phases gottlieb et al 2000 in our study the x ray source was optimized at 25 kv and 6 2 na and a species identification protocol was used to convert the raw data to a 3 0 3 0 mm mineralogy map with a resolution of 0 73 μm per pixel the arkose sample contained 60 5 quartz 27 9 carbonate 6 6 feldspar and a small fraction of other minerals such as kaolinite illite albite pyrite etc as shown in fig 1 qemscan results were further used during the segmentation of micro ct images to better identify and quantify the major minerals present in the miniature core sample 2 3 fluids gibbs crude oil from minnelusa formation in wyoming was selected as the napl phase and contained 10 2 of c7 asphaltenes the oil was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for one hour and filtered through a 0 5 μm filter paper to remove connate water and possible debris respectively qin et al 2018 the brine consisted of 1 m cacl2 in distilled deionized water the procedure used for the selection of this salinity is explained in our previous study javanbakht and goual 2016 sodium iodine 7 wt nai was added to the brine to enhance the contrast between brine and napl phases in the micro ct images the density and viscosity of napl and brine at ambient conditions i e 23 c and 14 7 psia are 0 91 g ml 1 09 g ml and 82 4 mpa s 1 32 mpa s respectively 2 4 interfacial tension and macroscale contact angles the interfacial tension between napl and brine was measured to be 20 7 mn m using the pendant drop technique saraji et al 2013 the needle diameter was 1 762 mm to have a bond number close to unity the images of napl droplets were analyzed by the axisymmetric drop shape analysis adsa saad and neumann 2016 to characterize the wettability of arkose rock before the drainage process contact angles were measured on a rock substrate that was initially vacuumed at 10 7 psi for 12 h then fully saturated with brine after transfer to a glass cuvette a napl droplet was carefully injected to the surface of the substrate after 4 h the droplet image was captured and analyzed using angle tool module in imagej software to obtain the contact angle to characterize the wettability of the rock after primary drainage another arkose substrate was vacuumed at 10 7 psi for 12 h and saturated with napl after aging in napl at ambient conditions for 24 h it was transferred to the cuvette and immersed in brine the napl inside the substrate was released by spontaneous imbibition of brine and formed several droplets on the surface of the rock the contact angles of these droplets were then measured using the same method and a distribution curve was plotted since most sandstone rocks are often considered to be composed primarily of quartz we repeated the previous measurement on a polished quartz substrate from spi supplies to clean the sample from any possible contamination it was sonicated in sulfuric acid solution containing 10 nocromix for one hour and then soaked in acid overnight after being thoroughly washed by distilled water and boiled for 4 h the quartz substrate was then rinsed in fresh distilled water and dried by ultrahigh purity nitrogen the clean substrate was immersed in napl at ambient condition upon aging in napl for 24 h the substrate was transferred to the glass cuvette and immersed in brine the oil on the surface of the substrate formed few small oil droplets whose images were captured after 24 h and analyzed by the same method 2 5 miniature core flooding experiments miniature core flooding experiments were performed using a three phase core flooding apparatus integrated with a high resolution x ray micro ct scanner fig 2a provides a schematic diagram of the experimental setup piri 2014 the sample was first placed in a custom built carbon fiber core holder and an initial confining pressure of 150 ambient pore pressure psi was applied afterward a location of interest in the middle of the core cylindrical field of view with 5 mm in diameter and 3 mm in length was scanned at a resolution of 2 18 μm per voxel to generate reference images these images were later used to segment the wet images with a modified workflow that is explained in the next section after the air inside the core sample and connected lines was replaced with co2 the sample and all the lines were vacuumed for 24 h the sample was then fully saturated with brine by injecting 10 pore volumes of the fluid and subsequently increasing the pore pressure to dissolve any remaining co2 brine absolute permeability of the medium was measured to be 14 09 md which was in line with the air permeability of the mother core plug i e 12 47 md next primary drainage was performed with a flow rate of 0 001 cc min to establish the initial brine saturation after reaching steady state approximately 24 h the process was followed by waterflooding with a brine flow rate of 0 01 cc min x ray tomography images were acquired at the exact same location of interest at the end of each flow process i e primary drainage and waterflooding the two phase flow experiments were conducted at ambient conditions i e 23 c and 14 7 psia pore pressure to represent the flow conditions in contaminated soil or aquifers fig 2b summarizes the experimental procedure followed in this study 2 6 data acquisition and image analysis the tomography projections acquired by the micro ct scanner were reconstructed using mango software middleton et al 2010 to provide raw data gray scale image the data was then imported to avizo 9 4 software scientific 2018 for further image processing and analysis in the first step we used the non local means filter to smoothen the images li et al 2014 afterward the reference image set obtained under dry condition was segmented into pore and mineralogy maps using the histogram threshold method wildenschild and sheppard 2013 which represented the pore topology and three different minerals quartz feldspar and calcite dolomite as shown in fig 3 the threshold values to separate the pore space and different mineral phases were selected through the following steps i coarse search of the threshold values by considering the intensity peak of each material from the gray scale image intensity histograms and ii interactive visual evaluation of overlapped gray scale and segmented images during fine search of the threshold values for final pixel assignment wildenschild and sheppard 2013 in the next step wet image sets acquired after primary drainage and waterflooding were aligned with the reference image set by manually moving them pixel by pixel at x y and z directions until a suitable registration was achieved the registered wet image sets were then multiplied by the pore map obtained from the reference image to eliminate the solid phase minerals this was done since doped brine had an x ray attenuation similar to that of the solid phase which could lead to poor segmentation results in the last step registered image sets were segmented to brine and napl phases by following the steps described above by combining the fluid occupancy and mineralogy maps contact angles could be measured in situ on the surface of each mineral these values were later used to describe the wettability of each pore body or pore throat based on the walls minerals surrounding that specific element in the pore network model the size distribution of napl clusters and slice averaged water saturation profiles were calculated by a statistical analysis method fig 4a presents examples of superimposed fluid occupancy and mineralogy maps from which in situ contact angles were measured locations with clear napl brine mineral interfaces such as main terminal meniscus mtm and large pores interfaces were considered the selected interfaces were monitoring in ten consecutive slides to confirm the tangent lines finally in situ contact angles were measured on the surface of the minerals toward the denser phase brine the distribution of 30 contact angle measurements on each mineral was plotted for the three minerals present in the arkose rock and is presented in fig 4b note that these values were measured during waterflooding with 1 m cacl2 since waterflooding could not restore the wettability of pore surfaces these angles also represented equilibrium values at the end of primary drainage fig 4c presents an average in situ ca distribution curve that was acquired by combining the three distributions in fig 4b using the area percentage of each mineral according to qemscan results this average contact angle distribution curve which could represent the wettability map of pore surfaces under complex test conditions including initial water saturation surface texture curvature and mineralogy is merely presented here for qualitative comparisons to the contact angle distribution obtained from the arkose substrate during spontaneous imbibition of water fig 4d e 3 modeling methods 3 1 pore network extraction after applying preprocessing filters on the micro ct images of arkose rock a segmentation tool i e histogram thresholding was applied to divide the images to solid and pore space a 3 mm cubical sub volume of the binary images 0 for solid and 1 for pore space was then used as input for the pore network extraction algorithm pore networks which are simplified geometrical representation of pore space dong and blunt 2009 raeini et al 2017 provide practical descriptions of porous media to simulate multi phase fluid flow at the pore scale piri and blunt 2005a valvatne et al 2005 aghaei and piri 2015 the extracted network should retain important geometrical and topological features of the pore space in the form of pore bodies connected through pore throats in order to construct a representative pore network model for the heterogeneous and anisotropic arkose rock we extracted a network that preserved not only the geometrical and topological properties but also thermodynamically equivalent transport properties underlying mayer and stowe princen ms p theory mayer and stowe 1965 princen 1970 more specifically we examined local and global morphology from the binary images then used a pore network extraction algorithm based on graph theory using data driven decision making concepts gesho et al 2014 we utilized modern data driven decision making concepts xie and yan 2008 e g data analytics big data pattern recognition and multi layered network analysis to extract equivalent pore networks from complex datasets with mineral heterogeneity and local anisotropy this approach was previously validated for various heterogeneous outcrop and reservoir rock samples gesho et al 2016 the extracted pore network model epnm shown in

sample quartz 60 5 carbonate 27 9 and feldspar 6 6 according to fig 1 this order of abundance was used as a guideline to identify the minerals segmented from the micro ct images based on their intensity peaks and threshold values fig 3 the solid phase in these images contained 71 quartz 22 2 carbonate and 4 5 feldspar note that 2 3 clay cement was also segmented from the solid phase in the micro ct images and directly assigned to the pore network elements on a pore by pore basis knowing their coordinate in the images the labeled images quartz carbonate and feldspar were then superimposed with the epnm and the mineralogy of the walls for each pore body and pore throat was determined the distributions of contact angles measured in situ on the surface of each mineral were assigned to the epnm to generate the final hybrid pore network model hpnm if a pore body or pore throat was in contact with two or more types of minerals mineral area weighted average of corresponding cas was calculated and assigned to the element fig 5 presents the wettability map of the hpnm used to simulate the waterflooding process it is worth noting that the ca distributions fig 4b were used to assess wettability of each mineral meaning that the pore wall roughness has been considered 3 3 flow model after generating the representative hpnm pore network combined with mineralogy map the primary drainage and waterflooding processes were predicted using a modified quasi static pore network flow model developed by piri and blunt piri and blunt 2005a the model has been previously validated by comparing model predictions of two and three phase flow through naturally occurring porous media against their experimental counterparts piri and blunt 2005b the quasi static model considers capillary forces to determine the sequence of displacements within the medium and is limited to processes with low capillary numbers this model however is capable of modeling two and three phase flow in napl wet media considering napl sandwiched layers since the primary drainage and waterflooding processes were performed with very low flow rates and the medium experienced significant wettability alteration from strongly water wet to weakly napl wet we selected the quasi static model to predict the displacement processes performed during the experiments piston like snap off and pore body filling displacement mechanisms are reflected in the model the flow model considers circular triangular and rectangular shaped cross section pores depending on the geometrical features of elements provided by the epnm in addition the corner interface between wetting and non wetting phases is adjusted based on changes in local capillary pressure a series of pore scale fluid fluid displacements were carried out in the pore network to simulate the flow eq 1 describes the young laplace equation to calculate the threshold capillary pressure of an idealized circular cross section pore element as can be seen from this equation displacement is a function of pore radius contact angle and napl brine interfacial tension displacement occurs once capillary pressure eq 2 reaches to the threshold value of the pore throat element after each displacement new displacements are added to the list based on the accessibility of the fluid phases to each other all the available displacements will be prioritized and eventually the most favorable ones occur additional details of the model could be found elsewhere piri and blunt 2005a note that the processing time for one full set of simulation primary drainage and waterflooding was 24 h 1 p c th 2 σcos θ ow r where pc th σ θow and r are threshold capillary pressure interfacial tension napl water contact angle and pore radius respectively 2 p c p nw p w where pc pnw and pw are capillary pressure non wetting phase pressure and wetting phase pressure respectively 4 experimental results 4 1 representative elementary volume rev rev is the smallest volume over which a measurement can be made that will yield a value representative of the whole sample hill 1963 to ensure that the scanned field of view fov is larger than porosity and mineralogy based rev the porosity and mineral fractions of several cubical sub volumes with different lengths from 0 1 to 3 0 mm were analyzed fig 7 presents the variation of porosity and mineralogy with changes in the size of sub volumes porosity and mineral percentages became constant once the length of the cubical sub volume was larger than 1 5 and 2 0 mm respectively therefore the porosity and mineralogy based revs are smaller than the fov furthermore it has been reported that the permeability based rev in heterogeneous systems could be up to twice as large as porosity based rev i e 3 mm cubical sub volume mostaghimi et al 2013 this indicates that the experimental values obtained from fov i e porosity mineral composition and saturation and the model predictions of the 3 mm cubical sub volume e g relative permeabilities can represent the overall properties of the core sample 4 2 primary drainage the water saturation profile along the length of fov at the end of primary drainage is shown in fig 8a where an average initial water saturation swi of 24 was established effective napl permeability at swi was measured to be 8 3 md one should note that pc s data were not measured during the experiments and simulation observation comparisons are presented only for fluid saturation profiles and kr s data since the medium was initially water wet pore scale piston like displacements started from larger pores and gradually filled up the smaller elements lenormand et al 1988 the water wet characteristics of the medium prior to primary drainage was previously confirmed by measuring napl water contact angles on a non aged arkose rock which yield an average value of 41 since napl contained 10 wt of asphaltenes the pore surfaces experienced wettability alteration at the end of primary drainage the wetting behaviors of these surfaces were first characterized by using a smooth quartz substrate and an arkose rock substrate after aging in napl for 24 h the quartz substrate was water wet with an average contact angle of 56 the smooth quartz surface was homogeneous with respect to mineralogy and surface texture thereby exhibited consistent contact angle values with a standard deviation of 2 in contrast to pure quartz the wettability of arkose substrate was altered from water wet to neutral wet with an average contact angle alteration from 41 to 90 as shown in fig 4e a closer examination of this figure showed a bi modal distribution of cas the largest one was mainly water wet or neutral wet with cas varying from 40 to 110 these non napl wet surfaces presented the dominant minerals with lower propensity to interact with asphaltenes like quartz and feldspar the smallest angle distribution represented areas of the surface that were further altered to napl wet with cas up to 140 this could be attributed to the strong adsorption of asphaltene polar components onto calcite and dolomite which contributed 27 9 to the total minerals of arkose the rougher mineral surfaces curbed the movement of the three phase contact line and made it harder for water to push the napl layer on the surface thereby contributing to the more napl wet states of napl aged arkose compared to the smooth quartz in situ wettability distributions on different minerals were later measured using the advanced microtomography technique fig 4b revealed that different minerals exhibited different wettability at the end of primary drainage carbonates including calcite and dolomite showed the highest wettability alteration after contacting with napl with an average ca of 120 on the other hand quartz and feldspar remained water wet with an average ca of 65 and 85 respectively to better compare the two wettability models i e arkose and pore by pore an area weighted average in situ contact angle curve was plotted in fig 4c in this figure a large fraction of pore elements was water wet or neutral wet and a smaller portion was napl wet which was in good agreement with the arkose model however the majority of pore surfaces were weakly water wet with an average in situ ca of 70 in contrast to 90 measured by spontaneous imbibition in arkose substrate this is because mineral surfaces inside the pores tended to be more water wet compared to aged substrate surfaces due to the existence of initial water saturation zhou et al 2000 which curbed the interaction between mineral surfaces and napl furthermore differences in the shape of both curves indicated that mineralogy on the surface of arkose substrate was slightly different from that inside the pores 4 3 waterflooding primary drainage was followed by waterflooding to displace napl from the medium slice averaged water saturation profiles revealed that the average residual napl saturation snr at the end of this process was 49 fig 8b this indicated that a large quantity of napl remained within the rock which could not be recovered by waterflooding the effective water permeability at snr was also measured to be 0 8 md in our study we used a brine flow rate of 0 01 cc min capillary number 6 7 10 7 to ensure that displacements were under capillary dominated regime this also implied that saturation profiles within the fov presented in fig 8b were not dependent on the location of the fov along the length of the core this was due to the low flow rate of brine and insignificant viscous pressure drop of displacements since flow was capillary dominated wettability had a significant impact on the magnitude of the threshold capillary pressure and hence the sequence of displacements quartz and feldspar grains were mostly weakly water wet whereas calcite and dolomite were neutral and weakly napl wet since the majority of pore walls within the rock were silicates imbibition of water through competition of snap off and piston like displacements governed the napl recovery in this category of pores napl clusters at the center of the pores became disconnected from the rest of the ganglia and could not be recovered by waterflooding once they lost their hydraulic connectivity it is worth mentioning that the contribution of snap off and hence trapping increased as the contact angle reduced toward zero strongly water wet blunt 1998 for instance snap off in throats made of quartz increased the chance of napl clusters being segmented during waterflooding this could in turn result in significant quantities of napl being left within the medium this phenomenon may occur to a higher extent in tight rocks such as arkose with high pore throat aspect ratios tanino and blunt 2012 in pores surrounded by calcite dolomite grains drainage through piston like displacement dominated the waterflooding process napl layers on the surface of these grains however may not maintain their connectivity across the rock due to their minor contribution to the rock minerals we must note that when pore surfaces became napl wet it was harder for water to invade into the pore due to the negative threshold capillary pressure of displacement as a result water tended to bypass these pores leaving napl trapped within the medium fig 9 shows that water mainly displaced napl from pores surrounded by quartz water wet walls whereas napl contained in calcite dolomite pores was bypassed due to the napl wet nature of these minerals this is a direct evidence of the impact of local mineralogy and wettability on pore scale displacement of napl in arkose rock in other words mineral heterogeneity and local variation of wettability have profound effects on the dominant flow and bypass paths within the arkose rock this suggests that extreme caution must be used with pore network models to predict multi phase flow in heterogeneous media pore scale displacement events captured in our micro ct images conformed with microscopic flow behaviors in mixed wet porous media presented elsewhere valvatne and blunt 2004 5 modeling results 5 1 model validation in this section we validated our model by comparing its predictions to the experimental measurements starting from basic properties the calculated porosity from the pore network model was 10 45 which was identical to the one measured by micro ct the model also predicted an absolute permeability of 12 9 md which was comparable to the value measured experimentally i e 12 14 md the pore throat size distribution contribution of coordination number and pore throat aspect ratio of the network model were presented in fig 6 elements with a radius ranging from 10 to 20 μm had the highest volume contribution to the pore space this was consistent with the experimental measurements of arkose rock reported earlier javanbakht et al 2017 relatively high pore throat aspect ratio of the medium fig 6c could further increase the chance of napl entrapment due to snap off in the pore throat junctions furthermore the primary drainage process was simulated utilizing the initially water wet pore network with an average ca of 41 and the relative permeability end points swi and krn at swi were compared against their experimental counterparts the model predicted swi and krn at swi to be 25 and 0 6 respectively which matched the experimental measurements i e 24 and 0 59 fig 8a compared the predicted saturation profile at the end of primary drainage with the in situ measurements and showed that both are in good agreement 5 2 waterflooding prediction and discussion after validating the pore network model the primary drainage was followed by waterflooding simulations in order to investigate the sensitivity of the model predictions to wettability three scenarios were created using the same pore network and primary drainage conditions the first scenario was designed by considering the exact mineralogy of the arkose rock and in situ contact angle distributions measured from the micro ct images this was the most accurate wettability characterization pore by pore model which accounted for spatial variations of mineralogy pore wall roughness and the presence of initial water saturation thus the ca data in fig 4b were assigned to the pore network on a pore by pore basis note that the majority of the pores had an in situ ca of 70 based on fig 4c the second scenario utilized the contact angle distribution measured on arkose substrate after spontaneous imbibition arkose model this model considered the rock surface roughness and mineralogy to some extent whereas compared to in situ measurements it overestimated the wettability due to the absence of initial water saturation average ca was 90 the wettability distribution in fig 4e was randomly assigned to the pore network in the last scenario the contact angle distribution on polished quartz substrate was used quartz model which did not consider mineral heterogeneity pore wall roughness and the presence of initial water saturation this method demonstrated strongly to weakly water wet characteristics with an average contact angle of 56 the smooth surface of quartz resulted in a very narrow standard deviation 2 meaning that the pore network was uniformly water wet fig 11 presents the relative permeability curves predicted by the model for the primary drainage and three waterflooding scenarios experimental end point relative permeability measurements were also included in this figure for comparison the predicted primary drainage endpoint swi and krn at swi was almost identical to the one measured during the micro ct experiments the waterflooding predictions however differed depending on the wettability model at a first glance the pore by pore model predicted the residual napl saturation more accurately than the other two wettability models i e 45 compared to the experimental value of 49 arkose model underestimated this value 38 whereas the quartz model overestimated snr significantly i e 71 as stated earlier wettability had a significant impact on the threshold capillary pressure and hence pore scale displacements within the pore network this impact can be seen not only from the end point saturations but also from the shape of the napl relative permeability curves during waterflooding the variation of contact angle could highly affect the pattern of napl phase segmentation and entrapment during the waterflooding as also observed in the experiments fig 9 under strongly water wet conditions there are two mechanisms for napl entrapment snap off and bypassing for contact angles toward 0 snap off dominates the trapping while piston like displacement is less favored this behavior may justify the significantly high residual napl saturation i e 71 obtained using the quartz substrate as it has the lowest average contact angle among the three tested cases the sharp reduction in napl relative permeability indicated that large clusters of napl were segmented at early time due to snap off mechanism and remained stranded within the network the high pore throat aspect ratio of the arkose rock fig 6c may have also contributed to the snap off trapping tanino and blunt 2012 as the contact angle increased toward weakly water wet the frequency of piston like displacements increased compared to that of snap off meaning that bypassing dominated entrapment this reduced the chance of large napl clusters to become disconnected at early time piston like advancement nucleated from mtm interfaces of water filled pores after primary drainage as well as water from the entrance of the medium and displaced the napl phase through a uniform pattern leading to a higher napl recovery blunt 1998 our model predictions using the pore by pore wettability model was in line with this behavior the residual napl saturation decreased to 45 as the average contact angle increased toward 70 entrapment through bypassing was mainly controlled by the size connectivity and wettability of pore elements for instance the napls residing within napl wet pores particularly those between calcite dolomite grains were bypassed given the fact that the majority of the network elements i e 72 made of quartz feldspar were weakly water wet fig 10 depicts the cumulative contribution of trapped napl blobs at the end of waterflooding in both experiment and model relatively large napl clusters were trapped within the pore network using the quartz model due to frequent snap off events the pore by pore model improved the predictions of trapped cluster sizes by shifting the corresponding plot to the left and producing a similar trend to that of the experiments this indicated the formation of smaller trapped napl clusters due to the increasing contribution of piston like displacements compared to snap off as the average contact angle further increased toward 90 arkose model the predicted residual napl saturation was the lowest i e 38 due to the increasing contribution of nucleated wetting and non wetting advance mechanisms this is in line with previous findings published elsewhere blunt 1998 interestingly napl relative permeabilities obtained from the arkose and pore by pore models were identical at low water saturations this could be due to the fact that the first i e easiest displacements in the network required the least water threshold pressure and invaded elements may have met this criterion according to their size and regardless of wettability fig 11b presents the water relative permeability curves during waterflooding in a logarithmic scale as expected the mobility of water in the quartz model was the lowest among all three cases this was primarily due to the high residual napl saturation and the tendency of water to invade smaller pore elements in the water wet network the mobility of water increased in the pore by pore model as the network became less water wet water permeability of the arkose model at snr was the highest among the three cases because of lower residual napl saturation and water preference to invade larger elements in the napl wet network one may note that the pore by pore model slightly underestimated the water permeability at residual napl saturation which might be due to the tight nature of the rock further investigation on the governing physics of flow through extremely tight rocks should be conducted to improve the accuracy of water permeability predictions in such systems in summary the pore by pore model predicted the residual napl saturation most accurately i e 8 error among the three models as expected the residual napl saturation determined by the arkose model was more accurate than that from the quartz model i e 22 compared to 41 error this is because the mineralogy measured on the surface of arkose substrate was relatively representative of the internal microstructure of the rock and consequently the angle distribution of the arkose model followed the same trend as the area weighted average in situ cas fig 4c e we anticipate improved predictions from the arkose model if initial water saturation in the substrate are established prior to ca measurements the failure of the quartz model to predict residual napl saturation suggests that traditional ca measurements on pure minerals and or polished rock substrates i e captive bubble sessile drop methods should be avoided when dealing with heterogeneous rocks this is primarily due to the limited number of bubbles droplets injected on local areas that may not cover all minerals present in the rock a closer examination of the saturation profiles in fig 8b revealed that both pore by pore and arkose simulations shared similar trends peaks and hills despite the fact that the cas were assigned to these models on a pore by pore and random basis respectively the trend of water relative permeabilities were also similar in these models fig 11b such similarities indicate that macroscopic displacements were mainly governed by the geometrical topological properties of the medium and average wettability rather than local mineral distribution in other words although arkose rock had a certain level of mineral heterogeneity the minerals were mostly distributed uniformly across the rev fig 7b in order to reduce the number of experiments we propose that the distribution of in situ contact angles on various rock minerals be measured for one set of fluids and used to simulate flow in multiple rock samples preferably from the same formation as long as the corresponding mineralogy and pore space topology of each sample are obtained under dry conditions in rocks where minerals are not distributed uniformly such as in agglomerates in situ wettability characterization pore by pore model is warranted in such cases direct pore to core upscaling of displacement processes is recommended by simulating transport in core size samples using parallel high performance computational methods to overcome scalability issues 6 conclusions constitutive relationships between microstructure heterogeneity and napl displacement in a contaminated aquifer rock arkose were successfully determined using x ray microtomography and pore scale network modeling micro ct imaging of waterflooding revealed that water mostly by passed the napl residing in pores with carbonate walls this was primarily due to the napl wet characteristics of calcite dolomite and the tendency of water to flow through neighboring water wet silicate pores formed within quartz feldspar grains such complex preferential flow paths determining residual napl saturation and water mobility at the pore scale were mainly governed by the frequency and distribution of minerals in the rock in order to predict this behavior micro ct images of arkose were selected to generate a hybrid pore network of the rock that was used as input in a quasi static flow model incorporating mineral heterogeneity on a pore by pore basis improved the ability of the flow model to predict residual napl saturation and relative permeabilities during waterflooding this was due to the selective characterization of solid fluid interactions by considering pore wall roughness mineral heterogeneity and the presence of initial water saturation different shapes and end points of relative permeability curves and cluster size distributions predicted with different wettability models pore by pore arkose quartz demonstrated the importance of local wettability on pore scale displacements and constitutive macroscopic transport properties of porous media the model prediction utilizing the arkose model was acceptable and could be further improved by establishing initial water saturation prior to aging with napl although this method captured the roughness and mineral heterogeneity of the substrate it may not represent the wettability of rock samples with higher levels of mineral heterogeneity and where minerals are not distributed uniformly across the medium e g agglomerates polished mineral substrates or other similar techniques such as sessile drop and captive bubble on the surface of smooth minerals are unlikely to represent the wettability characteristics of heterogeneous rocks as

1529,subsurface formations often contain multiple minerals with different wettability characteristics upon contact with nonaqueous phase liquids napls constitutive relationships between microstructure heterogeneity and napl fate and transport in these formations are difficult to predict several studies have used pore scale network models with faithful representations of rock pore space topology to predict macroscopic descriptors of two phase flow however wettability is usually considered as a spatially random variable this study attempts to overcome this limitation by considering more realistic representations of rock mineralogy and wettability in these models this is especially important for heterogeneous rocks where properties vary at the pore scale the work was carried out in two phases first pore fluid occupancy maps during waterflooding were obtained by x ray microtomography to elucidate the impact of pore wall mineralogy and wettability on water preferential flow paths and napl trapping within a heterogeneous aquifer sandstone arkose then microtomography images of the rock were used to generate a hybrid pore network model pnm that incorporated both pore space topology and pore wall mineralogy in situ contact angles ca measured on the surface of different minerals were assigned to the network on a pore by pore basis to describe the exact wettability distribution of the rock pore by pore model the equivalent network was used as input in a quasi static flow model to simulate waterflooding and the predictions of residual napl saturation and relative permeabilities were compared against their experimental counterparts to examine the sensitivity of the model to the underlying fluid solid interactions we also used traditional methods of wettability characterization in the input data and assigned them randomly to the pnm wettability in this case was assessed from macroscale ca distribution of oil droplets on the surface of unpolished arkose substrates released by spontaneous imbibition of water arkose model and from pendant drop measurements on polished quartz quartz model our results revealed that the pore by pore model predicted waterflooding with the highest accuracy among all three cases the arkose model slightly overestimated napl removal whereas the quartz model failed to predict the experiments more in depth analysis of the pore by pore and arkose models showed that macroscopic transport quantities are less dependent to microstructure heterogeneity if minerals are distributed uniformly across the rock the predictions herein indicate the importance of incorporating mineralogy and wettability maps to improve the prediction capabilities of pnms especially in systems with high mineral heterogeneity where minerals are nonuniformly distributed or selective fluid mineral interactions are targeted graphical abstract unlabelled image 1 introduction the release of nonaqueous phase liquids napls such as petroleum hydrocarbons into vadose zone and groundwater is a significant environmental concern davis et al 2009 during napl infiltration through soil several natural processes result in napl mass loss these processes include the partitioning of the napl components into other phases and degradation through biochemical reactions despite this napls may still remain in the subsurface and form an immiscible liquid plume in the aquifer zone napl is variably distributed in the subsurface where it can exist in free mobile entrapped and residual forms lenhard et al 2018 improved insight into how all forms of napl are distributed in the subsurface is fundamental to developing an effective remediation strategy us epa 2004 as well as determining the potential risk to human health and the environment crc care 2015 a critical step for the remediation of an impacted site is to recover the bulk of napl through appropriate techniques waterflooding or flushing processes are often used as aquifer remediation or hydrocarbon recovery methods to displace the mobile napls from the subsurface bear 1972 the assessment design and implementation of such processes depend on the fundamental understanding of napl displacement mechanisms in porous media bennion et al 1996 for instance predictive numerical simulations are widely used to model napl transport at the field scale these platforms however most often require macroscopic multiphase flow properties of the subsurface formation e g relative permeability saturation data in order to solve mass balance equations for various components present in the subsurface lenhard et al 2018 such flow properties at the darcy scale are the manifestation of displacement physics at the pore scale which is controlled by fluid fluid and fluid rock interactions although much progress has been made in recent years to improve our understanding of such interactions a lack of fundamental knowledge in several key areas frequently hinders these efforts one such area is the impact of rock mineralogy and wettability on the fate and transport of napls in heterogeneous rocks huling and weaver 1991 these pore scale properties govern waterflooding processes and determine the residual napl saturation left behind that might be remediated by other techniques such as enhanced oil recovery eor surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear sequential napl skimming vacuum enhanced recovery and water table drawdown mercer and cohen 1990 essaid et al 2015 sookhak lari et al 2018 in some cases where complete napl remediation may not be possible in reasonable time periods and costs natural attenuation of the residual napl may be recommended provided public health and environmental risks are acceptable it is now well believed that napls at residual and entrapped saturations rapidly undergo methanogenesis resulting in biofilm formation at the surface of the grains and also bubble formation inside the pores since napls are multi component fluids compositional changes due to volatilization and dissolution significantly affect the fluid properties such as interfacial tension and viscosity and wetting characteristics of porous media lekmine et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2018b and 2019 that is to say that the longer napl remains in the subsurface the more difficult the assessment of complete remediation becomes nevertheless the heterogeneous nature of subsurface rocks in terms of pore space topology mineralogy and wettability further complicates any initial attempt to determine the post waterflood entrapped and residual napl at multiple scales which is key to develop master strategies for long term napl remediation wettability is defined as the tendency of one fluid to spread over and adhesively coat a solid surface in the presence of another fluid and is commonly expressed in terms of the advancing contact angle ca at the napl water mineral interface cassie and baxter 1944 although most minerals are naturally water wet the adsorption of surface active constituents in napl may alter their wettability to neutral or napl wet buckley 1998 the polarizable fraction of napl is often referred to as asphaltenes and consists primarily of a polydisperse mixture of molecules with different molecular weight aromaticity and heteroatom content such as oxygen nitrogen and sulfur groenzin and mullins 2000 as a result they interact differently with minerals in sandstones quartz with abundant silanol groups can form hydrogen bonds with some electronegative heteroatoms of asphaltenes and promote their adsorption in carbonates where the majority of minerals consist of calcite and or dolomite calcium ions are able to strongly bond with acidic components of asphaltenes especially at ph conditions below 9 5 when the mineral surface charge is positive morrow et al 1973 different techniques have been used in the past to characterize wettability amott 1959 dickson et al 2006 chiquet et al 2007 chalbaud et al 2009 espinoza and santamarina 2010 the most common ones consist of measuring macroscale or apparent static or dynamic contact angles on the surface of mineral substrates using rising captive bubble techniques lee et al 2003 for example smooth quartz substrates were used to represent the mineralogy of sandstones yu and buckley 1997 whereas polished marble and calcite substrates acted as proxies for carbonates leslie zhang et al 2006 sharma and mohanty 2013 in most cases substrates were cleaned pre equilibrated with brine and then aged in napl saraji et al 2013 recent studies used rock samples as substrates to better represent their properties mirchi et al 2015 the impact of water films initially adsorbed on the mineral surfaces prior to aging in napl has been taken into consideration by establishing an initial water saturation in the substrates alotaibi et al 2010 to preserve surface roughness unpolished sandstone and carbonate substrates were also adopted javanbakht and goual 2016 after immersion in brine solutions napl inside aged substrates formed small droplets on the surface due to spontaneous imbibition of brine from which contact angle distributions were obtained qin et al 2017 goual et al 2017 the ease and reproducibility of this method has made it very attractive nonetheless it is not clear if its accuracy represents the intrinsic wettability inside pores which depends on pore geometry mineralogy wall roughness and initial water saturation recent developments in high resolution pore scale imaging of immiscible fluids in three dimensional 3d porous media allowed in situ measurements of microscale quantities such as pore fluid occupancies through which cas were measured on the pore walls matthew andrew et al 2014 khishvand et al 2016a among these methods micro computed tomography is emerging as the technique of choice because it is non invasive and can achieve micron resolution iglauer et al 2010 kazmouz et al 2016 javanbakht et al 2017 arshadi et al 2018a in situ contact angles in sandstones bead packs and limestone have been measured manually on images of the plane perpendicular to the three phase contact line khishvand et al 2016b lv et al 2016 arshadi et al 2018b an automated algorithm was developed to measure extensive in situ contact angles from x ray microtomography images allowing researchers to obtain statistically more representative distributions alratrout et al 2017 this approach was successfully applied to homogeneous rocks however subsurface formations may contain different levels of heterogeneity in terms of pore space and mineralogy the latter results in local variation of rock wettability characteristics which in turn impacts the pore scale displacement and hence multiphase transport properties of napl in porous media in other words different minerals found in heterogeneous rocks have their own wetting preferences and napls such as crude oils may alter their wettability to a non uniformly wet state kumar et al 2010 recent micro ct studies on a heterogeneous aquifer rock revealed significant differences in wetting behaviors of quartz and carbonate calcite and dolomite after contact with napl confirming that wettability is a microscopic property of the rock that is heterogeneous at the pore scale javanbakht et al 2017 local variations in rock wettability further impacted the pore scale displacements of napl and the residual saturation left in the rock after waterflooding for instance removing contaminants especially dense nonaqueous phase liquids such as asphaltenes from the surface of napl wet minerals was more difficult than on mixed or water wet ones such preferences in pore scale displacements resulted in complex patterns of bypassing segmentation and trapping of napl by water according to three dimensional distribution of minerals within the rock javanbakht et al 2017 although recent advances in x ray tomography have paved the way to understanding these complexities they remain challenging costly and time consuming endeavors therefore it is important to develop reliable modeling tools that are capable of predicting microscale phenomena occurring in these systems several studies have used pore scale network modeling techniques with realistic representations of rock pore space topology to investigate the effect of wettability on the pore scale displacements and macroscopic descriptors of two phase flow e g relative permeability capillary pressure and residual fluid saturations piri and blunt 2005a sahimi 2011 gharbi and blunt 2012 wopara and iyuke 2018 pore networks provide a practical description of the porous media to model multiphase fluid flow by incorporating physically based displacement mechanisms at the pore scale dong and blunt 2009 aghaei and piri 2015 in most studies the extracted pore network model epnm retains important geometrical features of the pore space topologies affecting fluid flow behavior scheidegger 1958 however since rock mineralogy is not explicitly known in these models wettability is usually considered as a spatially random variable more specifically macroscale cas are used in the flow models as input with uniform or normal distributions these parameters inform the flow models about the underlying solid fluid interaction physics which in turn have direct impacts on the sequence of pore scale displacements and transport properties of the continuum blunt 1998 this approach has a major limitation in heterogeneous rocks where the spatial variation of mineralogy results in local variation of wettability distribution javanbakht et al 2017 this issue is more of a concern when selective surface fluid interaction characterization is required in reactive transport processes recently pore scale heterogeneity in reactive surface area of minerals within a berea sandstone miniature core was quantified in 3d using an x ray micro ct lai and krevor 2014 the volumetric and statistical information obtained from this work could be used in statistically based models of reactive transport or modeling field scale reaction rates direct pore scale simulations techniques such as the lattice boltzmann method lbm were also used to study the effect of wettability heterogeneity different napl wet solid fractions on residual trapping and relative permeability of two and three phase flow in porous media mohammadmoradi and kantzas 2016 2017 zhao et al 2018 although direct methods simulate fluid flow in real pore structures with irregular fluid solid boundaries and deformable fluid fluid interfaces at the mesoscopic scale they become computationally expensive at the core scale pore network models pnm on the other hand can overcome these limitations and are readily scalable to handle larger size rocks where heterogeneities are better captured despite this fact mineral heterogeneity has never been explicitly incorporated into pnms to improve their prediction capabilities in real reservoir rocks to our best knowledge the goal of this study was to address this limitation by considering more realistic representations of rock mineralogy and wettability in pore network models to this aim we developed a novel platform to incorporate mineralogy and wettability maps of a contaminated heterogeneous aquifer rock arkose into a quasi static pnm to improve its prediction of napl displacement during primary drainage and waterflooding in this model in situ cas determined from micro ct core flooding experiments on the same rock were assigned to the network on a pore by pore basis to describe the exact wettability distribution of the rock and generate a hybrid pore network that incorporated both pore space topology and mineral heterogeneity the pore by pore model predictions of napl pore occupancy cluster sizes residual fluid saturation and relative permeabilities were then validated against the core flooding experimental data to examine the sensitivity of the model to wettability we randomly input macroscale ca data obtained on napl aged quartz and arkose substrates hereafter referred to as quartz and arkose models and compared the predictions to those from the pore by pore model pore scale physics of displacements were used to explain the trends obtained from each wettability model emphasizing the importance of incorporating mineral heterogeneity to improve the prediction capabilities of physically based pnms novel insights developed from this study could be used to reduce uncertainties in the design and implementation of aquifer remediation processes and when the performance of petroleum reservoirs is predicted using continuum scale simulation tools 2 experimental methods 2 1 rocks several blocks of heterogeneous rock were obtained from the arkose layer of fountain formation located in east colorado and wyoming from which a 38 mm diameter core plug was drilled this formation is a heterogeneous pennsylvanian sedimentary rock consisting primarily of conglomerate sandstone or arkose fountain sediments mostly formed from the sherman granite which is an igneous formation after drying at 110 c for 24 h and cooling down to room temperature the porosity and klinkenberg corrected air permeability of the core plug were measured by using a helium porosimeter permeameter apparatus ap 608 coretest system yielding values of 17 06 and 12 47 md respectively a miniature core sample 5 mm in diameter and 47 mm in length was then drilled from the mother core plug to be used in the core flooding experiments the porosity of the miniature core sample was calculated to be 10 45 from the micro ct images the difference in porosity values was attributed to the heterogeneity of the arkose rock in terms of pore space topology and mineralogy e g clay content and limitation of the micro ct scanner in detecting the sub micron porosity within the clay cement the absolute brine permeability of the miniature core was measured to be 14 09 md by recording the pressure drop responses to different brine flow rates 2 2 quantitative evaluation of minerals the mineralogy of arkose rock was determined by using qemscan 650f manufactured by fei now thermo fisher scientific usa qemscan creates phase assemblage maps of a specimen surface scanned by a high energy accelerated electron beam along a predefined raster scan pattern low count energy dispersive x ray spectra edx are generated and provide information on the elemental composition at each measurement point the elemental composition in combination with back scattered electron bse brightness and x ray count rate information is converted into mineral phases gottlieb et al 2000 in our study the x ray source was optimized at 25 kv and 6 2 na and a species identification protocol was used to convert the raw data to a 3 0 3 0 mm mineralogy map with a resolution of 0 73 μm per pixel the arkose sample contained 60 5 quartz 27 9 carbonate 6 6 feldspar and a small fraction of other minerals such as kaolinite illite albite pyrite etc as shown in fig 1 qemscan results were further used during the segmentation of micro ct images to better identify and quantify the major minerals present in the miniature core sample 2 3 fluids gibbs crude oil from minnelusa formation in wyoming was selected as the napl phase and contained 10 2 of c7 asphaltenes the oil was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for one hour and filtered through a 0 5 μm filter paper to remove connate water and possible debris respectively qin et al 2018 the brine consisted of 1 m cacl2 in distilled deionized water the procedure used for the selection of this salinity is explained in our previous study javanbakht and goual 2016 sodium iodine 7 wt nai was added to the brine to enhance the contrast between brine and napl phases in the micro ct images the density and viscosity of napl and brine at ambient conditions i e 23 c and 14 7 psia are 0 91 g ml 1 09 g ml and 82 4 mpa s 1 32 mpa s respectively 2 4 interfacial tension and macroscale contact angles the interfacial tension between napl and brine was measured to be 20 7 mn m using the pendant drop technique saraji et al 2013 the needle diameter was 1 762 mm to have a bond number close to unity the images of napl droplets were analyzed by the axisymmetric drop shape analysis adsa saad and neumann 2016 to characterize the wettability of arkose rock before the drainage process contact angles were measured on a rock substrate that was initially vacuumed at 10 7 psi for 12 h then fully saturated with brine after transfer to a glass cuvette a napl droplet was carefully injected to the surface of the substrate after 4 h the droplet image was captured and analyzed using angle tool module in imagej software to obtain the contact angle to characterize the wettability of the rock after primary drainage another arkose substrate was vacuumed at 10 7 psi for 12 h and saturated with napl after aging in napl at ambient conditions for 24 h it was transferred to the cuvette and immersed in brine the napl inside the substrate was released by spontaneous imbibition of brine and formed several droplets on the surface of the rock the contact angles of these droplets were then measured using the same method and a distribution curve was plotted since most sandstone rocks are often considered to be composed primarily of quartz we repeated the previous measurement on a polished quartz substrate from spi supplies to clean the sample from any possible contamination it was sonicated in sulfuric acid solution containing 10 nocromix for one hour and then soaked in acid overnight after being thoroughly washed by distilled water and boiled for 4 h the quartz substrate was then rinsed in fresh distilled water and dried by ultrahigh purity nitrogen the clean substrate was immersed in napl at ambient condition upon aging in napl for 24 h the substrate was transferred to the glass cuvette and immersed in brine the oil on the surface of the substrate formed few small oil droplets whose images were captured after 24 h and analyzed by the same method 2 5 miniature core flooding experiments miniature core flooding experiments were performed using a three phase core flooding apparatus integrated with a high resolution x ray micro ct scanner fig 2a provides a schematic diagram of the experimental setup piri 2014 the sample was first placed in a custom built carbon fiber core holder and an initial confining pressure of 150 ambient pore pressure psi was applied afterward a location of interest in the middle of the core cylindrical field of view with 5 mm in diameter and 3 mm in length was scanned at a resolution of 2 18 μm per voxel to generate reference images these images were later used to segment the wet images with a modified workflow that is explained in the next section after the air inside the core sample and connected lines was replaced with co2 the sample and all the lines were vacuumed for 24 h the sample was then fully saturated with brine by injecting 10 pore volumes of the fluid and subsequently increasing the pore pressure to dissolve any remaining co2 brine absolute permeability of the medium was measured to be 14 09 md which was in line with the air permeability of the mother core plug i e 12 47 md next primary drainage was performed with a flow rate of 0 001 cc min to establish the initial brine saturation after reaching steady state approximately 24 h the process was followed by waterflooding with a brine flow rate of 0 01 cc min x ray tomography images were acquired at the exact same location of interest at the end of each flow process i e primary drainage and waterflooding the two phase flow experiments were conducted at ambient conditions i e 23 c and 14 7 psia pore pressure to represent the flow conditions in contaminated soil or aquifers fig 2b summarizes the experimental procedure followed in this study 2 6 data acquisition and image analysis the tomography projections acquired by the micro ct scanner were reconstructed using mango software middleton et al 2010 to provide raw data gray scale image the data was then imported to avizo 9 4 software scientific 2018 for further image processing and analysis in the first step we used the non local means filter to smoothen the images li et al 2014 afterward the reference image set obtained under dry condition was segmented into pore and mineralogy maps using the histogram threshold method wildenschild and sheppard 2013 which represented the pore topology and three different minerals quartz feldspar and calcite dolomite as shown in fig 3 the threshold values to separate the pore space and different mineral phases were selected through the following steps i coarse search of the threshold values by considering the intensity peak of each material from the gray scale image intensity histograms and ii interactive visual evaluation of overlapped gray scale and segmented images during fine search of the threshold values for final pixel assignment wildenschild and sheppard 2013 in the next step wet image sets acquired after primary drainage and waterflooding were aligned with the reference image set by manually moving them pixel by pixel at x y and z directions until a suitable registration was achieved the registered wet image sets were then multiplied by the pore map obtained from the reference image to eliminate the solid phase minerals this was done since doped brine had an x ray attenuation similar to that of the solid phase which could lead to poor segmentation results in the last step registered image sets were segmented to brine and napl phases by following the steps described above by combining the fluid occupancy and mineralogy maps contact angles could be measured in situ on the surface of each mineral these values were later used to describe the wettability of each pore body or pore throat based on the walls minerals surrounding that specific element in the pore network model the size distribution of napl clusters and slice averaged water saturation profiles were calculated by a statistical analysis method fig 4a presents examples of superimposed fluid occupancy and mineralogy maps from which in situ contact angles were measured locations with clear napl brine mineral interfaces such as main terminal meniscus mtm and large pores interfaces were considered the selected interfaces were monitoring in ten consecutive slides to confirm the tangent lines finally in situ contact angles were measured on the surface of the minerals toward the denser phase brine the distribution of 30 contact angle measurements on each mineral was plotted for the three minerals present in the arkose rock and is presented in fig 4b note that these values were measured during waterflooding with 1 m cacl2 since waterflooding could not restore the wettability of pore surfaces these angles also represented equilibrium values at the end of primary drainage fig 4c presents an average in situ ca distribution curve that was acquired by combining the three distributions in fig 4b using the area percentage of each mineral according to qemscan results this average contact angle distribution curve which could represent the wettability map of pore surfaces under complex test conditions including initial water saturation surface texture curvature and mineralogy is merely presented here for qualitative comparisons to the contact angle distribution obtained from the arkose substrate during spontaneous imbibition of water fig 4d e 3 modeling methods 3 1 pore network extraction after applying preprocessing filters on the micro ct images of arkose rock a segmentation tool i e histogram thresholding was applied to divide the images to solid and pore space a 3 mm cubical sub volume of the binary images 0 for solid and 1 for pore space was then used as input for the pore network extraction algorithm pore networks which are simplified geometrical representation of pore space dong and blunt 2009 raeini et al 2017 provide practical descriptions of porous media to simulate multi phase fluid flow at the pore scale piri and blunt 2005a valvatne et al 2005 aghaei and piri 2015 the extracted network should retain important geometrical and topological features of the pore space in the form of pore bodies connected through pore throats in order to construct a representative pore network model for the heterogeneous and anisotropic arkose rock we extracted a network that preserved not only the geometrical and topological properties but also thermodynamically equivalent transport properties underlying mayer and stowe princen ms p theory mayer and stowe 1965 princen 1970 more specifically we examined local and global morphology from the binary images then used a pore network extraction algorithm based on graph theory using data driven decision making concepts gesho et al 2014 we utilized modern data driven decision making concepts xie and yan 2008 e g data analytics big data pattern recognition and multi layered network analysis to extract equivalent pore networks from complex datasets with mineral heterogeneity and local anisotropy this approach was previously validated for various heterogeneous outcrop and reservoir rock samples gesho et al 2016 the extracted pore network model epnm shown in fig 5 consisted of 146 832 pore bodies and 179 298 pore throats fig 6 presents the pore throat size distribution contribution of coordination number and pore throat aspect ratio of the network the processing time for network extraction was 2 17 h the software and hardware specifications of the machine used to run the network extraction and subsequent flow simulations are as follow red hat linux os 2 6 ghz intel r xeon r e5 2640 cpu with 16 nodes 512 gb of ram and nvidia quadro m 5000 gpu with 8 gb of memory and 2048 cuda cores 3 2 mineralogy map three major minerals were found in arkose rock sample quartz 60 5 carbonate 27 9 and feldspar 6 6 according to fig 1 this order of abundance was used as a guideline to identify the minerals segmented from the micro ct images based on their intensity peaks and threshold values fig 3 the solid phase in these images contained 71 quartz 22 2 carbonate and 4 5 feldspar note that 2 3 clay cement was also segmented from the solid phase in the micro ct images and directly assigned to the pore network elements on a pore by pore basis knowing their coordinate in the images the labeled images quartz carbonate and feldspar were then superimposed with the epnm and the mineralogy of the walls for each pore body and pore throat was determined the distributions of contact angles measured in situ on the surface of each mineral were assigned to the epnm to generate the final hybrid pore network model hpnm if a pore body or pore throat was in contact with two or more types of minerals mineral area weighted average of corresponding cas was calculated and assigned to the element fig 5 presents the wettability map of the hpnm used to simulate the waterflooding process it is worth noting that the ca distributions fig 4b were used to assess wettability of each mineral meaning that the pore wall roughness has been considered 3 3 flow model after generating the representative hpnm pore network combined with mineralogy map the primary drainage and waterflooding processes were predicted using a modified quasi static pore network flow model developed by piri and blunt piri and blunt 2005a the model has been previously validated by comparing model predictions of two and three phase flow through naturally occurring porous media against their experimental counterparts piri and blunt 2005b the quasi static model considers capillary forces to determine the sequence of displacements within the medium and is limited to processes with low capillary numbers this model however is capable of modeling two and three phase flow in napl wet media considering napl sandwiched layers since the primary drainage and waterflooding processes were performed with very low flow rates and the medium experienced significant wettability alteration from strongly water wet to weakly napl wet we selected the quasi static model to predict the displacement processes performed during the experiments piston like snap off and pore body filling displacement mechanisms are reflected in the model the flow model considers circular triangular and rectangular shaped cross section pores depending on the geometrical features of elements provided by the epnm in addition the corner interface between wetting and non wetting phases is adjusted based on changes in local capillary pressure a series of pore scale fluid fluid displacements were carried out in the pore network to simulate the flow eq 1 describes the young laplace equation to calculate the threshold capillary pressure of an idealized circular cross section pore element as can be seen from this equation displacement is a function of pore radius contact angle and napl brine interfacial tension displacement occurs once capillary pressure eq 2 reaches to the threshold value of the pore throat element after each displacement new displacements are added to the list based on the accessibility of the fluid phases to each other all the available displacements will be prioritized and eventually the most favorable ones occur additional details of the model could be found elsewhere piri and blunt 2005a note that the processing time for one full set of simulation primary drainage and waterflooding was 24 h 1 p c th 2 σcos θ ow r where pc th σ θow and r are threshold capillary pressure interfacial tension napl water contact angle and pore radius respectively 2 p c p nw p w where pc pnw and pw are capillary pressure non wetting phase pressure and wetting phase pressure respectively 4 experimental results 4 1 representative elementary volume rev rev is the smallest volume over which a measurement can be made that will yield a value representative of the whole sample hill 1963 to ensure that the scanned field of view fov is larger than porosity and mineralogy based rev the porosity and mineral fractions of several cubical sub volumes with different lengths from 0 1 to 3 0 mm were analyzed fig 7 presents the variation of porosity and mineralogy with changes in the size of sub volumes porosity and mineral percentages became constant once the length of the cubical sub volume was larger than 1 5 and 2 0 mm respectively therefore the porosity and mineralogy based revs are smaller than the fov furthermore it has been reported that the permeability based rev in heterogeneous systems could be up to twice as large as porosity based rev i e 3 mm cubical sub volume mostaghimi et al 2013 this indicates that the experimental values obtained from fov i e porosity mineral composition and saturation and the model predictions of the 3 mm cubical sub volume e g relative permeabilities can represent the overall properties of the core sample 4 2 primary drainage the water saturation profile along the length of fov at the end of primary drainage is shown in fig 8a where an average initial water saturation swi of 24 was established effective napl permeability at swi was measured to be 8 3 md one should note that pc s data were not measured during the experiments and simulation observation comparisons are presented only for fluid saturation profiles and kr s data since the medium was initially water wet pore scale piston like displacements started from larger pores and gradually filled up the smaller elements lenormand et al 1988 the water wet characteristics of the medium prior to primary drainage was previously confirmed by measuring napl water contact angles on a non aged arkose rock which yield an average value of 41 since napl contained 10 wt of asphaltenes the pore surfaces experienced wettability alteration at the end of primary drainage the wetting behaviors of these surfaces were first characterized by using a smooth quartz substrate and an arkose rock substrate after aging in napl for 24 h the quartz substrate was water wet with an average contact angle of 56 the smooth quartz surface was homogeneous with respect to mineralogy and surface texture thereby exhibited consistent contact angle values with a standard deviation of 2 in contrast to pure quartz the wettability of arkose substrate was altered from water wet to neutral wet with an average contact angle alteration from 41 to 90 as shown in fig 4e a closer examination of this figure showed a bi modal distribution of cas the largest one was mainly water wet or neutral wet with cas varying from 40 to 110 these non napl wet surfaces presented the dominant minerals with lower propensity to interact with asphaltenes like quartz and feldspar the smallest angle distribution represented areas of the surface that were further altered to napl wet with cas up to 140 this could be attributed to the strong adsorption of asphaltene polar components onto calcite and dolomite which contributed 27 9 to the total minerals of arkose the rougher mineral surfaces curbed the movement of the three phase contact line and made it harder for water to push the napl layer on the surface thereby contributing to the more napl wet states of napl aged arkose compared to the smooth quartz in situ wettability distributions on different minerals were later measured using the advanced microtomography technique fig 4b revealed that different minerals exhibited different wettability at the end of primary drainage carbonates including calcite and dolomite showed the highest wettability alteration after contacting with napl with an average ca of 120 on the other hand quartz and feldspar remained water wet with an average ca of 65 and 85 respectively to better compare the two wettability models i e arkose and pore by pore an area weighted average in situ contact angle curve was plotted in fig 4c in this figure a large fraction of pore elements was water wet or neutral wet and a smaller portion was napl wet which was in good agreement with the arkose model however the majority of pore surfaces were weakly water wet with an average in situ ca of 70 in contrast to 90 measured by spontaneous imbibition in arkose substrate this is because mineral surfaces inside the pores tended to be more water wet compared to aged substrate surfaces due to the existence of initial water saturation zhou et al 2000 which curbed the interaction between mineral surfaces and napl furthermore differences in the shape of both curves indicated that mineralogy on the surface of arkose substrate was slightly different from that inside the pores 4 3 waterflooding primary drainage was followed by waterflooding to displace napl from the medium slice averaged water saturation profiles revealed that the average residual napl saturation snr at the end of this process was 49 fig 8b this indicated that a large quantity of napl remained within the rock which could not be recovered by waterflooding the effective water permeability at snr was also measured to be 0 8 md in our study we used a brine flow rate of 0 01 cc min capillary number 6 7 10 7 to ensure that displacements were under capillary dominated regime this also implied that saturation profiles within the fov presented in fig 8b were not dependent on the location of the fov along the length of the core this was due to the low flow rate of brine and insignificant viscous pressure drop of displacements since flow was capillary dominated wettability had a significant impact on the magnitude of the threshold capillary pressure and hence the sequence of displacements quartz and feldspar grains were mostly weakly water wet whereas calcite and dolomite were neutral and weakly napl wet since the majority of pore walls within the rock were silicates imbibition of water through competition of snap off and piston like displacements governed the napl recovery in this category of pores napl clusters at the center of the pores became disconnected from the rest of the ganglia and could not be recovered by waterflooding once they lost their hydraulic connectivity it is worth mentioning that the contribution of snap off and hence trapping increased as the contact angle reduced toward zero strongly water wet blunt 1998 for instance snap off in throats made of quartz increased the chance of napl clusters being segmented during waterflooding this could in turn result in significant quantities of napl being left within the medium this phenomenon may occur to a higher extent in tight rocks such as arkose with high pore throat aspect ratios tanino and blunt 2012 in pores surrounded by calcite dolomite grains drainage through piston like displacement dominated the waterflooding process napl layers on the surface of these grains however may not maintain their connectivity across the rock due to their minor contribution to the rock minerals we must note that when pore surfaces became napl wet it was harder for water to invade into the pore due to the negative threshold capillary pressure of displacement as a result water tended to bypass these pores leaving napl trapped within the medium fig 9 shows that water mainly displaced napl from pores surrounded by quartz water wet walls whereas napl contained in calcite dolomite pores was bypassed due to the napl wet nature of these minerals this is a direct evidence of the impact of local mineralogy and wettability on pore scale displacement of napl in arkose rock in other words mineral heterogeneity and local variation of wettability have profound effects on the dominant flow and bypass paths within the arkose rock this suggests that extreme caution must be used with pore network models to predict multi phase flow in heterogeneous media pore scale displacement events captured in our micro ct images conformed with microscopic flow behaviors in mixed wet porous media presented elsewhere valvatne and blunt 2004 5 modeling results 5 1 model validation in this section we validated our model by comparing its predictions to the experimental measurements starting from basic properties the calculated porosity from the pore network model was 10 45 which was identical to the one measured by micro ct the model also predicted an absolute permeability of 12 9 md which was comparable to the value measured experimentally i e 12 14 md the pore throat size distribution contribution of coordination number and pore throat aspect ratio of the network model were presented in fig 6 elements with a radius ranging from 10 to 20 μm had the highest volume contribution to the pore space this was consistent with the experimental measurements of arkose rock reported earlier javanbakht et al 2017 relatively high pore throat aspect ratio of the medium fig 6c could further increase the chance of napl entrapment due to snap off in the pore throat junctions furthermore the primary drainage process was simulated utilizing the initially water wet pore network with an average ca of 41 and the relative permeability end points swi and krn at swi were compared against their experimental counterparts the model predicted swi and krn at swi to be 25 and 0 6 respectively which matched the experimental measurements i e 24 and 0 59 fig 8a compared the predicted saturation profile at the end of primary drainage with the in situ measurements and showed that both are in good agreement 5 2 waterflooding prediction and discussion after validating the pore network model the primary drainage was followed by waterflooding simulations in order to investigate the sensitivity of the model predictions to wettability three scenarios were created using the same pore network and primary drainage conditions the first scenario was designed by considering the exact mineralogy of the arkose rock and in situ contact angle distributions measured from the micro ct images this was the most accurate wettability characterization pore by pore model which accounted for spatial variations of mineralogy pore wall roughness and the presence of initial water saturation thus the ca data in fig 4b were assigned to the pore network on a pore by pore basis note that the majority of the pores had an in situ ca of 70 based on fig 4c the second scenario utilized the contact angle distribution measured on arkose substrate after spontaneous imbibition arkose model this model considered the rock surface roughness and mineralogy to some extent whereas compared to in situ measurements it overestimated the wettability due to the absence of initial water saturation average ca was 90 the wettability distribution in fig 4e was randomly assigned to the pore network in the last scenario the contact angle distribution on polished quartz substrate was used quartz model which did not consider mineral heterogeneity pore wall roughness and the presence of initial water saturation this method demonstrated strongly to weakly water wet characteristics with an average contact angle of 56 the smooth surface of quartz resulted in a very narrow standard deviation 2 meaning that the pore network was uniformly water wet fig 11 presents the relative permeability curves predicted by the model for the primary drainage and three waterflooding scenarios experimental end point relative permeability measurements were also included in this figure for comparison the predicted primary drainage endpoint swi and krn at swi was almost identical to the one measured during the micro ct experiments the waterflooding predictions however differed depending on the wettability model at a first glance the pore by pore model predicted the residual napl saturation more accurately than the other two wettability models i e 45 compared to the experimental value of 49 arkose model underestimated this value 38 whereas the quartz model overestimated snr significantly i e 71 as stated earlier wettability had a significant impact on the threshold capillary pressure and hence pore scale displacements within the pore network this impact can be seen not only from the end point saturations but also from the shape of the napl relative permeability curves during waterflooding the variation of contact angle could highly affect the pattern of napl phase segmentation and entrapment during the waterflooding as also observed in the experiments fig 9 under strongly water wet conditions there are two mechanisms for napl entrapment snap off and bypassing for contact angles toward 0 snap off dominates the trapping while piston like displacement is less favored this behavior may justify the significantly high residual napl saturation i e 71 obtained using the quartz substrate as it has the lowest average contact angle among the three tested cases the sharp reduction in napl relative permeability indicated that large clusters of napl were segmented at early time due to snap off mechanism and remained stranded within the network the high pore throat aspect ratio of the arkose rock fig 6c may have also contributed to the snap off trapping tanino and blunt 2012 as the contact angle increased toward weakly water wet the frequency of piston like displacements increased compared to that of snap off meaning that bypassing dominated entrapment this reduced the chance of large napl clusters to become disconnected at early time piston like advancement nucleated from mtm interfaces of water filled pores after primary drainage as well as water from the entrance of the medium and displaced the napl phase through a uniform pattern leading to a higher napl recovery blunt 1998 our model predictions using the pore by pore wettability model was in line with this behavior the residual napl saturation decreased to 45 as the average contact angle increased toward 70 entrapment through bypassing was mainly controlled by the size connectivity and wettability of pore elements for instance the napls residing within napl wet pores particularly those between calcite dolomite grains were bypassed given the fact that the majority of the network elements i e 72 made of quartz feldspar were weakly water wet fig 10 depicts the cumulative contribution of trapped napl blobs at the end of waterflooding in both experiment and model relatively large napl clusters were trapped within the pore network using the quartz model due to frequent snap off events the pore by pore model improved the predictions of trapped cluster sizes by shifting the corresponding plot to the left and producing a similar trend to that of the experiments this indicated the formation of smaller trapped napl clusters due to the increasing contribution of piston like displacements compared to snap off as the average contact angle further increased toward 90 arkose model the predicted residual napl saturation was the lowest i e 38 due to the increasing contribution of nucleated wetting and non wetting advance mechanisms this is in line with previous findings published elsewhere blunt 1998 interestingly napl relative permeabilities obtained from the arkose and pore by pore models were identical at low water saturations this could be due to the fact that the first i e easiest displacements in the network required the least water threshold pressure and invaded elements may have met this criterion according to their size and regardless of wettability fig 11b presents the water relative permeability curves during waterflooding in a logarithmic scale as expected the mobility of water in the quartz model was the lowest among all three cases this was primarily due to the high residual napl saturation and the tendency of water to invade smaller pore elements in the water wet network the mobility of water increased in the pore by pore model as the network became less water wet water permeability of the arkose model at snr was the highest among the three cases because of lower residual napl saturation and water preference to invade larger elements in the napl wet network one may note that the pore by pore model slightly underestimated the water permeability at residual napl saturation which might be due to the tight nature of the rock further investigation on the governing physics of flow through extremely tight rocks should be conducted to improve the accuracy of water permeability predictions in such systems in summary the pore by pore model predicted the residual napl saturation most accurately i e 8 error among the three models as expected the residual napl saturation determined by the arkose model was more accurate than that from the quartz model i e 22 compared to 41 error this is because the mineralogy measured on the surface of arkose substrate was relatively representative of the internal microstructure of the rock and consequently the angle distribution of the arkose model followed the same trend as the area weighted average in situ cas fig 4c e we anticipate improved predictions from the arkose model if initial water saturation in the substrate are established prior to ca measurements the failure of the quartz model to predict residual napl saturation suggests that traditional ca measurements on pure minerals and or polished rock substrates i e captive bubble sessile drop methods should be avoided when dealing with heterogeneous rocks this is primarily due to the limited number of bubbles droplets injected on local areas that may not cover all minerals present in the rock a closer examination of the saturation profiles in fig 8b revealed that both pore by pore and arkose simulations shared similar trends peaks and hills despite the fact that the cas were assigned to these models on a pore by pore and random basis respectively the trend of water relative permeabilities were also similar in these models fig 11b such similarities indicate that macroscopic displacements were mainly governed by the geometrical topological properties of the medium and average wettability rather than local mineral distribution in other words although arkose rock had a certain level of mineral heterogeneity the minerals were mostly distributed uniformly across the rev fig 7b in order to reduce the number of experiments we propose that the distribution of in situ contact angles on various rock minerals be measured for one set of fluids and used to simulate flow in multiple rock samples preferably from the same formation as long as the corresponding mineralogy and pore space topology of each sample are obtained under dry conditions in rocks where minerals are not distributed uniformly such as in agglomerates in situ wettability characterization pore by pore model is warranted in such cases direct pore to core upscaling of displacement processes is recommended by simulating transport in core size samples using parallel high performance computational methods to overcome scalability issues 6 conclusions constitutive relationships between microstructure heterogeneity and napl displacement in a contaminated aquifer rock arkose were successfully determined using x ray microtomography and pore scale network modeling micro ct imaging of waterflooding revealed that water mostly by passed the napl residing in pores with carbonate walls this was primarily due to the napl wet characteristics of calcite dolomite and the tendency of water to flow through neighboring water wet silicate pores formed within quartz feldspar grains such complex preferential flow paths determining residual napl saturation and water mobility at the pore scale were mainly governed by the frequency and distribution of minerals in the rock in order to predict this behavior micro ct images of arkose were selected to generate a hybrid pore network of the rock that was used as input in a quasi static flow model incorporating mineral heterogeneity on a pore by pore basis improved the ability of the flow model to predict residual napl saturation and relative permeabilities during waterflooding this was due to the selective characterization of solid fluid interactions by considering pore wall roughness mineral heterogeneity and the presence of initial water saturation different shapes and end points of relative permeability curves and cluster size distributions predicted with different wettability models pore by pore arkose quartz demonstrated the importance of local wettability on pore scale displacements and constitutive macroscopic transport properties of porous media the model prediction utilizing the arkose model was acceptable and could be further improved by establishing initial water saturation prior to aging with napl although this method captured the roughness and mineral heterogeneity of the substrate it may not represent the wettability of rock samples with higher levels of mineral heterogeneity and where minerals are not distributed uniformly across the medium e g agglomerates polished mineral substrates or other similar techniques such as sessile drop and captive bubble on the surface of smooth minerals are unlikely to represent the wettability characteristics of heterogeneous rocks as
