16300,hydrothermal treatment ht is effective for the deep dewatering of sewage sludge ss however the effective temperature generally exceeds 180 resulting in the production of refractory compounds in the sludge filtrates to explore a new process based on ht achieving ideal dehydration efficiency at lower temperatures it is essential to identify the key sludge dewatering mechanism under different ht stages in this study the relationship between the properties of sludge polymeric substances components and molecular structures and the physical chemical properties of sludge flocs during ht 120 260 was investigated the results indicated that the ss surface hydrophilicity hydrophobicity was mainly responsible for sludge dewaterability in the solubilization 120 and hydrolyzation stages 140 180 while the mechanically bound water and capillary force were the main limiting factors of sludge dewaterability during the carbonization stage 200 260 moreover in the solubilization stage 120 a plenty of high mw mw 70 kda polymeric substances with numerous hydrophilic functional groups and a compact structure were released from the intracellular region to the outer layer which improved the hydrophilicity of sludge floc surface and deteriorated the sludge dewaterability with the hydrolysis of the polymeric substances 140 180 hydrolyzation stage the destruction of proteins secondary structures and peptide chains exposed more hydrophobic groups resulting in the release of bound water and improvement of sludge dewaterability at ht temperatures of 200 260 carbonization stage dehydration and amine aldehyde condensation occurred benefiting the formation of fixed carbon and smooth morphology structure of ss reducing the capillary force induced water holding capacity of sludge flocs the establishment of the three stage influencing theory and the identification of key influencing factors are conducive to the further regulation and upgrading of ht graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge dewatering hydrothermal treatment physicochemical properties stratification structure protein secondary structure 1 introduction sewage sludge ss as the byproduct of wastewater treatment plants is characterized by high water content 95 99 and complex organic material content deng et al 2019 in 2019 the output of municipal ss in china was as high as 39 04 million tons 80 water content which was attributed to increasing industrialization and urbanization wei et al 2020 as ss usually contains pathogens and toxic inorganic appropriate ss treatment is vital to the environment and human health biganzoli et al 2012 in the different ss treatment and disposal system ss dewatering unit including ss drying unit is the most chemical and energy consuming units accounting for 44 82 of the total energy consumption cao et al 2012 chen et al 2022 however ss dewaterability is hindered by the gel like structure and the hydrophilic nature of extracellular polymeric substances epss to improve sludge dewaterability is necessary in cutting the coasts of operating and investment the techniques for improving ss dewaterability can be divided into two categories according to the conditioning mechanism one category involves disrupting the eps structures and weakening the ss floc hydrophilicity and encapsulation leading to the release of bound moisture bm from ss examples of these techniques are ultrasonic pretreatment microwave treatment cai et al 2017 freezing treatment hydrothermal treatment ht and advanced oxidation processes yu et al 2017 the other category involves altering the sludge floc compressibility and particle size so that a moisture transmission channel is formed facilitating the separation of solid and moisture examples of these techniques are coagulation yang et al 2019 and the addition of skeleton builders zhu et al 2018 among the above mentioned techniques hydrothermal treatment ht was the most effective preconditioning to improve sludge dewaterability by disrupts the sludge gel like structure and degrades epss yu et al 2014 in most of the previous studies ss dewaterability was effective improved at ht temperatures higher than 180 anderson et al 2002 by combining ht 180 60 min and mechanical expression 2 mpa 20 min wang et al 2014 achieved deep dewatering and a sludge cake with 42 moisture content mc in addition the energy consumption of ht 200 30 min to be only 42 1 of that of conventional thermal drying zhao et al 2013 thus high temperature ht 180 for sludge dewatering is both effective and energy saving and has huge potential to replace traditional ss drying process however the application of high ht temperatures 180 in sludge dewatering is limited by the formation of refractory compounds wang and li 2015 complicating the latter treatment of filtrates to solve this problem lowering the ht temperature to maintain ideal dehydration efficiency needs to be investigated as this will also reduce the energy input and costs however several researchers found that sludge dewaterability deteriorated as ht temperatures less than 130 bougrier et al 2008 wang et al 2021 many types of ht coupling process have been explored to reduce the optimal temperature of ht for ss deep dewatering for example wang et al 2020 found that carbonaceous skeleton aided ht could lower the effective ht temperature from 180 to 150 the addition of inorganic coagulant cacl2 fecl3 in ht has also been proven to reduce the optimal temperature of ht guan et al 2012 yan et al 2017 however the conditioning mechanism of different coupling processes are different to explore the more appropriate coupling process based on ht it is vital to first identify the key sludge dewatering mechanism under different ht stages in previous studies the constituent and molecular structure of biopolymers in ss play an important role in determining dewaterability and other physical chemical properties houghton and stephenson 2002 yu et al 2010 wang et al 2021 found that sludge dewaterability deterioration was due to the solubilization of biopolymers with numerous hydrophilic functional groups and gel like structures as ht temperatures below the threshold temperature 120 150 peng et al 2021 reported that during ht at 120 macromolecular organic matter hydrolysis and protein structure unfolding would occur improving sludge dewaterability for the physical chemical properties of ht sludge some studies found that the relative hydrophobicity of ss was improved at temperatures higher than 150 which induced the transformation of surface water to interstitial water and free water wang et al 2014 2017 moreover the hydrothermal carbonization of ss ht 180 endowed the sludge with a porous mesh structure owing to the intensified maillard and condensation reactions improving ss permeability and dewaterability xu et al 2018b the above studies show that the hydrothermal reaction pathway plays a critical role in ss dewaterability and physicochemical properties under different temperatures nevertheless it is difficult to form a conclusion based on the results of these different studies because the investigated sludge samples had varying characteristics and the studies were inconsistent in their analytical focus therefore there is no unified theory of the sludge dewatering mechanism during different hydrothermal stages solubilization hydrolysis and carbonization and the special relationship between polymeric substance sludge dewaterability and physicochemical properties in the different hydrothermal stages are still unclear in the current study hierarchical cluster analysis hca and pearson s correlation analysis were used to investigate the relationship between sludge dewaterability sludge floc physicochemical properties and sludge polymeric substance components and molecular structures properties under systematic ht temperatures 120 260 the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of the ht temperature 120 260 on sludge dewatering and physicochemical properties 2 clarify the transformation of the polymeric substance components and molecular structures in sludge samples of different phases and eps contents during ht and 3 investigate the potential relationship between sludge dewaterability physicochemical properties and polymeric substance characteristics during ht this relationship can serve as a basis to establish a unified theory of the effect of ht on sludge dewatering and identify the key influencing factors this study provides systematic theoretical guidance to advance the application of ht under lower temperatures to realize ideal dehydration efficiency and promote the use of ht for filtrate treatment a schematic diagram

positive correlation and 0 the absence of a linear relationship a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ht on sludge dewaterability the dewatering performances of ss under different ht temperatures are illustrated in fig 1 it was found that the influence of ht treatment temperature on the sludge dewaterability could be divided into three stages the sludge dewaterability cst srf and mc was deteriorated as the ht temperature range from 120 to 140 moreover the bm contents of the sludge samples treated at 120 140 5 85 6 76 were considerably higher than that of the rs 2 61 fig 1b the dewaterability of the ht sludge improved considerably with increasing temperature to 160 and tended to stabilize at temperatures exceeding 200 the higher dewaterability of the treated sludge was possibly due to the hydrolysis reaction in macromolecular organics neyens et al 2004 and the bound water conversion to free water which then exceeded 80 fig 1b thus the ht threshold temperature to improve sludge dewaterability was 140 consistent with the finding of a recent study wang et al 2020 however other studies have reported improved sludge dewaterability at temperatures above 150 bougrier et al 2008 or 130 yu et al 2014 the differing results may be due to the variation in ss properties and treatment devices peng et al 2021 proposed that the release of biopolymers with a network structure would deteriorate sludge dewaterability this suggests that the evolution of the polymeric substance properties in the different ht stages plays a critical role in sludge dewaterability 3 2 effects of ht on ss physicochemical properties the sludge dewaterability and moisture migration during ht are strongly related to the sludge floc surface characteristics and structure wu et al 2017 thus to understand the changes in dewaterability of the hydrothermally treated sludge hereafter referred to as ht sludge the evolution of the sludge physicochemical properties was determined fig 2 to evaluate the surface characteristics and binding strength between sludge flocs and water were determined fig 2a and 2b the total interfacial free energy gabh between sludge flocs and water comprises lewis acid base interaction free energy δ g adh ab and van der waals interaction free energy δ g adh lw the absolute values of the sludge δ g adh ab were higher than those of the δ g adh lw which indicates that lewis acid base interactions predominantly contributed to the binding strength between the sludge flocs and water consistent with a report by zhu et al 2020 as shown in table s6 the δ g adh of h 120 14 57 mj m2 was more positive than that of the rs 12 83 mj m2 moreover the average binding energy of ht 120 was also significantly higher than the value of the rs p 0 05 these results indicate that the sludge had a more hydrophilic surface when ss treated at 120 c increasing the sludge bm and reducing dewaterability with increasing ht temperature from 120 c to 180 the δ g adh of the ht sludge significantly decreased p 0 05 and it became negative as the ht temperature exceeded 180 which indicates that hydrophobic interaction was the main interaction force under this condition these results consistent with the changes of average binding energy of the sludge fig 2a a previous study on relative hydrophobicity analysis of ht sludge reported similar results wang et al 2014 combine with the analysis of ss surface charge and particle structures text s4 ht sludge with higher hydrophobicity was mainly responsible for the improvement of dewaterability as the ht temperature rose to 180 as previously reported the hydrothermal reaction pathways in different stages play main roles in sludge hydrophobicity for example the maillard reaction and cyclization of organic matter have been found to enhance sludge hydrophobicity in the carbonization stage peng et al 2021 therefore it is vital to investigate the transformation of polymeric substances during different hydrothermal stages and its impact on sludge floc surface characteristics which are discussed in the following sections 3 3 effects of ht on the characteristics of organic compounds in different ss phases 3 3 1 elemental analysis to explore biopolymer transformation during different ht stages the elemental composition and atomic ratio of organic matter in ss were quantified fig 3 a and table s1 the carbon c and hydrogen h contents of h 120 and h 140 were higher than that of the rs moreover the h c atomic ratio of h 140 2 09 was remarkably higher than that of the rs 1 89 the higher h content and h c atomic ratio of the ht sludge would be attributed to the hydrolyzation of unsaturated macromolecules in the sludge improved the polymeric substance saturation xue et al 2015 with the increase in the ht temperature from 120 to 140 the o c and n c atomic ratios increased from 0 57 to 0 14 to 0 58 and 0 15 respectively implying the relative increases in the amounts of o containing compounds e g polysaccharides and lipids and n containing compounds e g proteins this result also indicates the release of polar and hydrophilic polymeric substances in this stage wang et al 2019 as the ht temperature exceeded 140 the o c and h c atomic ratios decreased with increasing temperature this decrease may be due to dehydration of the carboxyl or carbonyl group in polysaccharides by caramelization reaction fig s2 wang et al 2020 the h c o c and n c atomic ratios of the sludges further decreased when sludges were treated at 180 indicating that the proteinaceous substrates and polysaccharides underwent condensation and aromatization in the carbonization stage resulting in the release of bm and mbm and the enhancement of ss dewaterability mursito et al 2010 3 3 2 nitrogenous compound analysis proteinaceous substrates as the major hydrophilic polymeric substances in ss play more important roles in dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic acids yu et al 2010 moreover the recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen don formed at a high temperature ht 180 inhibits the side stream nitrogen removal processes nitrification and anammox zhang et al 2020a thus fig 3c and d show the nitrogenous compound concentrations ton don dissolved protein d protein and nh4 nh3 n in the rs and ht sludge by comparison the h 120 to h 180 sludge samples had a lower ton content than the rs but higher don d protein don doc and nh4 nh3 n contents this result suggests that the proteinaceous compounds were transformed from the solid phase to the liquid phase during the hydrothermal treatment accompanied by the release of short chain fatty acids and nh4 nh3 n wilson and novak 2009 the increases in don content and don doc also suggests that denitrification was the main challenge in the side stream process of nitrogen removal from the filtrates moreover the ton don and don doc contents increased with the increase of ht temperature from 180 to 260 while the d protein content decreased the decrease in the d protein content suggests that the peptides were converted into heterocyclic n via maillard and diels alder reactions in the carbonization stage ht temperature 180 peng et al 2021 suggested that biopolymer solubilization and hydrolyzation during ht would affect sludge dewaterability combine with the results of mw distribution in dissolved polymeric substances text s5 the ht sludge treated below the threshold ht temperature 120 140 exhibited lower dewaterability which was attributed to the gelatinization and solubilization of the super macromolecule organic matter mw 1000 kda from inner eps or microbial cells at ht temperatures exceeding 140 the hydrolyzation of the high molecules was more pronounced than the solubilization these results led to the improvement of the sludge hydrophobicity properties and dewaterability as previously reported the proportion of molecules 300 kda greatly attributed to proteinaceous compounds duan et al 2014 meanwhile the d protein content increased with increasing ht temperature from 140 to 180 therefore the evolution of proteinaceous compounds especially changes in the molecular structure was possibly the predominant factor affecting the dewatering performance and physical chemical properties of ss in the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 120 180 3 4 effects of ht on the characteristics of polymeric substances in different eps fractions 3 4 1 eps distribution and composition epss represent 50 80 of the biopolymer substances in sludge the eps distribution and composition can affect the sludge hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and dewaterability ge et al 2019 fig 4 a d shows the toc ton polysaccharide and protein contents in different eps fractions during ht at solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 120 180 the sludge dewatering characteristics showed a strong positive correlation with toc ton and protein concentrations in s eps in contrast chen et al 2015b concluded that the correlation of the protein concentration with sludge dewaterability in b eps was higher than that in s eps this difference possibly existed because the ht is more destructive to sludge flocs than other sludge dewatering conditioning processes resulting in the disruption of microbial cells and the migration of macromolecular polymeric substances from the inner layer to the outer layer however no considerable correlation existed between the sludge dewatering characteristics and the toc and ton concentrations in the s eps as sludge treated at 200 to 260 this result shows that the eps concentration did not play a critical role in improving the dewaterability of the ss in the carbonization stage 200 260 text s6 of the supporting information provides a more detailed discussion 3 4 2 change in mw the weight average mw distributions of s eps and b eps are presented in fig 4e and f respectively the sludge samples treated at 120 180 corresponding to the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages exhibited strong correlations between the s eps fraction with a mw 70 kda and the cst table s3 however the ht sludge treated at carbonization stage 200 exhibited no such correlations table s2 as previously reported the high mw eps molecules endowed the sludge flocs with more adsorption points and structural stability xu et al 2017 combine with the analysis of ss surface characteristics these results suggested that the proteinaceous compounds mw 70 kda in solubilization and hydrolysis stage 120 180 was more hydrophilic than polymeric substances mw 70 kda in carbonization stage 200 text s7 of the supporting information provides a more detailed discussion 3 4 3 protein secondary structure analysis figure s3 shows the cd spectra of eps in the rs and ht sludge samples the spectra of the rs h 120 and h 140 showed a strong positive peak at 195 nm and all of the samples exhibited a negative trough at 208 nm however the cd spectra of the eps in h 200 fluctuated around θ 0 indicating that the secondary structures of proteins in sludges treated at 200 260 carbonization stage were destroyed in the s eps and b eps of the samples α helix β sheet and random coil were the predominant protein secondary structures table 1 after ht treatment the α helix β sheet and random coil contents of s eps were considerably higher than those of the rs and decreased with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 200 consistent with the findings of peng et al 2021 given the higher α helix content of the sludge treated at 120 solubilization stage implying that protein molecular in s eps had stronger hydrogen bonds and higher hydrophilicity with water hou et al 2015 as previously demonstrated a lower α helix β sheet random coil ratio resulted in a looser structure you et al 2017 the α helix β sheet random coil ratios of the s eps and b eps of h 120 0 2974 and 0 2724 respectively were higher than those of the rs 0 2704 and 0 2700 respectively this result suggests that the proteins released from microbe cells has more compact structure in solubilization stage in the hydrolyzation stage the α helix β sheet random coil ratio in the s eps decreased with increasing ht temperature these results suggest that the hydrogen bond in the α helix was destroyed and converted to β sheet and random coil structures with the hydrolysis of proteinaceous compounds consequently the structures of the s eps proteins were loosened and the eps was endowed with hydrophobic functions or sites enhancing the sludge floc surface hydrophobicity and subsequent dewaterability improved li et al 2020 these results are consistent with those represented in fig 1d and fig 2b 3 5 effects of ht on chemical structures of ht sludge polymeric substances the sludge samples were analyzed via ftir to determine the effects of ht on the molecular structures of the sludge polymeric substances the ftir spectra of the rs and ht sludge are shown in fig s4 and the specific wavenumbers are detailed in table s4 the spectra of all the characteristic peaks of the ht sludge samples exhibited enhanced peak transmission intensities indicating that the sludge released more functional groups furthermore ftir 2d correlation spectroscopy was used to verify the relationships between different functional groups in the ht sludge samples fig 5 the cross peaks of the different functional groups 1035 1457 1545 1650 2960 3450 cm 1 in the synchronous map were positive indicating that the corresponding groups in hydrocarbons proteins and polysaccharides in the ss showed conformational changes in the same direction furthermore an asynchronous map can further clarify the sequential relationships between different functional groups ye et al 2018 as depicted in the map with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 260 the functional group variation sequence was in the following sequence 3450 1545 1650 1457 1035 2920 cm 1 this result illustrates that the functional group variation of polymeric substances in the sludge during the ht process was as follows oh associated with hydrocarbon and polysaccharides and nh from proteins cn of amide ⅱ co of amide ⅰ ch of ch2 and ch3 and coc this finding indicates that the exposed of oh and nh functional groups was occurred firstly at 120 solubilization stage resulting in the improvement of the sludge floc hydrophilicity with increasing ht temperature the cn in amide ⅱ and co in amide ⅰ underwent hydrolyzation leading to the protein structure to unfold and exposure of unsaturated and hydrophobic structures ch2 co coc which improved the ss dewaterability some studies have reported similar results peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 these results are also supported by the results of xps analysis result text s8 3 6 relationship between sludge dewaterability physiochemical properties of sludge and organic compounds according to the analysis above the molecular structures and components of polymeric substances had different effects on the physicochemical properties and dewaterability of sludge at the different ht stages fig 6 thus according to sludge dewaterability under different conditions the ht process can be divided into three stages the solubilization stage 120 hydrolyzation stage 140 180 and carbonization stage 200 260 hierarchical clustering and pearson s correlation analysis were applied to evaluate the relationships between the sludge polymeric substance properties dewaterability and physicochemical characteristics and identify the key factors affecting sludge dewaterability in the different ht stages 3 6 1 solubilization and hydrolyzation stage 120 180 the hca result is presented as a dendrogram and the similarities between the different parameters were measured using the euclidean distance the dendrogram of sludge dewaterability and physicochemical characteristics can be split into two clusters as shown in fig 6a the zeta potential and fm are grouped in cluster b while the other sludge dewatering and physicochemical characteristics belong to cluster a these results indicate that under treatments at 120 180 the trend of sludge dewaterability was highly similar to those of the sludge floc particle distribution and hydrophobicity furthermore the pearson s correlation results indicate that the cst showed significant positive correlations with the mbm r 0 960 p 0 05 and fractal dimension df r 0 977 p 0 05 and the sludge cake mc showed a strongly significant positive correlation with the δ g adh r 0 992 p 0 01 therefore the changes of sludge dewaterability in solubilization and hydrolyzation stage 120 180 may be related to sludge floc destruction and the change in sludge hydrophobicity consistent with a previous study wang et al 2017 moreover the lewis acid base interactions of sludge flocs played more important roles in sludge dewatering at treatment temperatures of 120 180 furthermore the correlations between the characteristics of polymeric substance components and molecular structures sludge dewaterability and sludge physicochemical characteristics in the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 120 180 were determined the bm content showed the strongest negative correlation with the content of ton in the s eps r 0 995 p 0 01 and a high positive correlation with the content of ton in b eps r 0 989 p 0 05 however negligible correlations existed between the polysaccharide ps content in the eps and the sludge dewatering characteristics confirming that the proteinaceous compounds in the eps markedly affected the ss physicochemical properties and dewaterability furthermore the s eps fraction with mw 70 kda r 0 968 p 0 05 and the s eps proteinaceous compound secondary structures α helix β sheet random coil and α helix β sheet random coil showed significant and positive correlations with the binding energy be α helix r 0 978 p 0 05 β sheet r 0 980 0 05 random coil r 0 986 p 0 05 α helix β sheet random coil r 0 977 p 0 05 while the b eps fraction with mw 1000 kda and the b eps protein secondary structures showed no marked correlations with them additionally the n c atomic ratio and ton content of sludge showed significant and positive correlations with the s eps fraction with mw 70 kda and the protein secondary structures table s3 he et al 2014 reported that sludge protein was first hydrolyzed to amide n by peptide bond cleavage and then further transformed to nh4 nh3 n by deamination supporting the results of the current study therefore with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 180 the hydrolyzation and deamination of protein were the key mechanism responsible for the destruction of s eps protein secondary structure and the cleavage of peptide chain which led to the improvement of ss dewaterability 3 6 2 carbonization stage 200 260 the dendrogram of the dewaterability and physicochemical characteristics of sludge treated at carbonization stage can be divided into three clusters as shown in fig 6b the sludge dewaterability srf cst mc and mbm trend was similar to the particle distribution d50 df and zeta potential trend moreover the sludge cake mc showed significant and positive correlations with the mbm r 0 982 p 0 05 and d50 r 0 965 p 0 05 indicating that sludge dewaterability can be improved by the mbm and d50 reduction however the bm content and δ g adh showed no marked correlation with sludge dewaterability implying that sludge floc hydrophobicity was not the key factor that improved sludge dewaterability in the carbonization stage as previously reported the content of mbm was associated with the capillary forces between the sludge flocs vaxelaire and cezac 2004 therefore in this stage the sludge dewaterability was determined by the capillary condensation interaction of sludge flocs to verify the effects of the polymeric substance properties on the ss dewaterability and physicochemical characteristics in the carbonization stage 200 260 the pearson correlation coefficients of them were obtained fig 6b compared with the solubilization and hydrolyzation stage this stage featured negligible correlations between the sludge dewaterability characteristics srf cst mc and s eps fraction with mw 70 kda in this stage the mc of sludge cake showed a significant and positive correlation with the volatile matter vm r 0 980 p 0 05 and a negative correlation with the fixed carbon fc content r 0 971 p 0 05 and ash ash content r 0 974 p 0 05 these results indicate that the increased occurrence of ash and fc in the ss solid phase can reduce the mc of sludge cake and the content of mbm the predominance of ash in sludge was reported by svennevik et al 2019 suggesting that the low water binding capacity and skeleton building mechanisms of ash were responsible for the improved sludge dewaterability as previously reported the capillary force induced water binding capacity of vm is higher than that of fc in sludge miryahyaei et al 2019 meanwhile the formation of fc was due to the dehydration and devolatilization reaction of vm under this condition he et al 2013 thus the increases the content of fc and ash would reduce water binding capacity of sludge flocs by capillary force and facilitate the formation of drainage channels and separation of sludge flocs and water furthermore the fc showed significant and negative correlations with the n c atomic ratios in the sludge r 0 956 p 0 05 the result suggests that the n containing functional groups in the sludge particles treated at 200 260 were cleaved and shifted into the liquid phase zhuang et al 2017 according to these findings the decreases in oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups of polymeric substances should improve the fc contents of ht sludge which related with the capillary force induced water holding capacity during carbonization stage 3 7 overall summary fig 7 illustrates the sludge dewatering mechanism during the different ht stages in the solubilization stage 120 the biopolymers were solubilized and transformed from the intracellular region to the outer layer s eps moreover the biopolymer fraction with mw 70 kda increased and the proteins possessed a more compact secondary structure by forming hydrogen bonds in the α helix structure these results led to more adsorption points with water and stronger hydrophilicity of sludge flocs in the hydrolyzation stage 140 180 organic compound hydrolysis was more pronounced than solubilization reducing the biopolymer fraction with mw 70 kda furthermore with increasing ht temperature the protein in the s eps was hydrolyzed and converted to nh4 nh3 n and short peptide chains resulting in the secondary structure of protein were destroyed consequently this result leads to the more production of hydrophobic sites of s eps resulting the improvement of ss dewaterability which consistent with the findings of previous studies peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 however at ht temperatures exceeding 200 carbonization stage the mbm content played a critical role in the sludge dewatering process in this stage decarboxylation deamination and dehydration reactions caused the polymerization and aromatization of polymeric substances in the ht sludge resulting in the improvement of the fc and ash contents reducing the capillary binding capacity of sludge flocs eyser et al 2015 have reported similar results who found that the occurrence of decarboxylation and aromatization reactions can endow ht sludge with a stable and smooth structural morphology which reduces the sludge water holding capacity therefore the dehydration and decarboxylation reactions of polymeric substances increased the fc and ash contents and altered the sludge floc morphology resulting in a lower water holding capacity of ss and the release of mbm overall destroying the gel like network structure of protein in s eps and preventing the aggregation of different polypeptides are key directions to reduce the optimum ht temperature for ss deep dewatering thereby upgrading the ht process 4 conclusion this study systematically investigated the transformation of polymeric substances in sludge during ht 120 260 and established correlations between the polymeric substance properties sludge physicochemical properties and sludge dewaterability in the different ht stages the key sludge dewatering mechanism during ht were identified through hierarchical clustering and pearson s correlation analyses according to the sludge dewaterability under different ht stages the ht process can be divided into three stages the solubilization stage 120 hydrolyzation stage 140 180 and carbonization stage 200 260 in the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 120 180 the changes in the ss surface hydrophobicity and the polymeric substance molecular structure were mainly responsible for the change in sludge dewaterability during the solubilization stage 120 the high mw mw 70 kda polymeric substances with a compact structure were released via the disruption of microbial cells leading to the improvement of sludge floc surface hydrophilicity and subsequent sludge dewaterability deterioration with the hydrolysis of polymeric substances 140 180 the secondary structures of proteins were destroyed and converted to nh4 nh3 n and short polypeptide chains facilitating the enhancement of sludge hydrophobicity and the release of the sludge bound water thus improving sludge dewaterability in the carbonization stage 200 260 the mbm and the capillary force between sludge flocs and water were the main limiting factors of sludge dewaterability mechanistic studies showed that the occurred of dehydration and amine aldehyde condensation reaction reduced the content of oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups of polymeric substance benefiting the formation of fc and smooth

16300,hydrothermal treatment ht is effective for the deep dewatering of sewage sludge ss however the effective temperature generally exceeds 180 resulting in the production of refractory compounds in the sludge filtrates to explore a new process based on ht achieving ideal dehydration efficiency at lower temperatures it is essential to identify the key sludge dewatering mechanism under different ht stages in this study the relationship between the properties of sludge polymeric substances components and molecular structures and the physical chemical properties of sludge flocs during ht 120 260 was investigated the results indicated that the ss surface hydrophilicity hydrophobicity was mainly responsible for sludge dewaterability in the solubilization 120 and hydrolyzation stages 140 180 while the mechanically bound water and capillary force were the main limiting factors of sludge dewaterability during the carbonization stage 200 260 moreover in the solubilization stage 120 a plenty of high mw mw 70 kda polymeric substances with numerous hydrophilic functional groups and a compact structure were released from the intracellular region to the outer layer which improved the hydrophilicity of sludge floc surface and deteriorated the sludge dewaterability with the hydrolysis of the polymeric substances 140 180 hydrolyzation stage the destruction of proteins secondary structures and peptide chains exposed more hydrophobic groups resulting in the release of bound water and improvement of sludge dewaterability at ht temperatures of 200 260 carbonization stage dehydration and amine aldehyde condensation occurred benefiting the formation of fixed carbon and smooth morphology structure of ss reducing the capillary force induced water holding capacity of sludge flocs the establishment of the three stage influencing theory and the identification of key influencing factors are conducive to the further regulation and upgrading of ht graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge dewatering hydrothermal treatment physicochemical properties stratification structure protein secondary structure 1 introduction sewage sludge ss as the byproduct of wastewater treatment plants is characterized by high water content 95 99 and complex organic material content deng et al 2019 in 2019 the output of municipal ss in china was as high as 39 04 million tons 80 water content which was attributed to increasing industrialization and urbanization wei et al 2020 as ss usually contains pathogens and toxic inorganic appropriate ss treatment is vital to the environment and human health biganzoli et al 2012 in the different ss treatment and disposal system ss dewatering unit including ss drying unit is the most chemical and energy consuming units accounting for 44 82 of the total energy consumption cao et al 2012 chen et al 2022 however ss dewaterability is hindered by the gel like structure and the hydrophilic nature of extracellular polymeric substances epss to improve sludge dewaterability is necessary in cutting the coasts of operating and investment the techniques for improving ss dewaterability can be divided into two categories according to the conditioning mechanism one category involves disrupting the eps structures and weakening the ss floc hydrophilicity and encapsulation leading to the release of bound moisture bm from ss examples of these techniques are ultrasonic pretreatment microwave treatment cai et al 2017 freezing treatment hydrothermal treatment ht and advanced oxidation processes yu et al 2017 the other category involves altering the sludge floc compressibility and particle size so that a moisture transmission channel is formed facilitating the separation of solid and moisture examples of these techniques are coagulation yang et al 2019 and the addition of skeleton builders zhu et al 2018 among the above mentioned techniques hydrothermal treatment ht was the most effective preconditioning to improve sludge dewaterability by disrupts the sludge gel like structure and degrades epss yu et al 2014 in most of the previous studies ss dewaterability was effective improved at ht temperatures higher than 180 anderson et al 2002 by combining ht 180 60 min and mechanical expression 2 mpa 20 min wang et al 2014 achieved deep dewatering and a sludge cake with 42 moisture content mc in addition the energy consumption of ht 200 30 min to be only 42 1 of that of conventional thermal drying zhao et al 2013 thus high temperature ht 180 for sludge dewatering is both effective and energy saving and has huge potential to replace traditional ss drying process however the application of high ht temperatures 180 in sludge dewatering is limited by the formation of refractory compounds wang and li 2015 complicating the latter treatment of filtrates to solve this problem lowering the ht temperature to maintain ideal dehydration efficiency needs to be investigated as this will also reduce the energy input and costs however several researchers found that sludge dewaterability deteriorated as ht temperatures less than 130 bougrier et al 2008 wang et al 2021 many types of ht coupling process have been explored to reduce the optimal temperature of ht for ss deep dewatering for example wang et al 2020 found that carbonaceous skeleton aided ht could lower the effective ht temperature from 180 to 150 the addition of inorganic coagulant cacl2 fecl3 in ht has also been proven to reduce the optimal temperature of ht guan et al 2012 yan et al 2017 however the conditioning mechanism of different coupling processes are different to explore the more appropriate coupling process based on ht it is vital to first identify the key sludge dewatering mechanism under different ht stages in previous studies the constituent and molecular structure of biopolymers in ss play an important role in determining dewaterability and other physical chemical properties houghton and stephenson 2002 yu et al 2010 wang et al 2021 found that sludge dewaterability deterioration was due to the solubilization of biopolymers with numerous hydrophilic functional groups and gel like structures as ht temperatures below the threshold temperature 120 150 peng et al 2021 reported that during ht at 120 macromolecular organic matter hydrolysis and protein structure unfolding would occur improving sludge dewaterability for the physical chemical properties of ht sludge some studies found that the relative hydrophobicity of ss was improved at temperatures higher than 150 which induced the transformation of surface water to interstitial water and free water wang et al 2014 2017 moreover the hydrothermal carbonization of ss ht 180 endowed the sludge with a porous mesh structure owing to the intensified maillard and condensation reactions improving ss permeability and dewaterability xu et al 2018b the above studies show that the hydrothermal reaction pathway plays a critical role in ss dewaterability and physicochemical properties under different temperatures nevertheless it is difficult to form a conclusion based on the results of these different studies because the investigated sludge samples had varying characteristics and the studies were inconsistent in their analytical focus therefore there is no unified theory of the sludge dewatering mechanism during different hydrothermal stages solubilization hydrolysis and carbonization and the special relationship between polymeric substance sludge dewaterability and physicochemical properties in the different hydrothermal stages are still unclear in the current study hierarchical cluster analysis hca and pearson s correlation analysis were used to investigate the relationship between sludge dewaterability sludge floc physicochemical properties and sludge polymeric substance components and molecular structures properties under systematic ht temperatures 120 260 the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of the ht temperature 120 260 on sludge dewatering and physicochemical properties 2 clarify the transformation of the polymeric substance components and molecular structures in sludge samples of different phases and eps contents during ht and 3 investigate the potential relationship between sludge dewaterability physicochemical properties and polymeric substance characteristics during ht this relationship can serve as a basis to establish a unified theory of the effect of ht on sludge dewatering and identify the key influencing factors this study provides systematic theoretical guidance to advance the application of ht under lower temperatures to realize ideal dehydration efficiency and promote the use of ht for filtrate treatment a schematic diagram

positive correlation and 0 the absence of a linear relationship a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ht on sludge dewaterability the dewatering performances of ss under different ht temperatures are illustrated in fig 1 it was found that the influence of ht treatment temperature on the sludge dewaterability could be divided into three stages the sludge dewaterability cst srf and mc was deteriorated as the ht temperature range from 120 to 140 moreover the bm contents of the sludge samples treated at 120 140 5 85 6 76 were considerably higher than that of the rs 2 61 fig 1b the dewaterability of the ht sludge improved considerably with increasing temperature to 160 and tended to stabilize at temperatures exceeding 200 the higher dewaterability of the treated sludge was possibly due to the hydrolysis reaction in macromolecular organics neyens et al 2004 and the bound water conversion to free water which then exceeded 80 fig 1b thus the ht threshold temperature to improve sludge dewaterability was 140 consistent with the finding of a recent study wang et al 2020 however other studies have reported improved sludge dewaterability at temperatures above 150 bougrier et al 2008 or 130 yu et al 2014 the differing results may be due to the variation in ss properties and treatment devices peng et al 2021 proposed that the release of biopolymers with a network structure would deteriorate sludge dewaterability this suggests that the evolution of the polymeric substance properties in the different ht stages plays a critical role in sludge dewaterability 3 2 effects of ht on ss physicochemical properties the sludge dewaterability and moisture migration during ht are strongly related to the sludge floc surface characteristics and structure wu et al 2017 thus to understand the changes in dewaterability of the hydrothermally treated sludge hereafter referred to as ht sludge the evolution of the sludge physicochemical properties was determined fig 2 to evaluate the surface characteristics and binding strength between sludge flocs and water were determined fig 2a and 2b the total interfacial free energy gabh between sludge flocs and water comprises lewis acid base interaction free energy δ g adh ab and van der waals interaction free energy δ g adh lw the absolute values of the sludge δ g adh ab were higher than those of the δ g adh lw which indicates that lewis acid base interactions predominantly contributed to the binding strength between the sludge flocs and water consistent with a report by zhu et al 2020 as shown in table s6 the δ g adh of h 120 14 57 mj m2 was more positive than that of the rs 12 83 mj m2 moreover the average binding energy of ht 120 was also significantly higher than the value of the rs p 0 05 these results indicate that the sludge had a more hydrophilic surface when ss treated at 120 c increasing the sludge bm and reducing dewaterability with increasing ht temperature from 120 c to 180 the δ g adh of the ht sludge significantly decreased p 0 05 and it became negative as the ht temperature exceeded 180 which indicates that hydrophobic interaction was the main interaction force under this condition these results consistent with the changes of average binding energy of the sludge fig 2a a previous study on relative hydrophobicity analysis of ht sludge reported similar results wang et al 2014 combine with the analysis of ss surface charge and particle structures text s4 ht sludge with higher hydrophobicity was mainly responsible for the improvement of dewaterability as the ht temperature rose to 180 as previously reported the hydrothermal reaction pathways in different stages play main roles in sludge hydrophobicity for example the maillard reaction and cyclization of organic matter have been found to enhance sludge hydrophobicity in the carbonization stage peng et al 2021 therefore it is vital to investigate the transformation of polymeric substances during different hydrothermal stages and its impact on sludge floc surface characteristics which are discussed in the following sections 3 3 effects of ht on the characteristics of organic compounds in different ss phases 3 3 1 elemental analysis to explore biopolymer transformation during different ht stages the elemental composition and atomic ratio of organic matter in ss were quantified fig 3 a and table s1 the carbon c and hydrogen h contents of h 120 and h 140 were higher than that of the rs moreover the h c atomic ratio of h 140 2 09 was remarkably higher than that of the rs 1 89 the higher h content and h c atomic ratio of the ht sludge would be attributed to the hydrolyzation of unsaturated macromolecules in the sludge improved the polymeric substance saturation xue et al 2015 with the increase in the ht temperature from 120 to 140 the o c and n c atomic ratios increased from 0 57 to 0 14 to 0 58 and 0 15 respectively implying the relative increases in the amounts of o containing compounds e g polysaccharides and lipids and n containing compounds e g proteins this result also indicates the release of polar and hydrophilic polymeric substances in this stage wang et al 2019 as the ht temperature exceeded 140 the o c and h c atomic ratios decreased with increasing temperature this decrease may be due to dehydration of the carboxyl or carbonyl group in polysaccharides by caramelization reaction fig s2 wang et al 2020 the h c o c and n c atomic ratios of the sludges further decreased when sludges were treated at 180 indicating that the proteinaceous substrates and polysaccharides underwent condensation and aromatization in the carbonization stage resulting in the release of bm and mbm and the enhancement of ss dewaterability mursito et al 2010 3 3 2 nitrogenous compound analysis proteinaceous substrates as the major hydrophilic polymeric substances in ss play more important roles in dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic acids yu et al 2010 moreover the recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen don formed at a high temperature ht 180 inhibits the side stream nitrogen removal processes nitrification and anammox zhang et al 2020a thus fig 3c and d show the nitrogenous compound concentrations ton don dissolved protein d protein and nh4 nh3 n in the rs and ht sludge by comparison the h 120 to h 180 sludge samples had a lower ton content than the rs but higher don d protein don doc and nh4 nh3 n contents this result suggests that the proteinaceous compounds were transformed from the solid phase to the liquid phase during the hydrothermal treatment accompanied by the release of short chain fatty acids and nh4 nh3 n wilson and novak 2009 the increases in don content and don doc also suggests that denitrification was the main challenge in the side stream process of nitrogen removal from the filtrates moreover the ton don and don doc contents increased with the increase of ht temperature from 180 to 260 while the d protein content decreased the decrease in the d protein content suggests that the peptides were converted into heterocyclic n via maillard and diels alder reactions in the carbonization stage ht temperature 180 peng et al 2021 suggested that biopolymer solubilization and hydrolyzation during ht would affect sludge dewaterability combine with the results of mw distribution in dissolved polymeric substances text s5 the ht sludge treated below the threshold ht temperature 120 140 exhibited lower dewaterability which was attributed to the gelatinization and solubilization of the super macromolecule organic matter mw 1000 kda from inner eps or microbial cells at ht temperatures exceeding 140 the hydrolyzation of the high molecules was more pronounced than the solubilization these results led to the improvement of the sludge hydrophobicity properties and dewaterability as previously reported the proportion of molecules 300 kda greatly attributed to proteinaceous compounds duan et al 2014 meanwhile the d protein content increased with increasing ht temperature from 140 to 180 therefore the evolution of proteinaceous compounds especially changes in the molecular structure was possibly the predominant factor affecting the dewatering performance and physical chemical properties of ss in the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 120 180 3 4 effects of ht on the characteristics of polymeric substances in different eps fractions 3 4 1 eps distribution and composition epss represent 50 80 of the biopolymer substances in sludge the eps distribution and composition can affect the sludge hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and dewaterability ge et al 2019 fig 4 a d shows the toc ton polysaccharide and protein contents in different eps fractions during ht at solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 120 180 the sludge dewatering characteristics showed a strong positive correlation with toc ton and protein concentrations in s eps in contrast chen et al 2015b concluded that the correlation of the protein concentration with sludge dewaterability in b eps was higher than that in s eps this difference possibly existed because the ht is more destructive to sludge flocs than other sludge dewatering conditioning processes resulting in the disruption of microbial cells and the migration of macromolecular polymeric substances from the inner layer to the outer layer however no considerable correlation existed between the sludge dewatering characteristics and the toc and ton concentrations in the s eps as sludge treated at 200 to 260 this result shows that the eps concentration did not play a critical role in improving the dewaterability of the ss in the carbonization stage 200 260 text s6 of the supporting information provides a more detailed discussion 3 4 2 change in mw the weight average mw distributions of s eps and b eps are presented in fig 4e and f respectively the sludge samples treated at 120 180 corresponding to the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages exhibited strong correlations between the s eps fraction with a mw 70 kda and the cst table s3 however the ht sludge treated at carbonization stage 200 exhibited no such correlations table s2 as previously reported the high mw eps molecules endowed the sludge flocs with more adsorption points and structural stability xu et al 2017 combine with the analysis of ss surface characteristics these results suggested that the proteinaceous compounds mw 70 kda in solubilization and hydrolysis stage 120 180 was more hydrophilic than polymeric substances mw 70 kda in carbonization stage 200 text s7 of the supporting information provides a more detailed discussion 3 4 3 protein secondary structure analysis figure s3 shows the cd spectra of eps in the rs and ht sludge samples the spectra of the rs h 120 and h 140 showed a strong positive peak at 195 nm and all of the samples exhibited a negative trough at 208 nm however the cd spectra of the eps in h 200 fluctuated around θ 0 indicating that the secondary structures of proteins in sludges treated at 200 260 carbonization stage were destroyed in the s eps and b eps of the samples α helix β sheet and random coil were the predominant protein secondary structures table 1 after ht treatment the α helix β sheet and random coil contents of s eps were considerably higher than those of the rs and decreased with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 200 consistent with the findings of peng et al 2021 given the higher α helix content of the sludge treated at 120 solubilization stage implying that protein molecular in s eps had stronger hydrogen bonds and higher hydrophilicity with water hou et al 2015 as previously demonstrated a lower α helix β sheet random coil ratio resulted in a looser structure you et al 2017 the α helix β sheet random coil ratios of the s eps and b eps of h 120 0 2974 and 0 2724 respectively were higher than those of the rs 0 2704 and 0 2700 respectively this result suggests that the proteins released from microbe cells has more compact structure in solubilization stage in the hydrolyzation stage the α helix β sheet random coil ratio in the s eps decreased with increasing ht temperature these results suggest that the hydrogen bond in the α helix was destroyed and converted to β sheet and random coil structures with the hydrolysis of proteinaceous compounds consequently the structures of the s eps proteins were loosened and the eps was endowed with hydrophobic functions or sites enhancing the sludge floc surface hydrophobicity and subsequent dewaterability improved li et al 2020 these results are consistent with those represented in fig 1d and fig 2b 3 5 effects of ht on chemical structures of ht sludge polymeric substances the sludge samples were analyzed via ftir to determine the effects of ht on the molecular structures of the sludge polymeric substances the ftir spectra of the rs and ht sludge are shown in fig s4 and the specific wavenumbers are detailed in table s4 the spectra of all the characteristic peaks of the ht sludge samples exhibited enhanced peak transmission intensities indicating that the sludge released more functional groups furthermore ftir 2d correlation spectroscopy was used to verify the relationships between different functional groups in the ht sludge samples fig 5 the cross peaks of the different functional groups 1035 1457 1545 1650 2960 3450 cm 1 in the synchronous map were positive indicating that the corresponding groups in hydrocarbons proteins and polysaccharides in the ss showed conformational changes in the same direction furthermore an asynchronous map can further clarify the sequential relationships between different functional groups ye et al 2018 as depicted in the map with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 260 the functional group variation sequence was in the following sequence 3450 1545 1650 1457 1035 2920 cm 1 this result illustrates that the functional group variation of polymeric substances in the sludge during the ht process was as follows oh associated with hydrocarbon and polysaccharides and nh from proteins cn of amide ⅱ co of amide ⅰ ch of ch2 and ch3 and coc this finding indicates that the exposed of oh and nh functional groups was occurred firstly at 120 solubilization stage resulting in the improvement of the sludge floc hydrophilicity with increasing ht temperature the cn in amide ⅱ and co in amide ⅰ underwent hydrolyzation leading to the protein structure to unfold and exposure of unsaturated and hydrophobic structures ch2 co coc which improved the ss dewaterability some studies have reported similar results peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 these results are also supported by the results of xps analysis result text s8 3 6 relationship between sludge dewaterability physiochemical properties of sludge and organic compounds according to the analysis above the molecular structures and components of polymeric substances had different effects on the physicochemical properties and dewaterability of sludge at the different ht stages fig 6 thus according to sludge dewaterability under different conditions the ht process can be divided into three stages the solubilization stage 120 hydrolyzation stage 140 180 and carbonization stage 200 260 hierarchical clustering and pearson s correlation analysis were applied to evaluate the relationships between the sludge polymeric substance properties dewaterability and physicochemical characteristics and identify the key factors affecting sludge dewaterability in the different ht stages 3 6 1 solubilization and hydrolyzation stage 120 180 the hca result is presented as a dendrogram and the similarities between the different parameters were measured using the euclidean distance the dendrogram of sludge dewaterability and physicochemical characteristics can be split into two clusters as shown in fig 6a the zeta potential and fm are grouped in cluster b while the other sludge dewatering and physicochemical characteristics belong to cluster a these results indicate that under treatments at 120 180 the trend of sludge dewaterability was highly similar to those of the sludge floc particle distribution and hydrophobicity furthermore the pearson s correlation results indicate that the cst showed significant positive correlations with the mbm r 0 960 p 0 05 and fractal dimension df r 0 977 p 0 05 and the sludge cake mc showed a strongly significant positive correlation with the δ g adh r 0 992 p 0 01 therefore the changes of sludge dewaterability in solubilization and hydrolyzation stage 120 180 may be related to sludge floc destruction and the change in sludge hydrophobicity consistent with a previous study wang et al 2017 moreover the lewis acid base interactions of sludge flocs played more important roles in sludge dewatering at treatment temperatures of 120 180 furthermore the correlations between the characteristics of polymeric substance components and molecular structures sludge dewaterability and sludge physicochemical characteristics in the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 120 180 were determined the bm content showed the strongest negative correlation with the content of ton in the s eps r 0 995 p 0 01 and a high positive correlation with the content of ton in b eps r 0 989 p 0 05 however negligible correlations existed between the polysaccharide ps content in the eps and the sludge dewatering characteristics confirming that the proteinaceous compounds in the eps markedly affected the ss physicochemical properties and dewaterability furthermore the s eps fraction with mw 70 kda r 0 968 p 0 05 and the s eps proteinaceous compound secondary structures α helix β sheet random coil and α helix β sheet random coil showed significant and positive correlations with the binding energy be α helix r 0 978 p 0 05 β sheet r 0 980 0 05 random coil r 0 986 p 0 05 α helix β sheet random coil r 0 977 p 0 05 while the b eps fraction with mw 1000 kda and the b eps protein secondary structures showed no marked correlations with them additionally the n c atomic ratio and ton content of sludge showed significant and positive correlations with the s eps fraction with mw 70 kda and the protein secondary structures table s3 he et al 2014 reported that sludge protein was first hydrolyzed to amide n by peptide bond cleavage and then further transformed to nh4 nh3 n by deamination supporting the results of the current study therefore with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 180 the hydrolyzation and deamination of protein were the key mechanism responsible for the destruction of s eps protein secondary structure and the cleavage of peptide chain which led to the improvement of ss dewaterability 3 6 2 carbonization stage 200 260 the dendrogram of the dewaterability and physicochemical characteristics of sludge treated at carbonization stage can be divided into three clusters as shown in fig 6b the sludge dewaterability srf cst mc and mbm trend was similar to the particle distribution d50 df and zeta potential trend moreover the sludge cake mc showed significant and positive correlations with the mbm r 0 982 p 0 05 and d50 r 0 965 p 0 05 indicating that sludge dewaterability can be improved by the mbm and d50 reduction however the bm content and δ g adh showed no marked correlation with sludge dewaterability implying that sludge floc hydrophobicity was not the key factor that improved sludge dewaterability in the carbonization stage as previously reported the content of mbm was associated with the capillary forces between the sludge flocs vaxelaire and cezac 2004 therefore in this stage the sludge dewaterability was determined by the capillary condensation interaction of sludge flocs to verify the effects of the polymeric substance properties on the ss dewaterability and physicochemical characteristics in the carbonization stage 200 260 the pearson correlation coefficients of them were obtained fig 6b compared with the solubilization and hydrolyzation stage this stage featured negligible correlations between the sludge dewaterability characteristics srf cst mc and s eps fraction with mw 70 kda in this stage the mc of sludge cake showed a significant and positive correlation with the volatile matter vm r 0 980 p 0 05 and a negative correlation with the fixed carbon fc content r 0 971 p 0 05 and ash ash content r 0 974 p 0 05 these results indicate that the increased occurrence of ash and fc in the ss solid phase can reduce the mc of sludge cake and the content of mbm the predominance of ash in sludge was reported by svennevik et al 2019 suggesting that the low water binding capacity and skeleton building mechanisms of ash were responsible for the improved sludge dewaterability as previously reported the capillary force induced water binding capacity of vm is higher than that of fc in sludge miryahyaei et al 2019 meanwhile the formation of fc was due to the dehydration and devolatilization reaction of vm under this condition he et al 2013 thus the increases the content of fc and ash would reduce water binding capacity of sludge flocs by capillary force and facilitate the formation of drainage channels and separation of sludge flocs and water furthermore the fc showed significant and negative correlations with the n c atomic ratios in the sludge r 0 956 p 0 05 the result suggests that the n containing functional groups in the sludge particles treated at 200 260 were cleaved and shifted into the liquid phase zhuang et al 2017 according to these findings the decreases in oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups of polymeric substances should improve the fc contents of ht sludge which related with the capillary force induced water holding capacity during carbonization stage 3 7 overall summary fig 7 illustrates the sludge dewatering mechanism during the different ht stages in the solubilization stage 120 the biopolymers were solubilized and transformed from the intracellular region to the outer layer s eps moreover the biopolymer fraction with mw 70 kda increased and the proteins possessed a more compact secondary structure by forming hydrogen bonds in the α helix structure these results led to more adsorption points with water and stronger hydrophilicity of sludge flocs in the hydrolyzation stage 140 180 organic compound hydrolysis was more pronounced than solubilization reducing the biopolymer fraction with mw 70 kda furthermore with increasing ht temperature the protein in the s eps was hydrolyzed and converted to nh4 nh3 n and short peptide chains resulting in the secondary structure of protein were destroyed consequently this result leads to the more production of hydrophobic sites of s eps resulting the improvement of ss dewaterability which consistent with the findings of previous studies peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 however at ht temperatures exceeding 200 carbonization stage the mbm content played a critical role in the sludge dewatering process in this stage decarboxylation deamination and dehydration reactions caused the polymerization and aromatization of polymeric substances in the ht sludge resulting in the improvement of the fc and ash contents reducing the capillary binding capacity of sludge flocs eyser et al 2015 have reported similar results who found that the occurrence of decarboxylation and aromatization reactions can endow ht sludge with a stable and smooth structural morphology which reduces the sludge water holding capacity therefore the dehydration and decarboxylation reactions of polymeric substances increased the fc and ash contents and altered the sludge floc morphology resulting in a lower water holding capacity of ss and the release of mbm overall destroying the gel like network structure of protein in s eps and preventing the aggregation of different polypeptides are key directions to reduce the optimum ht temperature for ss deep dewatering thereby upgrading the ht process 4 conclusion this study systematically investigated the transformation of polymeric substances in sludge during ht 120 260 and established correlations between the polymeric substance properties sludge physicochemical properties and sludge dewaterability in the different ht stages the key sludge dewatering mechanism during ht were identified through hierarchical clustering and pearson s correlation analyses according to the sludge dewaterability under different ht stages the ht process can be divided into three stages the solubilization stage 120 hydrolyzation stage 140 180 and carbonization stage 200 260 in the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 120 180 the changes in the ss surface hydrophobicity and the polymeric substance molecular structure were mainly responsible for the change in sludge dewaterability during the solubilization stage 120 the high mw mw 70 kda polymeric substances with a compact structure were released via the disruption of microbial cells leading to the improvement of sludge floc surface hydrophilicity and subsequent sludge dewaterability deterioration with the hydrolysis of polymeric substances 140 180 the secondary structures of proteins were destroyed and converted to nh4 nh3 n and short polypeptide chains facilitating the enhancement of sludge hydrophobicity and the release of the sludge bound water thus improving sludge dewaterability in the carbonization stage 200 260 the mbm and the capillary force between sludge flocs and water were the main limiting factors of sludge dewaterability mechanistic studies showed that the occurred of dehydration and amine aldehyde condensation reaction reduced the content of oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups of polymeric substance benefiting the formation of fc and smooth structural morphology of sludge resulting in the reduction of water holding capacity of sludge by capillary force improving ss dewatering properties declaration of competing interest the authors

16301,the residues of nitrogen contaminants due to insufficient organic carbon sources in sewage has always been the main problem faced by wastewater treatment plants in the process of nitrogen removal in this study simultaneous shortcut nitrification and denitrification snd was achieved in the hybrid membrane aerated biofilm reactor h mbfr for treating low cod n ratio x223c 4 1 wastewater the effects of the aeration pressure and the influent cod n ratio in h mbfr were investigated and further optimized by the response surface methodology rsm by controlling the dissolved oxygen to achieve snd the removal efficiencies of nh4 n cod and tn of low cod n ratio wastewater reached maximum values of 95 52 96 61 and 72 23 respectively microbial community analysis showed that the influent cod n ratio had an obvious influence on the microbial community structure in particular ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and denitrifying bacteria had a good commensalism when the cod n ratio was 4 3 compared to control reactor the analysis of membrane bio fouling showed that h mbfr has a lower amount of extracellular polymeric substance eps on membrane and a low concentration of mlss in bulk liquid which is helpful for the longer term operation of h mbfr image graphical abstract keywords simultaneous shortcut nitrification and denitrification nitrogen removal hybrid membrane aerated biofilm reactor membrane bio fouling response surface methodology 1 introduction the removal of total nitrogen tn from wastewater has always been an important goal of wastewater treatment plant and how to meet the increasingly strict discharge standards economically and effectively that is a major challenge for conventional sewage treatment choi et al 2019 compared to physical and chemical technologies biological nitrogen removal bnr is widely used in wastewater treatment due to the advantages of more cost effective simple system and more environmentally friendly wang and he 2020 in the bnr process the carbon to nitrogen cod n ratio is considered to be a very pivotal indicator because the insufficient supply of organics in sewage will seriously restricts the efficiency of denitrification zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 however it is worth noting that the actual sewage in developing countries has characteristic of low cod n ratio usually less than 5 huang et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 as a conventional solution additional organic carbon sources such as acetic acid glucose and methanol etc are put in the denitrification process of sewage to ensure sufficient electron donors racys et al 2018 whereas this method increases the operating cost of wwtp and easily causes secondary pollution including the redundant sludge and cod of effluent yang et al 2021 therefore it is very necessary to develop a nitrogen removal process that can orient to the low cod n ratio wastewater the shortcut nitrification denitrification is also considered to be an effective process for nitrogen removal of wastewater under the low cod n ratio condition zhao et al 2018 nitrogen removal from wastewater by shortcut nitrification denitrification means that nh4 n oxidized to no2 n and no2 n directly reduced to nitrogen gas therefore this process can theoretically reduce the aeration requirement by 25 and save the organic carbon consumption by 40 zhao et al 2018 meanwhile it also can reduce the production of excess sludge lead to the positive role in the energy saving and emission reduction zheng et al 2018 inhibiting the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activity and making ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob become the dominant bacteria in the nitrification stage is the key to achieve the short cut nitrification denitrification process law et al 2019 wang et al 2019 as a main control method restricting dissolved oxygen do can decrease the growth rate of nob to achieve the enrichment of aob hou et al 2017 wang et al 2021b therefore the membrane biofilm reactor mbfr which can accurately control the aeration volume through aeration pressure will become a good choice to perform the shortcut nitrification denitrification process wang et al 2011 mbfr is a promising wastewater treatment technology based on membrane bioreactor mbr in recent years as one of the typical representatives the hollow fiber membrane is not only used as an aerator but also used to immobilize abundant microorganisms to form the biofilm hwang et al 2009 meanwhile mbfr as a counter diffusional biofilm process the oxygen flows through membranes from membrane lumen and is further utilized by biofilm attached on membrane surface while pollutants penetrate biofilm from wastewater side walter et al 2005 compared to conventional co diffusion biofilm reactor the opposing substrate diffusion provides a more suitable symbiotic environment for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms downing and nerenberg 2008 therefore an obvious aerobic anaerobic layered structure can be formed on the surface of aeration membrane and some scholars used the characteristic of mbfr to carry out researches about simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd zhang et al 2021a although mbfr has the above advantages in wastewater nitrogen removal the problem of membrane fouling has always been the main reason for limiting the application of membrane technology wu et al 2020 previous studies reported that using biomass carriers in mbr is an effective and promising method to control membrane fouling because biomass carriers facilitates the attached growth of microorganisms and reduces the concentration of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss in the reactor wang et al 2021a meanwhile the use of biomass carriers can reduce cake layer formation on the membrane surface and prevent pore blocking deng et al 2016 however using biomass carrier to alleviate membrane fouling has rarely been reported in the research on mbfr in the present study a new type of reactor called hybrid membrane aerated biofilms reactor h mbfr was designed that coupled biomass carrier and membrane aeration technology meanwhile h mbfr combined with simultaneous shortcut nitrification and denitrification snd process in order to achieve nitrogen removal from wastewater with low cod n ratio and the effective control of membrane bio fouling this study was aimed to 1 use the h mbfr for the wastewater nitrogen removal 2 evaluate the effects of aeration pressure and cod n ratio on the reactor and optimize by rsm 3 compare the variations of microbial community 4 investigate biomass carrier for the mitigation of membrane bio fouling the obtained results could provide the reference value for the nitrogen removal of low cod n ratio wastewater and the control of membrane bio fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration the h mbfr was made of polymethyl methacrylate pmma and had an effective volume of 50 l fig s1 the main components of the reactor included a frame with biomass carrier and a membrane module the frame was consisted of pmma plates threaded rods and a type of nylon biomass carrier dongyuan china fig s2 a hollow fiber microfiltration pvdf membrane module pore size of 0 4 μm and surface area of 2 m2 was installed in the middle of the frame h mbfr adopted the push flow mode specifically the wastewater was pumped from the bottom of the reactor using a peristaltic pump bt 300 2 j longer china and the effluent was discharged from the top of the reactor compressed air was supplied to the membrane lumen by an air pump and the transmembrane pressure was measured by a pressure gage and manually controlled with a valve the reactor temperature was maintained at 30 1 c by a heating rod and a mixing pump was used to mix the bulk liquid in reactor moreover h mbfr was covered with shading cloth to avoid the growth of photosynthetic microorganisms 2 2 inoculated sludge and wastewater the original sludge that was collected from shenshuiwan municipal wastewater treatment plant shenyang china and it was washed three times with deionized water before inoculation the initial cod concentration of the supernatant of inoculated sludge was 26 38 mg l ch3coona nh4 2so4 and k2hpo4 were used as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources of the synthetic wastewater respectively and the wastewater had the following composition in 1 l mg l k2hpo4 50 feso4 7h2o 10 cacl2 20 mgso4 7h2o 30 meanwhile the trace minerals were introduced into the solution through μg l mncl2 4h2o 0 2 cocl2 6h2o 0 24 znso4 7h2o 0 09 nicl2 6h2o 0 04 cuso4 6h2o 0 25 feng et al 2015 the ph of synthetic wastewater was controlled by nahco3 2 3 h mbfr startup and operation strategy the inoculated sludge was injected into the reactor at the start up period of biofilm culturing and then the synthetic wastewater was pumped through it the nh4 n concentration in the reactor was measured every 12 h the reactor was emptied when the nh4 n concentration decreased to 0 5 0 1 mg l and then the new synthetic wastewater 100 mg nh4 n l and discharged sludge reinjected into it the biofilm culturing lasted for 5 days and the new synthetic wastewater was injected into the reactor seven times during this stage on the fifth day the brown biofilm structure was observed on the biomass carrier which indicated the success of biofilm culturing subsequent experiments were conducted after the h mbfr was successfully startup as shown in table 1 the reactor was investigated for more than 277 days and the operation process was divided into five periods 2 4 eps extraction extracellular polymeric substance eps of cake layer was extracted with the modified heating method and the cake layer sample was collected from the membrane surface at the given time point guo et al 2018 the sample was washed for 3 times with deionized water and diluted to 2000 mg l then 10 ml mixture was taken and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min 4 c after the supernatant was discharged the sediment was re suspended to the original volume with pbs buffer including 2 mm na3po4 4 mm nah2po4 9 mm nacl and 1 mm kcl the re suspended sample was then heated in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min afterwards the mixture was centrifuged 12 000 rpm 4 c for 15 min and the supernatant was filtrated through 0 45 μm filter the filtrate was used as eps extraction solution for protein pn and polysaccharides ps analysis 2 5 chemical analyses and statistical optimization influent and effluent samples were collected by grab sampling and subjected to analyze chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n suspended solids ss and mlss were conducted according to standard methods apha 2005 nh4 n no3 n no2 n tn and cod were evaluated by a hach spectrophotometer dr 4000 hach usa and the cod was determined after rapid digestion polysaccharides content was determined by using anthrone sulfuric acid method and protein content was determined by using modified lowry method wang et al 2020 the sum of the protein and polysaccharides concentrations was regarded as the eps concentration zhou et al 2020 the do and temperature were monitored using a portable do meter jpbj 608 leici china and the ph was determined with a ph meter phbj 260 leici china the central composite design response surface methodology ccd rsm was used to describe the response surface properties of the experimental area and two significant factors aeration pressure and influent cod n ratio were optimized 2 6 sequencing analysis of microbial community the biofilm samples were collected when the reactor was in the stable state and each sample was sampled three times and mixed completely the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa was selected to dna extraction and the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes were amplified using universal primers 338f 806r zhang et al 2021b illumina miseq sequencing and analysis was performed at the majorbio bio pharm technology corporation shanghai china the usearch and the silva132 16s bacteria datebase were used during the analysis process operational taxonomic units otu with 97 similarity cutoff were clustered using uparse version 7 1 and chimeric sequences were identified and removed the taxonomy of each otu representative sequence was analyzed by rdp classifier version 2 2 against the 16s rrna database using confidence threshold of 0 7 according to the abundance distribution of otu in different samples the diversity level of each sample was evaluated 2 7 contrast experiment for membrane bio fouling conventional mbfr c mbfr and h mbfr were conducted to compare the membrane bio fouling in this study two reactors were identical except that there was no biomass carrier in the c mbfr fig s3 in the course of the contrast experiment the influent concentrations of nh4 n and cod were 61 42 1 97 mg l and 263 15 7 55 mg l respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt was maintained at 12 h and the initial aeration pressure was 0 02 mpa the two reactors were operated under the above conditions for 60 days and the protein concentration polysaccharides concentration and trans membrane pressure tmp were measured every ten days starting from the 10th day after the reactors operation 2 8 calculations the synthetic wastewater used in the experiment did not contain organic nitrogen therefore only the effluent concentration of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were investigated the tn removal efficiency was calculated as follow re moval efficiency c x i n f c x e ff c m e ff c n e ff c x i n f 100 the nitrite accumulation ratio nar was calculated based on the formula as follow n a r c m e ff c m e ff c n e f f 100 the snd rate formula as following s n d rate 1 c m e ff c n e ff c x inf c x e f f 100 where cx inf and cx eff is the influent and effluent concentration of nh4 n respectively cm eff is the effluent concentrations of no2 and cn eff is the effluent concentrations of no3 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of the h mbfr performance 3 1 1 performance of h mbfr during nitrification process as shown in fig 1 a the nh4 n removal efficiency of h mbfr increased from 66 25 to 96 81 after 10 days of continuous operation then the removal efficiency remained stable and the nh4 n concentration in the effluent was less than 2 mg l stage ⅰ moreover the effluent was dominated by nitrate and the average no3 n concentration of the effluent was 59 45 mg l when the nh4 n removal efficiency was stable while the concentration of no2 n in the effluent was always kept within a low concentration x223c1 49 mg l therefore in order to realize the short cut nitrification process the activity of nob needed to be inhibited to make aob become the dominant bacteria in the reactor many scholars believe that in addition to do temperature and ph also have significant effects on nob activity and higher temperature 30 c and ph 8 0 were considered favorable for the inhibition of nob therefore in the stage ⅱ the aeration pressure was reduced to 0 01 mpa while the temperature and ph were increased to 30 1 c and 8 0 0 3 respectively it could be seen from the fig 1 a that the removal efficiency of nh4 n has a plunge after changing the operating conditions the nh4 n removal efficiency was only 65 49 on the first day of the stage ⅱ but the effluent concentration of no2 n increased to 5 47 mg l in the following days the nh4 n removal efficiency gradually recovering and the nar continued to increase on the 46th day nh4 n removal efficiency and nar reached 91 9 and 82 34 respectively and the effluent no2 n concentration was 45 52 mg l the change trend of nh4 n removal efficiency indicated that aob activity was inhibited under the low do condition but it had strong adaptability for low do environment and the activity could gradually restored after a period of culture the variation trend of nar suggested that the operating conditions of stage ⅱ significantly inhibit the activity of nob thus the oxidation rate of no2 n to no3 n was reduced which leading to the accumulation of nitrite based on changes in the concentration of no2 n and no3 n it could infer that aob had replaced nob as the dominant bacteria in the reactor at this time 3 1 2 performance of nitrogen and cod removal in h mbfr at the end of stage ⅱ the nar was found to be stable at more than 80 which indicated that h mbfr had achieved the short cut nitrification process therefore organics were added as electron donor for the denitrification reaction in order to support snd process in the stage ⅲ as shown in fig 1 b on the first day of stage ⅲ the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased significantly with an effluent nh4 n concentration of 17 63 mg l eventually the nh4 n removal efficiency dropped to about 64 that was down 30 43 from stage ⅱ this was because heterotrophic bacteria compete nitrifiers for oxygen while autotrophic nitrifiers were at a disadvantage due to its slower growth rate leading to the reduction of nh4 n removal efficiency during the stage ⅲ the snd rate gradually increased from 43 06 to 77 55 and the removal efficiency of cod also showed a change trend similar to it fig 1 b the maximum cod removal efficiency could reach above 95 and the tn removal efficiency gradually increased from 34 13 to about 50 in this stage moreover it could be found that the remaining tn of effluent in the early was mainly no2 n because the denitrification ability is poor at this time and had insufficient capacity to reduce all the no2 n meanwhile previous studies have found that many denitrifying bacteria have incomplete denitrification pathway missing either nitrite or nitrate reductase therefore the conversion of nitrate to nitrite might also be one of the reasons why the effluent was mainly no2 n gao et al 2019 nguyen quoc et al 2021 however the main composition of tn in the later effluent was the nh4 n which was not oxidized by nitrification process therefore finding the balance between nitrification process and denitrification process so that the reactor has both good nitrification and denitrification capacity is the premise to achieve efficient nitrogen removal 3 2 effect of aeration pressure and cod n ratio on the h mbfr single factor experiment was used to evaluate the effects of aeration pressure and cod n ratio on the performance of the reactor 3 2 1 effect of aeration pressure on removal efficiency previous studies indicated that the oxygen supply is one of the main factors affecting the process of snd chiu et al 2007 so h mbfr was operated continuously under three aeration pressures 0 015 mpa 0 02 mpa and 0 025 mpa as shown in fig 2 a during 1 30 days aeration pressure of 0 015 mpa the removal efficiencies of nh4 n tn and cod were 65 29 48 62 and 96 61 respectively and the average do concentration in the reactor approached 0 0 2 mg l at this time then the aeration pressure was increased to 0 02 mpa on days 31 61 the nh4 n removal efficiency increased to 89 71 and the cod removal efficiency basically remained unchanged however the removal efficiency of tn did not significantly decrease with the increase of aeration pressure and remained at about 48 and the average do concentration in the reactor was about 0 5 0 2 mg l this result showed that the denitrification process was not inhibited when the aeration pressure was 0 02 mpa because the anaerobic environment was not diminished in days 62 90 the aeration pressure was further increased to 0 025 mpa at which time the nh4 n removal efficiency reached 96 11 cod removal efficiency was close to 100 however the tn removal efficiency decreased to 34 74 and was because the denitrification process was inhibited due to the larger aeration pressure at this stage at this stage the average do concentration in the reactor had risen to 1 1 0 2 mg l the above results indicated that the increase of aeration pressure within a certain range would not break the anaerobic environment in the reactor because the oxygen escaping from the membrane was preferentially used by nitrifying bacteria on the membrane surface rather than diffusing directly into the reactor however when the aeration pressure exceeds this range the denitrification rate will decrease obviously so it is very important to find an appropriate aeration pressure for h mbfr 3 2 2 effect of the cod n ratio on removal efficiency the cod n ratio of wastewater is an important parameter for bnr which can affect the performance of snd from two aspects zhang et al 2021a so h mbfr was operated continuously under three cod n ratio conditions 3 3 4 3 and 5 3 as shown in fig 2 b the average removal efficiency of nh4 n was 91 35 when the cod n ratio was 3 3 but the removal efficiency of tn was less than 50 meanwhile it could be found that the snd rate was 53 52 the average cod removal efficiency reached 98 56 and the remaining cod in the effluent was less than 7 mg l this indicated that the low tn removal efficiency was due to the incomplete denitrification process caused by the low organics content in the influent in days 31 60 cod n ratio of 4 3 although the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and cod decreased slightly 87 23 and 92 85 the tn removal efficiency increased to 78 89 the snd rate at this stage also increased to 91 62 which indicated that the carbon source in the wastewater at this time was relatively sufficient when the cod n ratio increased to 5 3 days 61 90 the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tn decreased to 83 53 54 79 and 52 91 respectively however the snd rate remained at 96 81 which indicated the tn in the effluent was mainly nh4 n that has not be oxidized it could be found that the tn removal efficiency significantly increased when the cod n ratio increased from 3 3 to 4 3 but the nh4 n removal efficiency did not show a significant decline the similar result was found in previous study downing and nerenberg 2008 and it reported that the reason for the insensitivity of nitrification rate to the cod loading was that the cod concentration in the reactor was not high so denitrification and cod degradation processes occurred exclusively in the bulk liquid however continuously increased cod concentration allow greater cod penetration into the aerobic biofilm on the membrane surface resulting the decrease of nitrification rate therefore it is necessary to ascertain an appropriate cod n ratio to ensure a high tn removal efficiency 3 3 multiple response optimization and comparative analysis in the current work the central composite design response surface methodology ccd rsm was used to examine the interrelation between the independent variables to predict the optimum conditions the highest removal efficiencies were achieved with optimization of process variables regression analysis and statistical significance of model equations used by design expert 8 0 almomani and bohsale 2020 the actual design of this study was presented in table s1 and statistical testing of the model was performed by the analysis of variance anova interaction between independent variables in h mbfr were shown on 3d surface plots fig 3 and the results of anova were listed in table s2 the optimal conditions calculated from the optimum formulation were aeration pressure of 21 85 kpa and cod n ratio of 4 and the corresponding values of nh4 n cod and tn removal efficiency were 95 52 96 61 and 72 23 respectively to confirm the validity of the statistical strategy parallel experiment was conducted under the optimal values of the operation parameters aeration pressure 0 022mpa cod n ratio 4 and the removal efficiency of nh4 n cod and tn reached 92 17 97 51 and 70 43 respectively fig s4 the results of the parallel experiment were similar to the predicted values indicating that the optimization results were reliable it can find according to the calculation of the theoretical formula that the theoretical cod n ratio required for the whole run denitrification with no3 n as electron acceptor is 2 86 if organic carbon sources can be fully used for denitrification and the theoretical cod n ratio required for the short cut denitrification with no2 n as electron acceptor is 1 71 shi et al 2022 however the consumption of organics in the actual wastewater treatment process is much higher than the theoretical value which is mainly due to the competition of other heterotrophic microorganisms for carbon sources gao et al 2020 some studies have shown that the cod n ratio required for the whole run denitrification process is usually 8 10 carrera et al 2004 fu et al 2009 moreover some researchers found that the stable short cut denitrification process could be achieved when the cod n ratio is 3 5 5 which is similar to this experimental result iannacone et al 2021 weissbach et al 2018 therefore it could be speculated that the snd process took place in h mbfr and the conclusion was further verified by the bacterial community analysis in section 3 4 the comparison of h mbfr with other nitrogen removal processes was shown in table 2 and the cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies of h mbfr could reach the same level as that of other processes meanwhile it could found that the cod n ratio demand of h mbfr was lower than other processes and it could ensure a high tn removal efficiency in addition the other processes in table 2 all used a multi stage reactor and compared with them h mbfr as a single stage reactor has advantages such as small floor area and convenient control therefore this study could provide a convenient and efficient approach for the treatment of wastewater with low cod n ratio 3 4 bacterial community analysis 3 4 1 analysis of microbial richness and diversity the influent cod n ratio is a major factor affecting the microbial community in mixotrophic treatment system zhou and xu 2020 therefore for further explore the nitrogen removal mechanism of h mbfr the bacterial communities were examined and analyzed under different conditions of influent cod n ratio table 3 showed the sampling phase sampling location and the alpha diversity index of the samples compared with g1 g2 had a higher community richness which was because the addition of organics led to the emergence of bacteria with cod degradation function and small amounts of organics did not affect the survival of nitrifying bacteria however the bacterial richness declined during g3 that might be due to the high organics concentration leading to the nitrifying bacteria were washed out in addition except g3 the richness and diversity of bacteria on the surface of biomass carrier were higher than those on the membranes surface during the same phase this was because organics preferentially affected the microbial structure on the surface of biomass carriers however when the cod concentration was high the aerobic microorganisms that grew on the biomass carrier were weed out but a small amount of aerobic microorganisms could still exist on the membranes surface downing and nerenberg 2008 additionally coverage was more than 90 in all the communities which demonstrated the truth of the results 3 4 2 analysis of the microbial community as shown in fig 4 a thirty one phyla were found in the six samples which contained twelve main phyla relative abundance 1 in at least one sample proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are common phyla in the activated sludge process which play a key role in the process of nitrogen removal and can participate in the degradation of macromolecular organics zhang et al 2021b it was worth noting that the main phyla of the all samples were the same and previous study had also confirmed the result that cod n ratio could affect the community succession but not affect the core microbiome in phylum level wang et al 2018 fig 4 b showed the bacterial taxonomic identification in genus level and forty seven kinds of genera relative abundance 1 in at least one sample were found in the six samples nitrosomonas as a common aob in the nitrogen removal system cao et al 2021 which accounted for 10 31 and 6 42 in two samples of g1 s1 and s2 comparing the microbial community structure of g1 s samples and g2 s samples and it could be found that although organics were added during g2 the microbial community structure of the membrane surface samples s1 and s3 had little difference and the proportion of nitrosomonas in s3 could still reach 9 87 however the microbial community structure of the biofilm on biomass carrier s4 changed remarkably the nitrosomonas proportion decreased to 1 87 and a variety of anaerobic denitrification bacteria appeared such as pseudomonas 12 75 terrimonas 4 39 and denitratisoma 1 53 previous mbfr studies have reported the same phenomenon most organics are consumed in the bulk liquid when the cod n ratio is low and organics are difficult to diffuse to the biofilm on the surface of membrane downing and nerenberg 2008 therefore compared with the biomass carrier in the bulk liquid the microbial community structure of the biofilm on the membrane was not significantly affected by organics the nitrosomonas proportion of the membrane surface sample s5 showed a significant decrease 1 19 during g3 this indicated that with the increase of the influent cod n ratio more organics diffused to the membrane surface and affected the community structure of the biofilm the major microbial genera in sample s5 were pseudomonas 23 96 zoogloea 17 61 and norank f saprospiraceae 9 63 which indicated that denitrifying bacteria became the dominant bacteria in addition the community structure of the biofilm on biomass carrier s6 was similar to s5 in this phase therefore it could be inferred that the poor nitrification capacity of the reactor during g3 was due to the high concentration of organics which seriously inhibited the growth of nitrifying bacteria in this study the principal component analysis pca was used to explore the shift in the microbial community structure velvizhi and venkata mohan 2015 pca results were shown in fig 4 c and the interpretation degrees of pc1 and pc2 to the results were 76 56 and 16 85 respectively it could be seen from the figure that there was significant difference between the samples of g1 and g3 but the bacterial community composition of samples during the same phase had a high similarity meanwhile there was obvious difference between s3 and s4 and the bacterial community composition of s3 was similar to the samples in g1 while the bacterial community composition of s4 was different from that of other samples s4 was in the middle position between g1 and g3 from the perspective of pc1 axis which indicated that the bacterial community composition of s4 was partly similar to that of them the results of microflora analysis showed that no common nob was found in the main genera with relative abundance 1 of each sample although at the sampling stage of s1 and s2 small amount of no3 n were detected in the effluent this might because that some nobs present in the samples which were incorporated into others due to their low relative abundance and some bacteria with unknown functions might also have nitrite oxidation function the major nitrifying bacteria detected in each sample were nitrosomonas and the same phenomenon was also found in previous studies about short cut nitrification indicating that the main product of nh4 n oxidation was no2 n instead of no3 n yuan et al 2020 therefore the combination of microbial analysis and previous organics consumption analysis could indicate that h mbfr performed the snd process which was nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway during the study it could be found that nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria could achieve a good commensalism state when the influent cod n ratio was controlled in an appropriate range for example nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria enriched simultaneously in h mbfr during g2 3 5 membrane bio fouling analysis previous studies have reported that the cake layer on the membrane surface is one of the important factors affecting membrane pollution which is formed by the accumulation of sludge particles on membrane surface yin et al 2020 therefore the control ability to membrane bio fouling can be evaluated by comparing the properties of the cake layer on the membrane surface of the two reactors the cake layer consists of a variety of components such as microorganisms and various inorganic and organic substances including eps zhang et al 2021c among them eps is considered as material base during the formation of cake layer to promote the formation of fouling layer on the membrane surface so the higher the content of eps the more serious the membrane bio fouling will be eps is a polymer secreted by microorganisms under certain conditions which mainly contains protein and polysaccharides during the operation of the two reactors the content changes of protein and polysaccharides of the cake layer eps were shown in fig 5 a in the cake layer on the membrane surface of the two reactors protein was the main component of eps which was consistent with the results of previous studies deng et al 2016 pang et al 2021 from the figure it could be found that the contents of protein and polysaccharides in the cake layer eps of c mbfr increased with the prolongation of running time protein and polysaccharides increased from 19 16 mg g ss and 6 95 mg g ss to 41 24 mg g ss and 23 63 mg g ss respectively however the increase amplitude of the contents of protein and polysaccharides in the cake layer eps of h mbfr decreased significantly in the operational process protein and polysaccharides increased from 17 81 mg g ss and 6 62 mg g ss to 23 47 mg g ss and 9 67 mg g ss respectively in addition protein and polysaccharides are hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances respectively and polysaccharides is more likely to cause irreversible pollution to the membrane than protein therefore the increased pn ps protein polysaccharides ratio is considered to be an important reason for the decreased of membrane bio fouling propensity yao et al 2011 fig 5 a showed that the pn ps ratio of the cake layer eps of c mbfr decreased from 2 76 to 1 74 a decrease of 36 96 however there was no significant change in the pn ps ratio of the cake layer eps of h mbfr and its initial and final values were 2 69 and 2 43 respectively the above results might be caused by the fact that the biofilm thickness on the membrane surface of c mbfr was higher than that of h mbfr there were more microorganisms attached on the membrane surface of c mbfr compared with the h mbfr thus more eps could be synthesized and due to the encapsulation of the biofilm the eps was difficult to diffuse beyond it meanwhile the oxygen limited environment in the thick biofilm of c mbfr led to the high polysaccharide like eps production by the microbial metabolism zhang et al 2006 some studies have shown that the content of mlss in the reactor also affects the level of membrane fouling giwa et al 2019 when the mlss concentration in the reactor is high the thickness of the sludge dynamic layer around the membrane and sludge viscosity so the rate of membrane fouling increases dramatically giwa et al 2019 fig 5 b showed the changes of mlss concentration in the two reactors during the experiment the mlss concentration of c mbfr increased continuously with the extension of running time from 1337 36 mg l on the 10th day to 2634 71 mg l on the 60th day however the change of mlss concentration in h mbfr was the opposite that gradually decreased from 862 55 mg l to 193 52 mg l this was because the biomass carrier in h mbfr provided more attachment site for microbes and microorganisms mainly gathered on the surface of the biomass carrier to form the biofilm however most of the microorganisms in c mbfr were concentrated in the bulk liquid so the mlss concentration continued to rise with the proliferation and finally reached a stable value as can be seen from the above results h mbfr had the lower eps content the higher pn ps ratio in cake layer and the lower mlss concentration in bulk liquid in addition tmp can be directly used to evaluate the degree of membrane fouling as shown in fig 5 b during the contrast experiment the tmp of h mbfr did not show a significant change which only increased from the initial 0 02 mpa to 0 022 mpa however in order to maintain the same air inflow the tmp of c mbfr increased to 0 033 mpa on the 60th day which indicated that the membrane in the c mbfr subjected to the more serious membrane bio fouling therefore results of the contrast experiment showed that the membrane bio fouling control ability of h mbfr was higher than that of c mbfr 4 conclusions this study reports on the treatment of low cod n ratio wastewater by means of snd process in the h mbfr according to the optimized result of rsm the optimal removal efficiencies of nh4 n cod and tn 92 17 97 51 and 70 43 were obtained with the optimized conditions aeration pressure of 0 022 mpa and influent cod n ratio of 4 the influent cod n ratio had obvious influence on the microbial community structure of the reactor when the influent cod n ratio was 4 3 nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria could achieve a good commensalism state in the reactor to ensure efficient nitrogen removal in addition it was found that h mbfr showed lower membrane bio fouling than the c mbfr the obtained result could provide insightful method for treating low cod n ratio wastewater by applying the membrane aeration technology declaration of competing interest the

16301,the residues of nitrogen contaminants due to insufficient organic carbon sources in sewage has always been the main problem faced by wastewater treatment plants in the process of nitrogen removal in this study simultaneous shortcut nitrification and denitrification snd was achieved in the hybrid membrane aerated biofilm reactor h mbfr for treating low cod n ratio x223c 4 1 wastewater the effects of the aeration pressure and the influent cod n ratio in h mbfr were investigated and further optimized by the response surface methodology rsm by controlling the dissolved oxygen to achieve snd the removal efficiencies of nh4 n cod and tn of low cod n ratio wastewater reached maximum values of 95 52 96 61 and 72 23 respectively microbial community analysis showed that the influent cod n ratio had an obvious influence on the microbial community structure in particular ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and denitrifying bacteria had a good commensalism when the cod n ratio was 4 3 compared to control reactor the analysis of membrane bio fouling showed that h mbfr has a lower amount of extracellular polymeric substance eps on membrane and a low concentration of mlss in bulk liquid which is helpful for the longer term operation of h mbfr image graphical abstract keywords simultaneous shortcut nitrification and denitrification nitrogen removal hybrid membrane aerated biofilm reactor membrane bio fouling response surface methodology 1 introduction the removal of total nitrogen tn from wastewater has always been an important goal of wastewater treatment plant and how to meet the increasingly strict discharge standards economically and effectively that is a major challenge for conventional sewage treatment choi et al 2019 compared to physical and chemical technologies biological nitrogen removal bnr is widely used in wastewater treatment due to the advantages of more cost effective simple system and more environmentally friendly wang and he 2020 in the bnr process the carbon to nitrogen cod n ratio is considered to be a very pivotal indicator because the insufficient supply of organics in sewage will seriously restricts the efficiency of denitrification zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 however it is worth noting that the actual sewage in developing countries has characteristic of low cod n ratio usually less than 5 huang et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 as a conventional solution additional organic carbon sources such as acetic acid glucose and methanol etc are put in the denitrification process of sewage to ensure sufficient electron donors racys et al 2018 whereas this method increases the operating cost of wwtp and easily causes secondary pollution including the redundant sludge and cod of effluent yang et al 2021 therefore it is very necessary to develop a nitrogen removal process that can orient to the low cod n ratio wastewater the shortcut nitrification denitrification is also considered to be an effective process for nitrogen removal of wastewater under the low cod n ratio condition zhao et al 2018 nitrogen removal from wastewater by shortcut nitrification denitrification means that nh4 n oxidized to no2 n and no2 n directly reduced to nitrogen gas therefore this process can theoretically reduce the aeration requirement by 25 and save the organic carbon consumption by 40 zhao et al 2018 meanwhile it also can reduce the production of excess sludge lead to the positive role in the energy saving and emission reduction zheng et al 2018 inhibiting the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activity and making ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob become the dominant bacteria in the nitrification stage is the key to achieve the short cut nitrification denitrification process law et al 2019 wang et al 2019 as a main control method restricting dissolved oxygen do can decrease the growth rate of nob to achieve the enrichment of aob hou et al 2017 wang et al 2021b therefore the membrane biofilm reactor mbfr which can accurately control the aeration volume through aeration pressure will become a good choice to perform the shortcut nitrification denitrification process wang et al 2011 mbfr is a promising wastewater treatment technology based on membrane bioreactor mbr in recent years as one of the typical representatives the hollow fiber membrane is not only used as an aerator but also used to immobilize abundant microorganisms to form the biofilm hwang et al 2009 meanwhile mbfr as a counter diffusional biofilm process the oxygen flows through membranes from membrane lumen and is further utilized by biofilm attached on membrane surface while pollutants penetrate biofilm from wastewater side walter et al 2005 compared to conventional co diffusion biofilm reactor the opposing substrate diffusion provides a more suitable symbiotic environment for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms downing and nerenberg 2008 therefore an obvious aerobic anaerobic layered structure can be formed on the surface of aeration membrane and some scholars used the characteristic of mbfr to carry out researches about simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd zhang et al 2021a although mbfr has the above advantages in wastewater nitrogen removal the problem of membrane fouling has always been the main reason for limiting the application of membrane technology wu et al 2020 previous studies reported that using biomass carriers in mbr is an effective and promising method to control membrane fouling because biomass carriers facilitates the attached growth of microorganisms and reduces the concentration of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss in the reactor wang et al 2021a meanwhile the use of biomass carriers can reduce cake layer formation on the membrane surface and prevent pore blocking deng et al 2016 however using biomass carrier to alleviate membrane fouling has rarely been reported in the research on mbfr in the present study a new type of reactor called hybrid membrane aerated biofilms reactor h mbfr was designed that coupled biomass carrier and membrane aeration technology meanwhile h mbfr combined with simultaneous shortcut nitrification and denitrification snd process in order to achieve nitrogen removal from wastewater with low cod n ratio and the effective control of membrane bio fouling this study was aimed to 1 use the h mbfr for the wastewater nitrogen removal 2 evaluate the effects of aeration pressure and cod n ratio on the reactor and optimize by rsm 3 compare the variations of microbial community 4 investigate biomass carrier for the mitigation of membrane bio fouling the obtained results could provide the reference value for the nitrogen removal of low cod n ratio wastewater and the control of membrane bio fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration the h mbfr was made of polymethyl methacrylate pmma and had an effective volume of 50 l fig s1 the main components of the reactor included a frame with biomass carrier and a membrane module the frame was consisted of pmma plates threaded rods and a type of nylon biomass carrier dongyuan china fig s2 a hollow fiber microfiltration pvdf membrane module pore size of 0 4 μm and surface area of 2 m2 was installed in the middle of the frame h mbfr adopted the push flow mode specifically the wastewater was pumped from the bottom of the reactor using a peristaltic pump bt 300 2 j longer china and the effluent was discharged from the top of the reactor compressed air was supplied to the membrane lumen by an air pump and the transmembrane pressure was measured by a pressure gage and manually controlled with a valve the reactor temperature was maintained at 30 1 c by a heating rod and a mixing pump was used to mix the bulk liquid in reactor moreover h mbfr was covered with shading cloth to avoid the growth of photosynthetic microorganisms 2 2 inoculated sludge and wastewater the original sludge that was collected from shenshuiwan municipal wastewater treatment plant shenyang china and it was washed three times with deionized water before inoculation the initial cod concentration of the supernatant of inoculated sludge was 26 38 mg l ch3coona nh4 2so4 and k2hpo4 were used as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources of the synthetic wastewater respectively and the wastewater had the following composition in 1 l mg l k2hpo4 50 feso4 7h2o 10 cacl2 20 mgso4 7h2o 30 meanwhile the trace minerals were introduced into the solution through μg l mncl2 4h2o 0 2 cocl2 6h2o 0 24 znso4 7h2o 0 09 nicl2 6h2o 0 04 cuso4 6h2o 0 25 feng et al 2015 the ph of synthetic wastewater was controlled by nahco3 2 3 h mbfr startup and operation strategy the inoculated sludge was injected into the reactor at the start up period of biofilm culturing and then the synthetic wastewater was pumped through it the nh4 n concentration in the reactor was measured every 12 h the reactor was emptied when the nh4 n concentration decreased to 0 5 0 1 mg l and then the new synthetic wastewater 100 mg nh4 n l and discharged sludge reinjected into it the biofilm culturing lasted for 5 days and the new synthetic wastewater was injected into the reactor seven times during this stage on the fifth day the brown biofilm structure was observed on the biomass carrier which indicated the success of biofilm culturing subsequent experiments were conducted after the h mbfr was successfully startup as shown in table 1 the reactor was investigated for more than 277 days and the operation process was divided into five periods 2 4 eps extraction extracellular polymeric substance eps of cake layer was extracted with the modified heating method and the cake layer sample was collected from the membrane surface at the given time point guo et al 2018 the sample was washed for 3 times with deionized water and diluted to 2000 mg l then 10 ml mixture was taken and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min 4 c after the supernatant was discharged the sediment was re suspended to the original volume with pbs buffer including 2 mm na3po4 4 mm nah2po4 9 mm nacl and 1 mm kcl the re suspended sample was then heated in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min afterwards the mixture was centrifuged 12 000 rpm 4 c for 15 min and the supernatant was filtrated through 0 45 μm filter the filtrate was used as eps extraction solution for protein pn and polysaccharides ps analysis 2 5 chemical analyses and statistical optimization influent and effluent samples were collected by grab sampling and subjected to analyze chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n suspended solids ss and mlss were conducted according to standard methods apha 2005 nh4 n no3 n no2 n tn and cod were evaluated by a hach spectrophotometer dr 4000 hach usa and the cod was determined after rapid digestion polysaccharides content was determined by using anthrone sulfuric acid method and protein content was determined by using modified lowry method wang et al 2020 the sum of the protein and polysaccharides concentrations was regarded as the eps concentration zhou et al 2020 the do and temperature were monitored using a portable do meter jpbj 608 leici china and the ph was determined with a ph meter phbj 260 leici china the central composite design response surface methodology ccd rsm was used to describe the response surface properties of the experimental area and two significant factors aeration pressure and influent cod n ratio were optimized 2 6 sequencing analysis of microbial community the biofilm samples were collected when the reactor was in the stable state and each sample was sampled three times and mixed completely the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa was selected to dna extraction and the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes were amplified using universal primers 338f 806r zhang et al 2021b illumina miseq sequencing and analysis was performed at the majorbio bio pharm technology corporation shanghai china the usearch and the silva132 16s bacteria datebase were used during the analysis process operational taxonomic units otu with 97 similarity cutoff were clustered using uparse version 7 1 and chimeric sequences were identified and removed the taxonomy of each otu representative sequence was analyzed by rdp classifier version 2 2 against the 16s rrna database using confidence threshold of 0 7 according to the abundance distribution of otu in different samples the diversity level of each sample was evaluated 2 7 contrast experiment for membrane bio fouling conventional mbfr c mbfr and h mbfr were conducted to compare the membrane bio fouling in this study two reactors were identical except that there was no biomass carrier in the c mbfr fig s3 in the course of the contrast experiment the influent concentrations of nh4 n and cod were 61 42 1 97 mg l and 263 15 7 55 mg l respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt was maintained at 12 h and the initial aeration pressure was 0 02 mpa the two reactors were operated under the above conditions for 60 days and the protein concentration polysaccharides concentration and trans membrane pressure tmp were measured every ten days starting from the 10th day after the reactors operation 2 8 calculations the synthetic wastewater used in the experiment did not contain organic nitrogen therefore only the effluent concentration of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were investigated the tn removal efficiency was calculated as follow re moval efficiency c x i n f c x e ff c m e ff c n e ff c x i n f 100 the nitrite accumulation ratio nar was calculated based on the formula as follow n a r c m e ff c m e ff c n e f f 100 the snd rate formula as following s n d rate 1 c m e ff c n e ff c x inf c x e f f 100 where cx inf and cx eff is the influent and effluent concentration of nh4 n respectively cm eff is the effluent concentrations of no2 and cn eff is the effluent concentrations of no3 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of the h mbfr performance 3 1 1 performance of h mbfr during nitrification process as shown in fig 1 a the nh4 n removal efficiency of h mbfr increased from 66 25 to 96 81 after 10 days of continuous operation then the removal efficiency remained stable and the nh4 n concentration in the effluent was less than 2 mg l stage ⅰ moreover the effluent was dominated by nitrate and the average no3 n concentration of the effluent was 59 45 mg l when the nh4 n removal efficiency was stable while the concentration of no2 n in the effluent was always kept within a low concentration x223c1 49 mg l therefore in order to realize the short cut nitrification process the activity of nob needed to be inhibited to make aob become the dominant bacteria in the reactor many scholars believe that in addition to do temperature and ph also have significant effects on nob activity and higher temperature 30 c and ph 8 0 were considered favorable for the inhibition of nob therefore in the stage ⅱ the aeration pressure was reduced to 0 01 mpa while the temperature and ph were increased to 30 1 c and 8 0 0 3 respectively it could be seen from the fig 1 a that the removal efficiency of nh4 n has a plunge after changing the operating conditions the nh4 n removal efficiency was only 65 49 on the first day of the stage ⅱ but the effluent concentration of no2 n increased to 5 47 mg l in the following days the nh4 n removal efficiency gradually recovering and the nar continued to increase on the 46th day nh4 n removal efficiency and nar reached 91 9 and 82 34 respectively and the effluent no2 n concentration was 45 52 mg l the change trend of nh4 n removal efficiency indicated that aob activity was inhibited under the low do condition but it had strong adaptability for low do environment and the activity could gradually restored after a period of culture the variation trend of nar suggested that the operating conditions of stage ⅱ significantly inhibit the activity of nob thus the oxidation rate of no2 n to no3 n was reduced which leading to the accumulation of nitrite based on changes in the concentration of no2 n and no3 n it could infer that aob had replaced nob as the dominant bacteria in the reactor at this time 3 1 2 performance of nitrogen and cod removal in h mbfr at the end of stage ⅱ the nar was found to be stable at more than 80 which indicated that h mbfr had achieved the short cut nitrification process therefore organics were added as electron donor for the denitrification reaction in order to support snd process in the stage ⅲ as shown in fig 1 b on the first day of stage ⅲ the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased significantly with an effluent nh4 n concentration of 17 63 mg l eventually the nh4 n removal efficiency dropped to about 64 that was down 30 43 from stage ⅱ this was because heterotrophic bacteria compete nitrifiers for oxygen while autotrophic nitrifiers were at a disadvantage due to its slower growth rate leading to the reduction of nh4 n removal efficiency during the stage ⅲ the snd rate gradually increased from 43 06 to 77 55 and the removal efficiency of cod also showed a change trend similar to it fig 1 b the maximum cod removal efficiency could reach above 95 and the tn removal efficiency gradually increased from 34 13 to about 50 in this stage moreover it could be found that the remaining tn of effluent in the early was mainly no2 n because the denitrification ability is poor at this time and had insufficient capacity to reduce all the no2 n meanwhile previous studies have found that many denitrifying bacteria have incomplete denitrification pathway missing either nitrite or nitrate reductase therefore the conversion of nitrate to nitrite might also be one of the reasons why the effluent was mainly no2 n gao et al 2019 nguyen quoc et al 2021 however the main composition of tn in the later effluent was the nh4 n which was not oxidized by nitrification process therefore finding the balance between nitrification process and denitrification process so that the reactor has both good nitrification and denitrification capacity is the premise to achieve efficient nitrogen removal 3 2 effect of aeration pressure and cod n ratio on the h mbfr single factor experiment was used to evaluate the effects of aeration pressure and cod n ratio on the performance of the reactor 3 2 1 effect of aeration pressure on removal efficiency previous studies indicated that the oxygen supply is one of the main factors affecting the process of snd chiu et al 2007 so h mbfr was operated continuously under three aeration pressures 0 015 mpa 0 02 mpa and 0 025 mpa as shown in fig 2 a during 1 30 days aeration pressure of 0 015 mpa the removal efficiencies of nh4 n tn and cod were 65 29 48 62 and 96 61 respectively and the average do concentration in the reactor approached 0 0 2 mg l at this time then the aeration pressure was increased to 0 02 mpa on days 31 61 the nh4 n removal efficiency increased to 89 71 and the cod removal efficiency basically remained unchanged however the removal efficiency of tn did not significantly decrease with the increase of aeration pressure and remained at about 48 and the average do concentration in the reactor was about 0 5 0 2 mg l this result showed that the denitrification process was not inhibited when the aeration pressure was 0 02 mpa because the anaerobic environment was not diminished in days 62 90 the aeration pressure was further increased to 0 025 mpa at which time the nh4 n removal efficiency reached 96 11 cod removal efficiency was close to 100 however the tn removal efficiency decreased to 34 74 and was because the denitrification process was inhibited due to the larger aeration pressure at this stage at this stage the average do concentration in the reactor had risen to 1 1 0 2 mg l the above results indicated that the increase of aeration pressure within a certain range would not break the anaerobic environment in the reactor because the oxygen escaping from the membrane was preferentially used by nitrifying bacteria on the membrane surface rather than diffusing directly into the reactor however when the aeration pressure exceeds this range the denitrification rate will decrease obviously so it is very important to find an appropriate aeration pressure for h mbfr 3 2 2 effect of the cod n ratio on removal efficiency the cod n ratio of wastewater is an important parameter for bnr which can affect the performance of snd from two aspects zhang et al 2021a so h mbfr was operated continuously under three cod n ratio conditions 3 3 4 3 and 5 3 as shown in fig 2 b the average removal efficiency of nh4 n was 91 35 when the cod n ratio was 3 3 but the removal efficiency of tn was less than 50 meanwhile it could be found that the snd rate was 53 52 the average cod removal efficiency reached 98 56 and the remaining cod in the effluent was less than 7 mg l this indicated that the low tn removal efficiency was due to the incomplete denitrification process caused by the low organics content in the influent in days 31 60 cod n ratio of 4 3 although the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and cod decreased slightly 87 23 and 92 85 the tn removal efficiency increased to 78 89 the snd rate at this stage also increased to 91 62 which indicated that the carbon source in the wastewater at this time was relatively sufficient when the cod n ratio increased to 5 3 days 61 90 the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tn decreased to 83 53 54 79 and 52 91 respectively however the snd rate remained at 96 81 which indicated the tn in the effluent was mainly nh4 n that has not be oxidized it could be found that the tn removal efficiency significantly increased when the cod n ratio increased from 3 3 to 4 3 but the nh4 n removal efficiency did not show a significant decline the similar result was found in previous study downing and nerenberg 2008 and it reported that the reason for the insensitivity of nitrification rate to the cod loading was that the cod concentration in the reactor was not high so denitrification and cod degradation processes occurred exclusively in the bulk liquid however continuously increased cod concentration allow greater cod penetration into the aerobic biofilm on the membrane surface resulting the decrease of nitrification rate therefore it is necessary to ascertain an appropriate cod n ratio to ensure a high tn removal efficiency 3 3 multiple response optimization and comparative analysis in the current work the central composite design response surface methodology ccd rsm was used to examine the interrelation between the independent variables to predict the optimum conditions the highest removal efficiencies were achieved with optimization of process variables regression analysis and statistical significance of model equations used by design expert 8 0 almomani and bohsale 2020 the actual design of this study was presented in table s1 and statistical testing of the model was performed by the analysis of variance anova interaction between independent variables in h mbfr were shown on 3d surface plots fig 3 and the results of anova were listed in table s2 the optimal conditions calculated from the optimum formulation were aeration pressure of 21 85 kpa and cod n ratio of 4 and the corresponding values of nh4 n cod and tn removal efficiency were 95 52 96 61 and 72 23 respectively to confirm the validity of the statistical strategy parallel experiment was conducted under the optimal values of the operation parameters aeration pressure 0 022mpa cod n ratio 4 and the removal efficiency of nh4 n cod and tn reached 92 17 97 51 and 70 43 respectively fig s4 the results of the parallel experiment were similar to the predicted values indicating that the optimization results were reliable it can find according to the calculation of the theoretical formula that the theoretical cod n ratio required for the whole run denitrification with no3 n as electron acceptor is 2 86 if organic carbon sources can be fully used for denitrification and the theoretical cod n ratio required for the short cut denitrification with no2 n as electron acceptor is 1 71 shi et al 2022 however the consumption of organics in the actual wastewater treatment process is much higher than the theoretical value which is mainly due to the competition of other heterotrophic microorganisms for carbon sources gao et al 2020 some studies have shown that the cod n ratio required for the whole run denitrification process is usually 8 10 carrera et al 2004 fu et al 2009 moreover some researchers found that the stable short cut denitrification process could be achieved when the cod n ratio is 3 5 5 which is similar to this experimental result iannacone et al 2021 weissbach et al 2018 therefore it could be speculated that the snd process took place in h mbfr and the conclusion was further verified by the bacterial community analysis in section 3 4 the comparison of h mbfr with other nitrogen removal processes was shown in table 2 and the cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies of h mbfr could reach the same level as that of other processes meanwhile it could found that the cod n ratio demand of h mbfr was lower than other processes and it could ensure a high tn removal efficiency in addition the other processes in table 2 all used a multi stage reactor and compared with them h mbfr as a single stage reactor has advantages such as small floor area and convenient control therefore this study could provide a convenient and efficient approach for the treatment of wastewater with low cod n ratio 3 4 bacterial community analysis 3 4 1 analysis of microbial richness and diversity the influent cod n ratio is a major factor affecting the microbial community in mixotrophic treatment system zhou and xu 2020 therefore for further explore the nitrogen removal mechanism of h mbfr the bacterial communities were examined and analyzed under different conditions of influent cod n ratio table 3 showed the sampling phase sampling location and the alpha diversity index of the samples compared with g1 g2 had a higher community richness which was because the addition of organics led to the emergence of bacteria with cod degradation function and small amounts of organics did not affect the survival of nitrifying bacteria however the bacterial richness declined during g3 that might be due to the high organics concentration leading to the nitrifying bacteria were washed out in addition except g3 the richness and diversity of bacteria on the surface of biomass carrier were higher than those on the membranes surface during the same phase this was because organics preferentially affected the microbial structure on the surface of biomass carriers however when the cod concentration was high the aerobic microorganisms that grew on the biomass carrier were weed out but a small amount of aerobic microorganisms could still exist on the membranes surface downing and nerenberg 2008 additionally coverage was more than 90 in all the communities which demonstrated the truth of the results 3 4 2 analysis of the microbial community as shown in fig 4 a thirty one phyla were found in the six samples which contained twelve main phyla relative abundance 1 in at least one sample proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are common phyla in the activated sludge process which play a key role in the process of nitrogen removal and can participate in the degradation of macromolecular organics zhang et al 2021b it was worth noting that the main phyla of the all samples were the same and previous study had also confirmed the result that cod n ratio could affect the community succession but not affect the core microbiome in phylum level wang et al 2018 fig 4 b showed the bacterial taxonomic identification in genus level and forty seven kinds of genera relative abundance 1 in at least one sample were found in the six samples nitrosomonas as a common aob in the nitrogen removal system cao et al 2021 which accounted for 10 31 and 6 42 in two samples of g1 s1 and s2 comparing the microbial community structure of g1 s samples and g2 s samples and it could be found that although organics were added during g2 the microbial community structure of the membrane surface samples s1 and s3 had little difference and the proportion of nitrosomonas in s3 could still reach 9 87 however the microbial community structure of the biofilm on biomass carrier s4 changed remarkably the nitrosomonas proportion decreased to 1 87 and a variety of anaerobic denitrification bacteria appeared such as pseudomonas 12 75 terrimonas 4 39 and denitratisoma 1 53 previous mbfr studies have reported the same phenomenon most organics are consumed in the bulk liquid when the cod n ratio is low and organics are difficult to diffuse to the biofilm on the surface of membrane downing and nerenberg 2008 therefore compared with the biomass carrier in the bulk liquid the microbial community structure of the biofilm on the membrane was not significantly affected by organics the nitrosomonas proportion of the membrane surface sample s5 showed a significant decrease 1 19 during g3 this indicated that with the increase of the influent cod n ratio more organics diffused to the membrane surface and affected the community structure of the biofilm the major microbial genera in sample s5 were pseudomonas 23 96 zoogloea 17 61 and norank f saprospiraceae 9 63 which indicated that denitrifying bacteria became the dominant bacteria in addition the community structure of the biofilm on biomass carrier s6 was similar to s5 in this phase therefore it could be inferred that the poor nitrification capacity of the reactor during g3 was due to the high concentration of organics which seriously inhibited the growth of nitrifying bacteria in this study the principal component analysis pca was used to explore the shift in the microbial community structure velvizhi and venkata mohan 2015 pca results were shown in fig 4 c and the interpretation degrees of pc1 and pc2 to the results were 76 56 and 16 85 respectively it could be seen from the figure that there was significant difference between the samples of g1 and g3 but the bacterial community composition of samples during the same phase had a high similarity meanwhile there was obvious difference between s3 and s4 and the bacterial community composition of s3 was similar to the samples in g1 while the bacterial community composition of s4 was different from that of other samples s4 was in the middle position between g1 and g3 from the perspective of pc1 axis which indicated that the bacterial community composition of s4 was partly similar to that of them the results of microflora analysis showed that no common nob was found in the main genera with relative abundance 1 of each sample although at the sampling stage of s1 and s2 small amount of no3 n were detected in the effluent this might because that some nobs present in the samples which were incorporated into others due to their low relative abundance and some bacteria with unknown functions might also have nitrite oxidation function the major nitrifying bacteria detected in each sample were nitrosomonas and the same phenomenon was also found in previous studies about short cut nitrification indicating that the main product of nh4 n oxidation was no2 n instead of no3 n yuan et al 2020 therefore the combination of microbial analysis and previous organics consumption analysis could indicate that h mbfr performed the snd process which was nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway during the study it could be found that nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria could achieve a good commensalism state when the influent cod n ratio was controlled in an appropriate range for example nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria enriched simultaneously in h mbfr during g2 3 5 membrane bio fouling analysis previous studies have reported that the cake layer on the membrane surface is one of the important factors affecting membrane pollution which is formed by the accumulation of sludge particles on membrane surface yin et al 2020 therefore the control ability to membrane bio fouling can be evaluated by comparing the properties of the cake layer on the membrane surface of the two reactors the cake layer consists of a variety of components such as microorganisms and various inorganic and organic substances including eps zhang et al 2021c among them eps is considered as material base during the formation of cake layer to promote the formation of fouling layer on the membrane surface so the higher the content of eps the more serious the membrane bio fouling will be eps is a polymer secreted by microorganisms under certain conditions which mainly contains protein and polysaccharides during the operation of the two reactors the content changes of protein and polysaccharides of the cake layer eps were shown in fig 5 a in the cake layer on the membrane surface of the two reactors protein was the main component of eps which was consistent with the results of previous studies deng et al 2016 pang et al 2021 from the figure it could be found that the contents of protein and polysaccharides in the cake layer eps of c mbfr increased with the prolongation of running time protein and polysaccharides increased from 19 16 mg g ss and 6 95 mg g ss to 41 24 mg g ss and 23 63 mg g ss respectively however the increase amplitude of the contents of protein and polysaccharides in the cake layer eps of h mbfr decreased significantly in the operational process protein and polysaccharides increased from 17 81 mg g ss and 6 62 mg g ss to 23 47 mg g ss and 9 67 mg g ss respectively in addition protein and polysaccharides are hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances respectively and polysaccharides is more likely to cause irreversible pollution to the membrane than protein therefore the increased pn ps protein polysaccharides ratio is considered to be an important reason for the decreased of membrane bio fouling propensity yao et al 2011 fig 5 a showed that the pn ps ratio of the cake layer eps of c mbfr decreased from 2 76 to 1 74 a decrease of 36 96 however there was no significant change in the pn ps ratio of the cake layer eps of h mbfr and its initial and final values were 2 69 and 2 43 respectively the above results might be caused by the fact that the biofilm thickness on the membrane surface of c mbfr was higher than that of h mbfr there were more microorganisms attached on the membrane surface of c mbfr compared with the h mbfr thus more eps could be synthesized and due to the encapsulation of the biofilm the eps was difficult to diffuse beyond it meanwhile the oxygen limited environment in the thick biofilm of c mbfr led to the high polysaccharide like eps production by the microbial metabolism zhang et al 2006 some studies have shown that the content of mlss in the reactor also affects the level of membrane fouling giwa et al 2019 when the mlss concentration in the reactor is high the thickness of the sludge dynamic layer around the membrane and sludge viscosity so the rate of membrane fouling increases dramatically giwa et al 2019 fig 5 b showed the changes of mlss concentration in the two reactors during the experiment the mlss concentration of c mbfr increased continuously with the extension of running time from 1337 36 mg l on the 10th day to 2634 71 mg l on the 60th day however the change of mlss concentration in h mbfr was the opposite that gradually decreased from 862 55 mg l to 193 52 mg l this was because the biomass carrier in h mbfr provided more attachment site for microbes and microorganisms mainly gathered on the surface of the biomass carrier to form the biofilm however most of the microorganisms in c mbfr were concentrated in the bulk liquid so the mlss concentration continued to rise with the proliferation and finally reached a stable value as can be seen from the above results h mbfr had the lower eps content the higher pn ps ratio in cake layer and the lower mlss concentration in bulk liquid in addition tmp can be directly used to evaluate the degree of membrane fouling as shown in fig 5 b during the contrast experiment the tmp of h mbfr did not show a significant change which only increased from the initial 0 02 mpa to 0 022 mpa however in order to maintain the same air inflow the tmp of c mbfr increased to 0 033 mpa on the 60th day which indicated that the membrane in the c mbfr subjected to the more serious membrane bio fouling therefore results of the contrast experiment showed that the membrane bio fouling control ability of h mbfr was higher than that of c mbfr 4 conclusions this study reports on the treatment of low cod n ratio wastewater by means of snd process in the h mbfr according to the optimized result of rsm the optimal removal efficiencies of nh4 n cod and tn 92 17 97 51 and 70 43 were obtained with the optimized conditions aeration pressure of 0 022 mpa and influent cod n ratio of 4 the influent cod n ratio had obvious influence on the microbial community structure of the reactor when the influent cod n ratio was 4 3 nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria could achieve a good commensalism state in the reactor to ensure efficient nitrogen removal in addition it was found that h mbfr showed lower membrane bio fouling than the c mbfr the obtained result could provide insightful method for treating low cod n ratio wastewater by applying the membrane aeration technology declaration of competing interest the

16302,the increasing requirement for reclaimed water has made it necessary to utilize multiple disinfection processes for efficient removal of organoleptic indicators while guaranteeing microbial safety however there is not a proper way to appropriately distribute the operation load between different disinfection units this study provides a new method to optimize doses of sequential ozonation ultraviolet uv irradiation and chlorine disinfection units and investigates the synergistic effects of combined disinfection on the basis of pilot tests in this method the minimal ozone dose is determined first for the removal of colority the chlorine dose is then adjusted according to the required residual chlorine at last since it has few side effects and relatively low operating costs uv dose is determined by the remaining requirement of microbial indicator reduction by this method the effluent of disinfection could meet the discharge standards of colority residual chlorine and microbial indicators the operating cost was reduced by 48 7 mainly by lowering the ozone dosage the production of disinfection by products dbps was effectively controlled by decreasing the chlorine dosage compared with the original working conditions in the plant moreover ozone pretreatment effectively improved the coliform inactivation efficiency of chlorine and the combined disinfection method alleviated the tailing phenomenon and achieved a higher maximum log reduction of coliforms the proposed method can help water reclamation plants reasonably determine operational loads between disinfection units with low cost and guaranteed performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection dose synergistic effects ozone uv chlorine pilot test 1 introduction water shortage is a persistent worldwide problem and water reuse is an effective means to alleviate the scarcity of water resources hou et al 2021 li et al 2019 radcliffe and page 2020 in the last decade the applications of reclaimed water have been increasing yearly and many sewage treatment plants in china have been developed into water reclamation plants by upgradation and reconstruction dou and zhu 2018 pathogens are the main source of health risks in reclaimed water toze 2006 they can invade the human body through inhalation karra and katsivela 2007 tian et al 2020 and diet exposure they may cause nose and throat discomfort eye irritation respiratory tract and lung inflammation and other diseases who 2006 recently it has been reported that so far non pathogenic bacteria have been considered as potential risk factors by inducing lung inflammation after long term inhalation exposure liu et al 2021 disinfection has become an important part of water reclamation to minimize the microbial risk of reclaimed water due to the increasing demand for reclaimed water it is a prerequisite for water reclamation plants to meet stricter discharge standards with respect to a series of indicators such as colority residual chlorine and microorganisms for maximum reuse therefore current disinfection units must achieve efficient removal of pathogens and organoleptic indicators ozone uv and chlorine disinfection are the three most widely applied conventional disinfection technologies in water reclamation chai et al 2018 zheng et al 2017 ozone disinfection can effectively decrease colority and inactivate endospores giardia cryptosporidium and other persistent pathogens by virtue of their strong oxidizing ability and low production of harmful dbps however high investment and operating costs combined with poor continuous disinfection ability limit its application scenarios dong et al 2018 xu et al 2002 uv is a clean disinfection method which has fast and broad biocidal efficacy however its drawbacks include lack of persistent disinfection and decolorization abilities existence of photoreactivation and significant influence of influent quality on the disinfection effect bolyard et al 2019 brahmi et al 2010 nguyen et al 2019 chlorine disinfection has been widely applied due to its cost effectiveness simplicity and continuous disinfection however the potential health risks caused by chlorinated dbps and the weak removal ability of organoleptic indices make chlorine disinfection alone unable to meet the strict reclamation requirements watson et al 2012 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 additionally different disinfection methods can only inactivate limited types of microbes because of their intrinsically distinct inactivation mechanisms kong et al 2021 shi et al 2021 therefore a single conventional disinfection process is incapable of fulfilling the expectations of economy achieving broad bactericidal performance thorough removal of color and odor and low side effects all together in addition to the above conventional disinfection processes several other disinfection technologies have unique advantages the application of photocatalysis to wastewater disinfection has promising prospects owing to the scarcity of toxic dbps and solar energy input he et al 2021 with the advent of new electrocatalytic materials and the awareness of potential cost effectiveness by using electrical current as a disinfectant electrochemical or electric disinfection is becoming an alternative to traditional chemical disinfectants martínez huitle and brillas 2021 advanced chemical oxidation processes have gained wide recognition in wastewater treatment because of their high chemical pollutant and pathogen removal efficiency ao et al 2021 the above technologies have not yet been applied on a large scale due to limitations in cost applicability and technical bottlenecks bergmann 2021 chen et al 2021 rueda marquez et al 2020 consequently to meet the higher requirements for reclaimed water a combination of conventional disinfection processes is a reasonable choice many studies have been conducted on combinations of conventional disinfection processes ozone uv combined disinfection which treats the water with ozone and uv simultaneously is capable of producing strong oxidizing substances such as hydroxyl radicals this results in higher inactivation efficiency of bacillus subtilis spores and lower formation of trihalomethane and haloacetic acids chin and berube 2005 jung et al 2008 sequential uv chlorine uv irradiation first then chlorination and uv chlorine combined processes can effectively improve stability of water quality decrease genotoxicity and inhibit the formation of some dbps by reducing disinfectant doses or generating advanced oxidation jia et al 2019 li et al 2018a 2016 wang et al 2014 2011 2012 furthermore ozone or uv pretreatment may remove some chlorine resistant bacteria ding et al 2019 shekhawat et al 2021 however most studies have focused on stationary laboratory tests which could not reflect the continuous running state of water treatment there are few studies revealing the potential synergistic effects of combined disinfection processes on removal of basic physicochemical and microbial indicators another problem is that previous research on combined disinfection did not focus on the dose setting of actual operations in the plant thus advantages of combined treatment have not been authentically exhibited and unbalanced load distribution may also increase unnecessary operating costs and side effects the aim of this study was to establish a dose optimization method suitable for the ozone uv chlorine ozone first uv second and then chlorine sequential disinfection process and investigate the potential synergistic effects of the combined disinfection processes on the removal of basic physicochemical indexes microbial indicators and dbps in addition the operating costs and potential mechanisms are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale experimental setup the pilot tests were carried out in a large water reclamation plant in beijing china the reclaimed water was supplied for urban use replenishment of surface water and industrial applications as the influent of the entire continuous flow pilot system the secondary effluent from the plant first passed a sand filter which mimicked the ultrafiltration of the real plant and prevented interference of large particles then it sequentially flowed through the disinfection units of ozone uv and chlorine fig 1 different combinations of disinfection experiments were conducted using dose adjustment and valve control water tank washing and pipe flushing were performed once or twice a week to avoid contamination the ozone preparation system consisted of an oxygen generator shanghai changai electronic science technology china an industrial chiller acj 270 suzhou aoqb machinery china an ozone generator jindawanxiang china and an ozone analyzer me810 ebara jitsugyo japan the generated ozone was continuously sparged into the bottom of the ozone contact tank by a fine bubble diffuser and the residual ozone was destroyed by an exhaust destruction device different ozone concentrations measured by the ozone analyzer could be obtained by adjusting the power of the ozone generator the water flow rate of the pipeline uv equipment uv c180w1 5thq foshan comwin light electricity china and the final concentration of sodium hypochlorite were used to obtain the desired uv and chlorine doses respectively 2 2 disinfection experiments six groups of experiments single ozone single uv single chlorine ozone chlorine ozone uv and ozone uv chlorine were conducted the single ozone ozone chlorine and ozone uv chlorine experiments were used to determine the doses of ozone chlorine and uv respectively while all experiments were performed to reveal the potential synergistic effects between different disinfection units the disinfection experiments whose results were to be compared were arranged in close time periods to minimize interference due to the influent quality fluctuation thus ensuring a consistent trend of the disinfection effect during every experiment it was essential to pre run the entire system for at least one hour to guarantee the stability of the final disinfection effluent for each disinfection dose more than three parallel samples of the final disinfection effluent ozone effluent from combined disinfection and the corresponding sand filter effluent were collected the sand filter effluent was sampled exactly one disinfection retention time earlier than the final disinfection effluent to decrease the error introduced by the influent quality all sampling bottles centrifuge tubes and pipette tips were autoclaved at 120 c for 30 min before the experiments although water quality fluctuation was unavoidable in pilot scale tests the above measures were proven to guarantee relatively stable and reliable experimental results transferred ozone dose tod is generally applied in ozonation and represents the consumption of ozone cruz alcalde et al 2020 gomes et al 2017 it was chosen to characterize the ozone dosing the ozone reaction time in the ozone contact tank and the sampling interval of ozone effluent were both 15 min the same was true in case of practical operating conditions in the water reclamation plant the tod was calculated by eq 1 1 tod q g a s q l i q o 3 i o 3 o where qgas and qliq were set at 0 2 m3 h and 6 m3 h and represent the flow rate of ozone gas and influent water respectively o3 i and o3 o are the ozone concentrations of inlet and outlet gas respectively tod is expressed in mg o3 l the evaluation of uv doses at different flow rates was conducted at the research center for eco environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences china the technology employed was based on a micro fluorescent silica detector mfsd and computational fluid dynamics cfd whose principle and preliminary applications are renowned li et al 2017 2018b qiang et al 2013 chlorine reaction time in the chlorine contact tank and the sampling interval of chlorine effluent were both 30 min which was the same as the actual operating conditions in the water reclamation plant the residual chlorine was immediately measured after sampling the chlorine effluent and excess sodium thiosulfate was added for quenching the chlorine dose was calculated by eq 2 2 chlorine dose c c l q c l q c l q l i q where qcl and qliq represent the flow rates of sodium hypochlorite solution and influent water which were kept at 2 25 l h and 1 m3 h respectively except for the sequential ozone uv chlorine experiments in which qliq depended on the flow rate of the uv effluent ccl is the concentration of the sodium hypochlorite solution the chlorine dose ccl and residual chlorine were expressed in available chlorine which was used to characterize the same oxidation ability as pure chlorine mg l 2 3 water quality determination 2 3 1 basic physicochemical parameters microfiltration membranes 0 22 µm were used to filter water samples and the colority and absorbance at 254 nm uv254 of the filtrate were determined using a water quality colorimeter sd9012a shanghai xinrui instruments china and a uv visible spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa respectively total organic carbon toc was determined by combustion oxidation nondispersive infrared absorption method with a toc total nitrogen analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena ag germany turbidity was measured by a portable turbidimeter 2100q hach usa chemical oxygen demand cod was measured using cod digestion vials 2 415 825 cn hach usa ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and nitrite nitrogen no 2 n were determined by ion chromatography total nitrogen tn was measured by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method the total and free residual chlorine were determined using residual chlorine powder packets and a pocket colorimeter dr300 hach usa the determination of dbps was performed by gas chromatography at the center for environmental quality test tsinghua university 2 3 2 microbial indicators fecal coliforms fc e coli and total coliforms tc were determined by the enzyme substrate method using colilert reagent and the quanti tray 2000 quantification protocol idexx westbrook us heterotrophic plate count hpc was determined using the simplate multiple enzyme substrates method idexx westbrook us the above technologies were approved by the environmental protection agency epa total microorganisms were characterized by intracellular adenosine triphosphate catp which was determined using the quenchgone aqueous qga test kit and photonmaster pbm equipment package luminultra technologies frederickton nb canada intact cells in the water samples were collected by 0 2 µm syringe filters and then the lytic solution was added to the syringe catp determination was subsequently performed following the instructions of manufacturer finally catp concentration was converted into microbial equivalents based on the principle of an e coli sized cell containing 1 fg of atp and expressed in me ml the log reduction was used to describe the disinfection efficiency and was calculated by eq 3 3 log reduction lo g 10 n 0 n where n0 and n represent microbial concentration of influent and microbial concentration of effluent respectively the influent water quality indices in different disinfection experiments is shown in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 new method to optimize doses of disinfection units 3 1 1 design principles of the method this method is suitable for sequential ozone uv chlorine disinfection on the one hand if chlorination is in front of ozonation or uv irradiation the two treatments would react with chloride ion and residual chlorine respectively thus chlorine must be the final one to meet the requirement of residual chlorine on the other hand the pre ozone can enhance the uv transmittance of the water as reported in previous studies these are the reasons to choose ozone uv chlorine disinfection process moreover this sequential disinfection process is widely accepted by plant operators and the water reclamation plant studied in this work adopts this sequence for years the aim of this method is to optimize the disinfection doses to reduce costs while ensuring that the effluent meets the appropriate standards moreover the generation of dbps would also be reduced due to the decrease in chlorine dosage the method is divided into four steps fig 2 first it is a prerequisite to set reasonable discharge standards of effluent for colority residual chlorine and microbial indicator which are the main assessment indices of disinfection processes second considering the high cost and strong colority removal gehr et al 2003 shi et al 2021 xu et al 2002 ozone disinfection is assigned as the main undertaker of colority removal at the forefront of disinfection process and its role in microbial inactivation is not the focus the discharge standard for colority is set as the control indicator for obtaining a relatively low tod to reduce the energy cost of the overall disinfection process the optimized tod and the dose effect relationship of colority removal are obtained through ozone alone experiments on the pilot system third a reasonable dose range of chlorine disinfection is determined using a low residual chlorine discharge standard as the control indicator the low discharge standard of residual chlorine could decrease the chlorine dose which would control the generation of dbps the optimized chlorine dose is obtained by ozone chlorine experiments finally uv disinfection is a clean and relatively low cost disinfection process nguyen et al 2019 and it is used to make up for microbial removal the dose effect relationship for reducing microbial indicator and the optimized uv dose are acquired through ozone uv chlorine experiments it is noteworthy that the sequence of dose determination in this method is different from the sequence of disinfection units in the ozone uv chlorine disinfection process chlorine was used as the last disinfection unit to ensure the residual chlorine in the effluent however if the dose of chlorine is determined after the dose of uv which is determined using microbial indicator the effluent of uv already meets the standard of the microbial indicator this would waste the inactivation ability of subsequent chlorine disinfection resulting in an increase in operating costs on the other hand presence of uv before the chlorine disinfection unit cannot change the chlorine consumption therefore the uv dose should be determined based on the chlorine dose the ozone uv chlorine combined disinfection process adopting the above parameters can not only enable the effluent to reach standard stably but also synergistically reduces costs and minimize the generation of dbps in the disinfection process therefore it effectively guarantees the safe reuse of reclaimed water 3 1 2 the dose determination of three disinfection units on a pilot scale based on the discharge standard of water pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants db11 890 2012 china and the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for scenic environment use gb t18921 2019 china the predetermined discharge standards of colority residual chlorine and microbial indicator were established true colority was below 10 degree free residual chlorine was between 0 05 0 1 mg cl l and fc was no more than 3 cfu l colority removal was carried out by ozone alone experiments since there is no scientific model for the dose effect relationship so far the common functions which have the similar shape to the experimental result were used for fitting attempts and then the function with best fitting result the result with best r2 value and the value being more than 0 9 was selected after trying the linear boltzmann allometricl and various polynomial and exponential functions the expassoc function was found to be the best model to fit the effluent colority reduction the target tod which was approximately 1 mg l was the value required for the upper 99 confidence limit of the fitting curve to be 10 degree fig 3 a the tod surplus provided by the 99 confidence band and the weak colority removal ability of subsequent chlorine disinfection could provide multiple barriers to the compliance of effluent colority in addition if the colority of disinfection effluent does not meet standard due to the serious deterioration of secondary water quality a linear fitting curve of colority removal value with tod 1 mg l fig 3b can be used as a reference to increase the tod and meet the expected requirements this is designed as another insurance measure for the disinfection units to treat unpredictable emergency the chlorine dose residual relationship from ozone chlorine experiments in which tod was set as 1 mg l was best fitted by the exp1p1 function fig 3c the range of chlorine doses whose upper and lower 99 confidence limits met the free residual chlorine discharge standard was 0 89 1 39 mg cl l an intermediate value of 1 mg cl l was selected as the target chlorine dose for the fecal coliform indicator of the ozone uv chlorine experiments with 1 mg l tod and 1 mg cl l chlorine dose similar procedures with the allometricl function were employed to obtain the desired uv dose of about 12 mj cm2 fig 3d in this study considering that the efficiency of disinfection was greatly affected by water quality especially for uv gehr et al 2003 lee et al 2015 the dose of uv was determined during winter in which the secondary effluent quality was the worst of the year this ensured that the modelled uv dose were reliable throughout the year since water quality had a relatively weak influence on the change of residual chlorine and colority removal we determined the doses of ozone and chlorine in summer and autumn respectively in order to reduce costs besides obtaining the ozone uv and chlorine doses specific for each season is the best choice as shown in fig s1 the effluent colority and free residual chlorine also met the standards when the predetermined tod and chlorine dose were adopted in winter hence this method possesses strong flexibility and reliability and different water reclamation plants can use it to obtain disinfectant doses suitable for their own water qualities 3 1 3 cost analysis in this study the cost was also taken into account in the disinfection efficiency analysis specifically it could be further calculated that the ozone uv and chlorine dosages required for a log reduction of fc were 0 92 mg l 1 78 mj cm2 and 0 44 mg cl l respectively by linearly fitting the fc inactivation results of the three single disinfection experiments fig s2 table 1 shows the doses and operating costs of the disinfection units in the water reclamation plant where this study was completed operating costs consisted of depreciation the annual depreciation costs were calculated by multiplying the original price of equipment by the annual depreciation rate and direct electricity chemicals and maintenance costs in the original operating conditions of the plant ozone and uv had the highest and lowest operating costs respectively similar result was found by tak and kumar 2017 who showed that the lower electricity cost of uv makes up for its relatively high initial capital investment since the depreciation of equipment is fixed the analysis of disinfection costs at different doses followed the principle that direct costs are proportional to the doses and the depreciation costs are constant in summary the operating costs of ozone uv and chlorine required to remove a unit log of fc were calculated as 0 02085 0 003 and 0 00287 cny m3 respectively therefore the costs of the three disinfection processes in the water reclamation plant could be judged as ozone uv chlorine this indicated that chlorine disinfection was still a non negligible choice for cost control due to the low cost of its equipment however the serious tailing off phenomenon of chlorine disinfection fig 6b makes it difficult to achieve high standards for water reuse when applied alone according to the new disinfection process parameters the cost was expected to be reduced by 0 03166 cny m3 this was approximately 60 9 direct cost and 48 7 operating cost the decrease in operating cost was primarily derived from the reduction of ozone dosage which was consistent with the design principle of improving the economy by reducing the ozone dosage 3 2 synergistic effects of combined disinfection in this section 1 mg l tod was used for ozone chlorine and 1 mg l tod 1 mg l available chlorine was applied for the ozone uv chlorine experiments the removal effects of microbial indicators were represented by log reduction all experiments were performed using the same pilot system 3 2 1 colority and uv254 the removal efficiencies of colority and uv254 by three types of disinfection experiments single ozone single chlorine and ozone chlorine are presented in fig 4 both ozone and chlorine alone were able to decrease colority and uv254 further the removal efficiency was positively correlated with the disinfectant doses this implied that disinfectants reacted and oxidized organic matter with double bonds aromatic structures and other chromogenic groups xu et al 2002 the removal effect of ozone was significantly higher than that of chlorine because of its stronger oxidizing ability in addition the removal slopes at low tod 0 0 5 mg l slopes were 74 01 and 35 10 for colority and uv254 respectively were greater than that at high doses 0 5 mg l slopes were 18 49 and 14 83 for colority and uv254 respectively fig 4 because of the quick reaction between readily reacting substances which contributed a considerable portion of colority and low dose of ozone chlorine did not show a similar trend due to its relatively weak oxidization to some extent for example chlorine can only substitute hydrogen on the aromatic ring but cannot break the ring after 1 mg l ozone pretreatment the majority of easily oxidized materials were consumed and the remaining substances were more resistant to oxidation this was manifested in the slope for removal of colority and uv254 by ozone chlorine 5 44 and 0 74 for colority and uv254 respectively which was significantly lower than that of chlorine alone 15 40 and 2 84 for colority and uv254 respectively fig 4 the detailed changes in colority and uv254 after ozone and chlorine disinfection are shown in fig s3a and s3c regardless of whether ozone pretreatment was performed the uv unit could not change the colority fig s3b and uv254 fig s3d significantly which is consistent with previous studies usepa 2006 3 2 2 residual chlorine for the chlorine alone and ozone chlorine experiments the free residual chlorine was maintained at a low level while the total residual chlorine elevated significantly with increase in the chlorine dosage fig 5 which indicated that the residual chlorine at current doses was mainly composed of combined residual chlorine this result is in line with the theory of breakpoint chlorination in which chlorine reacts with ammonia to form chloramine when the mass ratio of residual chlorine to ammonia the influent ammonia concentration is shown in table s1 is less than 5 1 khawaga et al 2021 compared with chlorine disinfection alone the higher total residual chlorine of ozone chlorine disinfection showed that the pre reaction between readily reacting substances and ozone was capable of effectively reducing the rate of chlorine consumption the residual chlorine in the ozone uv chlorine experiments is shown in fig s1b and as expected there was no significant effect on the residual chlorine at different uv doses 3 2 3 microbial indicators when ozone was added alone fig 6 a four microbial indices were effectively inactivated with increasing tod and there was no obvious initial lag phase as reported in previous studies macauley et al 2006 shi et al 2021 this might be due to the relatively superior water quality after sand filtration in this study compared to that of the secondary effluent and swine farm wastewater in the above two reports the log reduction of coliforms and hpc reached approximately 3 and 4 respectively at a 3 mg l tod when using chlorine alone fig 6b an initial lag phase was present at available chlorine doses ranging from to 0 0 5 mg l here the majority of chlorine reacted with non bacterial substances such as reductive organic matter and a small proportion of chlorine was used to inactivate microorganisms as the available chlorine doses rose to 0 5 1 5 mg l the total residual chlorine mainly composed of combined residual chlorine increased significantly fig 5 and the microbial inactivation entered a rapid phase with the further increase in available chlorine doses 1 5 mg l the tailing phenomenon occurred in the microbial inactivation curve which was possibly attributed to the occlusion of particles and the agglomeration of microorganisms li et al 2013 shi et al 2021 the maximum removal of the four microbial indicators in single chlorine experiments reached approximately 2 6 log for single uv disinfection fig 6c the strong inactivating effect showed the uv sensitive property of coliforms and inactivation rate reached about 3 5 log when the uv dose was 7 54 mj cm2 ozone treatment strengthened the subsequent chlorine performance in coliform inactivation fig 6b specifically subsequent chlorine disinfection directly entered the rapid inactivation stage when the available chlorine doses were 0 0 5 mg l the inactivation slopes were about 3 28 2 68 and 3 71 for fc e coli and tc respectively and 1 54 1 07 and 1 67 for single chlorine and then gradually moved to the tailing off phase with increasing available chlorine doses during this the maximal inactivation was improved by about one log as discussed in 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 pre ozone could remove most of the easily oxidized substances and effectively increase the residual chlorine concentration therefore it could be inferred that the proportion of chlorine utilized for microbial inactivation in the subsequent chlorination process would be significantly increased which was an important reason for the disappearance of the initial lag phase of chlorine disinfection in the ozone chlorine experiments moreover the maximum log reduction of coliforms by ozone chlorine disinfection reached close to 3 5 higher than 2 6 for single chlorine disinfection fig 6b when the fine bubbles of ozone contact with floc in the water the ozone can react to a deeper depth of the floc and break it by shear forces hashimoto et al 2021 which could expose the hidden cells within the particles this might explain why ozone chlorine disinfection could achieve a higher maximum log reduction of coliforms however the above synergistic effects were not observed in the hpc considering that the three types of coliforms in the present study only accounted for approximately one percent to one thousandth of hpc the difference between species and the existence of disinfection resistant bacteria might explain this phenomenon in contrast to ozone chlorine disinfection pre ozone treatment produced a negative effect on coliform inactivation in the subsequent uv unit fig 6c the inactivation slopes of ozone uv disinfection approximately 0 36 0 32 and 0 39 for fc e coli and tc respectively were smaller than that of single uv disinfection around 0 48 0 45 and 0 54 for fc e coli and tc respectively a similar tendency was observed in a previous laboratory study shi et al 2021 it is noteworthy that the uv254 of ozone effluent was significantly reduced shown in fig 4b according to previous studies this usually resulted in higher uv transmittance and better uv disinfection efficiency farrell et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 however many studies have also reported that ozone is able to cause oxidative damage to intracellular dna and induce the repair of dna damage such as base excision repair ber nucleotide excision repair ner and sos repair among these ner is considered to be the main repair mechanism of uv induced dna damage cadet and davies 2017 guilherme et al 2019 mazouzi et al 2017 poetsch 2020 sassa and odagiri 2020 hence compared with the retention time of a few seconds for uv disinfection 15 min of ozone pretreatment might provide the coliforms with sufficient time to activate their dna repair machinery in advance to protect them from uv irradiation judging from the above results the negative effect of ozone on subsequent uv inactivation of coliforms is stronger than the positive effect it may provide for the ozone uv chlorine experiments fig 6d at low uv doses 2 mj cm2 the inactivation of coliforms depended on ozone and chlorine and the addition of uv did not significantly improve the sterilization effect this does not mean that uv did not remove coliforms at low doses the possible reason could be that some easily uv inactivated coliforms might also be ozone and chlorine sensitive and the rest of coliforms requires a larger dose of uv to be inactivated when the uv doses were more than 2 mj cm2 the effect of uv was significant the fc maximum log reduction reached about 5 which was significantly higher than the upper limit of ozone chlorine disinfection 3 5 log reduction thus indicating the advantage of combining the three disinfection units however the inactivation of hpc presented obvious tailing off behavior and was maintained at approximately 2 5 log reduction under different uv doses cui et al 2020 also reported that the disinfection unit of an actual water plant had a low removal effect on hpc in which 3 mg l tod no less than 30 mj cm2 uv could only reduce 0 5 log hpc but 2 log fc thus it can be seen that the inactivation effect of hpc is somewhat different from that of coliforms which are considered as the indicator microorganisms for water pollution and fecal contamination and possess suitable correlation with the existence of pathogens di cesare et al 2020 it is important to pay greater attention to pathogens which have relatively poor parallelism with indicator microorganisms in reclaimed water such as chlorine resistant cryptosporidium ozone insensitive mycobacteria and uv resistant adenovirus the detailed changes in microbial indicators after the six types of disinfection are shown in fig s4 3 2 4 dbps and other indicators the dbps production by 2 5 mg l chlorine disinfection alone and 1 mg o3 l 1 04 mj cm2 uv 1 mg cl l synergistic disinfection were compared fig 7 the two processes had the same log reduction of fc but the amount of dbps produced by synergistic disinfection was significantly lower on the one hand the decrease in chlorine dosage was the primary reason on the other hand ozone was capable of destroying chlorination dbp precursors to some extent hua and reckhow 2013 therefore this result strongly proves that the new method presented in this study can effectively reduce the generation of dbps in addition to the above key indicators the removal effects of other water quality control indicators by combined disinfection were also analyzed in this study as presented in fig s5 among the three single disinfection methods only ozone alone could significantly lyse the cells to reduce the determination results of microbial equivalents by the atp assay moreover the combined disinfection processes did not show a synergistic effect on the removal of this indice there was no noteworthy removal effect on cod toc and turbidity by ozone uv and chlorine fig s6 the above physicochemical indicators of the disinfection effluent fluctuated with the variation in influent water quality this result is consistent with previous research chin and berube 2005 shi et al 2021 usepa 2006 xu et al 2002 an inconsistent observation is that ozone successfully removed turbidity in a previous study shi et al 2021 the reason for this might be the difference of water quality and tod between studies 4 conclusions in this study a method of flexibly optimizing the doses of disinfection units was proposed according to the characteristics of three prominent disinfection technologies and was verified by pilot tests this method was able to determine the load distribution of different disinfection units while achieving the discharge standards of colority residual chlorine and microbial indicators the lowest ozone and chlorine doses resulted in the lowest cost and generation of dbps furthermore ozone treatment effectively improved the inactivation efficiency of the subsequent chlorine disinfection the ozone uv chlorine process could alleviate the tailing off phenomenon and achieve a higher maximum log reduction this work reveals the synergistic effects of ozone uv and chlorine disinfection by pilot scale tests which has potential applications in reclaimed water treatment plants and can significantly improve cost effectiveness credit authorship contribution statement fan qin wei

16302,the increasing requirement for reclaimed water has made it necessary to utilize multiple disinfection processes for efficient removal of organoleptic indicators while guaranteeing microbial safety however there is not a proper way to appropriately distribute the operation load between different disinfection units this study provides a new method to optimize doses of sequential ozonation ultraviolet uv irradiation and chlorine disinfection units and investigates the synergistic effects of combined disinfection on the basis of pilot tests in this method the minimal ozone dose is determined first for the removal of colority the chlorine dose is then adjusted according to the required residual chlorine at last since it has few side effects and relatively low operating costs uv dose is determined by the remaining requirement of microbial indicator reduction by this method the effluent of disinfection could meet the discharge standards of colority residual chlorine and microbial indicators the operating cost was reduced by 48 7 mainly by lowering the ozone dosage the production of disinfection by products dbps was effectively controlled by decreasing the chlorine dosage compared with the original working conditions in the plant moreover ozone pretreatment effectively improved the coliform inactivation efficiency of chlorine and the combined disinfection method alleviated the tailing phenomenon and achieved a higher maximum log reduction of coliforms the proposed method can help water reclamation plants reasonably determine operational loads between disinfection units with low cost and guaranteed performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection dose synergistic effects ozone uv chlorine pilot test 1 introduction water shortage is a persistent worldwide problem and water reuse is an effective means to alleviate the scarcity of water resources hou et al 2021 li et al 2019 radcliffe and page 2020 in the last decade the applications of reclaimed water have been increasing yearly and many sewage treatment plants in china have been developed into water reclamation plants by upgradation and reconstruction dou and zhu 2018 pathogens are the main source of health risks in reclaimed water toze 2006 they can invade the human body through inhalation karra and katsivela 2007 tian et al 2020 and diet exposure they may cause nose and throat discomfort eye irritation respiratory tract and lung inflammation and other diseases who 2006 recently it has been reported that so far non pathogenic bacteria have been considered as potential risk factors by inducing lung inflammation after long term inhalation exposure liu et al 2021 disinfection has become an important part of water reclamation to minimize the microbial risk of reclaimed water due to the increasing demand for reclaimed water it is a prerequisite for water reclamation plants to meet stricter discharge standards with respect to a series of indicators such as colority residual chlorine and microorganisms for maximum reuse therefore current disinfection units must achieve efficient removal of pathogens and organoleptic indicators ozone uv and chlorine disinfection are the three most widely applied conventional disinfection technologies in water reclamation chai et al 2018 zheng et al 2017 ozone disinfection can effectively decrease colority and inactivate endospores giardia cryptosporidium and other persistent pathogens by virtue of their strong oxidizing ability and low production of harmful dbps however high investment and operating costs combined with poor continuous disinfection ability limit its application scenarios dong et al 2018 xu et al 2002 uv is a clean disinfection method which has fast and broad biocidal efficacy however its drawbacks include lack of persistent disinfection and decolorization abilities existence of photoreactivation and significant influence of influent quality on the disinfection effect bolyard et al 2019 brahmi et al 2010 nguyen et al 2019 chlorine disinfection has been widely applied due to its cost effectiveness simplicity and continuous disinfection however the potential health risks caused by chlorinated dbps and the weak removal ability of organoleptic indices make chlorine disinfection alone unable to meet the strict reclamation requirements watson et al 2012 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 additionally different disinfection methods can only inactivate limited types of microbes because of their intrinsically distinct inactivation mechanisms kong et al 2021 shi et al 2021 therefore a single conventional disinfection process is incapable of fulfilling the expectations of economy achieving broad bactericidal performance thorough removal of color and odor and low side effects all together in addition to the above conventional disinfection processes several other disinfection technologies have unique advantages the application of photocatalysis to wastewater disinfection has promising prospects owing to the scarcity of toxic dbps and solar energy input he et al 2021 with the advent of new electrocatalytic materials and the awareness of potential cost effectiveness by using electrical current as a disinfectant electrochemical or electric disinfection is becoming an alternative to traditional chemical disinfectants martínez huitle and brillas 2021 advanced chemical oxidation processes have gained wide recognition in wastewater treatment because of their high chemical pollutant and pathogen removal efficiency ao et al 2021 the above technologies have not yet been applied on a large scale due to limitations in cost applicability and technical bottlenecks bergmann 2021 chen et al 2021 rueda marquez et al 2020 consequently to meet the higher requirements for reclaimed water a combination of conventional disinfection processes is a reasonable choice many studies have been conducted on combinations of conventional disinfection processes ozone uv combined disinfection which treats the water with ozone and uv simultaneously is capable of producing strong oxidizing substances such as hydroxyl radicals this results in higher inactivation efficiency of bacillus subtilis spores and lower formation of trihalomethane and haloacetic acids chin and berube 2005 jung et al 2008 sequential uv chlorine uv irradiation first then chlorination and uv chlorine combined processes can effectively improve stability of water quality decrease genotoxicity and inhibit the formation of some dbps by reducing disinfectant doses or generating advanced oxidation jia et al 2019 li et al 2018a 2016 wang et al 2014 2011 2012 furthermore ozone or uv pretreatment may remove some chlorine resistant bacteria ding et al 2019 shekhawat et al 2021 however most studies have focused on stationary laboratory tests which could not reflect the continuous running state of water treatment there are few studies revealing the potential synergistic effects of combined disinfection processes on removal of basic physicochemical and microbial indicators another problem is that previous research on combined disinfection did not focus on the dose setting of actual operations in the plant thus advantages of combined treatment have not been authentically exhibited and unbalanced load distribution may also increase unnecessary operating costs and side effects the aim of this study was to establish a dose optimization method suitable for the ozone uv chlorine ozone first uv second and then chlorine sequential disinfection process and investigate the potential synergistic effects of the combined disinfection processes on the removal of basic physicochemical indexes microbial indicators and dbps in addition the operating costs and potential mechanisms are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale experimental setup the pilot tests were carried out in a large water reclamation plant in beijing china the reclaimed water was supplied for urban use replenishment of surface water and industrial applications as the influent of the entire continuous flow pilot system the secondary effluent from the plant first passed a sand filter which mimicked the ultrafiltration of the real plant and prevented interference of large particles then it sequentially flowed through the disinfection units of ozone uv and chlorine fig 1 different combinations of disinfection experiments were conducted using dose adjustment and valve control water tank washing and pipe flushing were performed once or twice a week to avoid contamination the ozone preparation system consisted of an oxygen generator shanghai changai electronic science technology china an industrial chiller acj 270 suzhou aoqb machinery china an ozone generator jindawanxiang china and an ozone analyzer me810 ebara jitsugyo japan the generated ozone was continuously sparged into the bottom of the ozone contact tank by a fine bubble diffuser and the residual ozone was destroyed by an exhaust destruction device different ozone concentrations measured by the ozone analyzer could be obtained by adjusting the power of the ozone generator the water flow rate of the pipeline uv equipment uv c180w1 5thq foshan comwin light electricity china and the final concentration of sodium hypochlorite were used to obtain the desired uv and chlorine doses respectively 2 2 disinfection experiments six groups of experiments single ozone single uv single chlorine ozone chlorine ozone uv and ozone uv chlorine were conducted the single ozone ozone chlorine and ozone uv chlorine experiments were used to determine the doses of ozone chlorine and uv respectively while all experiments were performed to reveal the potential synergistic effects between different disinfection units the disinfection experiments whose results were to be compared were arranged in close time periods to minimize interference due to the influent quality fluctuation thus ensuring a consistent trend of the disinfection effect during every experiment it was essential to pre run the entire system for at least one hour to guarantee the stability of the final disinfection effluent for each disinfection dose more than three parallel samples of the final disinfection effluent ozone effluent from combined disinfection and the corresponding sand filter effluent were collected the sand filter effluent was sampled exactly one disinfection retention time earlier than the final disinfection effluent to decrease the error introduced by the influent quality all sampling bottles centrifuge tubes and pipette tips were autoclaved at 120 c for 30 min before the experiments although water quality fluctuation was unavoidable in pilot scale tests the above measures were proven to guarantee relatively stable and reliable experimental results transferred ozone dose tod is generally applied in ozonation and represents the consumption of ozone cruz alcalde et al 2020 gomes et al 2017 it was chosen to characterize the ozone dosing the ozone reaction time in the ozone contact tank and the sampling interval of ozone effluent were both 15 min the same was true in case of practical operating conditions in the water reclamation plant the tod was calculated by eq 1 1 tod q g a s q l i q o 3 i o 3 o where qgas and qliq were set at 0 2 m3 h and 6 m3 h and represent the flow rate of ozone gas and influent water respectively o3 i and o3 o are the ozone concentrations of inlet and outlet gas respectively tod is expressed in mg o3 l the evaluation of uv doses at different flow rates was conducted at the research center for eco environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences china the technology employed was based on a micro fluorescent silica detector mfsd and computational fluid dynamics cfd whose principle and preliminary applications are renowned li et al 2017 2018b qiang et al 2013 chlorine reaction time in the chlorine contact tank and the sampling interval of chlorine effluent were both 30 min which was the same as the actual operating conditions in the water reclamation plant the residual chlorine was immediately measured after sampling the chlorine effluent and excess sodium thiosulfate was added for quenching the chlorine dose was calculated by eq 2 2 chlorine dose c c l q c l q c l q l i q where qcl and qliq represent the flow rates of sodium hypochlorite solution and influent water which were kept at 2 25 l h and 1 m3 h respectively except for the sequential ozone uv chlorine experiments in which qliq depended on the flow rate of the uv effluent ccl is the concentration of the sodium hypochlorite solution the chlorine dose ccl and residual chlorine were expressed in available chlorine which was used to characterize the same oxidation ability as pure chlorine mg l 2 3 water quality determination 2 3 1 basic physicochemical parameters microfiltration membranes 0 22 µm were used to filter water samples and the colority and absorbance at 254 nm uv254 of the filtrate were determined using a water quality colorimeter sd9012a shanghai xinrui instruments china and a uv visible spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa respectively total organic carbon toc was determined by combustion oxidation nondispersive infrared absorption method with a toc total nitrogen analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena ag germany turbidity was measured by a portable turbidimeter 2100q hach usa chemical oxygen demand cod was measured using cod digestion vials 2 415 825 cn hach usa ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and nitrite nitrogen no 2 n were determined by ion chromatography total nitrogen tn was measured by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method the total and free residual chlorine were determined using residual chlorine powder packets and a pocket colorimeter dr300 hach usa the determination of dbps was performed by gas chromatography at the center for environmental quality test tsinghua university 2 3 2 microbial indicators fecal coliforms fc e coli and total coliforms tc were determined by the enzyme substrate method using colilert reagent and the quanti tray 2000 quantification protocol idexx westbrook us heterotrophic plate count hpc was determined using the simplate multiple enzyme substrates method idexx westbrook us the above technologies were approved by the environmental protection agency epa total microorganisms were characterized by intracellular adenosine triphosphate catp which was determined using the quenchgone aqueous qga test kit and photonmaster pbm equipment package luminultra technologies frederickton nb canada intact cells in the water samples were collected by 0 2 µm syringe filters and then the lytic solution was added to the syringe catp determination was subsequently performed following the instructions of manufacturer finally catp concentration was converted into microbial equivalents based on the principle of an e coli sized cell containing 1 fg of atp and expressed in me ml the log reduction was used to describe the disinfection efficiency and was calculated by eq 3 3 log reduction lo g 10 n 0 n where n0 and n represent microbial concentration of influent and microbial concentration of effluent respectively the influent water quality indices in different disinfection experiments is shown in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 new method to optimize doses of disinfection units 3 1 1 design principles of the method this method is suitable for sequential ozone uv chlorine disinfection on the one hand if chlorination is in front of ozonation or uv irradiation the two treatments would react with chloride ion and residual chlorine respectively thus chlorine must be the final one to meet the requirement of residual chlorine on the other hand the pre ozone can enhance the uv transmittance of the water as reported in previous studies these are the reasons to choose ozone uv chlorine disinfection process moreover this sequential disinfection process is widely accepted by plant operators and the water reclamation plant studied in this work adopts this sequence for years the aim of this method is to optimize the disinfection doses to reduce costs while ensuring that the effluent meets the appropriate standards moreover the generation of dbps would also be reduced due to the decrease in chlorine dosage the method is divided into four steps fig 2 first it is a prerequisite to set reasonable discharge standards of effluent for colority residual chlorine and microbial indicator which are the main assessment indices of disinfection processes second considering the high cost and strong colority removal gehr et al 2003 shi et al 2021 xu et al 2002 ozone disinfection is assigned as the main undertaker of colority removal at the forefront of disinfection process and its role in microbial inactivation is not the focus the discharge standard for colority is set as the control indicator for obtaining a relatively low tod to reduce the energy cost of the overall disinfection process the optimized tod and the dose effect relationship of colority removal are obtained through ozone alone experiments on the pilot system third a reasonable dose range of chlorine disinfection is determined using a low residual chlorine discharge standard as the control indicator the low discharge standard of residual chlorine could decrease the chlorine dose which would control the generation of dbps the optimized chlorine dose is obtained by ozone chlorine experiments finally uv disinfection is a clean and relatively low cost disinfection process nguyen et al 2019 and it is used to make up for microbial removal the dose effect relationship for reducing microbial indicator and the optimized uv dose are acquired through ozone uv chlorine experiments it is noteworthy that the sequence of dose determination in this method is different from the sequence of disinfection units in the ozone uv chlorine disinfection process chlorine was used as the last disinfection unit to ensure the residual chlorine in the effluent however if the dose of chlorine is determined after the dose of uv which is determined using microbial indicator the effluent of uv already meets the standard of the microbial indicator this would waste the inactivation ability of subsequent chlorine disinfection resulting in an increase in operating costs on the other hand presence of uv before the chlorine disinfection unit cannot change the chlorine consumption therefore the uv dose should be determined based on the chlorine dose the ozone uv chlorine combined disinfection process adopting the above parameters can not only enable the effluent to reach standard stably but also synergistically reduces costs and minimize the generation of dbps in the disinfection process therefore it effectively guarantees the safe reuse of reclaimed water 3 1 2 the dose determination of three disinfection units on a pilot scale based on the discharge standard of water pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants db11 890 2012 china and the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for scenic environment use gb t18921 2019 china the predetermined discharge standards of colority residual chlorine and microbial indicator were established true colority was below 10 degree free residual chlorine was between 0 05 0 1 mg cl l and fc was no more than 3 cfu l colority removal was carried out by ozone alone experiments since there is no scientific model for the dose effect relationship so far the common functions which have the similar shape to the experimental result were used for fitting attempts and then the function with best fitting result the result with best r2 value and the value being more than 0 9 was selected after trying the linear boltzmann allometricl and various polynomial and exponential functions the expassoc function was found to be the best model to fit the effluent colority reduction the target tod which was approximately 1 mg l was the value required for the upper 99 confidence limit of the fitting curve to be 10 degree fig 3 a the tod surplus provided by the 99 confidence band and the weak colority removal ability of subsequent chlorine disinfection could provide multiple barriers to the compliance of effluent colority in addition if the colority of disinfection effluent does not meet standard due to the serious deterioration of secondary water quality a linear fitting curve of colority removal value with tod 1 mg l fig 3b can be used as a reference to increase the tod and meet the expected requirements this is designed as another insurance measure for the disinfection units to treat unpredictable emergency the chlorine dose residual relationship from ozone chlorine experiments in which tod was set as 1 mg l was best fitted by the exp1p1 function fig 3c the range of chlorine doses whose upper and lower 99 confidence limits met the free residual chlorine discharge standard was 0 89 1 39 mg cl l an intermediate value of 1 mg cl l was selected as the target chlorine dose for the fecal coliform indicator of the ozone uv chlorine experiments with 1 mg l tod and 1 mg cl l chlorine dose similar procedures with the allometricl function were employed to obtain the desired uv dose of about 12 mj cm2 fig 3d in this study considering that the efficiency of disinfection was greatly affected by water quality especially for uv gehr et al 2003 lee et al 2015 the dose of uv was determined during winter in which the secondary effluent quality was the worst of the year this ensured that the modelled uv dose were reliable throughout the year since water quality had a relatively weak influence on the change of residual chlorine and colority removal we determined the doses of ozone and chlorine in summer and autumn respectively in order to reduce costs besides obtaining the ozone uv and chlorine doses specific for each season is the best choice as shown in fig s1 the effluent colority and free residual chlorine also met the standards when the predetermined tod and chlorine dose were adopted in winter hence this method possesses strong flexibility and reliability and different water reclamation plants can use it to obtain disinfectant doses suitable for their own water qualities 3 1 3 cost analysis in this study the cost was also taken into account in the disinfection efficiency analysis specifically it could be further calculated that the ozone uv and chlorine dosages required for a log reduction of fc were 0 92 mg l 1 78 mj cm2 and 0 44 mg cl l respectively by linearly fitting the fc inactivation results of the three single disinfection experiments fig s2 table 1 shows the doses and operating costs of the disinfection units in the water reclamation plant where this study was completed operating costs consisted of depreciation the annual depreciation costs were calculated by multiplying the original price of equipment by the annual depreciation rate and direct electricity chemicals and maintenance costs in the original operating conditions of the plant ozone and uv had the highest and lowest operating costs respectively similar result was found by tak and kumar 2017 who showed that the lower electricity cost of uv makes up for its relatively high initial capital investment since the depreciation of equipment is fixed the analysis of disinfection costs at different doses followed the principle that direct costs are proportional to the doses and the depreciation costs are constant in summary the operating costs of ozone uv and chlorine required to remove a unit log of fc were calculated as 0 02085 0 003 and 0 00287 cny m3 respectively therefore the costs of the three disinfection processes in the water reclamation plant could be judged as ozone uv chlorine this indicated that chlorine disinfection was still a non negligible choice for cost control due to the low cost of its equipment however the serious tailing off phenomenon of chlorine disinfection fig 6b makes it difficult to achieve high standards for water reuse when applied alone according to the new disinfection process parameters the cost was expected to be reduced by 0 03166 cny m3 this was approximately 60 9 direct cost and 48 7 operating cost the decrease in operating cost was primarily derived from the reduction of ozone dosage which was consistent with the design principle of improving the economy by reducing the ozone dosage 3 2 synergistic effects of combined disinfection in this section 1 mg l tod was used for ozone chlorine and 1 mg l tod 1 mg l available chlorine was applied for the ozone uv chlorine experiments the removal effects of microbial indicators were represented by log reduction all experiments were performed using the same pilot system 3 2 1 colority and uv254 the removal efficiencies of colority and uv254 by three types of disinfection experiments single ozone single chlorine and ozone chlorine are presented in fig 4 both ozone and chlorine alone were able to decrease colority and uv254 further the removal efficiency was positively correlated with the disinfectant doses this implied that disinfectants reacted and oxidized organic matter with double bonds aromatic structures and other chromogenic groups xu et al 2002 the removal effect of ozone was significantly higher than that of chlorine because of its stronger oxidizing ability in addition the removal slopes at low tod 0 0 5 mg l slopes were 74 01 and 35 10 for colority and uv254 respectively were greater than that at high doses 0 5 mg l slopes were 18 49 and 14 83 for colority and uv254 respectively fig 4 because of the quick reaction between readily reacting substances which contributed a considerable portion of colority and low dose of ozone chlorine did not show a similar trend due to its relatively weak oxidization to some extent for example chlorine can only substitute hydrogen on the aromatic ring but cannot break the ring after 1 mg l ozone pretreatment the majority of easily oxidized materials were consumed and the remaining substances were more resistant to oxidation this was manifested in the slope for removal of colority and uv254 by ozone chlorine 5 44 and 0 74 for colority and uv254 respectively which was significantly lower than that of chlorine alone 15 40 and 2 84 for colority and uv254 respectively fig 4 the detailed changes in colority and uv254 after ozone and chlorine disinfection are shown in fig s3a and s3c regardless of whether ozone pretreatment was performed the uv unit could not change the colority fig s3b and uv254 fig s3d significantly which is consistent with previous studies usepa 2006 3 2 2 residual chlorine for the chlorine alone and ozone chlorine experiments the free residual chlorine was maintained at a low level while the total residual chlorine elevated significantly with increase in the chlorine dosage fig 5 which indicated that the residual chlorine at current doses was mainly composed of combined residual chlorine this result is in line with the theory of breakpoint chlorination in which chlorine reacts with ammonia to form chloramine when the mass ratio of residual chlorine to ammonia the influent ammonia concentration is shown in table s1 is less than 5 1 khawaga et al 2021 compared with chlorine disinfection alone the higher total residual chlorine of ozone chlorine disinfection showed that the pre reaction between readily reacting substances and ozone was capable of effectively reducing the rate of chlorine consumption the residual chlorine in the ozone uv chlorine experiments is shown in fig s1b and as expected there was no significant effect on the residual chlorine at different uv doses 3 2 3 microbial indicators when ozone was added alone fig 6 a four microbial indices were effectively inactivated with increasing tod and there was no obvious initial lag phase as reported in previous studies macauley et al 2006 shi et al 2021 this might be due to the relatively superior water quality after sand filtration in this study compared to that of the secondary effluent and swine farm wastewater in the above two reports the log reduction of coliforms and hpc reached approximately 3 and 4 respectively at a 3 mg l tod when using chlorine alone fig 6b an initial lag phase was present at available chlorine doses ranging from to 0 0 5 mg l here the majority of chlorine reacted with non bacterial substances such as reductive organic matter and a small proportion of chlorine was used to inactivate microorganisms as the available chlorine doses rose to 0 5 1 5 mg l the total residual chlorine mainly composed of combined residual chlorine increased significantly fig 5 and the microbial inactivation entered a rapid phase with the further increase in available chlorine doses 1 5 mg l the tailing phenomenon occurred in the microbial inactivation curve which was possibly attributed to the occlusion of particles and the agglomeration of microorganisms li et al 2013 shi et al 2021 the maximum removal of the four microbial indicators in single chlorine experiments reached approximately 2 6 log for single uv disinfection fig 6c the strong inactivating effect showed the uv sensitive property of coliforms and inactivation rate reached about 3 5 log when the uv dose was 7 54 mj cm2 ozone treatment strengthened the subsequent chlorine performance in coliform inactivation fig 6b specifically subsequent chlorine disinfection directly entered the rapid inactivation stage when the available chlorine doses were 0 0 5 mg l the inactivation slopes were about 3 28 2 68 and 3 71 for fc e coli and tc respectively and 1 54 1 07 and 1 67 for single chlorine and then gradually moved to the tailing off phase with increasing available chlorine doses during this the maximal inactivation was improved by about one log as discussed in 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 pre ozone could remove most of the easily oxidized substances and effectively increase the residual chlorine concentration therefore it could be inferred that the proportion of chlorine utilized for microbial inactivation in the subsequent chlorination process would be significantly increased which was an important reason for the disappearance of the initial lag phase of chlorine disinfection in the ozone chlorine experiments moreover the maximum log reduction of coliforms by ozone chlorine disinfection reached close to 3 5 higher than 2 6 for single chlorine disinfection fig 6b when the fine bubbles of ozone contact with floc in the water the ozone can react to a deeper depth of the floc and break it by shear forces hashimoto et al 2021 which could expose the hidden cells within the particles this might explain why ozone chlorine disinfection could achieve a higher maximum log reduction of coliforms however the above synergistic effects were not observed in the hpc considering that the three types of coliforms in the present study only accounted for approximately one percent to one thousandth of hpc the difference between species and the existence of disinfection resistant bacteria might explain this phenomenon in contrast to ozone chlorine disinfection pre ozone treatment produced a negative effect on coliform inactivation in the subsequent uv unit fig 6c the inactivation slopes of ozone uv disinfection approximately 0 36 0 32 and 0 39 for fc e coli and tc respectively were smaller than that of single uv disinfection around 0 48 0 45 and 0 54 for fc e coli and tc respectively a similar tendency was observed in a previous laboratory study shi et al 2021 it is noteworthy that the uv254 of ozone effluent was significantly reduced shown in fig 4b according to previous studies this usually resulted in higher uv transmittance and better uv disinfection efficiency farrell et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 however many studies have also reported that ozone is able to cause oxidative damage to intracellular dna and induce the repair of dna damage such as base excision repair ber nucleotide excision repair ner and sos repair among these ner is considered to be the main repair mechanism of uv induced dna damage cadet and davies 2017 guilherme et al 2019 mazouzi et al 2017 poetsch 2020 sassa and odagiri 2020 hence compared with the retention time of a few seconds for uv disinfection 15 min of ozone pretreatment might provide the coliforms with sufficient time to activate their dna repair machinery in advance to protect them from uv irradiation judging from the above results the negative effect of ozone on subsequent uv inactivation of coliforms is stronger than the positive effect it may provide for the ozone uv chlorine experiments fig 6d at low uv doses 2 mj cm2 the inactivation of coliforms depended on ozone and chlorine and the addition of uv did not significantly improve the sterilization effect this does not mean that uv did not remove coliforms at low doses the possible reason could be that some easily uv inactivated coliforms might also be ozone and chlorine sensitive and the rest of coliforms requires a larger dose of uv to be inactivated when the uv doses were more than 2 mj cm2 the effect of uv was significant the fc maximum log reduction reached about 5 which was significantly higher than the upper limit of ozone chlorine disinfection 3 5 log reduction thus indicating the advantage of combining the three disinfection units however the inactivation of hpc presented obvious tailing off behavior and was maintained at approximately 2 5 log reduction under different uv doses cui et al 2020 also reported that the disinfection unit of an actual water plant had a low removal effect on hpc in which 3 mg l tod no less than 30 mj cm2 uv could only reduce 0 5 log hpc but 2 log fc thus it can be seen that the inactivation effect of hpc is somewhat different from that of coliforms which are considered as the indicator microorganisms for water pollution and fecal contamination and possess suitable correlation with the existence of pathogens di cesare et al 2020 it is important to pay greater attention to pathogens which have relatively poor parallelism with indicator microorganisms in reclaimed water such as chlorine resistant cryptosporidium ozone insensitive mycobacteria and uv resistant adenovirus the detailed changes in microbial indicators after the six types of disinfection are shown in fig s4 3 2 4 dbps and other indicators the dbps production by 2 5 mg l chlorine disinfection alone and 1 mg o3 l 1 04 mj cm2 uv 1 mg cl l synergistic disinfection were compared fig 7 the two processes had the same log reduction of fc but the amount of dbps produced by synergistic disinfection was significantly lower on the one hand the decrease in chlorine dosage was the primary reason on the other hand ozone was capable of destroying chlorination dbp precursors to some extent hua and reckhow 2013 therefore this result strongly proves that the new method presented in this study can effectively reduce the generation of dbps in addition to the above key indicators the removal effects of other water quality control indicators by combined disinfection were also analyzed in this study as presented in fig s5 among the three single disinfection methods only ozone alone could significantly lyse the cells to reduce the determination results of microbial equivalents by the atp assay moreover the combined disinfection processes did not show a synergistic effect on the removal of this indice there was no noteworthy removal effect on cod toc and turbidity by ozone uv and chlorine fig s6 the above physicochemical indicators of the disinfection effluent fluctuated with the variation in influent water quality this result is consistent with previous research chin and berube 2005 shi et al 2021 usepa 2006 xu et al 2002 an inconsistent observation is that ozone successfully removed turbidity in a previous study shi et al 2021 the reason for this might be the difference of water quality and tod between studies 4 conclusions in this study a method of flexibly optimizing the doses of disinfection units was proposed according to the characteristics of three prominent disinfection technologies and was verified by pilot tests this method was able to determine the load distribution of different disinfection units while achieving the discharge standards of colority residual chlorine and microbial indicators the lowest ozone and chlorine doses resulted in the lowest cost and generation of dbps furthermore ozone treatment effectively improved the inactivation efficiency of the subsequent chlorine disinfection the ozone uv chlorine process could alleviate the tailing off phenomenon and achieve a higher maximum log reduction this work reveals the synergistic effects of ozone uv and chlorine disinfection by pilot scale tests which has potential applications in reclaimed water treatment plants and can significantly improve cost effectiveness credit authorship contribution statement fan qin wei

16303,the novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs have become widespread as a consequence of the prohibition on the use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes however the transformation mechanism and potential environmental risk are largely unclear in this study we have explored the phototransformation behavior of the most abundant nbfrs 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe in water under ultraviolet uv irradiation meanwhile the legacy 2 2 4 4 6 6 hexabromodiphenyl ether bde155 with similar structure was investigated contrastively results show that novel btbpe is more persistent than legacy bde155 with nearly four times slower photodegradation rate constants 0 0120 min 1and 0 0447 min 1 respectively 18 products are identified in the phototransformation of btbpe different from the only debrominated products formed in legacy bde155 transformation the ether bond cleavage photoproducts e g bromophenols are also identified in novel btbpe transformation compound specific stable isotope analysis csia confirms the phototransformation mechanism is mainly via debromination accompanying with the breaking of ether bond computational toxicity assessment implies that transformation products of btbpe still have the high kidney risks especially the bromophenols formed via the ether bond cleavage could significantly increase the health effects on skin irritation this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the photolytic behavior and potential risks of novel nbfrs and other structurally similar analogues keywords btbpe novel brominated flame retardants phototransformation compound specific isotope analysis degradation mechanism 1 introduction brominated flame retardants bfrs have caused a global environmental concern for several decades due to its serious harm to environment and human health in particular polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes have been prohibited or restricted in many countries renner 2004 tang 2013 accordingly as the important replacement of these banned bfrs several novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs are emerging into market particularly 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe is one of the most deployed nbfrs in recent years given the huge production and wide application for several decades nbfrs have been frequently detected in various environmental matrices including water wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 air ma et al 2012 sediment kolic et al 2009 shi et al 2009 biota samples verreault et al 2007 wu et al 2020 foods li et al 2015 lv et al 2017 and even in the human serum and breast milk ali et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 previous researches also revealed that nbfrs have potential neurotoxicity jin et al 2018 qu et al 2011 reproductive developmental toxicity ma et al 2018 and endocrine disruption johnson et al 2013 wang et al 2019 to aquatic organisms and humans what s worse similarity to legacy pbdes nbfrs could be accumulated in aquatic organisms and can possibly spread throughout the food chain hou et al 2021 wu et al 2020 greatly enhancing the potential risk to the ecosystems and humans generally uv induced reductive debromination is the most accepted pathway for pbdes phototransformation davis and stapleton 2009 wei et al 2013 similarly debromination mechanism was also observed in the photochemical transformation of nbfrs ling et al 2019 besides that the different ether bond cleavage pathway was proposed in the photochemical transformation of nbfrs zhang et al 2016 suggesting that the degradation mechanism of the legacy and novel brominated flame retardants are controversial what s more the previous phototransformation mechanism investigations of nbfrs were proposed only based on the relationship between the molecule structure of substrate and the identified intermediates which is impossible to clearly determine the main degradation processes as well as the rate limiting reaction more importantly some more toxic products e g dioxin like compounds were formed during the phototransformation of pbdes bendig and vetter 2013 su et al 2014 2016 thus it is very essential to investigate the transformation mechanism and the toxicity evolution of nbfrs to better understand the environmental behavior fate and potential risk to aquatic organisms and human health compound specific stable isotope analysis csia has been confirmed to provide reliable information for determining the reaction pathway elsner et al 2005 hofstetter and berg 2011 it can be not only to distinguish the type of transformation reaction aeppli et al 2012 birkigt et al 2015 but also to determine the key step of the reaction liu et al 2020 peng et al 2013 up to now only a few studies have reported the isotope fractionation in the photodegradation of pbdes ren et al 2021 rosenfelder et al 2011 while the isotope fractionation in nbfrs phototransformation is still unclear in order to probe the environmental transformation characteristic and mechanism of nbfrs and to better assess their environmental risk the photochemical transformation of a typical nbfrs btbpe in thf h2o under uv irradiation was investigated also its structurally similar pbde bde155 fig s1 under the same conditions was borrowed as a reference first the phototransformation kinetics of btbpe and bde155 were compared then the photoproducts were identified and employed to deduce its favored structural characteristics next the involved rate limiting reaction were determined by the stable carbon isotope analysis at last phototransformation pathways were tentatively proposed and the potential toxicities of btbpe as well as its photoproducts were assessed 2 material and methods 2 1 materials btbpe 99 9 purity and bde155 99 purity were purchased from accustandard 2 4 6 tribromophenol 100 mg l 1 in toluene and a stock solution of 39 pbdes bde aap a 15x were also obtained from accustandard used as standard for the intermediates the organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran thf hexane hex acetonitrile were hplc grade and provided by shanghai anpel ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was obtained from a milli q water purification system 2 2 irradiation experiments for the irradiation experiments a stock solution of 500 mg l 1 of btbpe in pure thf was prepared and 3 0 mg l 1 of btbpe was selected for photochemical experiment due to the analysis requirements on mass spectrometry and isotope ratio shown in text s1 the photolysis solutions were prepared by evaporating thf in an aliquot of the stock solutions and subsequently re dissolving in a mixture of thf h2o 6 4 solution without adjusting the ph 7 5 7 6 the irradiation experiments were performed with a photochemical reactor bl ghx v shanghai bilon instrument co ltd shanghai china equipped with a water refrigerated 100 w mercury lamp a water cooling system was applied to ensure a steady temperature around 27 2 c the reaction solution 25 ml was filled in pyrex tubes outer diameter 20 mm inner diameter 16 mm positioned circularly around the lamp the pyrex was used to filter the part of ultraviolet light with wavelengths less than 290 nm fang et al 2008 and the irradiation spectral around the surface of pyrex tubes is shown in fig s2 the dark control experiment was conducted in the same situation but with the tubes wrapped by foil all the experiments were conducted in at least triplicate 2 3 sample pretreatment 500 μl sample were taken from the reaction vessel at fixed intervals and then directly used for hplc analysis to identify the photoproducts and measure the stable carbon isotope composition the pyrex tube was withdrawn periodically then the solution was transferred into a 50 ml teflon centrifuge tube and was adjusted to ph 2 3 by h2so4 after that the solution was extracted by 3 ml hexane with 3 times the extracts were combined and dried by na2so4 then concentrated to near dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream and then dissolved in 100 μl of isooctane for gc ms analysis and gc irms analysis the recovery rate of btbpe and bde155 were 90 68 3 80 and 94 00 1 94 mean value standard deviation n 15 respectively 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 hplc for concentration analysis an agilent 1200 hplc with diode array detector and a zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 micron was employed to quantify the concentration of btbpe and bde155 the mobile phase was 100 acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min and the detection wavelengths for target compounds were 213 nm the quantification was done with a calibration cure fig s3 2 4 2 gc ms for photoproducts analysis an agilent gc ms 7890 5975b with electron ionization ei in full scan mode was adopted for the photoproducts analysis a db 5ms column 60 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm film thickness j w scientific was used the oven temperature program for btbpe was 70 c held for 1 min increased to 280 c at 10 c min and held for 2 min at last programmed to 300 c at 20 c min and held for 20 min and the oven temperature program for bde155 was 110 c held for 1 min increased to 180 c at 8 c min and held for 1 min followed by an increased to 240 c at 2 c min and held for 5 min then increased to 280 c at 2 c

was set from 50 to 800 2 4 3 gc irms for carbon isotope analysis a trace gc ultra isolink delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc irms thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa was hired to measure the δ13c values the method was borrowed from huang et al 2019 but with modifications on gc programs a db 5ms column 60 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm film thickness j w scientific was used with the following oven temperature program 70 c held for 1 min increased to 280 c at 10 c min and held for 2 min at last programmed to 300 c at 20 c min and held for 20 min the samples 1 μl were injected splitless with 1 1 ml min helium as the carrier gas and the combustion interface was maintained at a temperature of 1050 c all samples were run at least three times and the deviation is less than 0 5 and a standard mixture including 100 mg l 1 btbpe and 100 mg l 1 bde155 was tested begin and after every 3 or 4 samples to verify a constant instrumental condition more details for this method can be found in text s2 2 4 4 theoretical calculation quantum chemical calculation was performed using gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 the geometry of btbpe was fully optimized with hybrid density functional theory dft using the m06 2x functional walker et al 2013 and the basis set of 6 31 g d the adverse effects of btbpe bde155 and their transformation products were assessed using a commercial advanced chemistry development acd labs percepta program acd labs percepta 2016 this tool can provide full complement of physiochemical properties the absorption distribution metabolism excretion adme and toxicity parameters including health effects it is proven that this program can successfully estimate the health risk of organic pollutants e g organophosphate flame retardants chen et al 2020 and short chain chlorinated paraffins wang et al 2021 2 5 data and statistical analysis 2 5 1 kinetic parameters analysis the phototransformation rate constants was expressed as the k notation following the pseudo first order kinetics eq 1 1 ln c t c 0 k t where c is the concentration of reactant and the subscript t and 0 represent the reaction time is t min and 0 min respectively k is obtained based on the linear regression of ln ct c0 vs time t without forcing through zero 2 5 2 carbon stable isotope analysis the stable carbon isotope data was expressed as the δ notation calculated by the follow equation eq 2 2 δ r s a m p l e r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where r s a m p l e and r s t a n d a r d are the ratios of 13c to 12c in samples and the international standard v pdb vienna pee dee belemnite respectively the carbon isotope enrichment factor was expressed as the ε notation formulated by the rayleigh equation eq 3 3 ln δ t 1 δ 0 1 ε 1000 ln f where f represents the fraction of compound remaining and is calculated as the ratio of ct to c0 ε is obtained from the slope of the linear regression of ln δ t 1 δ 0 1 vs ln f not forced through zero differences in the reaction rate caused by the presence of isotope was called kinetic isotope effect kie defined by the follow equation eq 4 4 kie l k h k where lk and hk are the reaction rate constants of the specific bonds which containing a light or heavy isotope respectively if the kie is not masked by other reaction steps that are less or not isotope sensitive or other kinetic phenomena its value is approached by the apparent kinetic isotope effect akie hofstetter and berg 2011 which considered the intramolecular isotopic competition during the rate determining step of a specific reaction and was formulated by the follow equation eq 5 5 akie l k h k a p p a r e n t 1 1 n z x ε where n is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule x is the number of carbon atoms at reactive sites z is the number of carbon atoms in identical reaction positions undergoing intramolecular competition here for both btbpe and bde155 x z because of their symmetrical molecular structure 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation kinetics fig 1 portrays the phototransformation kinetics of the representatives of nbfrs btbpe and legacy bfrs bde155 no significant degradation for the two bfrs was observed in the dark control however upon uv irradiation the concentration of both btbpe and bde155 declined rapidly and followed a pseudo first order kinetics model r2 0 997 the phototransformation rate constants k for btbpe was obtained as 12 04 0 08 10 3 min 1 nearly 4 times lower than that of bde155 44 69 1 12 10 3 min 1 these differences may be contributed to their absorbance behavior since the irradiation spectrum and absorption spectra of btbpe overlap is less than those of bde155 fig s2 and text s3 previous studies have shown that the wider overlap the faster photodegradation rate eriksson et al 2004 wei et al 2013 thus compared to the legacy bfrs bde155 the novel nbfrs btbpe may be less photo chemically reactive potentially causing more persistent in environment 3 2 transformation products 3 2 1 transformation products and debromination model of bde155 in order to better identify the phototransformation products of btbpe the identification of products was firstly performed on bde155 with the structural similarity by comparison with the standard solution of 39 pbdes bde aap a 15x only 9 debrominated photoproducts were identified and confirmed by their standards in the gc ms chromatogram fig s4 including bde100 75 47 32 28 17 15 8 and 3 with structures summarized in table s4 interestingly no bromophenols were detected indicating that fission of ether bonds seems unlikely to occur under the experimental conditions with the increase of irradiation time the less brominated congeners gradually appeared especially the para bromine fraction gradually increased fig s5a this suggests that ortho debromination is the dominant mechanism for bde155 transformation in agreement with the previous studies davis and stapleton 2009 eljarrat et al 2011 shih and wang 2009 wei et al 2013 more interestingly the debromination occurred preferentially in the phenyl ring without a 2 4 6 tribromo substitution model because the proportion of these products with a 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy is significantly larger in high brominated products 3br fig s5a this is contrary to the most accepted rule of stepwise reductive debromination of pbdes which believes that debromination usually occurs in the more highly brominated phenyl ring especially a fully substituted one wei et al 2013 possible explanation is that the two phenyl rings are relatively independent saeed et al 2020 and the 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy is more stable than other bromophenoxys this conjecture is confirmed by the results observed by fang et al 2008 that is the photochemical degradation rate of bde100 24 246 is much slower than that of bde99 24 245 and the major product of bde100 24 246 was bde75 4 246 instead of bde47 24 24 3 2 2 transformation products of btbpe totally 18 photoproducts were identified in the gc ms chromatogram fig s7 and their structures listed in table s5 were identified by their mass spectra fig s8 with the analysis discussed in text s4 besides 13 debromination photoproducts p1 p13 it was also noticed three co cleavage products p14 p15 tribromophenol tbp and p16 and two of their derived debrominated products p17 and p18 dibromophenol dbp this is similar with the observation in pure organic solvent zhang et al 2016 but the photoproducts formed by the cleavage of the phenoxy bond c4 o3 fig s1 has not been detected indicating that the phenoxy bond seems unlikely to break under our experimental conditions further the theoretical calculation shows the bond length 1 36 å of c4 o3 is shorter than that of c2 o3 1 43 å fig s9 confirming the cleavage of phenoxy bond is more difficult seen from the whole evolutions of the debromination products fig 2 a btbpe is debrominated stepwise and tends to keep a 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy unchanged since the products with this structure e g p1 p2 p4 p5 and p9 have a relative larger peak area by analyzing the isomers in the debromination products fig 2b the dominated tetrabromo products is p4 formed by removing an ortho bromine atom from the 2 4 dibromophenyl and the secondary tribromo products is p9 formed by removing a para bromine atom from the 4 monobromophenoxy instead of the 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy therefore we concluded that the ortho bromine atoms are more vulnerable than the para bromine atoms and the 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy is more stable than 2 4 dibromophenoxy and 4 monobromophenoxy as for the five co cleavage products two channels to break the ether bond were proposed one is the direct fission of c2 o3 to form photoproducts p14 and p15 and the other is the 1 3 hydeogen shift from c1 to the flanked o3 atom to form photoproducts p15 and p16 the details for the process are discussed in text s4 furthermore the relative area of p16 is much larger than that of p14 fig 2c indicating the 1 3 hydeogen shift is the main channel to break the ether bond comparing to the debromination products the yield of the co cleavage products is less fig 2d this result may be due to the faster photodegradation rate of these tribromophenol analogs zhao et al 2017 nevertheless it is not clear whether the ether bond cleavage is an important pathway through the analysis of the photoproducts and this should be further discussed 3 3 compound specific stable isotope analysis the evolution profiles of carbon isotope ratios for btbpe and bde155 during phototransformation are shown in fig 3 a after phototransformation both btbpe and bde155 have a degree of 13c enrichment while no significant carbon isotope fraction was observed in the dark control table 1 the significant carbon isotope fractionation can be quantified by the rayleigh equation eq 3 fig 3b and the corresponding isotope enrichment factors ε were obtained as 1 93 0 09 for btbpe and 2 92 0 08 for bde155 in order to elucidate the phototransformation mechanisms the apparent kinetic isotope effect akie was further derived eq 5 table 1 the akie for bde155 1 036 was very close to the theoretical carbon kinetic isotope effect kie calculated for c br bond cleavage 1 040 table s3 meaning that the cleavage of c br bond is the rate limiting reaction for bde155 phototransformation elsner et al 2005 hofstetter and berg 2011 this result is consistent with the above mentioned analysis that stepwise debromination is the main photodegradation pathway of bde155 however the akie of btbpe 1 028 seems to difficultly determine one rate limiting reaction for btbpe photo transformation that is if the cleavage of ch bond is the only rate limiting reaction in btbpe phototransformation the akie should close to 1 021 table s3 otherwise 1 040 for the cleavage of c br bond only in fact the observed akie of btbpe 1 028 is between the theoretical kie of ch bond cleavage 1 021 and c br bond cleavage 1 040 indicating that the two reaction pathways could occur simultaneously namely both c br bond cleavage and ch bond cleavage are the significant rate limiting reactions for btbpe and more details are discussed in text s7 3 4 phototransformation pathways based on the photoproducts analysis and csia analysis the phototransformation pathways of btbpe and bde155 were tentatively proposed and shown in fig 4 and fig s6 respectively a successive losses of bromine atoms was observed during the phototransformation of bde155 fig s5a in agreement with previous studies fang et al 2008 shih and wang 2009 thus debromination is the dominant mechanism for bde155 phototransformation resulting in formation of less brominated congeners whereas btbpe undergoes two pathways one is the stepwise debromination to form a series of lower brominated products p1 p13 pathway i in fig 4 and the other is the fission of the ether bond to form three tribromophenol homologue along with their debrominated derivatives p14 p18 pathway ii in fig 4 the products p1 p3 p4 p6 p14 p18 were also observed in btbpe phototransformation under pure organic solvents zhang et al 2016 moreover by compound specific stable isotope analysis the rate limiting reactions for btbpe were determined as the cleavage of c br bond accompanied with the breaking of c1 h bond which is the rate limiting step of the 1 3 hydeogen shift altarawneh and dlugogorski 2014 3 5 toxicity assessments since the original pollutants btbpe and bde155 have adverse effects on kidney system zhao et al 2020 and potential health risks via dermal absorption cao et al 2019 the potential toxicity of degradation products is necessary to be investigated the probability p of adverse effect on kidney system and skin irritation were tentatively assessed using acd labs percepta software acd labs percepta 2016 which is confirmed in the application of environmental chemistry e g organophosphate flame retardants chen et al 2020 and short chain chlorinated paraffins wang et al 2021 the obtained results were displayed in figs 5 and s10 herein p is between 0 and 1 and the greater the p value is the stronger the adverse effects would impose both btbpe and bde155 with p of 0 98 and 0 97 respectively have toxicity on kidney confirmed by the previous research that the effects of pbdes on kidney injury zhao et al 2020 and the stepwise debromination is a promising detoxification pathway because the debromination products were less toxic than the parent unlike bde155 the nephrotoxicity of the dibromo products is slightly increased than that of the tribromo products indicating that the nephrotoxicity of debrominated products of btbpe does not always decrease with the decreasing number of bromines to our best knowledge the mechanism of toxicity difference is still unclear and further study is needed meantime a significant toxicity increase in skin irritation was found for the co cleavage products of btbpe fig 5 implying that btbpe can be degraded to the more toxic products especially the bromophenols p15 p18 in addition to the increased skin irritation bromophenols has also been confirmed to have neurotoxicity lyubimov et al 1998 and endocrine disrupting effects olsen et al 2002 and even can be transformed to the more toxic brominated dioxins arnoldsson et al 2012 4 conclusion our study demonstrates the novel btbpe can be degraded under uv irradiation and its rate constants is four times lower than that of legacy bde155 indicating that the stronger environmental persistence of novel btbpe compared to the only debromination of bde155 the potential multiple pathways via debromination and the ether bond cleavage were observed in the phototransformation of btbpe using comprehensive photoproducts identification and compound specific stable isotope analysis furthermore the computational toxicity data show that btbpe can transform into the more toxic products especially the bromophenols p15 p18 were produced from the ether bond cleavage pathway greatly enhancing its environmental risk in a word the phototransformation of nbfrs should be paid great attention in particular the formation of the more toxic products declaration

legacy bde155 with nearly four times slower photodegradation rate constants 0 0120 min 1and 0 0447 min 1 respectively 18 products are identified in the phototransformation of btbpe different from the only debrominated products formed in legacy bde155 transformation the ether bond cleavage photoproducts e g bromophenols are also identified in novel btbpe transformation compound specific stable isotope analysis csia confirms the phototransformation mechanism is mainly via debromination accompanying with the breaking of ether bond computational toxicity assessment implies that transformation products of btbpe still have the high kidney risks especially the bromophenols formed via the ether bond cleavage could significantly increase the health effects on skin irritation this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the photolytic behavior and potential risks of novel nbfrs and other structurally similar analogues keywords btbpe novel brominated flame retardants phototransformation compound specific isotope analysis degradation mechanism 1 introduction brominated flame retardants bfrs have caused a global environmental concern for several decades due to its serious harm to environment and human health in particular polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes have been prohibited or restricted in many countries renner 2004 tang 2013 accordingly as the important replacement of these banned bfrs several novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs are emerging into market particularly 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe is one of the most deployed nbfrs in recent years given the huge production and wide application for several decades nbfrs have been frequently detected in various environmental matrices including water wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 air ma et al 2012 sediment kolic et al 2009 shi et al 2009 biota samples verreault et al 2007 wu et al 2020 foods li et al 2015 lv et al 2017 and even in the human serum and breast milk ali et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 previous researches also revealed that nbfrs have potential neurotoxicity jin et al 2018 qu et al 2011 reproductive developmental toxicity ma et al 2018 and endocrine disruption johnson et al 2013 wang et al 2019 to aquatic organisms and humans what s worse similarity to legacy pbdes nbfrs could be accumulated in aquatic organisms and can possibly spread throughout the food chain hou et al 2021 wu et al 2020 greatly enhancing the potential risk to the ecosystems and humans generally uv induced reductive debromination is the most accepted pathway for pbdes phototransformation davis and stapleton 2009 wei et al 2013 similarly debromination mechanism was also observed in the photochemical transformation of nbfrs ling et al 2019 besides that the different ether bond cleavage pathway was proposed in the photochemical transformation of nbfrs zhang et al 2016 suggesting that the degradation mechanism of the legacy and novel brominated flame retardants are controversial what s more the previous phototransformation mechanism investigations of nbfrs were proposed only based on the relationship between the molecule structure of substrate and the identified intermediates which is impossible to clearly determine the main degradation processes as well as the rate limiting reaction more importantly some more toxic products e g dioxin like compounds were formed during the phototransformation of pbdes bendig and vetter 2013 su et al 2014 2016 thus it is very essential to investigate the transformation mechanism and the toxicity evolution of nbfrs to better understand the environmental behavior fate and potential risk to aquatic organisms and human health compound specific stable isotope analysis csia has been confirmed to provide reliable information for determining the reaction pathway elsner et al 2005 hofstetter and berg 2011 it can be not only to distinguish the type of transformation reaction aeppli et al 2012 birkigt et al 2015 but also to determine the key step of the reaction liu et al 2020 peng et al 2013 up to now only a few studies have reported the isotope fractionation in the photodegradation of pbdes ren et al 2021 rosenfelder et al 2011 while the isotope fractionation in nbfrs phototransformation is still unclear in order to probe the environmental transformation characteristic and mechanism of nbfrs and to better assess their environmental risk the photochemical transformation of a typical nbfrs btbpe in thf h2o under uv irradiation was investigated also its structurally similar pbde bde155 fig s1 under the same conditions was borrowed as a reference first the phototransformation kinetics of btbpe and bde155 were compared then the photoproducts were identified and employed to deduce its favored structural characteristics next the involved rate limiting reaction were determined by the stable carbon isotope analysis at last phototransformation pathways were tentatively proposed and the potential toxicities of btbpe as well as its photoproducts were assessed 2 material and methods 2 1 materials btbpe 99 9 purity and bde155 99 purity were purchased from accustandard 2 4 6

tetrahydrofuran thf hexane hex acetonitrile were hplc grade and provided by shanghai anpel ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was obtained from a milli q water purification system 2 2 irradiation experiments for the irradiation experiments a stock solution of 500 mg l 1 of btbpe in pure thf was prepared and 3 0 mg l 1 of btbpe was selected for photochemical experiment due to the analysis requirements on mass spectrometry and isotope ratio shown in text s1 the photolysis solutions were prepared by evaporating thf in an aliquot of the stock solutions and subsequently re dissolving in a mixture of thf h2o 6 4 solution without adjusting the ph 7 5 7 6 the irradiation experiments were performed with a photochemical reactor bl ghx v shanghai bilon instrument co ltd shanghai china equipped with a water refrigerated 100 w mercury lamp a water cooling system was applied to ensure a steady temperature around 27 2 c the reaction solution 25 ml was filled in pyrex tubes outer diameter 20 mm inner diameter 16 mm positioned circularly around the lamp the pyrex was used to filter the part of ultraviolet light with wavelengths less than 290 nm fang et al 2008 and the irradiation spectral around the surface of pyrex tubes is shown in fig s2 the dark control experiment was conducted in the same situation but with the tubes wrapped by foil all the experiments were conducted in at least triplicate 2 3 sample pretreatment 500 μl sample were taken from the reaction vessel at fixed intervals and then directly used for hplc analysis to identify the photoproducts and measure the stable carbon isotope composition the pyrex tube was withdrawn periodically then the solution was transferred into a 50 ml teflon centrifuge tube and was adjusted to ph 2 3 by h2so4 after that the solution was extracted by 3 ml hexane with 3 times the extracts were combined and dried by na2so4 then concentrated to near dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream and then dissolved in 100 μl of isooctane for gc ms analysis and gc irms analysis the recovery rate of btbpe and bde155 were 90 68 3 80 and 94 00 1 94 mean value standard deviation n 15 respectively 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 hplc for concentration analysis an agilent 1200 hplc with diode array detector and a zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 micron was employed to quantify the concentration of btbpe and bde155 the mobile phase was

was set from 50 to 800 2 4 3 gc irms for carbon isotope analysis a trace gc ultra isolink delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc irms thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa was hired to measure the δ13c values the method was borrowed from huang et al 2019 but with modifications on gc programs a db 5ms column 60 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm film thickness j w scientific was used with the following oven temperature program 70 c held for 1 min increased to 280 c at 10 c min and held for 2 min at last programmed to 300 c at 20 c min and held for 20 min the samples 1 μl were injected splitless with 1 1 ml min helium as the carrier gas and the combustion interface was maintained at a temperature of 1050 c all samples were run at least three times and the deviation is less than 0 5 and a standard mixture including 100 mg l 1 btbpe and 100 mg l 1 bde155 was tested begin and after every 3 or 4 samples to verify a constant instrumental condition more details for this method can be found in text s2 2 4 4 theoretical calculation quantum chemical calculation was performed using gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 the geometry of btbpe was fully optimized with hybrid density functional theory dft using the m06 2x functional walker et al 2013 and the basis set of 6 31 g d the adverse effects of btbpe bde155 and their transformation products were assessed using a commercial advanced chemistry development acd labs percepta program acd labs percepta 2016 this tool can provide full complement of physiochemical properties the absorption distribution metabolism excretion adme and toxicity parameters including health effects it is proven that this program can successfully estimate the health risk of organic pollutants e g organophosphate flame retardants chen et al 2020 and short chain chlorinated paraffins wang et al 2021 2 5 data and statistical analysis 2 5 1 kinetic parameters analysis the phototransformation rate constants was expressed as the k notation following the pseudo first order kinetics eq 1 1 ln c t c 0 k t where c is the concentration of reactant and the subscript t and 0 represent the reaction time is t min and 0 min respectively k is obtained based on the linear regression of ln ct c0 vs time t without forcing through zero 2 5 2 carbon stable isotope analysis the stable carbon isotope data was expressed as the δ notation calculated by the follow equation eq 2 2 δ r s a m p l e r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where r s a m p l e and r s t a n d a r d are the ratios of 13c to 12c in samples and the international standard v pdb vienna pee dee belemnite respectively the carbon isotope enrichment factor was expressed as the ε notation formulated by the rayleigh equation eq 3 3 ln δ t 1 δ 0 1 ε 1000 ln f where f represents the fraction of compound remaining and is calculated as the ratio of ct to c0 ε is obtained from the slope of the linear regression of ln δ t 1 δ 0 1 vs ln f not forced through zero differences in the reaction rate caused by the presence of isotope was called kinetic isotope effect kie defined by the follow equation eq 4 4 kie l k h k where lk and hk are the reaction rate constants of the specific bonds which containing a light or heavy isotope respectively if the kie is not masked by other reaction steps that are less or not isotope sensitive or other kinetic phenomena its value is approached by the apparent kinetic isotope effect akie hofstetter and berg 2011 which considered the intramolecular isotopic competition during the rate determining step of a specific reaction and was formulated by the follow equation eq 5 5 akie l k h k a p p a r e n t 1 1 n z x ε where n is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule x is the number of carbon atoms at reactive sites z is the number of carbon atoms in identical reaction positions undergoing intramolecular competition here for both btbpe and bde155 x z because of their symmetrical molecular structure 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation kinetics fig 1 portrays the phototransformation kinetics of the representatives of nbfrs btbpe and legacy bfrs bde155 no significant degradation for the two bfrs was observed in the dark control however upon uv irradiation the concentration of both btbpe and bde155 declined rapidly and followed a pseudo first order kinetics model r2 0 997 the phototransformation rate constants k for btbpe was obtained as 12 04 0 08 10 3 min 1 nearly 4 times lower than that of bde155 44 69 1 12 10 3 min 1 these differences may be contributed to their absorbance behavior since the irradiation spectrum and absorption spectra of btbpe overlap is less than those of bde155 fig s2 and text s3 previous studies have shown that the wider overlap the faster photodegradation rate eriksson et al 2004 wei et al 2013 thus compared to the legacy bfrs bde155 the novel nbfrs btbpe may be less photo chemically reactive potentially causing more persistent in environment 3 2 transformation products 3 2 1 transformation products and debromination model of bde155 in order to better identify the phototransformation products of btbpe the identification of products was firstly performed on bde155 with the structural similarity by comparison with the standard solution of 39 pbdes bde aap a 15x only 9 debrominated photoproducts were identified and confirmed by their standards in the gc ms chromatogram fig s4 including bde100 75 47 32 28 17 15 8 and 3 with structures summarized in table s4 interestingly no bromophenols were detected indicating that fission of ether bonds seems unlikely to occur under the experimental conditions with the increase of irradiation time the less brominated congeners gradually appeared especially the para bromine fraction gradually increased fig s5a this suggests that ortho debromination is the dominant mechanism for bde155 transformation in agreement with the previous studies davis and stapleton 2009 eljarrat et al 2011 shih and wang 2009 wei et al 2013 more interestingly the debromination occurred preferentially in the phenyl ring without a 2 4 6 tribromo substitution model because the proportion of these products with a 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy is significantly larger in high brominated products 3br fig s5a this is contrary to the most accepted rule of stepwise reductive debromination of pbdes which believes that debromination usually occurs in the more highly brominated phenyl ring especially a fully substituted one wei et al 2013 possible explanation is that the two phenyl rings are relatively independent saeed et al 2020 and the 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy is more stable than other bromophenoxys this conjecture is confirmed by the results observed by fang et al 2008 that is the photochemical degradation rate of bde100 24 246 is much slower than that of bde99 24 245 and the major product of bde100 24 246 was bde75 4 246 instead of bde47 24 24 3 2 2 transformation products of btbpe totally 18 photoproducts were identified in the gc ms chromatogram fig s7 and their structures listed in table s5 were identified by their mass spectra fig s8 with the analysis discussed in text s4 besides 13 debromination photoproducts p1 p13 it was also noticed three co cleavage products p14 p15 tribromophenol tbp and p16 and two of their derived debrominated products p17 and p18 dibromophenol dbp this is similar with the observation in pure organic solvent zhang et al 2016 but the photoproducts formed by the cleavage of the phenoxy bond c4 o3 fig s1 has not been detected indicating that the phenoxy bond seems unlikely to break under our experimental conditions further the theoretical calculation shows the bond length 1 36 å of c4 o3 is shorter than that of c2 o3 1 43 å fig s9 confirming the cleavage of phenoxy bond is more difficult seen from the whole evolutions of the debromination products fig 2 a btbpe is debrominated stepwise and tends to keep a 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy unchanged since the products with this structure e g p1 p2 p4 p5 and p9 have a relative larger peak area by analyzing the isomers in the debromination products fig 2b the dominated tetrabromo products is p4 formed by removing an ortho bromine atom from the 2 4 dibromophenyl and the secondary tribromo products is p9 formed by removing a para bromine atom from the 4 monobromophenoxy instead of the 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy therefore we concluded that the ortho bromine atoms are more vulnerable than the para bromine atoms and the 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy is more stable than 2 4 dibromophenoxy and 4 monobromophenoxy as for the five co cleavage products two channels to break the ether bond were proposed one is the direct fission of c2 o3 to form photoproducts p14 and p15 and the other is the 1 3 hydeogen shift from c1 to the flanked o3 atom to form photoproducts p15 and p16 the details for the process are discussed in text s4 furthermore the relative area of p16 is much larger than that of p14 fig 2c indicating the 1 3 hydeogen shift is the main channel to break the ether bond comparing to the debromination products the yield of the co cleavage products is less fig 2d this result may be due to the faster photodegradation rate of these tribromophenol analogs zhao et al 2017 nevertheless it is not clear whether the ether bond cleavage is an important pathway through the analysis of the photoproducts and this should be further discussed 3 3 compound specific stable isotope analysis the evolution profiles of carbon isotope ratios for btbpe and bde155 during phototransformation are shown in fig 3 a after phototransformation both btbpe and bde155 have a degree of 13c enrichment while no significant carbon isotope fraction was observed in the dark control table 1 the significant carbon isotope fractionation can be quantified by the rayleigh equation eq 3 fig 3b and the corresponding isotope enrichment factors ε were obtained as 1 93 0 09 for btbpe and 2 92 0 08 for bde155 in order to elucidate the phototransformation mechanisms the apparent kinetic isotope effect akie was further derived eq 5 table 1 the akie for bde155 1 036 was very close to the theoretical carbon kinetic isotope effect kie calculated for c br bond cleavage 1 040 table s3 meaning that the cleavage of c br bond is the rate limiting reaction for bde155 phototransformation elsner et al 2005 hofstetter and berg 2011 this result is consistent with the above mentioned analysis that stepwise debromination is the main photodegradation pathway of bde155 however the akie of btbpe 1 028 seems to difficultly determine one rate limiting reaction for btbpe photo transformation that is if the cleavage of ch bond is the only rate limiting reaction in btbpe phototransformation the akie should close to 1 021 table s3 otherwise 1 040 for the cleavage of c br bond only in fact the observed akie of btbpe 1 028 is between the theoretical kie of ch bond cleavage 1 021 and c br bond cleavage 1 040 indicating that the two reaction pathways could occur simultaneously namely both c br bond cleavage and ch bond cleavage are the significant rate limiting reactions for btbpe and more details are discussed in text s7 3 4 phototransformation pathways based on the photoproducts analysis and csia analysis the phototransformation pathways of btbpe and bde155 were tentatively proposed and shown in fig 4 and fig s6 respectively a successive losses of bromine atoms was observed during the phototransformation of bde155 fig s5a in agreement with previous studies fang et al 2008 shih and wang 2009 thus debromination is the dominant mechanism for bde155 phototransformation resulting in formation of less brominated congeners whereas btbpe undergoes two pathways one is the stepwise debromination to form a series of lower brominated products p1 p13 pathway i in fig 4 and the other is the fission of the ether bond to form three tribromophenol homologue along with their debrominated derivatives p14 p18 pathway ii in fig 4 the products p1 p3 p4 p6 p14 p18 were also observed in btbpe phototransformation under pure organic solvents zhang et al 2016 moreover by compound specific stable isotope analysis the rate limiting reactions for btbpe were determined as the cleavage of c br bond accompanied with the breaking of c1 h bond which is the rate limiting step of the 1 3 hydeogen shift altarawneh and dlugogorski 2014 3 5 toxicity assessments since the original pollutants btbpe and bde155 have adverse effects on kidney system zhao et al 2020 and potential health risks via dermal absorption cao et al 2019 the potential toxicity of degradation products is necessary to be investigated the probability p of adverse effect on kidney system and skin irritation were tentatively assessed using acd labs percepta software acd labs percepta 2016 which is confirmed in the application of environmental chemistry e g organophosphate flame retardants chen et al 2020 and short chain chlorinated paraffins wang et al 2021 the obtained results were displayed in figs 5 and s10 herein p is between 0 and 1 and the greater the p value is the stronger the adverse effects would impose both btbpe and bde155 with p of 0 98 and 0 97 respectively have toxicity on kidney confirmed by the previous research that the effects of pbdes on kidney injury zhao et al 2020 and the stepwise debromination is a promising detoxification pathway because the debromination products were less toxic than the parent unlike bde155 the nephrotoxicity of the dibromo products is slightly increased than that of the tribromo products indicating that the nephrotoxicity of debrominated products of btbpe does not always decrease with the decreasing number of bromines to our best knowledge the mechanism of toxicity difference is still unclear and further study is needed meantime a significant toxicity increase in skin irritation was found for the co cleavage products of btbpe fig 5 implying that btbpe can be degraded to the more toxic products especially the bromophenols p15 p18 in addition to the increased skin irritation bromophenols has also been confirmed to have neurotoxicity lyubimov et al 1998 and endocrine disrupting effects olsen et al 2002 and even can be transformed to the more toxic brominated dioxins arnoldsson et al 2012 4 conclusion our study demonstrates the novel btbpe can be degraded under uv irradiation and its rate constants is four times lower than that of legacy bde155 indicating that the stronger environmental persistence of novel btbpe compared to the only debromination of bde155 the potential multiple pathways via debromination and the ether bond cleavage were observed in the phototransformation of btbpe using comprehensive photoproducts identification and compound specific stable isotope analysis furthermore the computational toxicity data show that btbpe can transform into the more toxic products especially the bromophenols p15 p18 were produced from the ether bond cleavage pathway greatly enhancing its environmental risk in a word the phototransformation of nbfrs should be paid great attention in particular the formation of the more toxic products declaration

16304,though metal resistance genes mrgs are of global concern in aquatic ecosystems the underlying factors responsible for mrgs dissemination especially in urban rivers on the vulnerable qinghai tibet plateau are rarely known here we collected 64 samples including water and sediments during the wet and dry seasons and effluents from six wastewater treatment plants wwtps during the dry season and measured 50 metal loid s 60 bacterial phyla and 259 mrgs we observed the distinct difference of metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs between water and sediments and the great seasonal changes in metal loid s and bacterial communities instead of mrgs thirty one metal loid s were detectable in the water with relatively low concentrations and no significant effects on the planktonic bacterial communities and mrgs interestingly the wwtps effluent partially promoted the prevalence of dissolved metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs along the river in the sediments the average concentrations of 17 metal loid s exceeded their corresponding background levels in this region and strongly influenced the bacterial communities and the mrgs sedimentary hg and cd mainly sourced from the intensive animal husbandry were the major pollutants causing ecological risks and largely shaped their corresponding resistomes moreover we found that bacterial communities predominantly determined the variation of mrgs in both water and sediments metagenome assembled genomes further reveals the widespread co occurrence of mrgs and antibiotic resistance genes args in mrg hosts our study highlighted the concern of effluents discharged from wwtps and emphasized the importance of controlling the anthropogenic inputs of sedimentary metal loid s in the plateau river ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metal loid s metal resistance genes mrgs bacterial community huangshui river tibet plateau 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau recognized as the third pole and roof of the world provides critical ecological services such as climate regulation water conservation biodiversity protection and economic benefits sun et al 2020 meanwhile it is also one of the most vulnerable areas on earth sensitive to climate changes and human pressures li and song 2021 in the past years unexpected inorganic and organic contaminations have been measured in various environmental matrices of this area wu et al 2016a wu et al 2016b resulting in a significant threat to its ecological services among them metal loid s as one of the most typical pollutants have drawn extensive concern due to their abundance toxicity and persistence antoniadis et al 2019 liu et al 2020b during the past decades many cities on the qinghai tibet plateau have experienced rapid industrialization expansive urbanization and intensive agriculture as a result high metal loid contaminations were reported in water and soil in the qinghai tibet plateau dai et al 2019b wu et al 2016a wu et al 2018 for example wu et al 2018 reported the average concentrations of 0 28 and 0 68 mg kg in hg and cd in soils in the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau 40 and 108 times of their average concentrations throughout mainland china chen et al 1991 therefore further investigating the occurrence and source of heavy metal loid s in urban rivers in the qinghai tibet plateau will help us develop effective strategies to protect these fragile ecological ecosystems metal loid s species and levels impact the composition and diversity of planktonic and sedimentary microbial communities in rivers du et al 2018 li et al 2021 due to a variety of their susceptibility exposure to metal loid s would enhance or reduce bacterial abundance by affecting enzyme activities metabolic diversity and the use of diverse organic substrates zhuang et al 2019 for example deltaproteobacteria acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes and nitrospira were significantly sensitive to zn and cu contaminations accompanied by eutrophic conditions wang et al 2020a furthermore several bacteria such as fontibacter mariniphaga symbiobacterium and thauera were preferentially enriched in the sediments with v cr and mn pollutions he et al 2021 however the current knowledge about the impacts of metal loid s on bacterial communities is limited in the qinghai tibet plateau rivers because of the wide usage of surface water in irrigation industrial production and recreational activities the incidence of resistomes in river ecosystems has been considered a crucial issue associated with water quality and public health reddy and dubey 2019 among discovered resistomes metal loid s could induce the generation and dissemination of metal resistance genes mrgs in bacterial communities for example chen et al 2019 reported significant correlations of cd with its target resistance genes e g czca czcc czcd in the upper 20 cm of soils in a copper tailing dam area china li et al 2021 reported the join effects of sedimentary metals such as cd pb and mn from human activities on cu and hg resistance genes in the fuhe river china apart from the mrgs metal loid s may also promote the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args via the co selection mechanisms of mrgs and args yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 found the significant correlations of heavy metals with both mrgs and args in the feces of a dairy farm china while zhao et al 2019 observed the co occurrences of eight metals i e as cd co cr cu hg ni and zn with specific args furthermore the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants e wwtps is of prominence in the contaminants including metal loid s and mrgs kuang et al 2020 and can act as an essential and underestimated source of mrgs in the relatively pure plateau riverine ecosystems therefore examining how these potential factors affect the occurrence and abundance of mrgs is important for developing the appropriate strategies for protecting the plateau riverine ecosystems from mrgs due to high elevation the qinghai tibet plateau has the largest area of seasonally frozen ground around the world dai et al 2019a huang et al 2019 and the seasonal freeze thaw cycle could play an important impact on the variation of the microbial communities kui et al 2019 hence we conducted a systematic study on the huangshui river to collect the water and sediment samples during the wet and dry seasons the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the occurrence and potential source s of 50 dissolved and sedimentary metal loid s in the huangshui river 2 study the seasonal dynamics of metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs in both water and sediments 3 examine the linkage s among environmental variables e g water temperature and ph metal loid s communities and mrgs in the river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the huangshui river originated from the haibei tibetan autonomous prefecture of qinghai province and is the largest tributary of the upper yellow river with a drainage area of 1 77 104km2 and a total length of 374 km liu et al 2020a it is in a typical arid and semi arid continental climate zone with complex landforms ranging from 1751 to 4858 m in altitude as a mother river of xining the capital of the qinghai province the huangshui river flows through the main urban areas of this city receiving all the e wwtps along its path we collected surface water and sediment samples from the huangshui river in july 2018 wet season and april 2019 dry season we sampled at 12 monitoring stations

samples were taken by a stainless steel grab sampler and then placed in two types of containers one type of container is the clean polyethylene zip lock bag for chemical analysis and another type is

laboratory measurements were conducted at the state key laboratory of plateau ecology and agriculture at the qinghai university china following the above mentioned standard methods which were recommended by the ministry of protection ecology and environment of china the collected water samples were stored at 4 c and all the above mentioned analyses were completed within 7 d after the water sample collections 2 3 metal loid s determination the water and sediment samples were transported to the laboratory at 4 c water samples were immediately examined for metal loid s when arrived at the key laboratory of water and sediment sciences ministry of education peking university for the pretreatment the water samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm whatman nylon filters and then acidified to ph 2 the sediment samples were air dried ground and sieved through a 63 μm mesh then approximately 0 5 g of sediment powder was placed into a 50 ml teflon crucible with hno3 h2o2 hf for digestion after digestion the solution was diluted to 50 ml using deionized water for further metal loid analysis specifically we used hno3 hcl instead of hno3 h2o2 hf to digest the sediments when measuring the hg concentrations for the water samples the k ca na and mg concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes leeman prodigy while the concentrations of mn fe al sr ba zn ni cr v cu li pb zr rb ge pd in sn cs ta w mo pt be co tl bi cd as and rare earth elements i e la ce pr nd sm eu gd tb dy ho er tm yb lu y sc were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermofisher x series ii the hg concentration was measured using atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs jitian ltd afs 9320 for the sediment samples we used icp oes to determine the concentrations of k ca na mg v cr mn fe ni cu zn al sr zr ba and pb whereas the hg and as concentrations were measured using afs we used icp ms to determine the concentrations of the remaining metal loid s we conducted strict quality control procedures as follows for all analyses firstly the precision and accuracy were verified by using certified reference materials such as gsb 04 1767 2004 and gsb04 1789 2004 for the water samples and gbw07426 for the sediment samples issued by the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of china table s2 secondly blank samples were set in duplicate with each batch treatment during the whole process of digestion and analysis the method detection limits mdl for metal loid s were 0 02 120 µg l in the water samples and 0 002 12 mg kg in the sediment samples table s4 while the ratio of the measured to standard metal loid concentrations were 0 86 1 13 for certified reference materials table s3 the standard deviation of samples in four replicates was 5 in all batch treatments and the detected concentrations of the certified reference materials were within the range of certified values 2 4 dna extraction sequencing and bioinformatic analysis the water samples were transported to the laboratory at 4 c in 24 h while the sediment samples were deliveryed to the laboratory at 80 c we conducted the pcr and 16s rrna sequencing at a commercial laboratory majorbio shanghai china following the methods described in wang et al 2020b specifically the collected water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes gttp millipore ireland while the collected sediment samples were processed further without the pretreatment the total dna was extracted from the filters or sediments by fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedical france following the manufacturer s protocols the quality and concentration of extracted dna were determined by a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de us the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr using universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 we used metagenomic shotgun sequencing to characterize the mrgs in the water and sediment samples metagenomic sequencing and library construction were performed on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform with a sequencing strategy of 150 bp paired end using high quality dna the raw sequencing reads were filtered using sickle version 1 200 and fastp version 0 21 0 to remove the low quality reads the clean reads were afterwards assembled using megahit li et al 2015 and the contigs longer than 500 bp were further employed to predict open reading frames orfs via prodigal version 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 zhu et al 2010 to annotate the mrgs and args we used the predicted protein sequences of orfs to align against the bacmet database pal et al 2014 and sarg yang et al 2016 respectively in the blastp software version 2 10 1 with an e value cutoff of 10e 5 the sequences were annotated as mrg like or arg like orfs if the blastp alignment had an identity 80 and a query coverages 70 yin et al 2018 coverages of the identified orfs were normalized to the size of each metagenome read bases copies gbp the accession numbers of sequences produced by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and by shotgun were prjna736664 and prjna790652 respectively 2 5 metagenomic binning and quality control of metagenome assembled genomes we performed binning process by metawrap v1 2 3 with default parameters uritskiy et al 2018 to obtain the metagenome assembled genomes mags completeness and contamination of refined mags were assessed using checkm v1 1 2 parks et al 2015 mrg carrying and mrg arg carrying mags were seleced on the basis of the previous annotation results to calculate the relative abundance of the selected mags the clean reads of the 64 samples were firstly mapped onto these selected mags using bbmap v38 86 https sourceforge net projects bbmap then their sequencing coverages were statistically analyzed by the script implanted in metawrap on the basis of these mapping results finally the sequencing coverages of the mags were normalized to the total bases of the clean reads resulting in their relative abundance fold gbp taxonomic positions of the mags were determined according to the genome taxonomy database gtdb using gtdb tk v1 3 0 classify wf workflow in default parameters parks et al 2018 2 6 assessment of sedimentary contamination and source identification we calculated the enrichment factor ef and the geo accumulation index igeo to evaluate the metal loid s accumulation in the sediments and identify their potential sources we determined the potential ecological risk index ri to assess the potential impact of metal loid s in aquatic ecosystems section 1 1 in si the united states environmental protection agency us epa pmf software version 5 0 was further applied to assess the potential sources of sedimentary metal loid s in the huangshui river after filling the non detectable values with half of the mdl referenced with the user guideline of pmf 5 0 we used a site metal loid matrix accompanied with an uncertainty data set during the pmf analysis factor value was set at 3 6 with random seeds the most optimal factor number was obtained through comparison of q true and q robust values residual analysis and correlation coefficients analysis in addition we also carried out the boot strap bs displacement disp and hybrid bsdisp methods to assess the data stability 2 7 statistical analysis we used nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis and similarity analysis anosim in the vegan package in r software version 3 4 2 to visualize the dissimilarities of metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs between the water versus sediments or between the wet versus dry season the difference of metal loid concentrations between the wet versus dry season in the water and sediments of the huangshui river was analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova in the ibm spss 19 0 source tracker analysis was performed to reveal the contributions of dissolved metal loid s and mrgs in the e wwtps in the dry season to these in the water of the huangshui river the differential bacteria and mrgs between the wet versus dry seasons were identified by stamp based on t tests with an adjusted false discovery rate the network of co occurrence among environmental variables metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs was employed by spearman correlation analysis correlation coefficient r 0 65 p 0 05 and visualized via gephi software version 0 9 1 finally a partial least squares path model pls pm in the vegan package in r software was used to quantify the effects of environmental variables metal loid s and bacterial communities on mrgs 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and sources of metal loid s in the water and sediments e wwtps along the huangshui river were the critical sources of metal loid s in the river water though the water of the huangshui river was not contaminated by the studied metal loid s possibly due to the dilution effect in the 35 water samples a total of 31 metal loid s was detected with the highest average concentrations in ca mean 78 4 mg l range 24 7 358 6 mg l na mean 66 7 mg l range 5 9 474 7 mg l and mg mean 21 9 mg l range 6 2 59 7 mg l whereas elements such as cd hg be pt and most of rees were not detectable fig 1 a and table s5 compared with the low elevation urban rivers in inland china we observed much lower mn and pb concentrations and higher fe and cr concentrations in the huangshui river table s6 overall the average pb hg cu zn as and cd concentrations were far below the first class in the surface water quality standard of china gb3838 2002 and the cr concentration was satisfied with the second class suggesting that metal loid pollution was not severe in the water of the huangshui river source tracker analysis further exhibited that e wwtps attributed to 40 0 100 of the variations in metal loid s in the monitoring stations closing to upstream or downstream of the wwtps i e effluent affected reach fig 1c the wwtps along the huangshui river are primarily equipped with conventional biological treatment systems table s7 which were designed for removing organic matters with heavy metal loid s as a side benefit karvelas et al 2003 the higher metal loid concentrations in the e wwtps were primarily due to their incomplete removal by microorganisms in activated sludge relative to the water the sediments of the huangshui river were more contaminated by the studied metal loid s especially by hg pb and cd which were potentially sourced from animal husbandry and metal manufacturing specifically all the studied metal loid s were detected in all the 29 sediment samples with the highest average concentration in al mean 58 4 g kg range 44 3 74 9 g kg ca mean 43 0 g kg range 18 3 120 1 g kg and fe mean 21 5 g kg range 17 2 27 8 g kg while pt and in had the lowest average concentration of 10 range 1 25 and 30 range 10 44 μg kg respectively fig 1b and table s5 we found 17 metal loid s with the average concentrations exceeding their corresponding background values in the soil of qinghai table s8 particularly of 3 82 times for hg 2 08 times for pb and 1 82 times for cd despite this the pb concentration was comparable with those in the lower lijiang river the lower yangtze river and the xiaoqing river in china while the cd cr and cu concentrations were much lower than those in the maozhou river the daqing river and the xiaoqing river in china table s9 the enrichment factor ef and geo accumulation index igeo also confirmed the great contribution of anthropogenic activities on the sedimentary hg cd rb and pb table s10 and section 2 1 in si while the potential ecological risks ri indicate hg and cd as the major pollutants causing ecological risks fig s2 and section 3 1 in si according to the positive matrix factorization pmf model figs 1d s3 and section 4 1 in si factor 1 interpreted as natural sources was predominately weighted by the elements such as ba ta na sn be and co factor 2 possibly related to animal husbandry wang et al 2021 was strongly correlated with hg ca and cd factor 3 potentially representing industrial activities dominated by metal manufacturing aral and vecchio sadus 2008 chai et al 2021a was mainly loaded on rb pb pt ge in li cr and ni 3 2 seasonal variation of metal loid s in the water and sediments the metal loid s varied significantly between the water and sediments and their seasonal variations were observed in both water and sediments non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis showed an extremely significant difference of metal loid s between the water and sediments figs 2 a and s4 anosim global r 0 999 and p 0 001 the metal loid s also demonstrated the discernable seasonal variations in both water and sediments figs 2a and s4 global r 0 764 p 0 001 for water global r 0 690 p 0 001 for sediments which was consistent with the previous studies in the yamuna river india parmar et al 2021 fen river china chai et al 2021b and tano river ghana nyantakyi et al 2019 in the water the concentrations of dissolved metal loid s e g fe ni sr ca v and co in the dry season were much higher p 0 05 than those in the wet season fig 2b possibly due to the relatively lower flow during the dry season the reduced water volume makes the dissolved metal loid s more concentrated in the liquid phase islam et al 2015 however the opposite consequence was found in the cu zn and al concentrations which may be related to their increased exports from human activities during the wet season furthermore the concentration of metal loid s e g cu mn zn v fe and ni in the e wwtps was significantly higher than those in the river water in the dry season figs 2a and s4 anosim global r 0 634 p 0 002 for example the average concentrations of mn zn and cu were 104 6 12 4 and 10 8 times greater than those in the river water samples respectively figs 2c and s5 thus it further confirmed e wwtps as the sources of metal loid s in the water of the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau in the sediments the metal loid e g ca ni cr al zn and cu concentrations in the dry season were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in the wet season fig 2d during the dry season the low flow rate favored the metal loid s precipitation and accumulation in the solid phase allafta and opp 2020 besides the seasonal variations of environmental variables also influenced the metal loid concentrations in the sediments during the dry season table s11 for example pearson correlations showed that the concentrations of metal loid s such as al cu zn cd and ni were negatively p 0 05 related to ph in the sediments table s12 this result indicated that the significantly p 0 05 lower ph in the dry 7 78 0 06 relative to wet 8 80 0 10 season inhibited the transportation of these metal loid s from sediments to water thus it may also be responsible for higher concentrations of dissolved al cu and zn in the wet relative to dry season 3 3 seasonal variation of bacterial communities in water and sediments bacterial communities varied significantly between the water and sediments though both were dominated by the phyla of proteobacteria with the relative abundance of 39 2 and 32 8 respectively using the illumina 16s rrna gene sequencing we obtained 5508 752 clean reads from 64 samples and identified 1595 bacterial genus belonging to 60 phyla among them 44 bacterial phyla were determined in the water while 60 bacterial phyla were in the sediments nmds analysis showed that bacterial communities differed significantly between the water and sediments figs 3 a and s6 anosim global r 0 341 p 0 001 proteobacteria accounted for 39 2 of the total abundance was the most dominant phyla in the water followed by actinobacteriota 17 2 bacteroidota 15 3 and firmicutes 14 3 in comparison the most prevalent phyla in the sediments were proteobacteria 32 8 followed by firmicutes 18 0 actinobacteriota 15 3 and bacteroidota 13 0 figs 3b and s7 the dominant bacterial phyla identified in the huangshui river are ubiquitous in the low elevation rivers such as the yangtze river china liu et al 2018 fuhe river china li et al 2021 danube river europe savio et al 2015 and ganjiang river china wang et al 2016 potentially indicating their wide distribution in the high elevation plateau and low elevation plain environments at the genus level acinetobacter 6 6 chryseobacterium 6 0 and flavobacterium 4 3 were three groups with the highest abundances among the 1284 genera in the water whereas flavobacterium 5 2 proteiniclasticum 3 7 and trichococcus 3 3 were dominant among the 1282 genera in the sediments flavobacterium and chryseobacterium were considered typical potential psychrophiles cavicchioli 2016 furhan 2020 these genera had high relative abundance indicating their capability in adapting to the arctic alpine environments in the qinghai tibet plateau significant differences in the bacterial communities were observed between the wet and dry seasons in both water and sediments figs 3a and s6 anosim global r 0 275 p 0 001 for water global r 0 220 p 0 005 for sediments in the water most planktonic bacteria such as hydrogenophaga unclassified sphingomonadaceae and norank rhizobiales incertae sedis had the preference of the wet season while the genera such as paeniglutamicibacter unclassified micrococcales and cellulomonas favored the dry season fig 3c further network analysis revealed the co occurrence patterns among dissolved metal loid s environmental variables and planktonic bacterial genera fig s8a the network consisted of 281 significant edges among 92 genera 20 metal loid s and 5 environmental variables 77 2 of which were negative associations to be specific 36 planktonic bacterial genera were strongly p 0 05 associated with environmental variables particularly water temperature and nitrogen confirming the crucial roles of these environmental variables in structuring the planktonic bacterial communities of the huangshui river wang et al 2022 moreover we observed that 64 bacterial genera were significantly p 0 05 and negatively associated with metal loid s particularly fe ni cs v ree and co most of which were identified in the e wwtps fig s8a this result suggested that the increase of metal loid concentrations due to the discharges from wwtps could primarily impede the growth morphology and biochemical activity of these bacteria deng et al 2020 in the sediments bacteria such as ellin6067 hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobiumin were more abundant in the wet season whereas clostridium sensu stricto 13 carnobacterium fusibacter and youngiibacter mostly belonging to firmicutes preferred the dry season fig 3c different from water the seasonal changes of sedimentary bacterial communities were less affected by environmental variables except for ph fig s8b we observed that ca and ni mainly sourced from animal husbandry and metal manufacturing were the two most prominent nodes related with 44 and 32 associations of bacterial genera in sediments respectively 90 8 of which were negative connections fig s8b this indicated that the increase in the concentrations of sedimentary metal loid s due to anthropogenic interferences could potentially inhibit the growth of these sedimentary bacteria generally the sedimentary bacterial communities in natural river ecosystems exhibit no significant changes over time because they are in a long term equilibrium through the continuous processes of sediment erosion and deposition liu et al 2018 our study indicated that the anthropogenic inputs of metal loid s were more prone to disturb the seasonal adaptation of sedimentary bacterial communities in the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau possibly due to the high vulnerability of plateau aquatic ecosystems 3 4 seasonal variation of mrgs in the water and sediments the dominant mrgs according to their abundance were different between the water and sediments fig s9 anosim global r 0 561 p 0 001 and the sedimentary mrgs abundance related to the concentration of their metal loid s such as sedimentary hg and cd we identified a total of 259 mrgs in the water and sediment samples with 246 mrgs belonging to 16 single mrg types and 41 multi mrg types in the water and 147 mrgs belonging to 16 single mrg types and 28 multi mrg types in the sediment in the water five mrgs with the highest abundance followed the order of copa cu ag acn fe golt au cu mgta co mg nreb co ni fig 4 a whereas five mrg types with the highest abundances had the order of cu as zn ag cu ag at the same time in the sediments five mrgs with the highest abundance had the order of tr cu acn fe copf cu ruvb cr se te pstb as fig 4a while five mrg types with the highest abundance followed the order of cu fe cr hg as cu as and hg mrgs are prevalent in natural aquatic ecosystems reddy and dubey 2019 the high abundance of these mrgs in the huangshui river may be associated with high concentrations of their related metal loid s for example our study shows the significant and positive associations of the sedimentary hg r 0 416 p 0 05 and cd r 0 433 p 0 05 with their corresponding mrgs fig 5 lu and liu 2021 also found significant correlations between metal loid s e g pb cd cu and mrgs in the jiaojiang river as the priority pollutants with high ecological risks in our study hg and cd were mainly sourced from animal husbandry therefore reducing the application of hg cd containing pesticides can be a potential approach for minimizing their concentrations and potential ecological risks in the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau interestingly we observed no seasonal variations of mrgs in both water and sediments figs 4b and s9 anosim global r 0 097 p 0 068 for water global r 0 034 p 0 239 for sediments which could be attributed to the relatively stable abundance of metal resistance bacteria mrb which acts as the mrgs carriers venn diagram shows that 80 8 of mrgs in the water co occurred in the wet and dry season and this percentage was 71 4 in the sediments fig 4c besides welch s t test analysis also shows a few mrg types in either water or sediments with seasonal preferences for example in the water the dry season was preferred by fe mn cd zn cu zn as sb ag cu as and pb zn resistance genes while cr cu co mg resistance genes favored the wet season fig 4d in the sediments cu ag as mo v w resistance genes were prevalent in the wet season whereas ag cu resistance genes were enriched in the dry season fig 4e bacteria are considered the general hosts of mrgs based on the network analysis we obtained 382 significant and positive relationships between 71 genera and 168 mrgs in the water fig 6 a only unclassified f enterobacteriaceae serratia and acinetobacter were the most important notes associated with 92 84 and 59 connections of mrgs potentially suggesting these bacteria as the important mrgs hosts in the sediments 96 strong and positive relationships were found between 46 genera and 33 mrgs fig 6b for instance mera merd merp merr merr2 and mert were closely related with genera such as bifidobacterium norank f eubacteriaceae streptococcus ruminococcus torques group and thiothrix this result potentially indicated that these bacteria were particularly carrying hg resistance genes which were involved in the resistance mechanisms of mercuric reduction mercuric ion transport and regulator hao et al 2021 in addition the relative abundance of these mrg carrying bacteria exhibited insignificant variations between the wet and dry season fig 3c potentially resulting in insignificant seasonal changes in mrgs e wwtps along the huangshui river potentially served a critical role in the propagation of mrgs source tracker analysis showed that e wwtps contributed to 24 12 of the variations in mrgs in the monitoring stations adjacent to wwtps fig s10 this result indicates the critical role of wwtps along the huangshui river in the propagation of mrgs potentially due to their discharges of metal loid s and extracellular resistomes to the receiving water after wastewater treatment processes czekalski et al 2016 dong et al 2019 we determined 28 mrg types especially zn resistance genes with significantly high abundances in the e wwtps fig 4f zn is dominant in the acid extractable form in sewage sludge potentially resulting in a quick release to aquatic ecosystems and thus being taken by microbes tou et al 2017 3 5 effects of dissolved and sedimentary metal loid s on bacterial communities and mrgs in the water the planktonic bacterial communities and mrgs were influenced by environmental variables instead of metal loid s generally the distinct impacts of heavy metal loid s on bacterial communities and mrgs are widely presented in the contaminated low elevation aquatic ecosystems for instance vishnivetskaya et al 2011 documented that bacterial communities such as proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia were strongly associated with the hg and methyl hg contaminations in the streams of oak ridge similarly wang et al 2018 reported zn and fe concentrations as the most important drivers controlling the bacterial communities in the urban areas of the jialing river in our study the water of the huangshui river was not seriously contaminated by metal loid s potentially resulting in the insignificant effects of dissolved metal loid s on bacteria communities and mrgs in contrast environmental variables played an important role in both relative abundance path coefficient 0 752 p 0 001 and β diversity path coefficient 0 449 p 0 01 of bacterial communities fig 7 a on the contrary metal loid s in the sediments had direct effects path coefficient 0 321 p 0 05 on the relative abundance of bacterial communities and indirectly affected the β diversity of bacterial communities and the mrgs fig 7b the concentrations of metal loid s potentially influenced the sedimentary bacterial communities and mrgs in the sediments of the huangshui river exposure to metal loid s could change their composition and reduce microbial diversity in the sediments he et al 2017 wang et al 2020b found a substantial decrease in the relative abundance of nitrospirae bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia in the wetland sediments by the high concentrations of cr pb and zn rajeev et al 2021 observed that the bacterial communities in coastal sediments of india were highly impacted by the enriched cr cd and ni and dominated by mrbs such as ralstonia and arthrobacter bacterial phylogeny played a determinative role in shaping the mrg composition and abundance in both water and sediments of the huangshui river based on the standardized total effects four factors explained a total of 55 9 mrgs variations in the water and followed the order of bacterial β diversity 0 996 environmental variables 0 601 metal loid s 0 306 bacterial relative abundance 0 702 fig 7a in the sediments these factors explained a total of 83 4 mrgs variations and followed the order of bacterial β diversity 0 623 metal loid s 0 438 environmental variables 0 616 bacterial relative abundance 0 979 fig 7b previous studies reported the crucial roles of bacterial communities in driving the arg composition and abundance in the various environmental matrix such as water dang et al 2021 song et al 2019 agricultural soil cheng et al 2021 han et al 2018 and mariculture sediments han et al 2017 similarly our results imply the increase of mrg abundance as a direct consequence of the mrb proliferation in natural aquatic ecosystems consistent with our network analysis results 3 6 co occurrence of mrgs and args in water and sediments our study found that 74 out of 236 mrg carrying mags simultaneously carried args specifically we recovered 236 mrg carrying mags fig 8 a which could be assigned into 15 bacterial phyla including 152 mags in proteobacteria 28 in actinobacteriota 19 in firmicutes 15 in cyanobacteria and 22 in others among these mags 74 mags 68 from water and 6 from the sediments co carried mrgs and args indicating the widespread co occurrence of mrgs and args in plateau urban rivers fig 8a the mrg arg hosts mainly spanned three phyla belonging to proteobacteria 57 mags firmicutes 8 mags and actinobacteriota 7 mags we found significantly positive associations between the relative abundance of mrg arg hosts and the concentrations of cd fig 8d r 0 380 p 0 05 and hg fig 8d r 0 455 p 0 05 in the sediments this indicated that the selection pressures of cd and hg promoted the co occurrence of mrgs and args and partially confirmed that sedimentary metal loid s would indirectly influence the mrgs via bacterial community in view of the crucial role of cd and hg in co selecting antibiotic resistance special focus thereby should be made on cd and hg in the sediments of huangshui river to weaken the potential generation and dissemination of resistomes the co occurrence of args and mrgs were more likely to be observed in the water fig 8b in the sediments 6 mrg arg hosts merely contained 14 mrgs belonging to 6 mrg types and 8 args belonging to 3 arg types the most frequently detected mrg and arg types were hg and aminoglycoside respectively in the water 68 mags encoded 107 mrgs belonging to 39 mrg types and 185 args belonging to 17 arg types the most frequently detected mrg types were as cu hg and zn accompanied with the dominant arg types of multidrug bacitracin beta lactam and fosmidomycin at genus level each of 5 hosts i e kluyvera enterobacter raoultella hafnia and serratia simultaneously contained more than 5 mrg and arg types fig 8b this result suggested that these bacteria were the crucial reservoirs of mrgs and args and may be of importance in the acquisition and prevalence of resistomes in the river zhao et al 2020 e wwtps strongly promoted the co occurrence of mrgs and args and the proliferation of mrg arg hosts in the water the average relative abundance of mrg hosts in the water followed the order effluent affected reach 0 44 e wwtp 0 32 other river reach 0 24 fig 8c which further confirmed our results that e wwtp would strongly impact the microbial community and mrg abundance of receiving water more importantly we observed significantly higher proportion of mrg arg hosts in the effluent affected reach compared with that in the other river reach anova p 0 01 suggesting that e wwtps also played an important role in promoting the co dissemination of args and mrgs fig 8c thus it may be urgent to pay more attention to the wwtps in the plateau urban rivers due to the possible ecological risks of the receiving water in terms of the antibiotic resistance after the treatment by wwtps 4 conclusions and environmental implication as the third pole and roof of the world the qinghai tibet plateau provides critical ecological services it is also one of the most vulnerable areas on earth for contaminations and degradations our study investigated metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs in the water and sediments collected from the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau during the wet and dry seasons we observed the significant variation of metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs between the water and sediments we found the seasonal variations of metal loid s and bacterial communities in both the water and sediments interestingly no strong seasonal variations of mrgs were found in both the water and sediments potentially due to the stable relative abundance of bacteria carrying mrgs besides bacterial phylogeny plays a determinative role in shaping the mrgs in the water and sediments of the huangshui river this result implied the increase of mrg abundance as a potential consequence of the mrb proliferation in natural aquatic ecosystems in the water the planktonic bacterial community and mrgs were influenced by environmental variables instead of metal loid s possibly due to relatively low metal loid s concentrations we found e wwtps along the river as the essential sources of metal loid s in the river water though the water river was not contaminated by the studied metal loid s possibly due to the dilution effect in addition e wwtps contributed to about 24 12 of the mrgs variations in the monitoring stations adjacent to wwtps accompanied with the wide co occurrence of mrgs and args in mrg hosts indicating the critical role of e wwtps in promoting the environmental proliferation of args and mrgs wwtps in domestic are primarily in control of the discharges of conventional pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus due to the dilution effect of river water and the relatively pure ecosystems in the qinghai tibet plateau the effluents of wwtps even with relatively high concentrations of contaminants will not cause severe pollutions in the receiving rivers in the short term however the accumulative and persistent properties of heavy metal loid s could amplify this adverse effect in the long term especially in the rivers in the qinghai tibet plateau with vulnerable ecosystems by now though the discharge standard on the pollutants from wwtps in china gb 18 918 2002 stipulates the permissible effluent concentration of several heavy metal loid s e g hg cd cr as and pb the region specific strategies by incorporating more metal loid s e g ni fe cs and with more strict permits in the plateau wwtps will potentially benefit the protection of vulnerable ecosystems in the qinghai tibet plateau in contrast to water the sediments were more contaminated by the studied metal loid s such as hg pb and cd with potential animal husbandry and metal manufacturing sources metal loid s in the sediments directly influenced the bacterial relative abundance and indirectly affected the bacterial β diversity and the mrgs we found significant and positive correlations of hg and cd concentrations respectively with their corresponding mrgs and the relative abundance of mrg arg hosts indicating hg and cd as the priority targets during sediment metal loid s remediation in plateau rivers previous studies generally reported no significant changes of the sedimentary bacterial communities in natural river ecosystems over time due to the long term equilibrium by the continuous processes of sediment erosion and deposition however our study observed the seasonal variations of bacterial communities in the sediments though they were less affected by environmental variables except for ph relative to those in the water this result indicated that the anthropogenic inputs of metal loid s were prone to disturb the seasonal adaptation of bacterial communities in the sediments our study highlighted the importance

16304,though metal resistance genes mrgs are of global concern in aquatic ecosystems the underlying factors responsible for mrgs dissemination especially in urban rivers on the vulnerable qinghai tibet plateau are rarely known here we collected 64 samples including water and sediments during the wet and dry seasons and effluents from six wastewater treatment plants wwtps during the dry season and measured 50 metal loid s 60 bacterial phyla and 259 mrgs we observed the distinct difference of metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs between water and sediments and the great seasonal changes in metal loid s and bacterial communities instead of mrgs thirty one metal loid s were detectable in the water with relatively low concentrations and no significant effects on the planktonic bacterial communities and mrgs interestingly the wwtps effluent partially promoted the prevalence of dissolved metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs along the river in the sediments the average concentrations of 17 metal loid s exceeded their corresponding background levels in this region and strongly influenced the bacterial communities and the mrgs sedimentary hg and cd mainly sourced from the intensive animal husbandry were the major pollutants causing ecological risks and largely shaped their corresponding resistomes moreover we found that bacterial communities predominantly determined the variation of mrgs in both water and sediments metagenome assembled genomes further reveals the widespread co occurrence of mrgs and antibiotic resistance genes args in mrg hosts our study highlighted the concern of effluents discharged from wwtps and emphasized the importance of controlling the anthropogenic inputs of sedimentary metal loid s in the plateau river ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metal loid s metal resistance genes mrgs bacterial community huangshui river tibet plateau 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau recognized as the third pole and roof of the world provides critical ecological services such as climate regulation water conservation biodiversity protection and economic benefits sun et al 2020 meanwhile it is also one of the most vulnerable areas on earth sensitive to climate changes and human pressures li and song 2021 in the past years unexpected inorganic and organic contaminations have been measured in various environmental matrices of this area wu et al 2016a wu et al 2016b resulting in a significant threat to its ecological services among them metal loid s as one of the most typical pollutants have drawn extensive concern due to their abundance toxicity and persistence antoniadis et al 2019 liu et al 2020b during the past decades many cities on the qinghai tibet plateau have experienced rapid industrialization expansive urbanization and intensive agriculture as a result high metal loid contaminations were reported in water and soil in the qinghai tibet plateau dai et al 2019b wu et al 2016a wu et al 2018 for example wu et al 2018 reported the average concentrations of 0 28 and 0 68 mg kg in hg and cd in soils in the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau 40 and 108 times of their average concentrations throughout mainland china chen et al 1991 therefore further investigating the occurrence and source of heavy metal loid s in urban rivers in the qinghai tibet plateau will help us develop effective strategies to protect these fragile ecological ecosystems metal loid s species and levels impact the composition and diversity of planktonic and sedimentary microbial communities in rivers du et al 2018 li et al 2021 due to a variety of their susceptibility exposure to metal loid s would enhance or reduce bacterial abundance by affecting enzyme activities metabolic diversity and the use of diverse organic substrates zhuang et al 2019 for example deltaproteobacteria acidobacteria gemmatimonadetes and nitrospira were significantly sensitive to zn and cu contaminations accompanied by eutrophic conditions wang et al 2020a furthermore several bacteria such as fontibacter mariniphaga symbiobacterium and thauera were preferentially enriched in the sediments with v cr and mn pollutions he et al 2021 however the current knowledge about the impacts of metal loid s on bacterial communities is limited in the qinghai tibet plateau rivers because of the wide usage of surface water in irrigation industrial production and recreational activities the incidence of resistomes in river ecosystems has been considered a crucial issue associated with water quality and public health reddy and dubey 2019 among discovered resistomes metal loid s could induce the generation and dissemination of metal resistance genes mrgs in bacterial communities for example chen et al 2019 reported significant correlations of cd with its target resistance genes e g czca czcc czcd in the upper 20 cm of soils in a copper tailing dam area china li et al 2021 reported the join effects of sedimentary metals such as cd pb and mn from human activities on cu and hg resistance genes in the fuhe river china apart from the mrgs metal loid s may also promote the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args via the co selection mechanisms of mrgs and args yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 found the significant correlations of heavy metals with both mrgs and args in the feces of a dairy farm china while zhao et al 2019 observed the co occurrences of eight metals i e as cd co cr cu hg ni and zn with specific args furthermore the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants e wwtps is of prominence in the contaminants including metal loid s and mrgs kuang et al 2020 and can act as an essential and underestimated source of mrgs in the relatively pure plateau riverine ecosystems therefore examining how these potential factors affect the occurrence and abundance of mrgs is important for developing the appropriate strategies for protecting the plateau riverine ecosystems from mrgs due to high elevation the qinghai tibet plateau has the largest area of seasonally frozen ground around the world dai et al 2019a huang et al 2019 and the seasonal freeze thaw cycle could play an important impact on the variation of the microbial communities kui et al 2019 hence we conducted a systematic study on the huangshui river to collect the water and sediment samples during the wet and dry seasons the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the occurrence and potential source s of 50 dissolved and sedimentary metal loid s in the huangshui river 2 study the seasonal dynamics of metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs in both water and sediments 3 examine the linkage s among environmental variables e g water temperature and ph metal loid s communities and mrgs in the river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the huangshui river originated from the haibei tibetan autonomous prefecture of qinghai province and is the largest tributary of the upper yellow river with a drainage area of 1 77 104km2 and a total length of 374 km liu et al 2020a it is in a typical arid and semi arid continental climate zone with complex landforms ranging from 1751 to 4858 m in altitude as a mother river of xining the capital of the qinghai province the huangshui river flows through the main urban areas of this city receiving all the e wwtps along its path we collected surface water and sediment samples from the huangshui river in july 2018 wet season and april 2019 dry season we sampled at 12 monitoring stations 7 stations in the mainstream m1 m2 m3 m5 m6 m7 and m10 and 5 stations in the tributaries t1 t2 t5 t6 and t7 in the wet season and 17 monitoring stations 10 stations in the mainstream m1 m10 and 7 stations in the tributaries t1 t7 in the dry season fig s1 and table s1 totally we collected 12 water samples and 12 sediment samples in wet season and 17 water samples and 17 sediment samples in dry season in addition we collected the effluents of 6 wwtps w1 w6 in the dry season to assess their impacts we collected water samples into polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles whereas surface sediment samples were taken by a stainless steel grab sampler and then placed in two types of containers one type of container is the clean polyethylene zip lock bag for chemical analysis and another type is the 10 ml sterile polypropylene centrifuge tube for dna extraction 2 2 measurements of environmental variables before collecting field samples we measured water temperature wt ph and dissolved oxygen do in situ using a multi parameter online analyzer shanghai san xin instrumentation sx836 the collected water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon toc hj 501 2009 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n hj

laboratory measurements were conducted at the state key laboratory of plateau ecology and agriculture at the qinghai university china following the above mentioned standard methods which were recommended by the ministry of protection ecology and environment of china the collected water samples were stored at 4 c and all the above mentioned analyses were completed within 7 d after the water sample collections 2 3 metal loid s determination the water and sediment samples were transported to the laboratory at 4 c water samples were immediately examined for metal loid s when arrived at the key laboratory of water and sediment sciences ministry of education peking university for the pretreatment the water samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm whatman nylon filters and then acidified to ph 2 the sediment samples were air dried ground and sieved through a 63 μm mesh then approximately 0 5 g of sediment powder was placed into a 50 ml teflon crucible with hno3 h2o2 hf for digestion after digestion the solution was diluted to 50 ml using deionized water for further metal loid analysis specifically we used hno3 hcl instead of hno3 h2o2 hf to digest the sediments when measuring the hg concentrations for the water samples the k ca na and mg concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes leeman prodigy while the concentrations of mn fe al sr ba zn ni cr v cu li pb zr rb ge pd in sn cs ta w mo pt be co tl bi cd as and rare earth elements i e la ce pr nd sm eu gd tb dy ho er tm yb lu y sc were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermofisher x series ii the hg concentration was measured using atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs jitian ltd afs 9320 for the sediment samples we used icp oes to determine the concentrations of k ca na mg v cr mn fe ni cu zn al sr zr ba and pb whereas the hg and as concentrations were measured using afs we used icp ms to determine the concentrations of the remaining metal loid s we conducted strict quality control procedures as follows for all analyses firstly the precision and accuracy were verified by using certified reference materials such as gsb 04 1767 2004 and gsb04 1789 2004 for the water samples and gbw07426 for the sediment samples issued by the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of china table s2 secondly blank samples were set in duplicate with each batch treatment during the whole process of digestion and analysis the method detection limits mdl for metal loid s were 0 02 120 µg l in the water samples and 0 002 12 mg kg in the sediment samples table s4 while the ratio of the measured to standard metal loid concentrations were 0 86 1 13 for certified reference materials table s3 the standard deviation of samples in four replicates was 5 in all batch treatments and the detected concentrations of the certified reference materials were within the range of certified values 2 4 dna extraction sequencing and bioinformatic analysis the water samples were transported to the laboratory at 4 c in 24 h while the sediment samples were deliveryed to the laboratory at 80 c we conducted the pcr and 16s rrna sequencing at a commercial laboratory majorbio shanghai china following the methods described in wang et al 2020b specifically the collected water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes gttp millipore ireland while the collected sediment samples were processed further without the pretreatment the total dna was extracted from the filters or sediments by fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedical france following the manufacturer s protocols the quality and concentration of extracted dna were determined by a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de us the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr using universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 we used metagenomic shotgun sequencing to characterize the mrgs in the water and sediment samples metagenomic sequencing and library construction were performed on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform with a sequencing strategy of 150 bp paired end using high quality dna the raw sequencing reads were filtered using sickle version 1 200 and fastp version 0 21 0 to remove the low quality reads the clean reads were afterwards assembled using megahit li et al 2015 and the contigs longer than 500 bp were further employed to predict open reading frames orfs via prodigal version 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 zhu et al 2010 to annotate the mrgs and args we used the predicted protein sequences of orfs to align against the bacmet database pal et al 2014 and sarg yang et al 2016 respectively in the blastp software version 2 10 1 with an e value cutoff of 10e 5 the sequences were annotated as mrg like or arg like orfs if the blastp alignment had an identity 80 and a query coverages 70 yin et al 2018 coverages of the identified orfs were normalized to the size of each metagenome read bases copies gbp the accession numbers of sequences produced by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and by shotgun were prjna736664 and prjna790652 respectively 2 5 metagenomic binning and quality control of metagenome assembled genomes we performed binning process by metawrap v1 2 3 with default parameters uritskiy et al 2018 to obtain the metagenome assembled genomes mags completeness and contamination of refined mags were assessed using checkm v1 1 2 parks et al 2015 mrg carrying and mrg arg carrying mags were seleced on the basis of the previous annotation results to calculate the relative abundance of the selected mags the clean reads of the 64 samples were firstly mapped onto these selected mags using bbmap v38 86 https sourceforge net projects bbmap then their sequencing coverages were statistically analyzed by the script implanted in metawrap on the basis of these mapping results finally the sequencing coverages of the mags were normalized to the total bases of the clean reads resulting in their relative abundance fold gbp taxonomic positions of the mags were determined according to the genome taxonomy database gtdb using gtdb tk v1 3 0 classify wf workflow in default parameters parks et al 2018 2 6 assessment of sedimentary contamination and source identification we calculated the enrichment factor ef and the geo accumulation index igeo to evaluate the metal loid s accumulation in the sediments and identify their potential sources we determined the potential ecological risk index ri to assess the potential impact of metal loid s in aquatic ecosystems section 1 1 in si the united states environmental protection agency us epa pmf software version 5 0 was further applied to assess the potential sources of sedimentary metal loid s in the huangshui river after filling the non detectable values with half of the mdl referenced with the user guideline of pmf 5 0 we used a site metal loid matrix accompanied with an uncertainty data set during the pmf analysis factor value was set at 3 6 with random seeds the most optimal factor number was obtained through comparison of q true and q robust values residual analysis and correlation coefficients analysis in addition we also carried out the boot strap bs displacement disp and hybrid bsdisp methods to assess the data stability 2 7 statistical analysis we used nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis and similarity analysis anosim in the vegan package in r software version 3 4 2 to visualize the dissimilarities of metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs between the water versus sediments or between the wet versus dry season the difference of metal loid concentrations between the wet versus dry season in the water and sediments of the huangshui river was analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova in the ibm spss 19 0 source tracker analysis was performed to reveal the contributions of dissolved metal loid s and mrgs in the e wwtps in the dry season to these in the water of the huangshui river the differential bacteria and mrgs between the wet versus dry seasons were identified by stamp based on t tests with an adjusted false discovery rate the network of co occurrence among environmental variables metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs was employed by spearman correlation analysis correlation coefficient r 0 65 p 0 05 and visualized via gephi software version 0 9 1 finally a partial least squares path model pls pm in the vegan package in r software was used to quantify the effects of environmental variables metal loid s and bacterial communities on mrgs 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and sources of metal loid s in the water and sediments e wwtps along the huangshui river were the critical sources of metal loid s in the river water though the water of the huangshui river was not contaminated by the studied metal loid s possibly due to the dilution effect in the 35 water samples a total of 31 metal loid s was detected with the highest average concentrations in ca mean 78 4 mg l range 24 7 358 6 mg l na mean 66 7 mg l range 5 9 474 7 mg l and mg mean 21 9 mg l range 6 2 59 7 mg l whereas elements such as cd hg be pt and most of rees were not detectable fig 1 a and table s5 compared with the low elevation urban rivers in inland china we observed much lower mn and pb concentrations and higher fe and cr concentrations in the huangshui river table s6 overall the average pb hg cu zn as and cd concentrations were far below the first class in the surface water quality standard of china gb3838 2002 and the cr concentration was satisfied with the second class suggesting that metal loid pollution was not severe in the water of the huangshui river source tracker analysis further exhibited that e wwtps attributed to 40 0 100 of the variations in metal loid s in the monitoring stations closing to upstream or downstream of the wwtps i e effluent affected reach fig 1c the wwtps along the huangshui river are primarily equipped with conventional biological treatment systems table s7 which were designed for removing organic matters with heavy metal loid s as a side benefit karvelas et al 2003 the higher metal loid concentrations in the e wwtps were primarily due to their incomplete removal by microorganisms in activated sludge relative to the water the sediments of the huangshui river were more contaminated by the studied metal loid s especially by hg pb and cd which were potentially sourced from animal husbandry and metal manufacturing specifically all the studied metal loid s were detected in all the 29 sediment samples with the highest average concentration in al mean 58 4 g kg range 44 3 74 9 g kg ca mean 43 0 g kg range 18 3 120 1 g kg and fe mean 21 5 g kg range 17 2 27 8 g kg while pt and in had the lowest average concentration of 10 range 1 25 and 30 range 10 44 μg kg respectively fig 1b and table s5 we found 17 metal loid s with the average concentrations exceeding their corresponding background values in the soil of qinghai table s8 particularly of 3 82 times for hg 2 08 times for pb and 1 82 times for cd despite this the pb concentration was comparable with those in the lower lijiang river the lower yangtze river and the xiaoqing river in china while the cd cr and cu concentrations were much lower than those in the maozhou river the daqing river and the xiaoqing river in china table s9 the enrichment factor ef and geo accumulation index igeo also confirmed the great contribution of anthropogenic activities on the sedimentary hg cd rb and pb table s10 and section 2 1 in si while the potential ecological risks ri indicate hg and cd as the major pollutants causing ecological risks fig s2 and section 3 1 in si according to the positive matrix factorization pmf model figs 1d s3 and section 4 1 in si factor 1 interpreted as natural sources was predominately weighted by the elements such as ba ta na sn be and co factor 2 possibly related to animal husbandry wang et al 2021 was strongly correlated with hg ca and cd factor 3 potentially representing industrial activities dominated by metal manufacturing aral and vecchio sadus 2008 chai et al 2021a was mainly loaded on rb pb pt ge in li cr and ni 3 2 seasonal variation of metal loid s in the water and sediments the metal loid s varied significantly between the water and sediments and their seasonal variations were observed in both water and sediments non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis showed an extremely significant difference of metal loid s between the water and sediments figs 2 a and s4 anosim global r 0 999 and p 0 001 the metal loid s also demonstrated the discernable seasonal variations in both water and sediments figs 2a and s4 global r 0 764 p 0 001 for water global r 0 690 p 0 001 for sediments which was consistent with the previous studies in the yamuna river india parmar et al 2021 fen river china chai et al 2021b and tano river ghana nyantakyi et al 2019 in the water the concentrations of dissolved metal loid s e g fe ni sr ca v and co in the dry season were much higher p 0 05 than those in the wet season fig 2b possibly due to the relatively lower flow during the dry season the reduced water volume makes the dissolved metal loid s more concentrated in the liquid phase islam et al 2015 however the opposite consequence was found in the cu zn and al concentrations which may be related to their increased exports from human activities during the wet season furthermore the concentration of metal loid s e g cu mn zn v fe and ni in the e wwtps was significantly higher than those in the river water in the dry season figs 2a and s4 anosim global r 0 634 p 0 002 for example the average concentrations of mn zn and cu were 104 6 12 4 and 10 8 times greater than those in the river water samples respectively figs 2c and s5 thus it further confirmed e wwtps as the sources of metal loid s in the water of the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau in the sediments the metal loid e g ca ni cr al zn and cu concentrations in the dry season were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in the wet season fig 2d during the dry season the low flow rate favored the metal loid s precipitation and accumulation in the solid phase allafta and opp 2020 besides the seasonal variations of environmental variables also influenced the metal loid concentrations in the sediments during the dry season table s11 for example pearson correlations showed that the concentrations of metal loid s such as al cu zn cd and ni were negatively p 0 05 related to ph in the sediments table s12 this result indicated that the significantly p 0 05 lower ph in the dry 7 78 0 06 relative to wet 8 80 0 10 season inhibited the transportation of these metal loid s from sediments to water thus it may also be responsible for higher concentrations of dissolved al cu and zn in the wet relative to dry season 3 3 seasonal variation of bacterial communities in water and sediments bacterial communities varied significantly between the water and sediments though both were dominated by the phyla of proteobacteria with the relative abundance of 39 2 and 32 8 respectively using the illumina 16s rrna gene sequencing we obtained 5508 752 clean reads from 64 samples and identified 1595 bacterial genus belonging to 60 phyla among them 44 bacterial phyla were determined in the water while 60 bacterial phyla were in the sediments nmds analysis showed that bacterial communities differed significantly between the water and sediments figs 3 a and s6 anosim global r 0 341 p 0 001 proteobacteria accounted for 39 2 of the total abundance was the most dominant phyla in the water followed by actinobacteriota 17 2 bacteroidota 15 3 and firmicutes 14 3 in comparison the most prevalent phyla in the sediments were proteobacteria 32 8 followed by firmicutes 18 0 actinobacteriota 15 3 and bacteroidota 13 0 figs 3b and s7 the dominant bacterial phyla identified in the huangshui river are ubiquitous in the low elevation rivers such as the yangtze river china liu et al 2018 fuhe river china li et al 2021 danube river europe savio et al 2015 and ganjiang river china wang et al 2016 potentially indicating their wide distribution in the high elevation plateau and low elevation plain environments at the genus level acinetobacter 6 6 chryseobacterium 6 0 and flavobacterium 4 3 were three groups with the highest abundances among the 1284 genera in the water whereas flavobacterium 5 2 proteiniclasticum 3 7 and trichococcus 3 3 were dominant among the 1282 genera in the sediments flavobacterium and chryseobacterium were considered typical potential psychrophiles cavicchioli 2016 furhan 2020 these genera had high relative abundance indicating their capability in adapting to the arctic alpine environments in the qinghai tibet plateau significant differences in the bacterial communities were observed between the wet and dry seasons in both water and sediments figs 3a and s6 anosim global r 0 275 p 0 001 for water global r 0 220 p 0 005 for sediments in the water most planktonic bacteria such as hydrogenophaga unclassified sphingomonadaceae and norank rhizobiales incertae sedis had the preference of the wet season while the genera such as paeniglutamicibacter unclassified micrococcales and cellulomonas favored the dry season fig 3c further network analysis revealed the co occurrence patterns among dissolved metal loid s environmental variables and planktonic bacterial genera fig s8a the network consisted of 281 significant edges among 92 genera 20 metal loid s and 5 environmental variables 77 2 of which were negative associations to be specific 36 planktonic bacterial genera were strongly p 0 05 associated with environmental variables particularly water temperature and nitrogen confirming the crucial roles of these environmental variables in structuring the planktonic bacterial communities of the huangshui river wang et al 2022 moreover we observed that 64 bacterial genera were significantly p 0 05 and negatively associated with metal loid s particularly fe ni cs v ree and co most of which were identified in the e wwtps fig s8a this result suggested that the increase of metal loid concentrations due to the discharges from wwtps could primarily impede the growth morphology and biochemical activity of these bacteria deng et al 2020 in the sediments bacteria such as ellin6067 hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobiumin were more abundant in the wet season whereas clostridium sensu stricto 13 carnobacterium fusibacter and youngiibacter mostly belonging to firmicutes preferred the dry season fig 3c different from water the seasonal changes of sedimentary bacterial communities were less affected by environmental variables except for ph fig s8b we observed that ca and ni mainly sourced from animal husbandry and metal manufacturing were the two most prominent nodes related with 44 and 32 associations of bacterial genera in sediments respectively 90 8 of which were negative connections fig s8b this indicated that the increase in the concentrations of sedimentary metal loid s due to anthropogenic interferences could potentially inhibit the growth of these sedimentary bacteria generally the sedimentary bacterial communities in natural river ecosystems exhibit no significant changes over time because they are in a long term equilibrium through the continuous processes of sediment erosion and deposition liu et al 2018 our study indicated that the anthropogenic inputs of metal loid s were more prone to disturb the seasonal adaptation of sedimentary bacterial communities in the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau possibly due to the high vulnerability of plateau aquatic ecosystems 3 4 seasonal variation of mrgs in the water and sediments the dominant mrgs according to their abundance were different between the water and sediments fig s9 anosim global r 0 561 p 0 001 and the sedimentary mrgs abundance related to the concentration of their metal loid s such as sedimentary hg and cd we identified a total of 259 mrgs in the water and sediment samples with 246 mrgs belonging to 16 single mrg types and 41 multi mrg types in the water and 147 mrgs belonging to 16 single mrg types and 28 multi mrg types in the sediment in the water five mrgs with the highest abundance followed the order of copa cu ag acn fe golt au cu mgta co mg nreb co ni fig 4 a whereas five mrg types with the highest abundances had the order of cu as zn ag cu ag at the same time in the sediments five mrgs with the highest abundance had the order of tr cu acn fe copf cu ruvb cr se te pstb as fig 4a while five mrg types with the highest abundance followed the order of cu fe cr hg as cu as and hg mrgs are prevalent in natural aquatic ecosystems reddy and dubey 2019 the high abundance of these mrgs in the huangshui river may be associated with high concentrations of their related metal loid s for example our study shows the significant and positive associations of the sedimentary hg r 0 416 p 0 05 and cd r 0 433 p 0 05 with their corresponding mrgs fig 5 lu and liu 2021 also found significant correlations between metal loid s e g pb cd cu and mrgs in the jiaojiang river as the priority pollutants with high ecological risks in our study hg and cd were mainly sourced from animal husbandry therefore reducing the application of hg cd containing pesticides can be a potential approach for minimizing their concentrations and potential ecological risks in the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau interestingly we observed no seasonal variations of mrgs in both water and sediments figs 4b and s9 anosim global r 0 097 p 0 068 for water global r 0 034 p 0 239 for sediments which could be attributed to the relatively stable abundance of metal resistance bacteria mrb which acts as the mrgs carriers venn diagram shows that 80 8 of mrgs in the water co occurred in the wet and dry season and this percentage was 71 4 in the sediments fig 4c besides welch s t test analysis also shows a few mrg types in either water or sediments with seasonal preferences for example in the water the dry season was preferred by fe mn cd zn cu zn as sb ag cu as and pb zn resistance genes while cr cu co mg resistance genes favored the wet season fig 4d in the sediments cu ag as mo v w resistance genes were prevalent in the wet season whereas ag cu resistance genes were enriched in the dry season fig 4e bacteria are considered the general hosts of mrgs based on the network analysis we obtained 382 significant and positive relationships between 71 genera and 168 mrgs in the water fig 6 a only unclassified f enterobacteriaceae serratia and acinetobacter were the most important notes associated with 92 84 and 59 connections of mrgs potentially suggesting these bacteria as the important mrgs hosts in the sediments 96 strong and positive relationships were found between 46 genera and 33 mrgs fig 6b for instance mera merd merp merr merr2 and mert were closely related with genera such as bifidobacterium norank f eubacteriaceae streptococcus ruminococcus torques group and thiothrix this result potentially indicated that these bacteria were particularly carrying hg resistance genes which were involved in the resistance mechanisms of mercuric reduction mercuric ion transport and regulator hao et al 2021 in addition the relative abundance of these mrg carrying bacteria exhibited insignificant variations between the wet and dry season fig 3c potentially resulting in insignificant seasonal changes in mrgs e wwtps along the huangshui river potentially served a critical role in the propagation of mrgs source tracker analysis showed that e wwtps contributed to 24 12 of the variations in mrgs in the monitoring stations adjacent to wwtps fig s10 this result indicates the critical role of wwtps along the huangshui river in the propagation of mrgs potentially due to their discharges of metal loid s and extracellular resistomes to the receiving water after wastewater treatment processes czekalski et al 2016 dong et al 2019 we determined 28 mrg types especially zn resistance genes with significantly high abundances in the e wwtps fig 4f zn is dominant in the acid extractable form in sewage sludge potentially resulting in a quick release to aquatic ecosystems and thus being taken by microbes tou et al 2017 3 5 effects of dissolved and sedimentary metal loid s on bacterial communities and mrgs in the water the planktonic bacterial communities and mrgs were influenced by environmental variables instead of metal loid s generally the distinct impacts of heavy metal loid s on bacterial communities and mrgs are widely presented in the contaminated low elevation aquatic ecosystems for instance vishnivetskaya et al 2011 documented that bacterial communities such as proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia were strongly associated with the hg and methyl hg contaminations in the streams of oak ridge similarly wang et al 2018 reported zn and fe concentrations as the most important drivers controlling the bacterial communities in the urban areas of the jialing river in our study the water of the huangshui river was not seriously contaminated by metal loid s potentially resulting in the insignificant effects of dissolved metal loid s on bacteria communities and mrgs in contrast environmental variables played an important role in both relative abundance path coefficient 0 752 p 0 001 and β diversity path coefficient 0 449 p 0 01 of bacterial communities fig 7 a on the contrary metal loid s in the sediments had direct effects path coefficient 0 321 p 0 05 on the relative abundance of bacterial communities and indirectly affected the β diversity of bacterial communities and the mrgs fig 7b the concentrations of metal loid s potentially influenced the sedimentary bacterial communities and mrgs in the sediments of the huangshui river exposure to metal loid s could change their composition and reduce microbial diversity in the sediments he et al 2017 wang et al 2020b found a substantial decrease in the relative abundance of nitrospirae bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia in the wetland sediments by the high concentrations of cr pb and zn rajeev et al 2021 observed that the bacterial communities in coastal sediments of india were highly impacted by the enriched cr cd and ni and dominated by mrbs such as ralstonia and arthrobacter bacterial phylogeny played a determinative role in shaping the mrg composition and abundance in both water and sediments of the huangshui river based on the standardized total effects four factors explained a total of 55 9 mrgs variations in the water and followed the order of bacterial β diversity 0 996 environmental variables 0 601 metal loid s 0 306 bacterial relative abundance 0 702 fig 7a in the sediments these factors explained a total of 83 4 mrgs variations and followed the order of bacterial β diversity 0 623 metal loid s 0 438 environmental variables 0 616 bacterial relative abundance 0 979 fig 7b previous studies reported the crucial roles of bacterial communities in driving the arg composition and abundance in the various environmental matrix such as water dang et al 2021 song et al 2019 agricultural soil cheng et al 2021 han et al 2018 and mariculture sediments han et al 2017 similarly our results imply the increase of mrg abundance as a direct consequence of the mrb proliferation in natural aquatic ecosystems consistent with our network analysis results 3 6 co occurrence of mrgs and args in water and sediments our study found that 74 out of 236 mrg carrying mags simultaneously carried args specifically we recovered 236 mrg carrying mags fig 8 a which could be assigned into 15 bacterial phyla including 152 mags in proteobacteria 28 in actinobacteriota 19 in firmicutes 15 in cyanobacteria and 22 in others among these mags 74 mags 68 from water and 6 from the sediments co carried mrgs and args indicating the widespread co occurrence of mrgs and args in plateau urban rivers fig 8a the mrg arg hosts mainly spanned three phyla belonging to proteobacteria 57 mags firmicutes 8 mags and actinobacteriota 7 mags we found significantly positive associations between the relative abundance of mrg arg hosts and the concentrations of cd fig 8d r 0 380 p 0 05 and hg fig 8d r 0 455 p 0 05 in the sediments this indicated that the selection pressures of cd and hg promoted the co occurrence of mrgs and args and partially confirmed that sedimentary metal loid s would indirectly influence the mrgs via bacterial community in view of the crucial role of cd and hg in co selecting antibiotic resistance special focus thereby should be made on cd and hg in the sediments of huangshui river to weaken the potential generation and dissemination of resistomes the co occurrence of args and mrgs were more likely to be observed in the water fig 8b in the sediments 6 mrg arg hosts merely contained 14 mrgs belonging to 6 mrg types and 8 args belonging to 3 arg types the most frequently detected mrg and arg types were hg and aminoglycoside respectively in the water 68 mags encoded 107 mrgs belonging to 39 mrg types and 185 args belonging to 17 arg types the most frequently detected mrg types were as cu hg and zn accompanied with the dominant arg types of multidrug bacitracin beta lactam and fosmidomycin at genus level each of 5 hosts i e kluyvera enterobacter raoultella hafnia and serratia simultaneously contained more than 5 mrg and arg types fig 8b this result suggested that these bacteria were the crucial reservoirs of mrgs and args and may be of importance in the acquisition and prevalence of resistomes in the river zhao et al 2020 e wwtps strongly promoted the co occurrence of mrgs and args and the proliferation of mrg arg hosts in the water the average relative abundance of mrg hosts in the water followed the order effluent affected reach 0 44 e wwtp 0 32 other river reach 0 24 fig 8c which further confirmed our results that e wwtp would strongly impact the microbial community and mrg abundance of receiving water more importantly we observed significantly higher proportion of mrg arg hosts in the effluent affected reach compared with that in the other river reach anova p 0 01 suggesting that e wwtps also played an important role in promoting the co dissemination of args and mrgs fig 8c thus it may be urgent to pay more attention to the wwtps in the plateau urban rivers due to the possible ecological risks of the receiving water in terms of the antibiotic resistance after the treatment by wwtps 4 conclusions and environmental implication as the third pole and roof of the world the qinghai tibet plateau provides critical ecological services it is also one of the most vulnerable areas on earth for contaminations and degradations our study investigated metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs in the water and sediments collected from the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau during the wet and dry seasons we observed the significant variation of metal loid s bacterial communities and mrgs between the water and sediments we found the seasonal variations of metal loid s and bacterial communities in both the water and sediments interestingly no strong seasonal variations of mrgs were found in both the water and sediments potentially due to the stable relative abundance of bacteria carrying mrgs besides bacterial phylogeny plays a determinative role in shaping the mrgs in the water and sediments of the huangshui river this result implied the increase of mrg abundance as a potential consequence of the mrb proliferation in natural aquatic ecosystems in the water the planktonic bacterial community and mrgs were influenced by environmental variables instead of metal loid s possibly due to relatively low metal loid s concentrations we found e wwtps along the river as the essential sources of metal loid s in the river water though the water river was not contaminated by the studied metal loid s possibly due to the dilution effect in addition e wwtps contributed to about 24 12 of the mrgs variations in the monitoring stations adjacent to wwtps accompanied with the wide co occurrence of mrgs and args in mrg hosts indicating the critical role of e wwtps in promoting the environmental proliferation of args and mrgs wwtps in domestic are primarily in control of the discharges of conventional pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus due to the dilution effect of river water and the relatively pure ecosystems in the qinghai tibet plateau the effluents of wwtps even with relatively high concentrations of contaminants will not cause severe pollutions in the receiving rivers in the short term however the accumulative and persistent properties of heavy metal loid s could amplify this adverse effect in the long term especially in the rivers in the qinghai tibet plateau with vulnerable ecosystems by now though the discharge standard on the pollutants from wwtps in china gb 18 918 2002 stipulates the permissible effluent concentration of several heavy metal loid s e g hg cd cr as and pb the region specific strategies by incorporating more metal loid s e g ni fe cs and with more strict permits in the plateau wwtps will potentially benefit the protection of vulnerable ecosystems in the qinghai tibet plateau in contrast to water the sediments were more contaminated by the studied metal loid s such as hg pb and cd with potential animal husbandry and metal manufacturing sources metal loid s in the sediments directly influenced the bacterial relative abundance and indirectly affected the bacterial β diversity and the mrgs we found significant and positive correlations of hg and cd concentrations respectively with their corresponding mrgs and the relative abundance of mrg arg hosts indicating hg and cd as the priority targets during sediment metal loid s remediation in plateau rivers previous studies generally reported no significant changes of the sedimentary bacterial communities in natural river ecosystems over time due to the long term equilibrium by the continuous processes of sediment erosion and deposition however our study observed the seasonal variations of bacterial communities in the sediments though they were less affected by environmental variables except for ph relative to those in the water this result indicated that the anthropogenic inputs of metal loid s were prone to disturb the seasonal adaptation of bacterial communities in the sediments our study highlighted the importance of controlling the anthropogenic inputs of sedimentary metal loid s for reducing the disturbances in the plateau rivine ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement xuming xu conceptualization
