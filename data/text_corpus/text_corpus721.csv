be reduced by changing the calibration practice which can enhance the interpretation and identifiability of crrm parameters a crrm was developed and tested on a dataset of 14 extensive green roofs located in four norwegian cities with different climatic conditions two calibration schemes were compared a common scheme using runoff data as a basis for calibration single objective and a scheme combining runoff and soil moisture data for the calibration multi objective scheme the results confirmed the ability of the crrm to simulate runoff from extensive green roofs across multiple climatic zones and different roof configurations kling gupta efficiency 0 75 the multi objective calibration scheme was found to reduce the uncertainty of the crrm parameters especially the storage parameters enhancing the physical interpretation of parameter values the study attempted to give guidelines to estimate parameters of the crrm which can be used by practitioners for new roof configurations under different climatic conditions keywords green roof conceptual hydrological model multi objective calibration 1 introduction urbanization converts the natural undeveloped areas into impermeable surfaces such as roads parking lots and rooftops this results in decreased evapotranspiration and infiltration and increased stormwater runoff on a catchment level the ongoing climate change is causing an increase in the intensity of precipitation for many places around the globe sun et al 2006 while global urbanization is growing rapidly luederitz et al 2015 the combined effect of climate change and rapid urbanization is expected to increase the stormwater runoff in the future as stated by yazdanfar sharma 2015 among others green roofs have over the past decade become a popular solution to reduce stormwater runoff in urban areas green roofs have shown great potential in reducing runoff from rooftops as concluded by many studies fassman beck et al 2013 johannessen et al 2018 stovin 2010 additionally green roofs have been shown to improve runoff water quality enhance urban biodiversity and improve visual amenities in urban areas czemiel berndtsson 2010 much of the current literature on green roofs pay particular attention to the performance of different green roofs under different climatic conditions through field measurements fassman beck et al 2013 hamouz et al 2018 johannessen et al 2018 stovin 2010 some studies applied hydrological models to test green roofs performance beyond the measured data and roof characteristics which is of great interest for planning future cities li babcock 2016 stovin et al 2013 hydrological models of green roofs can serve as a valuable tool for decision makers and stormwater engineers for planning and design purposes these practitioners prefer models that i require less effort to set up ii run with low computation costs and iii give reliable results johannessen et al 2019 conceptual rainfall runoff models crrm fulfil these criteria as they are simpler and computationally cheaper than physically based models additionally their results are more generic and interpretable than data driven models crrms have been applied successfully in many green roof studies palla et al 2012 soulis et al 2017 stovin et al 2013 vesuviano et al 2014 yio et al 2013 the most common conceptualization is to represent the roof with a cascade of linear or nonlinear tanks representing the different roof layers i e vegetation substrate and drainage layers the storage and the flow of water between the tanks are controlled via parameters due to the simplification of these conceptual models most of their parameters are not physically measurable and hence calibration is needed to find their optimal values many studies have attempted to link the parameters of crrms and the physical characteristics of the green roofs for instance stovin et al 2013 explained how the storage parameters in their reservoir model could be estimated from the substrate s measurable physical properties i e field capacity vesuviano stovin 2013 found the parameters of the drainage layers in their model to be independent of rain intensity while correlated with the physical properties of the drainage layer and the slope of the roof yio et al 2013 found the flow parameters of the substrate layer to be correlated to the depth of the substrate similarly soulis et al 2017 described how the depth of the roof affected the flow parameter in their reservoir model however all the above mentioned studies were conducted in lab scale green roofs in which horizontal water flow through the roof structure is insignificant due to the short horizontal flow length compared to a full scale roof hence there is a need for further studies to estimate crrm parameters for full scale green roofs estimating parameters of green roof models has been done for other models than the reservoir routing based models for instance johannessen et al 2019 attempted to transfer parameters of a swmm model rossman 2015 between similar full scale green roofs located in four norwegian cities the calibrated parameter sets for the same type of green roofs differed between the cities limiting the performance of the transferred parameter sets the limited knowledge on how to estimate crrm parameters of green roofs from climatic and roof characteristics can be attributed to the uncertainty of finding their optimal values many sources of uncertainties can affect parameter values such as the uncertainty of model inputs uncertainty due to the calibration practice and the induced uncertainty due to the model structure for instance sims et al 2019 attributed the errors of their hydrological model to the uncertainty of initial soil moisture measurements on the other hand hernes et al 2020 found the lack of temporal storage in the drainage layer in the mike urban model dhi 2017 to be compensated by the model by assigning unrealistic parameter values during calibration to fit with the observed discharge in this study we investigated the effect of the calibration practice on crrm parameters values many calibration practices can be found in green roof modelling studies such as maximizing nse between observed and simulated runoff hamouz muthanna 2019 liu fassman beck 2017 soulis et al 2017 or minimizing the error between observed and simulated runoff such as the sum of square error or the root mean square error alfredo et al 2010 vesuviano et al 2014 yio et al 2013 however it was found that for all the studies the measured runoff was the only quantity used as a basis of calibration in most green roof modelling studies this was found despite the fact that using only one measured quantity e g observed runoff for model calibration increases the uncertainty of parameter values beven 1989 this is because the parameters of the substrate and vegetation layers do not explicitly simulate the runoff process but other internal processes i e infiltration evapotranspiration soil storage plant storage etc hence using one measured quantity i e runoff might cause convergence towards the wrong parameter set due to the compensation and interaction between model parameters which increase the equifinality beven 1993 in which different parameter sets give similar results hernes et al 2020 demonstrated this by presenting two different parameter sets of a green roof model that gave the same results due to the compensation between substrate and drainage parameters the benefits of constraining hydrological models by calibrating against more than one measured quantity hereafter referred to as multi objective calibration have been discussed frequently in general hydrological modelling studies seibert 2000 applied a multi objective calibration scheme that combined measured groundwater level data and observed streamflow data to calibrate a crrm for multiple catchments the author found that the multi objective calibration scheme significantly reduced parameter uncertainty compared to the typical scheme using streamflow measurements only a similar finding was found by beldring 2002 in which groundwater level data and runoff data were used to calibrate a physically based model for a norwegian catchment parajka et al 2009 found a multi objective calibration scheme combining soil moisture data with runoff data to provide a more robust parameter set for a crrm compared to using only one measured quantity budhathoki et al 2020 applied a multi objective calibration scheme incorporating in site soil moisture measurements with runoff data to calibrate a distributed hydrological model the study found that the scheme to reduce parameter uncertainty while enhancing the simulation accuracy of the internal catchment storage in comparison to a calibration scheme that only used flow measurements in this study a crrm was developed and validated using a dataset of 14 full scale extensive green roofs located in four norwegian cities with different climatic conditions in addition the study investigated the advantages of multi objective calibration i e using soil moisture and runoff for calibration in green roof crrms the study sheds light on how the multi objective calibration improves the model results by reducing the uncertainty of model parameters enhancing their identifiability and their physical interpretation moreover the study attempted to develop a general guideline for estimating parameters for the crrm from climate and physical roof characteristics simplifying the use of the model for practical applications 2 methods and tools 2 1 the hydrological model the hydrological model is a simple two stage reservoir model fig 1 somewhat similar to the one applied in the study by vesuviano et al 2014 and to the faveur model ramier et al 2018 the model represents the roof layers by two tanks an upper tank for the substrate layer and a lower tank for the drainage layer the precipitation p enters the substrate and fills the available storage of the substrate layer s1 water infiltrates into the lower tank when the storage of the substrate layer is surpassed the infiltration process is determined by equation 1 the drainage layer stores the water s2 and the water starts to flow from s2 q after the storage of the drainage layer is filled equation 2 1 inf t k 1

evapotranspiration aet equation 7 and equation 8 is determined from the potential evapotranspiration pet and the actual soil moisture the oudin equation equation 5 was used to determine pet following

and observed runoff and kge sw is the kling gupta efficiency between simulated and observed soil moisture according to thiemig et al 2013 the kge can be used to classify model results as follows good kge 0 75 satisfactory 0 75 kge 0 5 poor unsatisfactory 0 5 kge multi objective calibration techniques can be divided into pareto based and aggregated efstratiadis koutsoyiannis 2010 the pareto based approach detects sets of non dominated solutions using multi objective evolutionary algorithms while the aggregated approach selects a unique parameter set by multiple criteria embedded into one aggregated objective function making it a best compromise in this study the adopted multi objective calibration scheme can be classified as an aggregated approach similar to the work of seibert 2000 we evaluated two parameterization options of the crrm a linear parameterization in which the values of n1 and n2 were fixed to one during calibration 5 calibrated parameters and a nonlinear parameterization in which n1 and n2 are calibrated 7 calibrated parameters both calibration schemes were applied to the linear and nonlinear parameterizations of the crrm for calibration the differential evolution algorithm de storn price 1997 was applied using the deoptim library in r mullen et al 2011 the algorithm solved the optimization problem by generating populations of candidate solutions each new population was generated from the previous one in such a way that the new objective function of each candidate was either improved or kept the same in the next generation for each calibration scheme 200 generations were done the number of candidates in each population was selected as t h e n u m b e r o f m o d e l p a r a m e t e r s 10 the best result of each generation was stored the best solution of the 200th generation was considered as the optimized parameter set due to the lack of a snow routine in the current model snow periods were excluded 1st of october 31st of march from the simulations 2017 was used for model calibration while 2016 was used for model validation the simulations were done using a 5 minute time step 3 green roof data fourteen green roofs located in four norwegian cities bergen berg trondheim trd sandnes san and oslo osl were used in this study berg receives the highest amount of precipitation followed by san trd and osl the four cities cover three classes of the köppen geiger classification system kottek et al 2006 trd has a subpolar oceanic climate dfc while osl has the warm summer humid continental climate dfb the climate of bergen and sandnes cities is classified as temperate oceanic climate cfb the green roofs were categorized into five groups based on their configurations thin1 with a thickness of 33 mm thin2 with a thickness of 40 mm medium with a total thickness of 80 mm and thick with a thickness higher than 100 mm an additional category termed valid includes an additional green roof located in trondheim trd described in hamouz et al 2018 the valid roof was used to verify the applicability of the developed guidelines to estimate the parameters of the reservoir model the details of the roof configurations are presented in table 1 precipitation temperature and runoff were collected in 1 min resolution between 2015 and 2017 at berg san and trd while osl roofs have eight years of records from 2011 to 2017 the roof valid has a data record of 11 months collected between may 2017 to april 2018 details about field measurements and data processing are documented by johannessen et al 2018 and hamouz et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameterization of the crrm the thin2 roofs in the four cities were used to compare linear and nonlinear parameterizations of the crrm as shown in fig 2 the result confirmed the ability of the two parameterization options to simulate observed and simulated discharges in both calibration and validation periods kge 0 75 the nonlinear parameterization of the crrm produced slightly better runoff simulations higher kge values than the linear option especially in berg and osl roofs similarly skala et al 2019 found a nonlinear model in their study to yield more accurate results than a linear cascade model this can be attributed to the higher degree of freedom for the nonlinear parameterization due to the number of calibrated parameters which improves the calibration schoups et al 2008 however the reduced number of calibrated parameters and the fact that the results produced by the linear parameterization of the crrm model are still classified as good based on the kge criteria thiemig et al 2013 make the linear parameterization of the crrm more favourable over the nonlinear one models with few parameters are widely recommended in the hydrological modelling literature over models with higher model parameters kay et al 2006 oudin et al 2008 tsegaw et al 2019 due to the reduced model parameter interactions and uncertainties 4 2 calibration schemes and parameter values the comparison between the two calibration schemes is presented in fig 2 by considering runoff data only as a basis for calibration it is possible to produce good results of runoff simulations kge 0 75 for both the calibration and validation data however by applying the single objective calibration there is a high risk of yielding unsatisfactory soil moisture simulations fig 3 and fig 4 present one month of runoff and soil moisture simulations from calibration and validation periods at thin2 berg roof using the two calibration schemes the results show how it is possible by applying the single objective scheme to achieve satisfactory runoff calibration in both the calibration and validation periods with a large deviation on the simulated internal state of the roof i e soil moisture which in this case was underestimated this demonstrated the need for alternative calibration strategies which account for the internal state and runoff response in this case it was found that the optimizer converged to optimal solutions by splitting the total roof storage between the substrate and the drainage layer in an unrealistic way which resulted in erroneous soil moisture simulation results a consequence of this approach was a high correlation between the storage parameters s1 and s2 which could result in equifinality where different parameter sets yield similar results similar correlations were found by locatelli et al 2014 between the storage parameters when only runoff was used as a basis for calibration applying the multi objective calibration strategy the model produced satisfactory results for both flow and soil moisture simulations budhathoki et al 2020 found the same that multi objective calibration produced better soil moisture simulations than single objective calibration similarly seibert 2000 reported better runoff and groundwater level simulations by following a multi objective calibration compared to a single objective scheme it should be noted that the trd and san roofs have large gaps in soil moisture measurements in the validation year which resulted in low values of kge for the simulated soil moisture the results presented in fig 5 and fig 6 illustrate the parameter sets of the best solution in each of the 200 generations identified by the de algorithm for the nonlinear and linear parameterization of the crrm respectively it can be noted that the calibration scheme highly affects the uncertainty of parameter values in the two parameterizations of the crrm this can be seen in fig 5 and fig 6 by the range of parameter values giving the same modelling results the single objective calibration made it difficult to conclude on the optimal set of parameters especially the storage parameters if no prior knowledge about the system is utilized for instance soulis et al 2017 applied runoff only for calibrating a reservoir model however the storage parameters in the model were fixed following the result of lab measurements and the calibration results of a physical based model as presented in fig 5 and fig 6 the multi objective calibration scheme resulted in unique clusters of solutions for most parameters that were easier to interpret than the solutions of the single objective scheme for instance s1 values of the thin2 roofs clustered around 10 mm and ranged between 7 mm and 11 mm accounting for 23 to 36 of the substrate thickness likewise locatelli et al 2014 concluded a similar value of s1 when they applied a reservoir model for a green roof with 30 mm substrate depth similar to the thin2 roofs in addition minor differences between s1 values in the four cities were noted for instance the roofs at osl and san had a higher s1 value than those at berg and trd this can be attributed to the different geometries of the roofs particularly the slope the osl roofs have a mild slope of 5 5 and trd and berg roofs have a slope of 16 and san has a slope of 27 through lab measurements getter et al 2007 found the green roof retention i e available permanent storage to increase by decreasing the roof s slope the s1 values at the san roof location were slightly higher than those at berg and trd despite the 27 slope though this was somewhat contradictory to expectation it is difficult to evaluate accurately the value of s1 due to the quality of the soil moisture dataset which can be seen in the model performance during validation another factor that could explain the minor differences of s1 values is the difference of vegetation types and densities amongst the roofs as reported by johannessen et al 2018 trd and berg have lower vegetation coverage and percentages of sedum plants in comparison to san and osl roofs which results in different substrate properties i e porosities due to roots development another interesting finding was the s11 parameter the threshold at which the actual evapotranspiration equals the potential the parameter had a unique value for each city which can be explained by the difference in local climatic conditions e g wind exposure air humidity solar radiation and the vegetation types and densities as reported in johannessen et al 2018 trd roofs were the most wind exposed which increased the evapotranspiration resulting in a lower value of s11 than the other roofs in comparable studies s11 has been fixed to the maximum holding capacity of the roof stovin et al 2013 arguably fixing s11 to the maximum holding capacity might lead to an overestimation of green roof retention for locations without enhanced evapotranspiration conditions e g low wind exposure in addition the differences of vegetation types and densities between the roofs as reported in johannessen et al 2018 study could partly explain the geographical difference of s11 thin2 roofs at trd and berg have higher percentages of local vegetation than osl and san roofs which enhances evapotranspiration resulting in lower values of s11 parameter johannessen et al 2018 reported higher values of event based retention of thin2 roofs at trd and berg in comparison to san and osl cities the value of s2 the permanent storage in the drainage layer varied between the four cities at osl and san roofs s2 was found to vary between 1 mm and 2 mm whereas the value of s2 in trd and berg was found to higher and to vary in a wider range as shown in fig 6 the model used in this study does not explicitly account for the storage due to the plant interception therefore the parameter s2 represents the permanent storages in the drainage and vegetation layers hence the variation of s2 amongst the roofs can somewhat we explained by the differences of vegetation densities and types johannessen et al 2018 locatelli et al 2014 developed a crrm for extensive green roofs with an additional layer representing the plant interception they found the storage parameter of the vegetation layer to be 0 8 mm the sensitivity of s2 was investigated by running grid simulations in which s2 was changed by a fixed step 1 mm while fixing the other model parameters to their optimal values the results of these simulations are illustrated in fig 7 changing the value s2 parameter was found to have no effect on the simulated soil moisture kgesw and to have a little impact on the quality of runoff simulation kgeq except for the thick roofs at trd and osl and the medium roof at trd in addition the range of s2 between 1 mm 2 mm could yield good modelling results kgeq 0 75 in most of the roofs in the study the parameters n1 and n2 showed unpredictable variations for both calibration schemes probably due to compensation with other model parameters further strengthening the conclusion of using the linear parameterization of the crrm similarly vesuviano et al 2014 suggested fixing the value of n in their reservoir model due to the compensation between the n and k parameters by following the multi objective scheme the parameter k1 showed a wide range of variation in the linear parametrization of the crrm fig 6 we investigated how k1 and k2 are related in all roofs in the study this was done by running grid simulations fig 8 in which k1 and k2 were changed by a small step 0 01 while fixing s1 s2 and s11 parameters the result presented in fig 8 suggested a unique k1 k2 relationship for each green roof thickness that was influenced by the local climatic conditions as well the k1 and k2 values can be interchangeable for thin roofs thin1 and thin2 this means that a model with high k1 and low k2 can achieve the same response as a model with low k1 and high k2 values however this is not valid for thick roofs where the k2 value must be lower than k1 for optimal performance the parameter k1 represents the portion of water above field capacity that flows into the drainage layer representing the vertical infiltration of water through the substrate the k2 parameter represents the horizontal movement through the drainage layer i e the portion of water that leaves the roof system green roofs substrates are designed with high porous materials to avoid surface ponding and thus quickly moving from the substrate to the drainage layer after reaching field capacity additionally the horizontal flow distance i e roof length is typically higher than the vertical flow distance i e substrate by orders of magnitude in extensive green roofs hence the vertical movement of water is typically faster than the horizontal movement johannessen et al 2018 therefore it can be concluded that the value of k1 should be higher than k2 which is illustrated in fig 8 it was found that the k1 value can be fixed between 0 75 and 1 for all roofs in the study after fixing the k1 value to 0 75 the variation in the k2 value can be attributed to the location and to some extent the roof depth fig 9 similar relations between roof flow parameters and the substrate depth were described by yio et al 2013 and soulis et al 2017 trd and san roofs were found to have lower k2 values in comparison to the roofs at berg and osl cities this is can be partly explained by the difference in rainfall events characteristics amongst the four cities for instance berg city receives rainfall events with higher amount and intensity and has shorter anticipant dry weather periods adwp in comparison to trd and san cities abdalla et al 2021 consequently the green roofs located at trd and san have in most of the time lower soil moisture contents than the green roof at berg as a result the green roofs at berg were found to have higher k2 values more outflow in comparison to the roofs at trd and san as illustrated in fig 9 it should be noted that osl roofs have the mildest slope and the highest k2 values this is somewhat contradictory to expectation as k2 values are expected to be higher for steep roofs and lower for roofs with mild slopes one possible explanation is the differences of rainfall events characteristics amongst the four cities which influence the value of k2 parameter as explained earlier hence it is expected to observe a higher impact of roof slope on the value of k2 if roofs with different slopes are tested in the same location 4 3 calibration and validation of the crrm model following the multi objective calibration the linear crrm was calibrated and validated for all the green roofs at the four locations in the study the results are shown in table 2 the result confirmed the crrm s ability to produce good runoff modelling results kgeq 0 75 in most cases some of the soil moisture simulations results were unsatisfactory kgesw 0 5 especially for the trd and san roofs which were attributed to large gaps in soil moisture measurements the value of s1 for thin1 thin2 and medium roofs was found to be 9 56 1 44 accounting for 27 36 of the substrate depth for thick roofs the s1 value was found to be 29 3 1 44 which is equivalent to 34 to 38 of the substrate depth these are consistent with the reported literature values of the maximum holding capacities of vegetation mats johannessen et al 2018 locatelli et al 2014 and brick based substrates stovin et al 2013 it can be noted that the variation of s1 values was larger for thick roofs one possible explanation could be the different drainage layer configurations for the roofs in this category table 1 4 4 practical applications of the crrm the hydrological performance of green roofs is typically assessed by estimating retention and detention the former is the permanent reduction of stormwater due to evapotranspiration and it is typically determined from flow accumulation curves stovin et al 2013 on the other hand the detention is the delay and attenuation of drainage outflows due to the temporal storage of water within the green roof layers detention is typically estimated via several indicators such as peak reduction rate peak delay and centroid delay stovin et al 2017 or by using flow duration curves hernes et al 2020 the model developed in this study can be used by practitioners e g stormwater engineers city planners etc to plot flow accumulation curves and flow duration curves from long term simulations to estimate retention and detention performance fig 10 presents the simulated and observed flow accumulation curves and flow duration curves for thin2 roofs flow accumulation curves illustrate the cumulative reduction of precipitation water due to the evapotranspiration of the green roof as shown in fig 10 the model gave accurate estimations of flow accumulation curves at the different climatic regions on the other hand flow duration curves show the values of runoff from green roofs and durations when these runoff values are exceeded therefore they represent the practical implication of green roof detention i e peak delay and attenuation for instance hernes et al 2020 showed how the implementation of green infrastructures at the catchment scale could reduce the duration of drainage flows above a critical value that triggers combined sewer overflow events as presented in fig 10 the crrm estimated accurately the flow duration curves at the four cities except for high runoff values duration 1hr and low values duration 1000 hr 4 5 guidelines to estimate parameters of the linear crrm well calibrated crrm yielded satisfactory runoff and soil moisture simulations across different climatic regions and can be used to estimate green roof retention and detention performances based on the results of this study we attempted to give guidelines that can be used to estimates the linear crrm parameters when observations are not available for model calibration s1 represents the available permanent storage in all substrate layers vegetation mats were found to have around 23 to 36 of their total depth while brick based substrates have around 40 of total substrate depth the optimal range of the parameter s2 was found to be 1 mm 2 mm in most of the roofs this parameter represents the permanent storages of the vegetation i e interception and drainage layers s11 varies according to local climatic conditions and the vegetation characteristics of the green roof but it is typically less than the total substrate thickness s11 is lower for locations with enhanced evapotranspiration conditions wind exposure humidity vegetation density etc further studies are needed to relate the s11 value with local climatic conditions and vegetation characteristics the value of k1 represents the vertical movement of water which is typically faster than the horizontal movement a k1 value of 0 75 was found to fit with the different roof characteristics and climatic regions the value of k2 ranges between 0 01 and 0 15 in all roofs in our study it depends mainly on the climatic conditions and slightly on the roof thickness a low k2 value is expected in dry locations and a high k2 value is expected in wet locations and mild sloped roofs these guidelines were tested on a month long simulation for the valid trd roof july 2017 fig 11 high kge values were obtained for soil moisture and runoff simulations kgeq 0 77 kgesw 0 82 indicating good simulation results thiemig et al 2013 the value of s1 was initially selected as 10 mm yielding a good runoff simulation but overestimated the soil moisture by reducing the value of s1 to 6 mm it resulted in a good fit with the valid trd roof this can be attributed to the difference in substrate age between valid trd roofs and the other roofs in the study de ville et al 2017 found the holding capacity of a crushed brick based substrate of an extensive green roof to increase by 7 over five years the modelled period of valid trd was during the third month of operation of the roof which might explain the reduced s1 value compared to other roofs it should be noted that the type of substrate in the study by de ville et al 2017 was different from the substrate of valid trd the value of s11 was taken as 30 mm which was estimated from the value of s11 at osl this because the roof is almost flat 2 degree which affects its exposure to wind and hence reduce the evapotranspiration k1 was fixed to 0 75 following the general guidelines while the value of k2 was estimated as 0 02 from fig 8 by following the curves of trd s2 was taken as 1 5 mm following the general guidelines 5 conclusions this study developed a crrm reservoir model that can be used to estimate the hydrological performance of green roofs the study highlighted the benefits of the multi objective calibrations in which soil moisture measurements are used for calibration together with runoff data in green roof crrms based on the results the following conclusions were drawn the results confirmed the ability of the crrm to simulate runoff from extensive green roofs across multiple climatic zones and different roof configurations the multi objective calibration scheme reduced the uncertainty of the crrm model parameters especially the storage parameters which enhances the physical interpretation of crrm parameters values the scheme results in comparable runoff simulations as the single objective scheme while yielding satisfactory soil moisture simulations this study attempted to give practitioners guidelines to estimate the linear crrm model parameters for new roof configurations however we acknowledge the difficulties of identifying k2 and s11 parameters solely from the green roof characteristics the variation of the parameter k2 amongst the cities was attributed to the rainfall characteristics of each city i e amount intensity adwp the variation of the parameter s11 was attributed to the local climatic conditions i e wind exposure air humidity solar radiation etc and vegetation characteristics of the green roof density and type

such as roads parking lots and rooftops this results in decreased evapotranspiration and infiltration and increased stormwater runoff on a catchment level the ongoing climate change is causing an increase in the intensity of precipitation for many places around the globe sun et al 2006 while global urbanization is growing rapidly luederitz et al 2015 the combined effect of climate change and rapid urbanization is expected to increase the stormwater runoff in the future as stated by yazdanfar sharma 2015 among others green roofs have over the past decade become a popular solution to reduce stormwater runoff in urban areas green roofs have shown great potential in reducing runoff from rooftops as concluded by many studies fassman beck et al 2013 johannessen et al 2018 stovin 2010

as they are simpler and computationally cheaper than physically based models additionally their results are more generic and interpretable than data driven models crrms have been applied successfully in many green roof studies palla et al 2012 soulis et al 2017 stovin et al 2013 vesuviano et al 2014 yio et al 2013 the most common conceptualization is to represent the roof with a cascade of linear or nonlinear tanks representing the different roof layers i e vegetation substrate and drainage layers the storage and the flow of water between the tanks are controlled via parameters due to the simplification of these conceptual models most of their parameters are not physically measurable and hence calibration is needed to find their optimal values many studies have attempted to link the parameters of crrms and the physical characteristics of the green roofs for instance stovin et al 2013 explained how the storage parameters in their reservoir model could be estimated from the substrate s measurable physical properties i e field capacity vesuviano stovin 2013 found the parameters of the drainage layers in their model to be independent of rain intensity while correlated with the physical properties of the drainage layer and the slope of the roof yio et al 2013 found the flow parameters of the substrate layer to be correlated to the depth of the substrate similarly soulis et al 2017 described how the depth of the roof affected the flow parameter in their reservoir model however all the above mentioned studies were conducted in lab scale green roofs in which horizontal water flow through the roof structure is insignificant due to the short horizontal flow length compared to a full scale roof hence there is a need for further studies to estimate crrm parameters for full scale green roofs estimating parameters of green roof models has been done for other models than the reservoir routing based models for instance johannessen et al 2019 attempted to transfer parameters of a swmm model rossman 2015 between similar full scale green roofs located in four norwegian cities the calibrated parameter sets for the same type of green roofs differed between the cities limiting the performance of the transferred parameter sets the limited knowledge on how to estimate crrm parameters of green roofs from climatic and roof characteristics can be attributed to the uncertainty of finding their optimal values many sources of uncertainties can affect parameter values such as the uncertainty of model inputs uncertainty due to the calibration practice and the induced uncertainty due to the model structure for instance sims et al 2019 attributed the errors of their hydrological model to the uncertainty of initial soil moisture measurements on the other hand hernes et al 2020 found the lack of temporal storage in the drainage layer in the mike urban model dhi 2017 to be compensated by the model by assigning unrealistic parameter values during calibration to fit with the observed discharge in this study we investigated the effect of the calibration practice on crrm parameters values many calibration practices can be found in green roof modelling studies such as maximizing nse between observed and simulated runoff hamouz muthanna 2019 liu fassman beck 2017 soulis et al 2017 or minimizing the error between observed and simulated runoff such as the sum of square error or the root mean square error alfredo et al 2010 vesuviano et al 2014 yio et al 2013 however it was found that for all the studies the measured runoff was the only quantity used as a basis of calibration in most green roof modelling studies this was found despite the fact that using only one measured quantity e g observed runoff for model calibration increases the uncertainty of parameter values beven 1989 this is because the parameters of the substrate and vegetation layers do not explicitly simulate the runoff process but other internal processes i e infiltration evapotranspiration soil storage plant storage etc hence using one measured quantity i e runoff might cause convergence towards the wrong parameter set due to the compensation and interaction between model parameters which increase the equifinality beven 1993 in which different parameter sets give similar results hernes et al 2020 demonstrated this by presenting two different parameter sets of a green roof model that gave the same results due to the compensation between substrate and drainage parameters the benefits of constraining hydrological models by calibrating against more than one measured quantity hereafter referred to as multi objective calibration have been discussed frequently in general hydrological modelling studies seibert 2000 applied a multi objective calibration scheme that combined measured groundwater level data and observed streamflow data to calibrate a crrm for multiple catchments the author found that the multi objective calibration scheme significantly reduced parameter uncertainty compared to the typical scheme using streamflow measurements only a similar finding was found by beldring 2002 in which groundwater level data and runoff data were used to calibrate a physically based model for a norwegian catchment parajka et al 2009 found a multi objective calibration scheme combining soil moisture data with runoff data to provide a more robust parameter set for a crrm compared to using only one measured quantity budhathoki et al 2020 applied a multi objective calibration scheme incorporating in site soil moisture measurements with runoff data to calibrate a distributed hydrological model the study found that the scheme to reduce parameter uncertainty while enhancing the simulation accuracy of the internal catchment storage in comparison to a calibration scheme that only used flow measurements in this study a crrm was developed and validated using a dataset of 14 full scale extensive green roofs located in four norwegian cities with different climatic conditions in addition the study investigated the advantages of multi objective calibration i e using soil moisture and runoff for calibration in green roof crrms the study sheds light on how the multi objective calibration improves the model results by reducing the uncertainty of model parameters enhancing their identifiability and their physical interpretation moreover the study attempted to develop a general guideline for estimating parameters for the crrm from climate and physical roof characteristics simplifying the use of the model for practical applications 2 methods and tools 2 1 the hydrological model the hydrological model is a simple two stage reservoir model fig 1 somewhat similar to the one applied in the study by vesuviano et al 2014 and to the faveur model ramier et al 2018 the model represents the roof layers by two tanks an upper tank for the substrate layer and a lower tank for the drainage layer the precipitation p enters the substrate and fills the available storage of the substrate layer s1 water infiltrates into the lower tank when the storage of the substrate layer is surpassed the infiltration process is determined by equation 1 the drainage layer stores the water s2 and the water starts to flow from s2 q after the storage of the drainage layer is filled equation 2 1 inf t k 1

and observed runoff and kge sw is the kling gupta efficiency between simulated and observed soil moisture according to thiemig et al 2013 the kge can be used to classify model results as follows good kge 0 75 satisfactory 0 75 kge 0 5 poor unsatisfactory 0 5 kge multi objective calibration techniques can be divided into pareto based and aggregated efstratiadis koutsoyiannis 2010 the pareto based approach detects sets of non dominated solutions using multi objective evolutionary algorithms while the aggregated approach selects a unique parameter set by multiple criteria embedded into one aggregated objective function making it a best compromise in this study the adopted multi objective calibration scheme can be classified as an aggregated approach similar to the work of seibert 2000 we evaluated two parameterization options of the crrm a linear parameterization in which the values of n1 and n2 were fixed to one during calibration 5 calibrated parameters and a nonlinear parameterization in which n1 and n2 are calibrated 7 calibrated parameters both calibration schemes were applied to the linear and nonlinear parameterizations of the crrm for calibration the differential evolution algorithm de storn price 1997 was applied using the deoptim library in r mullen et al 2011 the algorithm solved the optimization problem by generating populations of candidate solutions each new population was generated from the previous one in such a way that the new objective function of each candidate was either improved or kept the same in the next generation for each calibration scheme 200 generations were done the number of candidates in each population was selected as t h e n u m b e r o f m o d e l p a r a m e t e r s 10 the best result of each generation was stored the best solution of the 200th generation was considered as the optimized parameter set due to the lack of a snow routine in the current model snow periods were excluded 1st of october 31st of march from the simulations 2017 was used for model calibration while 2016 was used for model validation the simulations were done using a 5 minute time step 3 green roof data fourteen green roofs located in four norwegian cities bergen berg trondheim trd sandnes san and oslo osl were used in this study berg receives the highest amount of precipitation followed by san trd and osl the four cities cover three classes of the köppen geiger classification system kottek et al 2006 trd has a subpolar oceanic climate dfc while osl has the warm summer humid continental climate dfb the climate of bergen and sandnes cities is classified as temperate oceanic climate cfb the green roofs were categorized into five groups based on their configurations thin1 with a thickness of 33 mm thin2 with a thickness of 40 mm medium with a total thickness of 80 mm and thick with a thickness higher than 100 mm an additional category termed valid includes an additional green roof located in trondheim trd described in hamouz et al 2018 the valid roof was used to verify the applicability of the developed guidelines to estimate the parameters of the reservoir model the details of the roof configurations are presented in table 1 precipitation temperature and runoff were collected in 1 min resolution between 2015 and 2017 at berg san and trd while osl roofs have eight years of records from 2011 to 2017 the roof valid has a data record of 11 months collected between may 2017 to april 2018 details about field measurements and data processing are documented by johannessen et al 2018 and hamouz et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameterization of the crrm the thin2 roofs in the four cities were used to compare linear and nonlinear parameterizations of the crrm as shown in fig 2 the result confirmed the ability of the two parameterization options to simulate observed and simulated discharges in both calibration and validation periods kge 0 75 the nonlinear parameterization of the crrm produced slightly better runoff simulations higher kge values than the linear option especially in berg and osl roofs similarly skala et al 2019 found a nonlinear model in their study to yield more accurate results than a linear cascade model this can be attributed to the higher degree of freedom for the nonlinear parameterization due to the number of calibrated parameters which improves the calibration schoups et al 2008 however the reduced number of calibrated parameters and the fact that the results produced by the linear parameterization of the crrm model are still classified as good based on the kge criteria thiemig et al 2013 make the linear parameterization of the crrm more favourable over the nonlinear one models with few parameters are widely recommended in the hydrological modelling literature over models with higher model parameters kay et al 2006 oudin et al 2008 tsegaw et al 2019 due to the reduced model parameter interactions and uncertainties 4 2 calibration schemes and parameter values the comparison between the two calibration schemes is presented in fig 2 by considering runoff data only as a basis for calibration it is possible to produce good results of runoff simulations kge 0 75 for both the calibration and validation data however by applying the single objective calibration there is a high risk of yielding unsatisfactory soil moisture simulations fig 3 and fig 4 present one month of runoff and soil moisture simulations from calibration and validation periods at thin2 berg roof using the two calibration schemes the results show how it is possible by applying the single objective scheme to achieve satisfactory runoff calibration in both the calibration and validation periods with a large deviation on the simulated internal state of the roof i e soil moisture which in this case was underestimated this demonstrated the need for alternative calibration strategies which account for the internal state and runoff response in this case it was found that the optimizer converged to optimal solutions by splitting the total roof storage between the substrate and the drainage layer in an unrealistic way which resulted in erroneous soil moisture simulation results a consequence of this approach was a high correlation between the storage parameters s1 and s2 which could result in equifinality where different parameter sets yield similar results similar correlations were found by locatelli et al 2014 between the storage parameters when only runoff was used as a basis for calibration applying the multi objective calibration strategy the model produced satisfactory results for both flow and soil moisture simulations budhathoki et al 2020 found the same that multi objective calibration produced better soil moisture simulations than single objective calibration similarly seibert 2000 reported better runoff and groundwater level simulations by following a multi objective calibration compared to a single objective scheme it should be noted that the trd and san roofs have large gaps in soil moisture measurements in the validation year which resulted in low values of kge for the simulated soil moisture the results presented in fig 5 and fig 6 illustrate the parameter sets of the best solution in each of the 200 generations identified by the de algorithm for the nonlinear and linear parameterization of the crrm respectively it can be noted that the calibration scheme highly affects the uncertainty of parameter values in the two parameterizations of the crrm this can be seen in fig 5 and fig 6 by the range of parameter values giving the same modelling results the single objective calibration made it difficult to conclude on the optimal set of parameters especially the storage parameters if no prior knowledge about the system is utilized for instance soulis et al 2017 applied runoff only for calibrating a reservoir model however the storage parameters in the model were fixed following the result of lab measurements and the calibration results of a physical based model as presented in fig 5 and fig 6 the multi objective calibration scheme resulted in unique clusters of solutions for most parameters that were easier to interpret than the solutions of the single objective scheme for instance s1 values of the thin2 roofs clustered around 10 mm and ranged between 7 mm and 11 mm accounting for 23 to 36 of the substrate thickness likewise locatelli et al 2014 concluded a similar value of s1 when they applied a reservoir model for a green roof with 30 mm substrate depth similar to the thin2 roofs in addition minor differences between s1 values in the four cities were noted for instance the roofs at osl and san had a higher s1 value than those at berg and trd this can be attributed to the different geometries of the roofs particularly the slope the osl roofs have a mild slope of 5 5 and trd and berg roofs have a slope of 16 and san has a slope of 27 through lab measurements getter et al 2007 found the green roof retention i e available permanent storage to increase by decreasing the roof s slope the s1 values at the san roof location were slightly higher than those at berg and trd despite the 27 slope though this was somewhat contradictory to expectation it is difficult to evaluate accurately the value of s1 due to the quality of the soil moisture dataset which can be seen in the model performance during validation another factor that could explain the minor differences of s1 values is the difference of vegetation types and densities amongst the roofs as reported by johannessen et al 2018 trd and berg have lower vegetation coverage and percentages of sedum plants in comparison to san and osl roofs which results in different substrate properties i e porosities due to roots development another interesting finding was the s11 parameter the threshold at which the actual evapotranspiration equals the potential the parameter had a unique value for each city which can be explained by the difference in local climatic conditions e g wind exposure air humidity solar radiation and the vegetation types and densities as reported in johannessen et al 2018 trd roofs were the most wind exposed which increased the evapotranspiration resulting in a lower value of s11 than the other roofs in comparable studies s11 has been fixed to the maximum holding capacity of the roof stovin et al 2013 arguably fixing s11 to the maximum holding capacity might lead to an overestimation of green roof retention for locations without enhanced evapotranspiration conditions e g low wind exposure in addition the differences of vegetation types and densities between the roofs as reported in johannessen et al 2018 study could partly explain the geographical difference of s11 thin2 roofs at trd and berg have higher percentages of local vegetation than osl and san roofs which enhances evapotranspiration resulting in lower values of s11 parameter johannessen et al 2018 reported higher values of event based retention of thin2 roofs at trd and berg in comparison to san and osl cities the value of s2 the permanent storage in the drainage layer varied between the four cities at osl and san roofs s2 was found to vary between 1 mm and 2 mm whereas the value of s2 in trd and berg was found to higher and to vary in a wider range as shown in fig 6 the model used in this study does not explicitly account for the storage due to the plant interception therefore the parameter s2 represents the permanent storages in the drainage and vegetation layers hence the variation of s2 amongst the roofs can somewhat we explained by the differences of vegetation densities and types johannessen et al 2018 locatelli et al 2014 developed a crrm for extensive green roofs with an additional layer representing the plant interception they found the storage parameter of the vegetation layer to be 0 8 mm the sensitivity of s2 was investigated by running grid simulations in which s2 was changed by a fixed step 1 mm while fixing the other model parameters to their optimal values the results of these simulations are illustrated in fig 7 changing the value s2 parameter was found to have no effect on the simulated soil moisture kgesw and to have a little impact on the quality of runoff simulation kgeq except for the thick roofs at trd and osl and the medium roof at trd in addition the range of s2 between 1 mm 2 mm could yield good modelling results kgeq 0 75 in most of the roofs in the study the parameters n1 and n2 showed unpredictable variations for both calibration schemes probably due to compensation with other model parameters further strengthening the conclusion of using the linear parameterization of the crrm similarly vesuviano et al 2014 suggested fixing the value of n in their reservoir model due to the compensation between the n and k parameters by following the multi objective scheme the parameter k1 showed a wide range of variation in the linear parametrization of the crrm fig 6 we investigated how k1 and k2 are related in all roofs in the study this was done by running grid simulations fig 8 in which k1 and k2 were changed by a small step 0 01 while fixing s1 s2 and s11 parameters the result presented in fig 8 suggested a unique k1 k2 relationship for each green roof thickness that was influenced by the local climatic conditions as well the k1 and k2 values can be interchangeable for thin roofs thin1 and thin2 this means that a model with high k1 and low k2 can achieve the same response as a model with low k1 and high k2 values however this is not valid for thick roofs where the k2 value must be lower than k1 for optimal performance the parameter k1 represents the portion of water above field capacity that flows into the drainage layer representing the vertical infiltration of water through the substrate the k2 parameter represents the horizontal movement through the drainage layer i e the portion of water that leaves the roof system green roofs substrates are designed with high porous materials to avoid surface ponding and thus quickly moving from the substrate to the drainage layer after reaching field capacity additionally the horizontal flow distance i e roof length is typically higher than the vertical flow distance i e substrate by orders of magnitude in extensive green roofs hence the vertical movement of water is typically faster than the horizontal movement johannessen et al 2018 therefore it can be concluded that the value of k1 should be higher than k2 which is illustrated in fig 8 it was found that the k1 value can be fixed between 0 75 and 1 for all roofs in the study after fixing the k1 value to 0 75 the variation in the k2 value can be attributed to the location and to some extent the roof depth fig 9 similar relations between roof flow parameters and the substrate depth were described by yio et al 2013 and soulis et al 2017 trd and san roofs were found to have lower k2 values in comparison to the roofs at berg and osl cities this is can be partly explained by the difference in rainfall events characteristics amongst the four cities for instance berg city receives rainfall events with higher amount and intensity and has shorter anticipant dry weather periods adwp in comparison to trd and san cities abdalla et al 2021 consequently the green roofs located at trd and san have in most of the time lower soil moisture contents than the green roof at berg as a result the green roofs at berg were found to have higher k2 values more outflow in comparison to the roofs at trd and san as illustrated in fig 9 it should be noted that osl roofs have the mildest slope and the highest k2 values this is somewhat contradictory to expectation as k2 values are expected to be higher for steep roofs and lower for roofs with mild slopes one possible explanation is the differences of rainfall events characteristics amongst the four cities which influence the value of k2 parameter as explained earlier hence it is expected to observe a higher impact of roof slope on the value of k2 if roofs with different slopes are tested in the same location 4 3 calibration and validation of the crrm model following the multi objective calibration the linear crrm was calibrated and validated for all the green roofs at the four locations in the study the results are shown in table 2 the result confirmed the crrm s ability to produce good runoff modelling results kgeq 0 75 in most cases some of the soil moisture simulations results were unsatisfactory kgesw 0 5 especially for the trd and san roofs which were attributed to large gaps in soil moisture measurements the value of s1 for thin1 thin2 and medium roofs was found to be 9 56 1 44 accounting for 27 36 of the substrate depth for thick roofs the s1 value was found to be 29 3 1 44 which is equivalent to 34 to 38 of the substrate depth these are consistent with the reported literature values of the maximum holding capacities of vegetation mats johannessen et al 2018 locatelli et al 2014 and brick based substrates stovin et al 2013 it can be noted that the variation of s1 values was larger for thick roofs one possible explanation could be the different drainage layer configurations for the roofs in this category table 1 4 4 practical applications of the crrm the hydrological performance of green roofs is typically assessed by estimating retention and detention the former is the permanent reduction of stormwater due to evapotranspiration and it is typically determined from flow accumulation curves stovin et al 2013 on the other hand the detention is the delay and attenuation of drainage outflows due to the temporal storage of water within the green roof layers detention is typically estimated via several indicators such as peak reduction rate peak delay and centroid delay stovin et al 2017 or by using flow duration curves hernes et al 2020 the model developed in this study can be used by practitioners e g stormwater engineers city planners etc to plot flow accumulation curves and flow duration curves from long term simulations to estimate retention and detention performance fig 10 presents the simulated and observed flow accumulation curves and flow duration curves for thin2 roofs flow accumulation curves illustrate the cumulative reduction of precipitation water due to the evapotranspiration of the green roof as shown in fig 10 the model gave accurate estimations of flow accumulation curves at the different climatic regions on the other hand flow duration curves show the values of runoff from green roofs and durations when these runoff values are exceeded therefore they represent the practical implication of green roof detention i e peak delay and attenuation for instance hernes et al 2020 showed how the implementation of green infrastructures at the catchment scale could reduce the duration of drainage flows above a critical value that triggers combined sewer overflow events as presented in fig 10 the crrm estimated accurately the flow duration curves at the four cities except for high runoff values duration 1hr and low values duration 1000 hr 4 5 guidelines to estimate parameters of the linear crrm well calibrated crrm yielded satisfactory runoff and soil moisture simulations across different climatic regions and can be used to estimate green roof retention and detention performances based on the results of this study we attempted to give guidelines that can be used to estimates the linear crrm parameters when observations are not available for model calibration s1 represents the available permanent storage in all substrate layers vegetation mats were found to have around 23 to 36 of their total depth while brick based substrates have around 40 of total substrate depth the optimal range of the parameter s2 was found to be 1 mm 2 mm in most of the roofs this parameter represents the permanent storages of the vegetation i e interception and drainage layers s11 varies according to local climatic conditions and the vegetation characteristics of the green roof but it is typically less than the total substrate thickness s11 is lower for locations with enhanced evapotranspiration conditions wind exposure humidity vegetation density etc further studies are needed to relate the s11 value with local climatic conditions and vegetation characteristics the value of k1 represents the vertical movement of water which is typically faster than the horizontal movement a k1 value of 0 75 was found to fit with the different roof characteristics and climatic regions the value of k2 ranges between 0 01 and 0 15 in all roofs in our study it depends mainly on the climatic conditions and slightly on the roof thickness a low k2 value is expected in dry locations and a high k2 value is expected in wet locations and mild sloped roofs these guidelines were tested on a month long simulation for the valid trd roof july 2017 fig 11 high kge values were obtained for soil moisture and runoff simulations kgeq 0 77 kgesw 0 82 indicating good simulation results thiemig et al 2013 the value of s1 was initially selected as 10 mm yielding a good runoff simulation but overestimated the soil moisture by reducing the value of s1 to 6 mm it resulted in a good fit with the valid trd roof this can be attributed to the difference in substrate age between valid trd roofs and the other roofs in the study de ville et al 2017 found the holding capacity of a crushed brick based substrate of an extensive green roof to increase by 7 over five years the modelled period of valid trd was during the third month of operation of the roof which might explain the reduced s1 value compared to other roofs it should be noted that the type of substrate in the study by de ville et al 2017 was different from the substrate of valid trd the value of s11 was taken as 30 mm which was estimated from the value of s11 at osl this because the roof is almost flat 2 degree which affects its exposure to wind and hence reduce the evapotranspiration k1 was fixed to 0 75 following the general guidelines while the value of k2 was estimated as 0 02 from fig 8 by following the curves of trd s2 was taken as 1 5 mm following the general guidelines 5 conclusions this study developed a crrm reservoir model that can be used to estimate the hydrological performance of green roofs the study highlighted the benefits of the multi objective calibrations in which soil moisture measurements are used for calibration together with runoff data in green roof crrms based on the results the following conclusions were drawn the results confirmed the ability of the crrm to simulate runoff from extensive green roofs across multiple climatic zones and different roof configurations the multi objective calibration scheme reduced the uncertainty of the crrm model parameters especially the storage parameters which enhances the physical interpretation of crrm parameters values the scheme results in comparable runoff simulations as the single objective scheme while yielding satisfactory soil moisture simulations this study attempted to give practitioners guidelines to estimate the linear crrm model parameters for new roof configurations however we acknowledge the difficulties of identifying k2 and s11 parameters solely from the green roof characteristics the variation of the parameter k2 amongst the cities was attributed to the rainfall characteristics of each city i e amount intensity adwp the variation of the parameter s11 was attributed to the local climatic conditions i e wind exposure air humidity solar radiation etc and vegetation characteristics of the green roof density and type

3606,groundwater recharge gwr is one of the most challenging water fluxes to estimate as it relies on observed data that are often limited in many developing countries this study developed an innovative water budget method using satellite products for estimating the spatially distributed gwr at monthly and annual scales in tropical wet sedimentary regions despite cloudy conditions the distinctive features proposed in this study include the capacity to address 1 evapotranspiration estimations in tropical wet regions frequently overlaid by substantial cloud cover and 2 seasonal root zone water storage estimations in sedimentary regions prone to monthly variations the method also utilises satellite based information of the precipitation and surface runoff the gwr was estimated and validated for the hydrologically contrasting years 2016 and 2017 over a tropical wet sedimentary region located in north eastern brazil which has substantial potential for groundwater abstraction this study showed that applying a cloud cleaning procedure based on monthly compositions of biophysical data enables the production of a reasonable proxy for evapotranspiration able to estimate groundwater by the water budget method the resulting gwr rates were 219 2016 and 302 2017 mm yr 1 showing good correlations cc 0 68 to 0 83 and slight underestimations pbias 13 to 9 when compared with the referenced estimates obtained by the water table fluctuation method for 23 monitoring wells sensitivity analysis shows that water storage changes account for 19 to 22 of our monthly evaluation the satellite based approach consistently demonstrated that the consideration of cloud cleaned evapotranspiration and root zone soil water storage changes are essential for a proper estimation of spatially distributed gwr in tropical wet sedimentary regions because of their weather seasonality and cloudy conditions keywords remote sensing water balance groundwater recharge water table fluctuation tropical climate sedimentary aquifer 1 introduction understanding the factors constraining groundwater recharge gwr is important for management and planning purposes of this water resource that is only slowly renewed cuthbert et al 2019 in some regions for instance the abstracted groundwater over the past decades are taken from non renewable groundwater döll et al 2014 which increases even more the need for a better understanding of such factors these abstractions need to be regionally regulated aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 since groundwater serves as the key strategic reserve for supplying water to societies during long lasting droughts famiglietti 2014 such regulation in turn requires accurate information about the spatiotemporal distribution of natural gwr rates jasechko et al 2014 including their variability and uncertainty in estimations which are strongly sensitive to climate forcing factors land uses and covers watershed geomorphology and local hydrogeology moeck et al 2020 since gwr is a key component used in many hydrological models to assess groundwater resource worldwide graaf et al 2017 wada et al 2010 its accurate estimation constitutes a priority for stakeholders and a research challenge for the scientific community jasechko et al 2014 mohan et al 2018 many methods have been developed to estimate natural gwr at various spatiotemporal scales with a wide range of complexity walker et al 2019 given that gwr cannot be directly measured melo et al 2015 making use of these methods often depends on data availability desired spatiotemporal resolution and result representations walker et al 2019 the following five methods are commonly used to estimate gwr 1 tracer techniques which estimate aquifer renewal via substances in the water or specific concentrations of chemical elements such as the chloride mass balance method e g brunner et al 2004 hornero et al 2016 2 groundwater level monitoring in unconfined aquifers which include examples such as water table fluctuation method e g cai and ofterdinger 2016 wendland et al 2007 and cumulative rainfall departure methods e g ahmadi et al 2015 weber and stewart 2004 3 darcy s law application which allows calculating the velocity of soil water percolation and requires knowledge of hydraulic gradient and vertical hydraulic conductivity e g callahan et al 2012 yin et al 2011 4 numerical modelling which consists of a mathematical representation of the gwr process e g melo et al 2015 melo and wendland 2017 and 5 the water balance method which considers the main variables of the hydrological cycle as inputs and outputs of the system e g hornero et al 2016 wendland et al 2007 most of the aforementioned methods are based on point scale observations e g meteorological stations or boreholes which may cause serious issues when spatial variability in the regions of concern is great e g melo and wendland 2017 although such a problem can be simply ignored for regions with extremely dense observation networks it remains persistent in most regions worldwide especially in developing countries for instance in brazil the national ground based monitoring network consists of about 400 wells distributed over the country complemented by a small number of observation wells monitored in only 21 active experimental basins melo et al 2020 therefore the chief challenge for many hydrologists is to find and utilise alternative sources of data to estimate the spatial information of gwr brunner et al 2007 the use of cutting edge satellite derived remote sensing technology has played a crucial role in assimilating valuable distributed observation and in modelling water resources which would otherwise be impossible with relatively sparse ground based measurements alone famiglietti et al 2015 however the remote sensing contributions are rather inconsistent at quantifying and estimating gwr because all current data from satellite data can only detect patterns and processes related to water resources on and above the surface brunner et al 2007 coelho et al 2017 lucas et al 2015 satellite based observations of time variable gravity such as the joint mission of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace are sensitive to variations of terrestrial water storage including the groundwater storage changes tapley et al 2004 vasco et al 2019 wahr et al 2004 unfortunately the low spatial resolution of grace derived data limits its ability to provide localised groundwater information at an appropriate scale alley and konikow 2015 lakshmi et al 2018 thus an innovative use of satellite data to estimate gwr at local and regional scales has been recently proposed where most of data are applied to a simplified water budget approach that uses precipitation and evapotranspiration products e g crosbie et al 2015 gokmen et al 2013 lucas et al 2015 műnch et al 2013 szilágyi et al 2012 szilagyi et al 2011 this approach disregards other water balance components such as surface runoff and soil water storage changes which could considerably alter the estimation accuracy of gwr in some regions for short time scales e g monthly in this context some studies also have considered uniform surface runoff khalaf and donoghue 2012 as well as spatially distributed information about surface runoff coelho et al 2017 and irrigation usman et al 2015 the aforementioned studies used different remote sensing products and algorithms but all of them were developed in regions with arid semiarid continental or mediterranean climate conditions where the cloud cover is limited coelho et al 2017 for some tropical regions such as brazil the estimation of gwr using this approach remains challenging mainly because of the difficulties in obtaining continuous information of actual evapotranspiration data by remote sensing without substantial cloud cover in parallel soil moisture information from satellite observations is currently available at the global scale and can provide valuable data to update the water budget approach with information regarding water storage changes in unsaturated soil layers reichle et al 2018 accounting for this component is particularly important for understanding gwr in sedimentary aquifers where the unsaturated vadose zone width may vary from thin to thick soil layers rossetti et al 2012 unfortunately some satellite based datasets are only recently available but some applications require earlier data based on this information this study develops an innovative water budget method using satellite based data for estimating natural spatially distributed gwr rates at annual and monthly scales in tropical wet sedimentary regions taking into account cloudy conditions accordingly this study hypothesizes that such an approach enables local and regional scale perspectives in ungauged tropical wet regions the general and transferable strategy would be relevant to account for 1 the substantial cloud cover and 2 the water storage changes in sedimentary regions prone to monthly variations the method also utilises spatially distributed information on precipitation and surface runoff estimated from satellite products the major limitation of this residual approach is that the accuracy of the gwr depends on the accuracy of the other components considered in the water balance scanlon et al 2002 i e its application is appropriated when the errors of these components are small relative to the water flux this limitation when a satellite based approach is considered is mainly identified in regions that present ground truth measurements discrepant with the estimated products used in the water balance especially the main input precipitation and output evapotranspiration of the system on the other hand ground based evaluations are punctual and representative of small areas hardly integrating the spatial heterogeneity of meteorological processes especially in urban areas maier et al 2020 this study used ground truth measurements to assess the two main estimated components of the water balance i e precipitation and evapotranspiration and the gwr rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out over an area of 1032 km2 in joão pessoa jpa paraíba ne brazil which includes the metropolitan region and surrounding rural areas fig 1 it consists in 1 the gramame river basin 589 1 km2 57 1 of the area and 2 the right bank of the baixo paraíba river basin 442 9 km2 42 9 of the area the main source of water of the jpa metropolitan region 1 million inhabitants is the gramame mamuaba reservoir with maximum volume capacity of 56 9 hm3 the water supply is complemented by more than 756 wells cprm geological service of brazil 2020 pumped mostly for the public industry and irrigation which are essential during periods of surface water shortage the jpa has a tropical wet climate with a dry summer i e as according to the köppen climate classification with a mean temperature of 26 c and well distinguished rainy and dry seasons alvares et al 2013 the average annual precipitation is 1700 mm of which 70 occurs from march to august during the austral autumn and winter the potential evapotranspiration is relatively high in jpa with mean annual values greater than 1500 mm the predominant land use and land cover lulc types in jpa are cropland 30 7 atlantic forest 28 4 pasture 26 3 and urban areas 9 5 the forest areas are atlantic remnants and the cropland areas contain mainly sugarcane and pineapple crops moreover the main soil types in jpa are acrisols 58 7 fluvisols 12 0 podzols 10 8 lixisols 9 1 and histosols 5 5 the fluvisols and histosols surround the rivers and the jpa urban area the hydrogeological framework mainly consists in 1 a coastal multi layered sedimentary aquifer system near the littoral i e the paraíba basin and 2 a regional substratum that outcrops upstream in the more continental area i e the borborema province this latter corresponds to the crystalline regional basement that was affected by rifting processes due to the cretaceos atlantic aperture this resulted in a graben that was progressively and sequentially filled by sediments as follows 1 up to 360 m thick fluvial sandstones of the beberibe formation from the coniacian santonian age 2 a 70 m thick fossiliferous calciferous sandstones and muddy siltstones of the itamaracá formation formed in marine transitional settings during the santonian campanian age 3 a 50 m thick phosphatic rocks and calciferous shales of the marine gramame formation from the campanian maastrichtian age and 4 a nearly 70 m thick succession of fluvial sandstones and mudstones of the barreiras formation from the early middle miocene ages rossetti et al 2012 rossetti et al 2011 2 2 satellite based water budget approach the actual gwr rates defined as the rate at which water arrives at the table of an aquifer mathias et al 2017 were spatially estimated from the residual terms of the water budget equation using satellite based information this estimation was performed for two hydrologically contrasting years 2016 and 2017 in which ground based information was measured to evaluate the results the gwr rates were then calculated at the monthly and annual scales by eq 1 1 g w r p e t δ s q i f p e t δ s q 0 0 i f p e t δ s q 0 where gwr is the groundwater recharge p is the precipitation et is the actual evapotranspiration δs is the water storage change at a root zone scale 100 cm depth and q is the surface runoff other input and output water balance components were not investigated in this study because 1 they frequently represent relatively small contributions to the root zone e g water pumping or are implicitly considered in the aforementioned components e g irrigation and interception and 2 there are no reliable in situ data available for the jpa moreover horizontal groundwater flow was also neglected because it refers to a slower gwr mechanism rather than the direct contribution of vertical infiltration e g coelho et al 2017 crosbie et al 2015 műnch et al 2013 since 70 of the study area has terrain slope ranging from 0 to 92 m km 1 which means that the topography predominantly presents weak slopes all the used remote sensing products and other input data are summarised in fig 2 and described thoroughly in the next sub items of this sub section 2 2 1 precipitation p was estimated by the global precipitation measurement gpm mission which is an international network of satellites undertaken by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa of the usa and the japanese aerospace agency jaxa huffman et al 2018 this mission provides rainfall and snowfall information globally via the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg products at 0 1 10 km and 30 min resolutions huffman et al 2018 imerg is an algorithm that combines microwave and infrared estimates from the gpm constellation this study used version v05b of the imerg final run product the imerg final run product also incorporates monthly gauge observations from the global precipitation climatology gpcc and other ancillary data to improve the satellite estimations skofronick jackson et al 2017 this product is ready for use after 3 5 months of the data acquisition skofronick jackson et al 2018 the advantage of imerg is the high spatial resolution when compared to other satellite based products on the other hand the weakness of this product is its latency 3 5 months which is inappropriate for real time applications imerg p is a valuable source of information for global and regional applications mainly because of its high spatiotemporal resolution however for medium and small scale hydrological studies the spatial resolution of 0 1 of the imerg product is still coarse sharifi et al 2019 due to the dimension of the study area the imerg data was downscaled to a resolution of 0 0045 500 m similarly to lu et al 2019 the bilinear interpolation method was used to downscale the imerg product as it can provide consistent data disaggregation moghim et al 2016 the 30 min imerg data were accumulated aggregated to daily monthly and annual p scales the accuracy of remote sensing p products can be hampered by various factors such as calculation algorithms and satellite sensor characteristics semire et al 2012 the assessment carried out by gadelha et al 2019 found that in comparison with the ground based rainfall data the imerg v05b effectively captures the p spatial patterns over most of the brazilian territory except for the entire coastal zone of ne brazil where underestimates occurs for this reason a linear scaling bias correction procedure was applied lenderink et al 2007 using a single correction factor per month calculated by the ratio between the monthly averages of rain gauges and the imerg data le et al 2018 rather than a grid box correction i e pixel per pixel to preserve the original spatial distribution of the imerg data p data measured from 16 rain gauges that are subjected to quality control were used for the imerg bias correction and comparison purposes fig 1c the gridded observed rainfall data were estimated by inverse distance weighting interpolation for comparison purposes quantile quantile plots between the bias corrected imerg interpolated data henceforth imerg c and ground based interpolated data were built at the monthly and annual scales for every 10 percentiles i e 0 10 90 100 over these estimates the linear regressions were plotted and their slope and y intersect values were calculated moreover the rain gauges interpolated data were used as input to spatially estimate the runoff and the gwr from the water budget equation the estimates were then compared with the estimated components obtained from the satellite based approach 2 2 2 actual evapotranspiration the et was estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 which was also adopted by mu et al 2007 to create the first global et product mod16 the mod16 is a product from nasa based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensors installed on two satellites terra and aqua as well as reanalysis derived meteorological inputs currently the mod16 dataset provides et at the global scale with a spatial resolution of 500 m and three different timescales 8 d monthly and annual scales unlike the algorithm used by mu et al 2011 to generate the current mod16 product this study calculated the et based on the algorithm developed by mu et al 2007 using the biome property look up table shown by running et al 2017 the algorithm proposed by mu et al 2007 was based on eq 2 and assumes that night time et is small and in turn negligible 2 λ e λ e transp λ e soil δ a ρ c p e s e a r a δ γ 1 r s r a where λ is the latent heat of evaporation 2 45 mj kg 1 λe is the latent heat flux density w m 2 consisting of the plant transpiration λetransp and

the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the mod16 algorithm is only suitable to use under clear sky conditions as modis satellite sensors cannot measure cloud base parameters sur et al 2015 this occurs because the mod16 generates the et based on some 8 day modis products i e pixels of the best observations from the last eight days with 500 m spatial resolutions e g mod15a2h and mcd43a2 a3 these 8 d products remain insufficient to attenuate cloudy condition effects on et estimations in some regions running et al 2017 the available mod09q1 terra and myd09q1 aqua reflectance products were used in this study due to their suitable 250 m and 8 d resolutions to obtain the biophysical data namely 1 the leaf area index lai using the soil adjusted vegetation index savi bastiaanssen et al 1998 huete 1988 2 the vegetation cover fraction calculated by the enhanced vegetation index evi2 proposed by jiang et al 2008 and 3 the surface albedo alb computed by the equation proposed by teixeira et al 2013 to address the shortcomings related to cloudy conditions this study carried out monthly map compositions with 8 d grid biophysical inputs i e evi2 lai and alb the monthly compositions were based on the selection of pixels with higher values of lai and evi2 obtained from the eight images available per month i e four mod09q1 and four myd09q1 assuming that lower or negative values of these two biophysical parameters were possibly contaminated by clouds conversely for the monthly compositions of alb only the lower values per pixel from the eight images available per month were considered assuming that higher values of albedo were possibly contaminated by clouds these new data then assumed clear sky conditions to indicate fixed input parameters throughout a month and were used to generate daily et data the mod16 product also uses global lulc classification from modis land cover type mcd12q1 as an input to obtain information about canopy conductance and plant transpiration however the global representation of the mcd12q1 which is associated with the limited number of classes 17 can misidentify some local and regional specificities of the vegetation and introduce considerable errors in the estimation of et for medium and small areas ruhoff et al 2013 therefore we used a regional lulc classification seeg oc 2015 namely the mapbiomas project http mapbiomas org mapbiomas provides landsat based annual lulc maps associated with 27 classes at a 30 m spatial resolution processed from 1985 in this study mapbiomas lulc collection 3 1 was reclassified into six general classes barren land forest cropland pasture urban and water body before being used to generate et data the mod16 product uses the global meteorological reanalysis data provided by nasa s global modelling and assimilation office gmao at a 0 5 0 6 or 1 0 1 25 spatial resolution as inputs of the original algorithm mu et al 2011 2007 running et al 2017 gmao incorporates ground and satellite based observations to provide information with a 6 h temporal resolution unlike the mod16 product this study used the gldas noah l4 v2 1 meteorological product provided by the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 it allowed providing the following meteorological data with 3 h and 0 25 resolutions downward shortwave radiation air pressure air temperature and specific humidity the meteorological data were retrieved from four pixels covering most of jpa and were averaged and used as inputs for the et estimation the daily mean estimated et was tested against the penman monteith equation which is considered the universal standard approach for calculating daily reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 such a comparison does not validate the estimates but only assess if both evapotranspiration time series oscillate and peak with similar amplitudes and magnitudes respectively the meteorological data used to calculate the et0 were acquired from a meteorological station inside jpa which belongs to the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet acronym in portuguese fig 1c additionally the mean 8 day et data from the original mod16a2 product was also used to check the daily estimates using the cloud cleaning procedure combined with a more fine tuned dataset 2 2 3 soil water storage changes the soil water storage changes were calculated using root zone moisture information of the soil moisture active passive smap mission from nasa estimated each 2 to 3 days since 2015 reichle et al 2018 the smap level 4 l4 provides global near surface 0 5 cm and root zone 0 100 cm soil moisture with the smap l4 surface and root zone soil moisture analysis update spl4smau product reichle et al 2017 the 100 cm root zone spl4smau soil moisture product 3 h temporal and 9 km spatial resolution whose data result from the assimilation of l band brightness temperature data into the nasa catchment land surface model was used to obtain the soil water storage by the soil moisture difference from one day to another multiplied by the root zone depth of 1000 mm reichle et al 2018 based on the smap orbit revisit time the soil moisture data were scheduled to be retrieved at 6 00 a m and 6 00 p m at the legal local time however since the satellite takes 2 to 3 days to map the whole globe some images over jpa were missing for a range of days of the year thus similar to the study carried out by souza et al 2018 the soil moisture data were calculated in three ways 1 if both orbits were completed on the same day then both values were averaged 2 if only one orbit had a valid value then this value was considered for that day and 3 if no valid value was obtained in any orbit then the soil moisture calculated for the previous day was repeated finally the soil water storage changes were calculated by summing positive or negative daily differences in the spl4smau root zone data at the monthly and annual scales which was performed after interpolating their images from a 9 km to a 500 m resolution through bilinear interpolation same as that for p 2 2 4 surface runoff the surface runoff was estimated using the natural resources conservation service curve number nrcs cn method hawkins et al 1985 the nrcs cn method combines climatic and physiographic characteristics in empirical formulas that convert basic descriptive data into numeric values to estimate the excess p that was not intercepted stored or infiltrated deshmukh et al 2013 we implemented this estimation spatially with daily p the daily runoff estimates were then summed pixel by pixel at monthly and annual scales thus avoiding the overestimation errors that stem from its direct calculation at monthly and annual scales awadallah et al 2017 we choose the nrcs cn method because of its simplicity ease of use and widespread acceptance ponce and hawkins 1996 verma et al 2017 focusing on scarce data regions in developing countries but taking advantage of freely available remote sensing data the nrcs cn method is based on a water budget equation that assumes that p must exceed the initial abstraction ia being a soil dependent fraction λ of the maximum water storage capacity s before any direct runoff q is triggered a fixed value of λ equals to 0 20 is recommended by the original method and widely adopted in the united states hawkins et al 1985 however the initial losses depend on the local and regional characteristics of the watershed many studies including some carried out in brazilian catchments indicated that the value proposed by the original method is too high for many parts of the world and recommended λ values of about 0 05 or less e g ajmal and kim 2015 durán barroso et al 2017 shi et al 2009 valle junior et al 2019 veeck et al 2020 recently the studies by lal et al 2019 lal et al 2017 reviewed the values of λ for 63 watersheds worldwide with various lulc finding 0 03 as a representative value which was also used in our study in this context the new runoff and water storage capacity calculations under average wet conditions sii λ 0 03 are shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 q p 0 03 s i i λ 0 03 2 p 0 97 s i i λ 0 03 i f p

spatially assigned to different hydrologic soil cover complexes using a look up table built in a gis platform the hydrologic soil cover complexes refer to the different combinations of lulc and hydrological soil groups hsgs contained in a study area the hsg information was created from the regional information about soil types provided by araújo filho et al 2000 the hsg was assigned according to the soil type following the methodology proposed by sartori et al 2005 that consists of 19 criteria based on a survey of 58 soil profiles and hydrodynamic data in brazil the lulc information was obtained from mapbiomas collection 3 1 the same used for estimating et the potential runoff before a surface runoff event generated by the nrcs cn method depends on the antecedent moisture condition amc hawkins et al 1985 the proper condition was identified through the 5 d antecedent cumulative p p5d mm which was calculated for each p grid cell for this purpose three intervals of p5d were used distinguishing between the growing season gs from march to july and the dormant season ds from august to february according to the amc similar to those in lal et al 2017 the p5d intervals in this study were defined as amc i dry conditions if p5d 35 56 mm gs or p5d 12 7 mm ds amc ii average conditions if 35 56 p5d 53 34 mm gs or 12 70 p5d 27 94 mm ds and amc iii wet conditions if p5d 53 34 mm gs or p5d 27 94 mm ds moreover the p5d intervals of ds were considered for the urban and barren areas whereas the p5d intervals of gs were considered for the forest areas throughout all months of the year because of their active vegetation growing conditions finally the cni and cniii values were determined under amc i and amc iii respectively based on lal et al 2019 2 3 evaluation of groundwater recharge estimates the gwr rates were evaluated by the water table fluctuation wtf method healy and cook 2002 scanlon et al 2002 the ground based gwr rates obtained from wtf eq 5 were used to evaluate the spatially distributed gwr rates estimated by the water budget equation on a 1 km footprint around the wells to comprehensively consider the surrounding characteristics their absolute gwr mm and relative gwr p estimates were compared through linear regressions 5 r w t f s y δ h δ t where rwtf denotes the estimated recharge rate mm time step using wtf sy represents the aquifer specific yield coefficient δh is the cumulated rising piezometric level changes mm and δt is the time from the beginning of the rise to the peak δh corresponds to the sum of the actual groundwater rise and the potential groundwater decline for the same period with the latter being obtained by extrapolating the antecedent recession curve healy and cook 2002 wendland et al 2007 the groundwater fluctuation data were manually collected every 45 days from 16 in 2016 and 23 monitoring wells in 2017 located in the barreiras formation fig 1c seven additional wells were drilled in 2017 in the urban area these monitoring wells are well distributed throughout the study area and therefore capable to characterise the local groundwater since they cover several soil types depths from shallow to deep and lulc from the coastline to the headwater this monitoring network was carefully selected so as to have no groundwater pumping in or nearby the monitoring wells the temporal variations of groundwater fluctuations were also used to compare the overall behaviour of the monthly satellite based gwr estimates the values of sy equal to 0 10 16 wells and 0 24 7 wells were estimated by pumping tests in four wells and assigned to the others based on their similar local characteristics including the groundwater level patterns 2 4 statistical metrics three statistical metrics were selected to evaluate the goodness of fit of the results the first metric was the correlation coefficient cc eq 6 which describes the relationship between variations in simulated and observed values the other two metrics were the percent bias pbias eq 7 and the relative root mean square error rrmse eq 8 both with perfect values equal to 0 which were used to describe the bias and error between simulated and observed values respectively 6 c c i 1 n g i g s i s i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 7 p b i a s i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i 100 8 r r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 g 100 where si and gi are the satellite and ground based data respectively and s and g are the mean values of the satellite and ground based data respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation the first set of analyses assessed the spatiotemporal distributions of the main input of the water balance i e p obtained from imerg c data and compared these with the ground based interpolated data henceforth gauge fig 3 annual p based on imerg c data gradually decreased from east to west varying from 1120 to 1600 mm in 2016 and 1050 to 2300 mm in 2017 the maximum p based on gauge observations was 1630 mm in 2016 and 2070 mm in 2017 similarly lu et al 2019 showed consistent spatial patterns and maximum values of imerg p after performing bias correction using monitoring data p obtained in jpa from the imerg c data occurred mostly within the regular rainy season i e from march to july corresponding to 71 in 2016 and 77 in 2017 of the annual totals the monthly variations in p in 2016 from the imerg c and gauge data were similar fig 3e f whereas the imerg c variation was larger than the gauge variation in some months of 2017 particularly in june and july when the 10 90 percentile ranges were 60 higher and double respectively despite such differences the average values obtained by imerg c were similar to those from the gauge in most of the months showing that imerg c was able to detect the temporal variation of p the deviations between the imerg c and ground based interpolated p were also assessed using quantile quantile plots fig 4 at the monthly scale a suitable correlation cc 0 97 and a reasonable fit using linear regressions slope 1 01 y intersect 1 68 were found with some deviations in march june and july good correlations between the imerg products and the observed dataset have been found by other studies in tropical regions at the monthly scale e g satgé et al 2017 tan and duan 2017 the monthly mean error was 23 higher than the annual mean error i e 8 these values remained within the acceptable ranges for satellite based monthly p salles et al 2019 acceptable metrics were also found at the annual scale despite the slight deviation of the linear regression slope 1 20 y intersect 314 mm such a deviation probably occurred due to the larger variation of the ground based p on the western side of the study area in 2017 which likely stemmed from the limited number of rain gauges used on the interpolation see fig 1 according to tang et al 2016 the underestimation of this satellite based p data can occur over regions with wet climates and low latitudes the results found in this analysis confirm that the imerg c data enabled the mapping of the decreasing p gradient in the study area 3 2 actual evapotranspiration the spatial et distribution estimated by the modified mod16 algorithm applying cloud cleaning is shown in fig 5 overall the mean annual et varied from 1 170 in 2016 to 1 220 mm in 2017 the results were consistently distinguishable amongst the lulc types with values smaller than 850 mm in the urban areas and above 1450 mm in the forest areas at the monthly scale the ranges of the average estimates were similar between the studied years varying from 73 to 119 mm in 2016 and 85 to 114 mm in 2017 however comparing the monthly mean estimates of 2017 with those of 2016 they were smaller at the beginning closer at the middle and higher at the end of the year in the rainy season smaller differences between high and low et data were observed showing monthly averages in the 10 90 percentile ranges equal to 63 in 2016 and 58 mm in 2017 from april to august on the other hand larger differences between high and low et data occurred in the dry season as shown by the monthly averages in the 10 90 percentile ranges equal to 84 in 2016 and 87 mm in 2017 from september to march lima and ribeiro 2018 showed that such seasonable patterns can stem from the associations between meteorological and evapotranspiration estimates by using the mapbiomas lulc and gldas meteorological forcing data to calculate spatially distributed et thus variations in the et throughout the studied years in jpa were likely influenced by the combination of lulc diversity weather seasonality and cloudy conditions the mean daily et obtained by the modified mod16 algorithm ranged from 1 0 to 4 7 mm d 1 during the whole study period whereas the mean et0 varied from 3 0 to 7 0 mm d 1 fig 6 the et0 was as much as three times higher than the et estimated by the proposed approach between august and february dry season due to the lower soil water availability in these months this difference is plausible since et0 refers to the evapotranspiration of well watered grass vegetation with active growth throughout the year such a difference considerably shrunk during the rainy seasons with the actual and reference evapotranspiration following the same temporal behaviour as expected the daily et estimates obtained by the proposed methodology were greater than those acquired by the mean 8 day mod16a2 product for the studied period which ranged from 1 9 to 3 9 mm d 1 fig 6 consequently the mean annual et estimated by the mod16a2 was lower than those obtained by the modified mod16 algorithm for 2016 895 mm and 2017 938 mm the values of et estimated by the mod16a2 product was also lower than those found by other studies using the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal in river basins with similar characteristics in ne brazil e g oliveira et al 2014 although slightly higher the et estimates presented the same temporal patterns observed by the original mod16a2 product the differences found between the original and the modified approaches can possibly be attributed to the following factors 1 the missing data in some pixels of the mod16a2 product because of the presence of cloud cover 2 the use of a more fine tuned lulc regional product and 3 the use of a higher resolution input meteorological data for instance ruhoff et al 2013 identified that the misclassification of the lulc data used in the mod16a2 product combined with the low spatial resolution of the gmao reanalysis meteorological information and the cloud cover contaminated pixels were the largest contributors to over or under estimate the eddy covariance measurements in a humid tropical river basin located in south eastern brazil recently a study carried by melo et al 2021 used 25 flux towers to evaluate four remote sensing based et algorithms in many ecoregions over south america including the mod16 model forced by ground based meteorological data an average uncertainty of 10 was found for the mod16 algorithm when considering all studied ecoregions with relatively higher performance observed for wet climate regions this overall uncertainty observed by melo et al 2021 for the mod16 algorithm was similar to those found by ruhoff et al 2013 in two sites in brazil after the mod16 algorithm parameter fitting based on land use and land cover i e without the use of the mod12q1 product 3 3 soil water storage changes the annual water storage changes in the root zone throughout jpa varied from 27 to 6 mm during 2016 and from 40 to 12 mm during 2017 fig 7 annual water storage decreases suggest that the root zone released water during the studied period which is in part due to vertical percolation to aquifers despite its original coarse resolution spl4smau consistently showed a water storage increase in the root zone mostly during the rainy season likely because there is more water in the top layer after p the water increase in the root zone in december 2016 likely stemmed from substantial p fig 3e when the south atlantic convergence zone was positioned further eastward palharini and vila 2017 moreover as expected the urban areas featured large water decreases in the root zone in both years likely because of the lower infiltration caused by soil imperviousness whereas the rural areas featured a larger spatial variation in water decreases these results show that an above average rainy condition is required for an annual water increase in the root zone implying a susceptibility in jpa to water shortage 3 4 surface runoff the mean annual surface runoff estimated from the imerg c data varied from 220 in 2016 to 300 in 2017 mm fig 8 due to soil imperviousness urban areas produced annual runoff estimates greater than 450 mm in 2017 higher values of surface runoff from imerg c data also occurred outside the urban area in relation to that from gauge because of the high p in june and july in the regular rainy season i e from march to july the mean annual surface runoff estimated with imerg c data accounted for 200 mm in 2016 and 265 mm in 2017 the sources of uncertainties surrounding the nrcs cn method were analysed by durán barroso et al 2017 which include 1 a significant weakness to select representative events for simulation with the nrcs cn parameters and 2 the impossibility of determining an optimum value for λ but lower values are recommended instead of the original value for instance the study carried out by veeck et al 2020 in a brazilian catchment found fitted initial losses lower than the original value for almost all simulated events with relative errors below 12 however quantifying uncertainties of rainfall runoff is a very complex issue in brazil due to the lack of data 3 5 groundwater recharge on average the gwr rates ranged from 219 in 2016 to 302 mm yr 1 in 2017 fig 9 these results remained within the range of the gwr rates of several tropical wet regions throughout the world e g malakar et al 2019 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 vu and merkel 2019 the urban area featured greater gwr rates than other areas despite its greater surface runoff likely due to the combination of lower et and sandy soils minnig et al 2018 o driscoll et al 2010 as well as to the higher p estimates for the coastline than for the headwaters consistently moeck et al 2020 also showed that in the eastern part of brazil high gwr rates can occur despite the annual potential evapotranspiration being greater than 1500 mm because of the large amount and seasonality of p at the monthly scale gwr rates using imerg c and gauge data averaged 34 7 and 36 5 mm month 1 in 2016 and 47 7 and 51 4 mm month 1 in 2017 respectively these monthly estimates using imerg c data were similar to the gauge estimates although the difference doubled in 2017 due to higher surface runoff estimated in june and july using imerg c data the differing gwr rates obtained for the gauge data were likely influenced by the sensitivity of modelled groundwater recharge estimates to the rain gauge network scale wiebe and rudolph 2020 the differences caused by disregarding the soil water storage changes were negligible at the annual scale reducing the mean relative gwr by less than 1 for the studied years which likely occurred due to the compensation of the water increases and decreases in the root zone throughout the rainy and dry seasons conversely at the monthly scale neglecting the soil water storage changes would have considerably impacted the gwr values increasing their mean relative estimates by as much as 19 in 2016 and 12 in 2017 during the rainy season and decreasing their mean relative estimates by 22 in 2016 and 13 in 2017 during the dry season therefore although other studies considering long term average recharge e g 10 year period have claimed that satisfactory estimations can be obtained by simply applying the difference between p and et satellite products in some semiarid continental and mediterranean regions e g crosbie et al 2015 gokmen et al 2013 műnch et al 2013 szilagyi et al 2011 this study demonstrated that tropical wet sedimentary regions also require the consideration of surface runoff and soil water storage changes on a monthly and annual basis because their water cycles are stressed by weather seasonality and hydrologic soil cover complexes the annual gwr rates estimated by the wtf method varied from 110 to 370 mm yr 1 in 2016 corresponding to 10 and 24 of the mean annual p obtained by the gauge data respectively table 1 half of these estimates ranged from 100 to 200 mm yr 1 mostly obtained from the observation wells located upstream fig 9 in 2017 the gwr rates varied from 90 to 550 mm yr 1 corresponding to 7 and 29 of the mean annual p obtained by the gauge data respectively more than half of these estimates ranged from 300 to 550 mm yr 1 mostly obtained from observation wells located downstream urban area for evaluation purposes the absolute and relative estimates of the gwr obtained by the water budget equation were plotted against the wtf results fig 10 the correlations and mean errors of the absolute and relative gwr estimates based on the imerg c data varied from 0 68 to 0 83 and from 30 to 34 respectively these correlations and mean errors were fairly similar to the gwr ranges estimated using the gauge data whose correlations varied from 0 73 to 0 89 and the mean errors remained at 31 szilagyi et al 2011 compared the gwr rates estimated by a satellite based approach with chloride mass balance rates showing a spatial correlation of 0 57 at the annual scale in our study the gwr rates estimated by the water budget equation using the imerg c data tended to slightly underestimate the wtf data between 13 and 9 whereas the gauge scenario overestimated the wtf data between 8 and 11 however a good fit was found for the imerg c data by using linear regressions showing decent slope and y intersect values for the absolute 1 16 and 69 mm respectively and relative 0 82 and 0 79 respectively gwr which confirmed the low underestimations these negative biases could have been caused by neglecting the contribution of the irrigation input component in the water budget equation of this study which is practically nil in the wettest period but can be significant in some sugarcane cultivated areas i e corresponding to 30 of the study area during the four driest months usman et al 2015 also found negative bias by applying a satellite based approach to estimate gwr rates showing that the consideration of irrigation considerably improves gwr estimates in comparison with wtf estimates in this study the gwr estimates based on the imerg c data were slightly lower than those calculated based on the wtf method whose mean differences were 5 in 2016 and 30 mm yr 1 in 2017 at the absolute scale as well as 0 8 in 2016 and 1 8 in 2017 at the relative scale respectively crosbie et al 2015 also found average underestimations of 45 mm yr 1 when comparing the gwr rates calculated by a satellite based approach with the chloride mass balance and wtf estimates besides the biases possibly caused by disregarding the irrigation the uncertainties in each water balance component i e p with 8 according to comparisons with on ground gauge measurements et with 10 based upon melo et al 2021 and q with 12 as found by veeck et al 2020 used in the proposed approach might propagate to the residual term i e the gwr uncertainty in time series of gwr estimated using the wtf method is associated with the difficulty in determining a representative sy which has a dependence on the depth to water table crosbie et al 2019 for instance the uncertainty in the gwr rates estimated from a satellite based approach p et and the wtf method was analysed by lucas et al 2015 which found uncertainties ranging from 24 to 42 of the annual mean gwr actually estimating gwr is a big challenge because it cannot be measured directly crosbie et al 2019 scanlon et al 2002 therefore it is still difficult to assess the accuracy of any method crosbie et al 2019 healy and cook 2002 with no widely applicable methodology available that can directly and accurately quantify the volume of rainwater that reaches the water table macdonald et al 2021 because of this it has been recommended over the last decades to use multiple methods when estimating the gwr crosbie et al 2019 scanlon et al 2002 unfortunately in most developing countries and remote regions groundwater measured data are scarce or unavailable and rarely one or more than one method has been used to estimate gwr lucas et al 2015 for such areas satellite based approaches as proposed in this study for tropical wet regions can be scientifically much more robust than considering for instance the estimations of gwr as a fixed percentage of rainfall as often adopted by water managers in some tropical developing areas fig 11 shows the comparisons between the temporal variations of groundwater level fluctuations at 9 monitoring wells and the monthly satellite based gwr estimates the satellite based gwr estimates presented similar peak variation patterns to those observed in the groundwater levels this agreement between the peak variation patterns from the gwr and groundwater levels were observed to either shallower e g w04 w9 and w13 and deeper e g w15 and w16 monitoring wells although presenting similar peak variation patterns it is possible to notice a monthly delay in the groundwater level fluctuations compared to the gwr amounts likely due to unsaturated zone transit which is not considered in the method as it was already pointed out by coelho et al 2017 in a semiarid region 4 summary and conclusions this study developed and evaluated an innovative satellite based approach based on the water budget equation to estimate the natural gwr over by only using freely available satellite based data the proposed distinctive features include the capacity to address 1 et estimations mod16 algorithm in tropical wet regions frequently overlaid by substantial cloud cover and 2 water storage change estimation in the root zone spl4smau product in sedimentary regions seasonably prone to monthly variations the proposed method which also included p imerg product and runoff nrcs cn method information was assessed for two hydrologically contrasting years the spatially distributed gwr rates were compared with the measurements of groundwater levels and recharge estimates based on the wtf method applied to the monitoring wells over the study area overall the results of the proposed satellite based water budget approach performed consistently with the groundwater ground based estimates the monitoring wells used to evaluate the groundwater recharge rates covered different soil types lulc and depths from shallow to deep these features suggest that the proposed methodology may be reliable in characterising the spatial heterogeneity of the studied area concerning et the use of a cloud cleaning procedure based on monthly map compositions of biophysical data i e lai evi2 and alb combined with a more fine tuned lulc regional product and a set of gldas meteorological forcing data suggested the production of a reasonable proxy for et despite cloudy conditions the use of soil water storage changes calculated from the spl4smau root zone soil moisture product was shown to provide essential spatially distributed information to be included in the satellite based approach as the gwr estimates would vary considerably over jpa by disregarding this component at the monthly scale therefore the satellite based approach consistently demonstrated that the consideration of soil water storage changes and the cloud cleaning procedure used to obtain et are essential for a proper estimation of the spatially distributed gwr rates in tropical wet sedimentary regions because of their hydrologic soil cover complexes weather seasonality and cloudy conditions however some sources of uncertainty in the satellite based approach still require a better assessment which includes 1 a more detailed comparison of each component of the water balance e g runoff et and soil moisture with ground based measurements to identify the errors accumulated in the residual term i e gwr and 2 the impact of interception irrigation and pumping demands in the gwr estimates also a better representation of sy across the region together with an analysis of errors associated with its estimates which contribute to the overall uncertainty of the wtf method need to be accounted for in further studies credit authorship contribution statement luís romero barbosa conceptualization data curation

3606,groundwater recharge gwr is one of the most challenging water fluxes to estimate as it relies on observed data that are often limited in many developing countries this study developed an innovative water budget method using satellite products for estimating the spatially distributed gwr at monthly and annual scales in tropical wet sedimentary regions despite cloudy conditions the distinctive features proposed in this study include the capacity to address 1 evapotranspiration estimations in tropical wet regions frequently overlaid by substantial cloud cover and 2 seasonal root zone water storage estimations in sedimentary regions prone to monthly variations the method also utilises satellite based information of the precipitation and surface runoff the gwr was estimated and validated for the hydrologically contrasting years 2016 and 2017 over a tropical wet sedimentary region located in north eastern brazil which has substantial potential for groundwater abstraction this study showed that applying a cloud cleaning procedure based on monthly compositions of biophysical data enables the production of a reasonable proxy for evapotranspiration able to estimate groundwater by the water budget method the resulting gwr rates were 219 2016 and 302 2017 mm yr 1 showing good correlations cc 0 68 to 0 83 and slight underestimations pbias 13 to 9 when compared with the referenced estimates obtained by the water table fluctuation method for 23 monitoring wells sensitivity analysis shows that water storage changes account for 19 to 22 of our monthly evaluation the satellite based approach consistently demonstrated that the consideration of cloud cleaned evapotranspiration and root zone soil water storage changes are essential for a proper estimation of spatially distributed gwr in tropical wet sedimentary regions because of their weather seasonality and cloudy conditions keywords remote sensing water balance groundwater recharge water table fluctuation tropical climate sedimentary aquifer 1 introduction understanding the factors constraining groundwater recharge gwr is important for management and planning purposes of this water resource that is only slowly renewed cuthbert et al 2019 in some regions for instance the abstracted groundwater over the past decades are taken from non renewable groundwater döll et al 2014 which increases even more the need for a better understanding of such factors these abstractions need to be regionally regulated aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 since groundwater serves as the key strategic reserve for supplying water to societies during long lasting droughts famiglietti 2014 such regulation in turn requires accurate information about the spatiotemporal distribution of natural gwr rates jasechko et al 2014 including their variability and uncertainty in estimations which are strongly sensitive to climate forcing factors land uses and covers watershed geomorphology and local hydrogeology moeck et al 2020 since gwr is a key component used in many hydrological models to assess groundwater resource worldwide graaf et al 2017 wada et al 2010 its accurate estimation constitutes a priority for stakeholders and a research challenge for the scientific community jasechko et al 2014 mohan et al 2018 many methods have been developed to estimate natural gwr at various spatiotemporal scales with a wide range of complexity walker et al 2019 given that gwr cannot be directly measured melo et al 2015 making use of these methods often depends on data availability desired spatiotemporal resolution and result representations walker et al 2019 the following five methods are commonly used to estimate gwr 1 tracer techniques which estimate aquifer renewal via substances in the water or specific concentrations of chemical elements such as the chloride mass balance method e g brunner et al 2004 hornero et al 2016 2 groundwater level monitoring in unconfined aquifers which include examples such as water table fluctuation method e g cai and ofterdinger 2016 wendland et al 2007 and cumulative rainfall departure methods e g ahmadi et al 2015 weber and stewart 2004 3 darcy s law application which allows calculating the velocity of soil water percolation and requires knowledge of hydraulic gradient and vertical hydraulic conductivity e g callahan et al 2012 yin et al 2011 4 numerical modelling which consists of a mathematical representation of the gwr process e g melo et al 2015 melo and wendland 2017 and 5 the water balance method which considers the main variables of the hydrological cycle as inputs and outputs of the system e g hornero et al 2016 wendland et al 2007 most of the aforementioned methods are based on point scale observations e g meteorological stations or boreholes which may cause serious issues when spatial variability in the regions of concern is great e g melo and wendland 2017 although such a problem can be simply ignored for regions with extremely dense observation networks it remains persistent in most regions worldwide especially in developing countries for instance in brazil the national ground based monitoring network consists of about 400 wells distributed over the country complemented by a small number of observation wells monitored in only 21 active experimental basins melo et al 2020 therefore the chief challenge for many hydrologists is to find and utilise alternative sources of data to estimate the spatial information of gwr brunner et al 2007 the use of cutting edge satellite derived remote sensing technology has played a crucial role in assimilating valuable distributed observation and in modelling water resources which would otherwise be impossible with relatively sparse ground based measurements alone famiglietti et al 2015 however the remote sensing contributions are rather inconsistent at quantifying and estimating gwr because all current data from satellite data can only detect patterns and processes related to water resources on and above the surface brunner et al 2007 coelho et al 2017 lucas et al 2015 satellite based observations of time variable gravity such as the joint mission of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace are sensitive to variations of terrestrial water storage including the groundwater storage changes tapley et al 2004 vasco et al 2019 wahr et al 2004 unfortunately the low spatial resolution of grace derived data limits its ability to provide localised groundwater information at an appropriate scale alley and konikow 2015 lakshmi et al 2018 thus an innovative use of satellite data to estimate gwr at local and regional scales has been recently proposed where most of data are applied to a simplified water budget approach that uses precipitation and evapotranspiration products e g crosbie et al 2015 gokmen et al 2013 lucas et al 2015 műnch et al 2013 szilágyi et al 2012 szilagyi et al 2011 this approach disregards other water balance components such as surface runoff and soil water storage changes which could considerably alter the estimation accuracy of gwr in some regions for short time scales e g monthly in this context some studies also have considered uniform surface runoff khalaf and donoghue 2012 as well as spatially distributed information about surface runoff coelho et al 2017 and irrigation usman et al 2015 the aforementioned studies used different remote sensing products and algorithms but all of them were developed in regions with arid semiarid continental or mediterranean climate conditions where the cloud cover is limited coelho et al 2017 for some tropical regions such as brazil the estimation of gwr using this approach remains challenging mainly because of the difficulties in obtaining continuous information of actual evapotranspiration data by remote sensing without substantial cloud cover in parallel soil moisture information from satellite observations is currently available at the global scale and can provide valuable data to update the water budget approach with information regarding water storage changes in unsaturated soil layers reichle et al 2018 accounting for this component is particularly important for understanding gwr in sedimentary aquifers where the unsaturated vadose zone width may vary from thin to thick soil layers rossetti et al 2012 unfortunately some satellite based datasets are only recently available but some applications require earlier data based on this information this study develops an innovative water budget method using satellite based data for estimating natural spatially distributed gwr rates at annual and monthly scales in tropical wet sedimentary regions taking into account cloudy conditions accordingly this study hypothesizes that such an approach enables local and regional scale perspectives in ungauged tropical wet regions the general and transferable strategy would be relevant to account for 1 the substantial cloud cover and 2 the water storage changes in sedimentary regions prone to monthly variations the method also utilises spatially distributed information on precipitation and surface runoff estimated from satellite products the major limitation of this residual approach is that the accuracy of the gwr depends on the accuracy of the other components considered in the water balance scanlon et al 2002 i e its application is appropriated when the errors of these components are small relative to the water flux this limitation when a satellite based approach is considered is mainly identified in regions that present ground truth measurements discrepant with the estimated products used in the water balance especially the main input precipitation and output evapotranspiration of the system on the other hand ground based evaluations are punctual and representative of small areas hardly integrating the spatial heterogeneity of meteorological processes especially in urban areas maier et al 2020 this study used ground truth measurements to assess the two main estimated components of the water balance i e precipitation and evapotranspiration and the gwr rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out over an area of 1032 km2 in joão pessoa jpa paraíba ne brazil which includes the metropolitan region and surrounding rural areas fig 1 it consists in 1 the gramame river basin 589 1 km2 57 1 of the area and 2 the right bank of the baixo paraíba river basin 442 9 km2 42 9 of the area the main source of water of the jpa metropolitan region 1 million inhabitants is the gramame mamuaba reservoir with maximum volume capacity of 56 9 hm3 the water supply is complemented by more than 756 wells cprm geological service of brazil 2020 pumped mostly for the public industry and irrigation which are essential during periods of surface water shortage the jpa has a tropical wet climate with a dry summer i e as according to the köppen climate classification with a mean temperature of 26 c and well distinguished rainy and dry seasons alvares et al 2013 the average annual precipitation is 1700 mm of which 70 occurs from march to august during the austral autumn and winter the potential evapotranspiration is relatively high in jpa with mean annual values greater than 1500 mm the predominant land use and land cover lulc types in jpa are cropland 30 7 atlantic forest 28 4 pasture 26 3 and urban areas 9 5 the forest areas are atlantic remnants and the cropland areas contain mainly sugarcane and pineapple crops moreover the main soil types in jpa are acrisols 58 7 fluvisols 12 0 podzols 10 8 lixisols 9 1 and histosols 5 5 the fluvisols and histosols surround the rivers and the jpa urban area the hydrogeological framework mainly consists in 1 a coastal multi layered sedimentary aquifer system near the littoral i e the paraíba basin and 2 a regional substratum that outcrops upstream in the more continental area i e the borborema province this latter corresponds to the crystalline regional basement that was affected by rifting processes due to the cretaceos atlantic aperture this resulted in a graben that was progressively and sequentially filled by sediments as follows 1 up to 360 m thick fluvial sandstones of the beberibe formation from the coniacian santonian age 2 a 70 m thick fossiliferous calciferous sandstones and muddy siltstones of the itamaracá formation formed in marine transitional settings during the santonian campanian age 3 a 50 m thick phosphatic rocks and calciferous shales of the marine gramame formation from the campanian maastrichtian age and 4 a nearly 70 m thick succession of fluvial sandstones and mudstones of the barreiras formation from the early middle miocene ages rossetti et al 2012 rossetti et al 2011 2 2 satellite based water budget approach the actual gwr rates defined as the rate at which water arrives at the table of an aquifer mathias et al 2017 were spatially estimated from the residual terms of the water budget equation using satellite based information this estimation was performed for two hydrologically contrasting years 2016 and 2017 in which ground based information was measured to evaluate the results the gwr rates were then calculated at the monthly and annual scales by eq 1 1 g w r p e t δ s q i f p e t δ s q 0 0 i f p e t δ s q 0 where gwr is the groundwater recharge p is the precipitation et is the actual evapotranspiration δs is the water storage change at a root zone scale 100 cm depth and q is the surface runoff other input and output water balance components were not investigated in this study because 1 they frequently represent relatively small contributions to the root zone e g water pumping or are implicitly considered in the aforementioned components e g irrigation and interception and 2 there are no reliable in situ data available for the jpa moreover horizontal groundwater flow was also neglected because it refers to a slower gwr mechanism rather than the direct contribution of vertical infiltration e g coelho et al 2017 crosbie et al 2015 műnch et al 2013 since 70 of the study area has terrain slope ranging from 0 to 92 m km 1 which means that the topography predominantly presents weak slopes all the used remote sensing products and other input data are summarised in fig 2 and described thoroughly in the next sub items of this sub section 2 2 1 precipitation p was estimated by the global precipitation measurement gpm mission which is an international network of satellites undertaken by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa of the usa and the japanese aerospace agency jaxa huffman et al 2018 this mission provides rainfall and snowfall information globally via the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg products at 0 1 10 km and 30 min resolutions huffman et al 2018 imerg is an algorithm that combines microwave and infrared estimates from the gpm constellation this study used version v05b of the imerg final run product the imerg final run product also incorporates monthly gauge observations from the global precipitation climatology gpcc and other ancillary data to improve the satellite estimations skofronick jackson et al 2017 this product is ready for use after 3 5 months of the data acquisition skofronick jackson et al 2018 the advantage of imerg is the high spatial resolution when compared to other satellite based products on the other hand the weakness of this product is its latency 3 5 months which is inappropriate for real time applications imerg p is a valuable source of information for global and regional applications mainly because of its high spatiotemporal resolution however for medium and small scale hydrological studies the spatial resolution of 0 1 of the imerg product is still coarse sharifi et al 2019 due to the dimension of the study area the imerg data was downscaled to a resolution of 0 0045 500 m similarly to lu et al 2019 the bilinear interpolation method was used to downscale the imerg product as it can provide consistent data disaggregation moghim et al 2016 the 30 min imerg data were accumulated aggregated to daily monthly and annual p scales the accuracy of remote sensing p products can be hampered by various factors such as calculation algorithms and satellite sensor characteristics semire et al 2012 the assessment carried out by gadelha et al 2019 found that in comparison with the ground based rainfall data the imerg v05b effectively captures the p spatial patterns over most of the brazilian territory except for the entire coastal zone of ne brazil where underestimates occurs for this reason a linear scaling bias correction procedure was applied lenderink et al 2007 using a single correction factor per month calculated by the ratio between the monthly averages of rain gauges and the imerg data le et al 2018 rather than a grid box correction i e pixel per pixel to preserve the original spatial distribution of the imerg data p data measured from 16 rain gauges that are subjected to quality control were used for the imerg bias correction and comparison purposes fig 1c the gridded observed rainfall data were estimated by inverse distance weighting interpolation for comparison purposes quantile quantile plots between the bias corrected imerg interpolated data henceforth imerg c and ground based interpolated data were built at the monthly and annual scales for every 10 percentiles i e 0 10 90 100 over these estimates the linear regressions were plotted and their slope and y intersect values were calculated moreover the rain gauges interpolated data were used as input to spatially estimate the runoff and the gwr from the water budget equation the estimates were then compared with the estimated components obtained from the satellite based approach 2 2 2 actual evapotranspiration the et was estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 which was also adopted by mu et al 2007 to create the first global et product mod16 the mod16 is a product from nasa based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensors installed on two satellites terra and aqua as well as reanalysis derived meteorological inputs currently the mod16 dataset provides et at the global scale with a spatial resolution of 500 m and three different timescales 8 d monthly and annual scales unlike the algorithm used by mu et al 2011 to generate the current mod16 product this study calculated the et based on the algorithm developed by mu et al 2007 using the biome property look up table shown by running et al 2017 the algorithm proposed by mu et al 2007 was based on eq 2 and assumes that night time et is small and in turn negligible 2 λ e λ e transp λ e soil δ a ρ c p e s e a r a δ γ 1 r s r a where λ is the latent heat of evaporation 2 45 mj kg 1 λe is the latent heat flux density w m 2 consisting of the plant transpiration λetransp and

the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the mod16 algorithm is only suitable to use under clear sky conditions as modis satellite sensors cannot measure cloud base parameters sur et al 2015 this occurs because the mod16 generates the et based on some 8 day modis products i e pixels of the best observations from the last eight days with 500 m spatial resolutions e g mod15a2h and mcd43a2 a3 these 8 d products remain insufficient to attenuate cloudy condition effects on et estimations in some regions running et al 2017 the available mod09q1 terra and myd09q1 aqua reflectance products were used in this study due to their suitable 250 m and 8 d resolutions to obtain the biophysical data namely 1 the leaf area index lai using the soil adjusted vegetation index savi bastiaanssen et al 1998 huete 1988 2 the vegetation cover fraction calculated by the enhanced vegetation index evi2 proposed by jiang et al 2008 and 3 the surface albedo alb computed by the equation proposed by teixeira et al 2013 to address the shortcomings related to cloudy conditions this study carried out monthly map compositions with 8 d grid biophysical inputs i e evi2 lai and alb the monthly compositions were based on the selection of pixels with higher values of lai and evi2 obtained from the eight images available per month i e four mod09q1 and four myd09q1 assuming that lower or negative values of these two biophysical parameters were possibly contaminated by clouds conversely for the monthly compositions of alb only the lower values per pixel from the eight images available per month were considered assuming that higher values of albedo were possibly contaminated by clouds these new data then assumed clear sky conditions to indicate fixed input parameters throughout a month and were used to generate daily et data the mod16 product also uses global lulc classification from modis land cover type mcd12q1 as an input to obtain information about canopy conductance and plant transpiration however the global representation of the mcd12q1 which is associated with the limited number of classes 17 can misidentify some local and regional specificities of the vegetation and introduce considerable errors in the estimation of et for medium and small areas ruhoff et al 2013 therefore we used a regional lulc classification seeg oc 2015 namely the mapbiomas project http mapbiomas org mapbiomas provides landsat based annual lulc maps associated with 27 classes at a 30 m spatial resolution processed from 1985 in this study mapbiomas lulc collection 3 1 was reclassified into six general classes barren land forest cropland pasture urban and water body before being used to generate et data the mod16 product uses the global meteorological reanalysis data provided by nasa s global modelling and assimilation office gmao at a 0 5 0 6 or 1 0 1 25 spatial resolution as inputs of the original algorithm mu et al 2011 2007 running et al 2017 gmao incorporates ground and satellite based observations to provide information with a 6 h temporal resolution unlike the mod16 product this study used the gldas noah l4 v2 1 meteorological product provided by the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 it allowed providing the following meteorological data with 3 h and 0 25 resolutions downward shortwave radiation air pressure air temperature and specific humidity the meteorological data were retrieved from four pixels covering most of jpa and were averaged and used as inputs for the et estimation the daily mean estimated et was tested against the penman monteith equation which is considered the universal standard approach for calculating daily reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 such a comparison does not validate the estimates but only assess if both evapotranspiration time series oscillate and peak with similar amplitudes and magnitudes respectively the meteorological data used to calculate the et0 were acquired from a meteorological station inside jpa which belongs to the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet acronym in portuguese fig 1c additionally the mean 8 day et data from the original mod16a2 product was also used to check the daily estimates using the cloud cleaning procedure combined with a more fine tuned dataset 2 2 3 soil water storage changes the soil water storage changes were calculated using root zone moisture information of the soil moisture active passive smap mission from nasa estimated each 2 to 3 days since 2015 reichle et al 2018 the smap level 4 l4 provides global near surface 0 5 cm and root zone 0 100 cm soil moisture with the smap l4 surface and root zone soil moisture analysis update spl4smau product reichle et al 2017 the 100 cm root zone spl4smau soil moisture product 3 h temporal and 9 km spatial resolution whose data result from the assimilation of l band brightness temperature data into the nasa catchment land surface model was used to obtain the soil water storage by the soil moisture difference from one day to another multiplied by the root zone depth of 1000 mm reichle et al 2018 based on the smap orbit revisit time the soil moisture data were scheduled to be retrieved at 6 00 a m and 6 00 p m at the legal local time however since the satellite takes 2 to 3 days to map the whole globe some images over jpa were missing for a range of days of the year thus similar to the study carried out by souza et al 2018 the soil moisture data were calculated in three ways 1 if both orbits were completed on the same day then both values were averaged 2 if only one orbit had a valid value then this value was considered for that day and 3 if no valid value was obtained in any orbit then the soil moisture calculated for the previous day was repeated finally the soil water storage changes were calculated by summing positive or negative daily differences in the spl4smau root zone data at the monthly and annual scales which was performed after interpolating their images from a 9 km to a 500 m resolution through bilinear interpolation same as that for p 2 2 4 surface runoff the surface runoff was estimated using the natural resources conservation service curve number nrcs cn method hawkins et al 1985 the nrcs cn method combines climatic and physiographic characteristics in empirical formulas that convert basic descriptive data into numeric values to estimate the excess p that was not intercepted stored or infiltrated deshmukh et al 2013 we implemented this estimation spatially with daily p the daily runoff estimates were then summed pixel by pixel at monthly and annual scales thus avoiding the overestimation errors that stem from its direct calculation at monthly and annual scales awadallah et al 2017 we choose the nrcs cn method because of its simplicity ease of use and widespread acceptance ponce and hawkins 1996 verma et al 2017 focusing on scarce data regions in developing countries but taking advantage of freely available remote sensing data the nrcs cn method is based on a water budget equation that assumes that p must exceed the initial abstraction ia being a soil dependent fraction λ of the maximum water storage capacity s before any direct runoff q is triggered a fixed value of λ equals to 0 20 is recommended by the original method and widely adopted in the united states hawkins et al 1985 however the initial losses depend on the local and regional characteristics of the watershed many studies including some carried out in brazilian catchments indicated that the value proposed by the original method is too high for many parts of the world and recommended λ values of about 0 05 or less e g ajmal and kim 2015 durán barroso et al 2017 shi et al 2009 valle junior et al 2019 veeck et al 2020 recently the studies by lal et al 2019 lal et al 2017 reviewed the values of λ for 63 watersheds worldwide with various lulc finding 0 03 as a representative value which was also used in our study in this context the new runoff and water storage capacity calculations under average wet conditions sii λ 0 03 are shown in eqs 3 and 4 3 q p 0 03 s i i λ 0 03 2 p 0 97 s i i λ 0 03 i f p

spatially assigned to different hydrologic soil cover complexes using a look up table built in a gis platform the hydrologic soil cover complexes refer to the different combinations of lulc and hydrological soil groups hsgs contained in a study area the hsg information was created from the regional information about soil types provided by araújo filho et al 2000 the hsg was assigned according to the soil type following the methodology proposed by sartori et al 2005 that consists of 19 criteria based on a survey of 58 soil profiles and hydrodynamic data in brazil the lulc information was obtained from mapbiomas collection 3 1 the same used for estimating et the potential runoff before a surface runoff event generated by the nrcs cn method depends on the antecedent moisture condition amc hawkins et al 1985 the proper condition was identified through the 5 d antecedent cumulative p p5d mm which was calculated for each p grid cell for this purpose three intervals of p5d were used distinguishing between the growing season gs from march to july and the dormant season ds from august to february according to the amc similar to those in lal et al 2017 the p5d intervals in this study were defined as amc i dry conditions if p5d 35 56 mm gs or p5d 12 7 mm ds amc ii average conditions if 35 56 p5d 53 34 mm gs or 12 70 p5d 27 94 mm ds and amc iii wet conditions if p5d 53 34 mm gs or p5d 27 94 mm ds moreover the p5d intervals of ds were considered for the urban and barren areas whereas the p5d intervals of gs were considered for the forest areas throughout all months of the year because of their active vegetation growing conditions finally the cni and cniii values were determined under amc i and amc iii respectively based on lal et al 2019 2 3 evaluation of groundwater recharge estimates the gwr rates were evaluated by the water table fluctuation wtf method healy and cook 2002 scanlon et al 2002 the ground based gwr rates obtained from wtf eq 5 were used to evaluate the spatially distributed gwr rates estimated by the water budget equation on a 1 km footprint around the wells to comprehensively consider the surrounding characteristics their absolute gwr mm and relative gwr p estimates were compared through linear regressions 5 r w t f s y δ h δ t where rwtf denotes the estimated recharge rate mm time step using wtf sy represents the aquifer specific yield coefficient δh is the cumulated rising piezometric level changes mm and δt is the time from the beginning of the rise to the peak δh corresponds to the sum of the actual groundwater rise and the potential groundwater decline for the same period with the latter being obtained by extrapolating the antecedent recession curve healy and cook 2002 wendland et al 2007 the groundwater fluctuation data were manually collected every 45 days from 16 in 2016 and 23 monitoring wells in 2017 located in the barreiras formation fig 1c seven additional wells were drilled in 2017 in the urban area these monitoring wells are well distributed throughout the study area and therefore capable to characterise the local groundwater since they cover several soil types depths from shallow to deep and lulc from the coastline to the headwater this monitoring network was carefully selected so as to have no groundwater pumping in or nearby the monitoring wells the temporal variations of groundwater fluctuations were also used to compare the overall behaviour of the monthly satellite based gwr estimates the values of sy equal to 0 10 16 wells and 0 24 7 wells were estimated by pumping tests in four wells and assigned to the others based on their similar local characteristics including the groundwater level patterns 2 4 statistical metrics three statistical metrics were selected to evaluate the goodness of fit of the results the first metric was the correlation coefficient cc eq 6 which describes the relationship between variations in simulated and observed values the other two metrics were the percent bias pbias eq 7 and the relative root mean square error rrmse eq 8 both with perfect values equal to 0 which were used to describe the bias and error between simulated and observed values respectively 6 c c i 1 n g i g s i s i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 7 p b i a s i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i 100 8 r r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 g 100 where si and gi are the satellite and ground based data respectively and s and g are the mean values of the satellite and ground based data respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation the first set of analyses assessed the spatiotemporal distributions of the main input of the water balance i e p obtained from imerg c data and compared these with the ground based interpolated data henceforth gauge fig 3 annual p based on imerg c data gradually decreased from east to west varying from 1120 to 1600 mm in 2016 and 1050 to 2300 mm in 2017 the maximum p based on gauge observations was 1630 mm in 2016 and 2070 mm in 2017 similarly lu et al 2019 showed consistent spatial patterns and maximum values of imerg p after performing bias correction using monitoring data p obtained in jpa from the imerg c data occurred mostly within the regular rainy season i e from march to july corresponding to 71 in 2016 and 77 in 2017 of the annual totals the monthly variations in p in 2016 from the imerg c and gauge data were similar fig 3e f whereas the imerg c variation was larger than the gauge variation in some months of 2017 particularly in june and july when the 10 90 percentile ranges were 60 higher and double respectively despite such differences the average values obtained by imerg c were similar to those from the gauge in most of the months showing that imerg c was able to detect the temporal variation of p the deviations between the imerg c and ground based interpolated p were also assessed using quantile quantile plots fig 4 at the monthly scale a suitable correlation cc 0 97 and a reasonable fit using linear regressions slope 1 01 y intersect 1 68 were found with some deviations in march june and july good correlations between the imerg products and the observed dataset have been found by other studies in tropical regions at the monthly scale e g satgé et al 2017 tan and duan 2017 the monthly mean error was 23 higher than the annual mean error i e 8 these values remained within the acceptable ranges for satellite based monthly p salles et al 2019 acceptable metrics were also found at the annual scale despite the slight deviation of the linear regression slope 1 20 y intersect 314 mm such a deviation probably occurred due to the larger variation of the ground based p on the western side of the study area in 2017 which likely stemmed from the limited number of rain gauges used on the interpolation see fig 1 according to tang et al 2016 the underestimation of this satellite based p data can occur over regions with wet climates and low latitudes the results found in this analysis confirm that the imerg c data enabled the mapping of the decreasing p gradient in the study area 3 2 actual evapotranspiration the spatial et distribution estimated by the modified mod16 algorithm applying cloud cleaning is shown in fig 5 overall the mean annual et varied from 1 170 in 2016 to 1 220 mm in 2017 the results were consistently distinguishable amongst the lulc types with values smaller than 850 mm in the urban areas and above 1450 mm in the forest areas at the monthly scale the ranges of the average estimates were similar between the studied years varying from 73 to 119 mm in 2016 and 85 to 114 mm in 2017 however comparing the monthly mean estimates of 2017 with those of 2016 they were smaller at the beginning closer at the middle and higher at the end of the year in the rainy season smaller differences between high and low et data were observed showing monthly averages in the 10 90 percentile ranges equal to 63 in 2016 and 58 mm in 2017 from april to august on the other hand larger differences between high and low et data occurred in the dry season as shown by the monthly averages in the 10 90 percentile ranges equal to 84 in 2016 and 87 mm in 2017 from september to march lima and ribeiro 2018 showed that such seasonable patterns can stem from the associations between meteorological and evapotranspiration estimates by using the mapbiomas lulc and gldas meteorological forcing data to calculate spatially distributed et thus variations in the et throughout the studied years in jpa were likely influenced by the combination of lulc diversity weather seasonality and cloudy conditions the mean daily et obtained by the modified mod16 algorithm ranged from 1 0 to 4 7 mm d 1 during the whole study period whereas the mean et0 varied from 3 0 to 7 0 mm d 1 fig 6 the et0 was as much as three times higher than the et estimated by the proposed approach between august and february dry season due to the lower soil water availability in these months this difference is plausible since et0 refers to the evapotranspiration of well watered grass vegetation with active growth throughout the year such a difference considerably shrunk during the rainy seasons with the actual and reference evapotranspiration following the same temporal behaviour as expected the daily et estimates obtained by the proposed methodology were greater than those acquired by the mean 8 day mod16a2 product for the studied period which ranged from 1 9 to 3 9 mm d 1 fig 6 consequently the mean annual et estimated by the mod16a2 was lower than those obtained by the modified mod16 algorithm for 2016 895 mm and 2017 938 mm the values of et estimated by the mod16a2 product was also lower than those found by other studies using the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal in river basins with similar characteristics in ne brazil e g oliveira et al 2014 although slightly higher the et estimates presented the same temporal patterns observed by the original mod16a2 product the differences found between the original and the modified approaches can possibly be attributed to the following factors 1 the missing data in some pixels of the mod16a2 product because of the presence of cloud cover 2 the use of a more fine tuned lulc regional product and 3 the use of a higher resolution input meteorological data for instance ruhoff et al 2013 identified that the misclassification of the lulc data used in the mod16a2 product combined with the low spatial resolution of the gmao reanalysis meteorological information and the cloud cover contaminated pixels were the largest contributors to over or under estimate the eddy covariance measurements in a humid tropical river basin located in south eastern brazil recently a study carried by melo et al 2021 used 25 flux towers to evaluate four remote sensing based et algorithms in many ecoregions over south america including the mod16 model forced by ground based meteorological data an average uncertainty of 10 was found for the mod16 algorithm when considering all studied ecoregions with relatively higher performance observed for wet climate regions this overall uncertainty observed by melo et al 2021 for the mod16 algorithm was similar to those found by ruhoff et al 2013 in two sites in brazil after the mod16 algorithm parameter fitting based on land use and land cover i e without the use of the mod12q1 product 3 3 soil water storage changes the annual water storage changes in the root zone throughout jpa varied from 27 to 6 mm during 2016 and from 40 to 12 mm during 2017 fig 7 annual water storage decreases suggest that the root zone released water during the studied period which is in part due to vertical percolation to aquifers despite its original coarse resolution spl4smau consistently showed a water storage increase in the root zone mostly during the rainy season likely because there is more water in the top layer after p the water increase in the root zone in december 2016 likely stemmed from substantial p fig 3e when the south atlantic convergence zone was positioned further eastward palharini and vila 2017 moreover as expected the urban areas featured large water decreases in the root zone in both years likely because of the lower infiltration caused by soil imperviousness whereas the rural areas featured a larger spatial variation in water decreases these results show that an above average rainy condition is required for an annual water increase in the root zone implying a susceptibility in jpa to water shortage 3 4 surface runoff the mean annual surface runoff estimated from the imerg c data varied from 220 in 2016 to 300 in 2017 mm fig 8 due to soil imperviousness urban areas produced annual runoff estimates greater than 450 mm in 2017 higher values of surface runoff from imerg c data also occurred outside the urban area in relation to that from gauge because of the high p in june and july in the regular rainy season i e from march to july the mean annual surface runoff estimated with imerg c data accounted for 200 mm in 2016 and 265 mm in 2017 the sources of uncertainties surrounding the nrcs cn method were analysed by durán barroso et al 2017 which include 1 a significant weakness to select representative events for simulation with the nrcs cn parameters and 2 the impossibility of determining an optimum value for λ but lower values are recommended instead of the original value for instance the study carried out by veeck et al 2020 in a brazilian catchment found fitted initial losses lower than the original value for almost all simulated events with relative errors below 12 however quantifying uncertainties of rainfall runoff is a very complex issue in brazil due to the lack of data 3 5 groundwater recharge on average the gwr rates ranged from 219 in 2016 to 302 mm yr 1 in 2017 fig 9 these results remained within the range of the gwr rates of several tropical wet regions throughout the world e g malakar et al 2019 rodríguez huerta et al 2020 vu and merkel 2019 the urban area featured greater gwr rates than other areas despite its greater surface runoff likely due to the combination of lower et and sandy soils minnig et al 2018 o driscoll et al 2010 as well as to the higher p estimates for the coastline than for the headwaters consistently moeck et al 2020 also showed that in the eastern part of brazil high gwr rates can occur despite the annual potential evapotranspiration being greater than 1500 mm because of the large amount and seasonality of p at the monthly scale gwr rates using imerg c and gauge data averaged 34 7 and 36 5 mm month 1 in 2016 and 47 7 and 51 4 mm month 1 in 2017 respectively these monthly estimates using imerg c data were similar to the gauge estimates although the difference doubled in 2017 due to higher surface runoff estimated in june and july using imerg c data the differing gwr rates obtained for the gauge data were likely influenced by the sensitivity of modelled groundwater recharge estimates to the rain gauge network scale wiebe and rudolph 2020 the differences caused by disregarding the soil water storage changes were negligible at the annual scale reducing the mean relative gwr by less than 1 for the studied years which likely occurred due to the compensation of the water increases and decreases in the root zone throughout the rainy and dry seasons conversely at the monthly scale neglecting the soil water storage changes would have considerably impacted the gwr values increasing their mean relative estimates by as much as 19 in 2016 and 12 in 2017 during the rainy season and decreasing their mean relative estimates by 22 in 2016 and 13 in 2017 during the dry season therefore although other studies considering long term average recharge e g 10 year period have claimed that satisfactory estimations can be obtained by simply applying the difference between p and et satellite products in some semiarid continental and mediterranean regions e g crosbie et al 2015 gokmen et al 2013 műnch et al 2013 szilagyi et al 2011 this study demonstrated that tropical wet sedimentary regions also require the consideration of surface runoff and soil water storage changes on a monthly and annual basis because their water cycles are stressed by weather seasonality and hydrologic soil cover complexes the annual gwr rates estimated by the wtf method varied from 110 to 370 mm yr 1 in 2016 corresponding to 10 and 24 of the mean annual p obtained by the gauge data respectively table 1 half of these estimates ranged from 100 to 200 mm yr 1 mostly obtained from the observation wells located upstream fig 9 in 2017 the gwr rates varied from 90 to 550 mm yr 1 corresponding to 7 and 29 of the mean annual p obtained by the gauge data respectively more than half of these estimates ranged from 300 to 550 mm yr 1 mostly obtained from observation wells located downstream urban area for evaluation purposes the absolute and relative estimates of the gwr obtained by the water budget equation were plotted against the wtf results fig 10 the correlations and mean errors of the absolute and relative gwr estimates based on the imerg c data varied from 0 68 to 0 83 and from 30 to 34 respectively these correlations and mean errors were fairly similar to the gwr ranges estimated using the gauge data whose correlations varied from 0 73 to 0 89 and the mean errors remained at 31 szilagyi et al 2011 compared the gwr rates estimated by a satellite based approach with chloride mass balance rates showing a spatial correlation of 0 57 at the annual scale in our study the gwr rates estimated by the water budget equation using the imerg c data tended to slightly underestimate the wtf data between 13 and 9 whereas the gauge scenario overestimated the wtf data between 8 and 11 however a good fit was found for the imerg c data by using linear regressions showing decent slope and y intersect values for the absolute 1 16 and 69 mm respectively and relative 0 82 and 0 79 respectively gwr which confirmed the low underestimations these negative biases could have been caused by neglecting the contribution of the irrigation input component in the water budget equation of this study which is practically nil in the wettest period but can be significant in some sugarcane cultivated areas i e corresponding to 30 of the study area during the four driest months usman et al 2015 also found negative bias by applying a satellite based approach to estimate gwr rates showing that the consideration of irrigation considerably improves gwr estimates in comparison with wtf estimates in this study the gwr estimates based on the imerg c data were slightly lower than those calculated based on the wtf method whose mean differences were 5 in 2016 and 30 mm yr 1 in 2017 at the absolute scale as well as 0 8 in 2016 and 1 8 in 2017 at the relative scale respectively crosbie et al 2015 also found average underestimations of 45 mm yr 1 when comparing the gwr rates calculated by a satellite based approach with the chloride mass balance and wtf estimates besides the biases possibly caused by disregarding the irrigation the uncertainties in each water balance component i e p with 8 according to comparisons with on ground gauge measurements et with 10 based upon melo et al 2021 and q with 12 as found by veeck et al 2020 used in the proposed approach might propagate to the residual term i e the gwr uncertainty in time series of gwr estimated using the wtf method is associated with the difficulty in determining a representative sy which has a dependence on the depth to water table crosbie et al 2019 for instance the uncertainty in the gwr rates estimated from a satellite based approach p et and the wtf method was analysed by lucas et al 2015 which found uncertainties ranging from 24 to 42 of the annual mean gwr actually estimating gwr is a big challenge because it cannot be measured directly crosbie et al 2019 scanlon et al 2002 therefore it is still difficult to assess the accuracy of any method crosbie et al 2019 healy and cook 2002 with no widely applicable methodology available that can directly and accurately quantify the volume of rainwater that reaches the water table macdonald et al 2021 because of this it has been recommended over the last decades to use multiple methods when estimating the gwr crosbie et al 2019 scanlon et al 2002 unfortunately in most developing countries and remote regions groundwater measured data are scarce or unavailable and rarely one or more than one method has been used to estimate gwr lucas et al 2015 for such areas satellite based approaches as proposed in this study for tropical wet regions can be scientifically much more robust than considering for instance the estimations of gwr as a fixed percentage of rainfall as often adopted by water managers in some tropical developing areas fig 11 shows the comparisons between the temporal variations of groundwater level fluctuations at 9 monitoring wells and the monthly satellite based gwr estimates the satellite based gwr estimates presented similar peak variation patterns to those observed in the groundwater levels this agreement between the peak variation patterns from the gwr and groundwater levels were observed to either shallower e g w04 w9 and w13 and deeper e g w15 and w16 monitoring wells although presenting similar peak variation patterns it is possible to notice a monthly delay in the groundwater level fluctuations compared to the gwr amounts likely due to unsaturated zone transit which is not considered in the method as it was already pointed out by coelho et al 2017 in a semiarid region 4 summary and conclusions this study developed and evaluated an innovative satellite based approach based on the water budget equation to estimate the natural gwr over by only using freely available satellite based data the proposed distinctive features include the capacity to address 1 et estimations mod16 algorithm in tropical wet regions frequently overlaid by substantial cloud cover and 2 water storage change estimation in the root zone spl4smau product in sedimentary regions seasonably prone to monthly variations the proposed method which also included p imerg product and runoff nrcs cn method information was assessed for two hydrologically contrasting years the spatially distributed gwr rates were compared with the measurements of groundwater levels and recharge estimates based on the wtf method applied to the monitoring wells over the study area overall the results of the proposed satellite based water budget approach performed consistently with the groundwater ground based estimates the monitoring wells used to evaluate the groundwater recharge rates covered different soil types lulc and depths from shallow to deep these features suggest that the proposed methodology may be reliable in characterising the spatial heterogeneity of the studied area concerning et the use of a cloud cleaning procedure based on monthly map compositions of biophysical data i e lai evi2 and alb combined with a more fine tuned lulc regional product and a set of gldas meteorological forcing data suggested the production of a reasonable proxy for et despite cloudy conditions the use of soil water storage changes calculated from the spl4smau root zone soil moisture product was shown to provide essential spatially distributed information to be included in the satellite based approach as the gwr estimates would vary considerably over jpa by disregarding this component at the monthly scale therefore the satellite based approach consistently demonstrated that the consideration of soil water storage changes and the cloud cleaning procedure used to obtain et are essential for a proper estimation of the spatially distributed gwr rates in tropical wet sedimentary regions because of their hydrologic soil cover complexes weather seasonality and cloudy conditions however some sources of uncertainty in the satellite based approach still require a better assessment which includes 1 a more detailed comparison of each component of the water balance e g runoff et and soil moisture with ground based measurements to identify the errors accumulated in the residual term i e gwr and 2 the impact of interception irrigation and pumping demands in the gwr estimates also a better representation of sy across the region together with an analysis of errors associated with its estimates which contribute to the overall uncertainty of the wtf method need to be accounted for in further studies credit authorship contribution statement luís romero barbosa conceptualization data curation

3607,accurate estimation of the basin specific parameter in the budyko framework e g parameter n in the choudhury yang equation is critical to quantify precipitation partitioning into evapotranspiration e and runoff however n is difficult to estimate due to complex interactions between the water balance and various environmental factors in this study we identified the controlling factors of n using random forest during 1981 2015 for 30 basins in the loess plateau of china we then used the long short term memory lstm network combined with an 11 year moving window to develop a model to estimate time varying n this model was further incorporated into the choudhury yang equation to simulate e our results showed that correlations between parameter n and environmental factors presented obvious spatial heterogeneity three land use type factors i e the proportions of cropland shrubland and built up land area two climatic factors i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and a water use factor i e irrigation water use were identified as the controlling factors for n based on these controls the lstm model outperformed the traditional multiple linear regression model mlr model in estimating time varying n with root mean square error rmse of 0 31 0 49 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 88 0 67 for the lstm mlr model respectively moreover compared with the original choudhury yang equation using constant n calibrated by long term average water balance the improved equation using time varying n estimated by the lstm better reproduced the time series of water balance based e this study could enhance the applicability of the budyko framework and provide scientific guidance for water resources management keywords budyko framework land use change long short term memory network time varying loess plateau 1 introduction accurately estimating precipitation p partitioning into evapotranspiration e and runoff r is critical for water resources management however this is always a challenge because the p partitioning process involves complex interactions between climate vegetation soil and the hydrological cycle these interactions are influenced by anthropogenic and natural factors that change over time and space li and quiring 2021 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 at the long term scale the budyko framework provides a simple but effective approach to illustrate the p partitioning process under environmental change and is usually expressed as budyko type equations choudhury 1999 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 the budyko framework provides a simple but effective approach to illustrate the p partitioning at the basin scale which has developed from nonparametric to parametric equations budyko 1974 choudhury 1999 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 the original budyko equation postulates that e is mainly controlled by water availability indicated by p and energy availability indicated by potential evapotranspiration e 0 and so it is deterministic and nonparametric budyko 1974 however this equation was found to result in deviations between modeled and measured e because it does not consider the effects of basin characteristics on water balance except for climate conditions zhang et al 2001 to improve model performance parameters related to basin characteristics have been introduced into the original budyko equation to develop parametric equations including the fu fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 zhang zhang et al 2001 choudhury yang choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 and wang tang equations wang and tang 2014 these parametric equations consider the influence of land surface characteristics and thus better estimate e among the parametric equations two one parameter equations the choudhury yang equation with parameter n and the fu equation with parameter ω are the most widely used parameters n and ω are also termed basin specific parameters that are essentially equivalent sharing a significant linear relationship ω n 0 72 r2 0 999 yang et al 2008 in this study we focused on the choudhury yang equation with parameter n parameter n is recognized to represent the integrated effects of various environmental factors including underlying physical properties e g soil vegetation and topography climatic features e g seasonal cycle and anthropogenic factors e g land use management and irrigation on the water cycle donohue et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 ning et al 2017 yang et al 2009 yang et al 2020 as some environmental factors e g climatic factor land use type and vegetation cover change over time parameter n also changes over time and thus influences e by altering the budyko curves choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 the resulting variation of e can be estimated by the choudhury yang equation if the changes in n values are known for a specific basin for gauged basins parameter n is often calibrated by minimizing the bias between estimated e using the choudhury yang equation and water balance e i e p r however for some areas lacking continuous observations it is not feasible to obtain a priori estimates of n therefore many studies have explored the relationship between n and various environmental factors and hence developed models to estimate n bai et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2009 zhao et al 2020 yang et al 2009 built a stepwise regression model of n for the yellow river basin and the inland river basin with relative infiltration capacity vegetation coverage and average slope li et al 2013 proposed a simple linear regression model of ω only based on vegetation coverage over 26 major global river basins 300 000 km2 however they emphasized that other environmental factors should be considered for small basins 50 000 km2 jiang et al 2015 built a function between ω and the variables of climate conditions and human activities i e irrigated area for the wei river basin by using a moving window to estimate the temporal changes of ω and hence r ning et al 2017 developed an empirical formula of ω based on climate seasonality and vegetation coverage to estimate e for the loess plateau overall the relationships between n and its controlling factors depend on the environmental factors selected the area and location of the basin the study period and the analytical method as such the relationships vary over time and space therefore accurate e simulations using the budyko framework depend on the robustness of the estimation model of n when building the model of n two issues require particular consideration first it is essential to select relevant influencing factors earlier studies mainly considered the impact of underlying physical characteristics e g vegetation soil and topography on n li et al 2013 yang et al 2009 however several later studies have found that n is also related to climatic factors including prevailing climatic conditions e g p and e 0 climatic variability e g climate seasonality and even large scale climate patterns e g the arctic oscillation pacific decadal oscillation and niño 3 4 ning et al 2017 wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 most recently many studies have incorporated anthropogenic factors into budyko type equations such as land use management e g land use cover change lucc agricultural activity e g irrigated area and socioeconomic factors e g population and gross domestic product gdp jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2020 however it is a misconception that more factors in the model of n lead to improved predictive performance in reality it can cause overfitting problems conversely insufficient factors may result in underfitting problems making it challenging to capture n variations accurately hence to guarantee the effectiveness of the estimation model of n an appropriate number of representative influencing factors should be selected the second issue is to consider the time varying characteristics of n earlier studies usually treated n as a constant throughout the study period or several subperiods divided by a few change points liang et al 2015 xu et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 some factors e g topography and soil properties change slowly over time so it is reasonable to consider them constant zhang et al 2016 however many other factors e g p temperature vegetation cover and land use type change with time and thus parameter n and its corresponding budyko curve also vary over time jiang et al 2015 ning et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 it is challenging to capture temporal variations in e using equations with a constant n therefore we need to construct the model under time scales that match the study objective such as long term average annual decadal interannual or monthly scales once these issues have been addressed the estimation model of n can be incorporated into the choudhury yang equation to reproduce e over the historical period and predict its future changes the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the controlling factors of parameter n from various environmental factors and 2 to develop a model to estimate time varying n based on its controls an attempt was also made to incorporate the time varying n into the choudhury yang equation to improve the accuracy of e simulations this study was conducted over 30 typical basins in the loess plateau of china which has experienced significant human activities and climate change over recent decades this study highlights the need to consider dynamic features of the basin specific parameter in budyko type equations for assessing the effect of environmental changes on regional water balance thus contributing to water resources management 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the loess plateau lp is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin in northern china within 34 41 n and 98 114 e fig 1 it belongs to sub humid and sub arid zones and is controlled by continental monsoon climates the long term average annual precipitation is approximately 430 mm yr most of which occurs during the rainy season june to september in the form of high intensity rainstorms due to unfavorable environmental conditions e g sparse vegetation cover high intensity rainstorms and increased human activities e g urbanization overgrazing and coal mining lp suffers from severe soil erosion li et al 2016 sun et al 2001 zhang et al 2008 to address this issue the chinese government has implemented a series of ecological restoration measures over the past half century including the grain for green project ggp and the natural forest conservation project nfcp these projects have significantly improved vegetation coverage and caused large scale lucc over the lp feng et al 2016 ji et al 2021 meanwhile rapid socioeconomic development urbanization and population growth have led to increasing demand for water resources influencing the water balance through water withdrawals murray et al 2012 zhou et al 2020 2 2 data description three categories of environmental factors were considered as potential controlling factors of n 1 climatic factors including p and e 0 2 anthropogenic factors including area proportion of different land use types irrigated area and water use for irrigation and industry and 3 geographic factors including location i e latitude and longitude basin size i e drainage area and topographic factors i e elevation and slope all factors are detailed in table 1 daily meteorological data of 114 meteorological stations during 1981 2015 in and around the study area including p average air temperature maximum air temperature minimum air temperature relative moisture wind speed and sunshine duration were collected from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn accordingly the daily e 0 of all the stations was calculated by the penman monteith equation penman 1948 recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao finally all observational data were spatially interpolated by the gids method nalder and wein 1998 annual runoff data of 30 hydrological stations from 1981 to 2015 were obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission digital elevation model dem data with a spatial resolution of 90 m were obtained from the resource and environment science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn annual land use cover maps of china clud a at a spatial resolution of 1 km for 1981 2015 were obtained from xu et al 2020 this dataset is the first annual continuous land use cover product over china which was produced by integrating multi source satellite data e g advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat and using a change detection algorithm named breaks for additive seasonal and trend bfast the global land surface satellite glass leaf area index lai dataset from 1981 to 2015 was obtained from the national earth system science data center of the national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn this dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 8 days and was retrieved from avhrr and modis reflectance products using general regression neutral networks grnns annual socioeconomic data including population gdp and irrigated area were collected from the statistical yearbook for each province and autonomous region and the china statistical yearbook for regional economy annual water use data by sector and administrative region during the period of 1981 2013 was derived from zhou et al 2020 during 2000 2015 was obtained from the water resources bulletin for each province and autonomous region we compared the two datasets for the overlapping period 2000 2013 and the results showed good consistency between them then the final water use data was obtained from the combination of 1981 2013 data from zhou et al 2020 with the 2014 2015 data from the water resources bulletin finally all the socioeconomic data at the administrative scale were converted to the basin scale using the area weight average method see fig s1 this method consists of three steps 1 obtain patches by intersecting basin layer and administrative unit layer using the intersect tool of arcgis 2 calculate the area of each patch 3 calculate the area weighted average value for each basin using the equation as follows 1 x i m 1 n x i m a i m m 1 n a i m where xi is the area weighted average value of basin i xi m is the value of patch m obtained by the intersection of basin i and its surrounding administrative units n is the number of patches within basin i and ai m is the area of patch m information of all environmental factors for each basin is listed in table s1 3 methods 3 1 budyko framework the water balance for a specific basin can be simplified as e p r δs where δs is water storage change budyko budyko 1974 developed a framework that describes the relationships among e p and e 0 for large basins 10 000 km2 on a long term average annual scale the large area and long term period allow the assumption that δs can be considered negligible donohue et al 2007 this framework essentially estimates the evaporation ratio e p as a nonlinear function of the climatic aridity index e 0 p among which e 0 and p reflect the available energy and water that control e the original budyko framework can be expressed as 2 e p e 0 p tanh p e 0 1 exp e 0 p choudhury 1999 adjusted the empirical relationship between e p and e 0 p by introducing a basin specific parameter n as follows 3 e p e 0 p 1 e 0 p n 1 n where n is a parameter related to various environmental factors for a given basin yang et al 2008 for gauged basins parameter n can be calibrated using eq 3 based on long term average e p and e 0 to minimize the impacts of δs and natural climate variation on the water balance an 11 year moving window was taken to obtain multi year moving averages of hydro meteorological factors referring to previous studies in the lp jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2020 shao et al 2021 also showed that ignoring δs on a nearly 10 year scale has the least influence on water budget closure in the budyko framework for most basins of the lp then the original annual data of 1981 2015 were transformed into 11 year moving average data from 1986 to 2010 the moving average data for each year represents the 11 year average centered on it 3 2 variable selection using random forest random forest rf is a well known machine learning algorithm for variable selection especially in multivariate regression or classification issues breiman 1996 breiman 2001 gregorutti et al 2016 rf can help avoid overfitting and has been widely used in hydrological and climate change studies desai and ouarda 2021 tan et al 2021 zeng et al 2020 herein rf was used to select the optimal variable subset i e controlling factors of n from the original variables i e all the environmental factors the rf modeling was conducted using the train function in the r package caret kuhn et al 2020 the model was then validated by the fivefold cross validation approach de ath and fabricius 2000 refaeilzadeh et al 2009 where the entire dataset was divided into five subsets and each subset was dropped out in turn while the other subsets were used to train the model when the random forest model was built the relative importance of each variable was estimated and scaled to a maximum value of 100 using the varimp function in the caret package this value reflected the magnitude of each variable s contribution to the model the variable selection process was carried out based on the principle of keeping the least number of variables but with comparable or even better performance compared with retaining all variables this process was conducted using the sequential backward selection method zeng et al 2020 including five steps 1 sort variables in ascending order of their relative importance 2 remove the least important variable and build the model with the remaining variables 3 repeat step 2 until only one variable remains in the model 4 evaluate the prediction accuracy of each model based on the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse 5 select the variable subset with the least number of variables and the highest prediction accuracy more information about the variable selection method can be found in zeng et al 2020 this procedure was applied to non geographic factors that change over time i e climatic and anthropogenic factors geographic factors were treated as static variables due to their relative stability compared to time varying factors 3 3 long short term memory network the long short term memory lstm network is a special type of recurrent neural networks rnns which is capable of learning long term dependencies between inputs and outputs greff et al 2017 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 in this study lstm was used to build the estimation model of n from its controlling factors relying on the specially designed memory block and an efficient gradient based learning algorithm lstm can overcome the vanishing gradient problem in traditional rnn the problem is that the gradient signal becomes exponentially smaller for the long term sequence as it propagates through the network via the chain rule eventually making the backpropagation ineffective hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 each memory block in the lstm network consists of a cell state forget gate input gate output gate and hidden state fig 2 the cell state is served as the memory in which information can be stored the three gates which are essentially neurons with learnable weights control the information flow within the lstm cell specifically the forget gate determines which past state should be retained in the cell the input gate controls the extent to which a new input flows into the cell the output gate decides how much memory is used to produce the output kratzert et al 2018 together these gates enable lstm to learn from long sequence data e g length of over 10 more efficiently than conventional rnn the calibration and validation periods were set to the first 80 1986 2005 and the last 20 2006 2010 of the 11 year moving average time series for a given time step t x t is the input vector containing all the explanatory variables i e climatic factors anthropogenic factors and geographic factors and ht is the output hidden state that flows into the next time step t 1 the complete sequence of input matrix x x 1 xm is processed time step by time step where m is the sequence length and the output h h 1 hm is calculated correspondingly finally the output parameter n for time step t yt can be calculated based on hm more details can be found in kratzert et al 2018 3 4 statistical analysis the nonparametric mann kendall method mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to test the trends of hydro meteorological and anthropogenic factors rmse

average of the observed and simulated values respectively 4 results 4 1 spatio temporal characteristics of parameter n and environmental factors the long term average value of parameter n during 1981 2015 ranged from 1 14 to 3 98 table s1 with a low to high spatial pattern from north to south fig 3 a the highest values of n occurred in the eastern and southern parts of the study area such as the shiwang river fenchuan river and jing river basins the long term average value also showed an approximately normal distribution being 2 3 in half of the basins fig 3b by contrast the trend and degree of variation of n based on the 11 year moving averages displayed spatial heterogeneity the n values showed an increasing trend in all basins fig 3c with the highest increasing rate of 0 38 0 60 found in the northern e g the huangfu river and gushan river basins and central e g the qingjian river and yan river basins parts of the study area additionally the highest coefficients of variation cv of n values were found in the northern and central basins fig 3d indicating that the effect of environmental factors on the water balance fluctuated more in these basins than the remaining basins the basins with high cv were mainly small basins e g the huangfu river gushan river and kuye river basins while those with low cv were mainly large basins e g the wuding river jinghe river wei river and fen river basins the trends of environmental factors are shown in fig 4 for climatic factors p showed an increasing trend for most basins but a decreasing trend in some southern basins all changes were insignificant e 0 for most basins showed a significant increasing trend however the aridity index e 0 p increased in these basins because the variation magnitude of e 0 was higher than that of p land use types significantly changed owing to large scale ecological restoration and urbanization over the past two decades ji et al 2021 li et al 2016 specifically the proportion of cropland area pcrop decreased in almost all basins and was accompanied by increasing proportions of forestland pforest shrubland pshrub and built up land pbuilt up the proportion of grassland pgrass increased in some basins e g the tuwei river jialu river and wei river basins but decreased in others e g the kuye river wuding river and fen river basins fig 4e socioeconomic activities reflected by irrigated area airr and water use for irrigation wuirr displayed an intensifying trend for all the basins except those in southern and eastern areas i e the jing river wei river xinshui river and fen river basins fig 4h and i interestingly airr expanded while wuirr decreased for these basins with a large population and prosperous agricultural activities a possible reason was the improved irrigation efficiency owing to utilizing water saving irrigation techniques over southeastern gansu province central shaanxi province i e the guanzhong plain and central and southern shanxi province zhou et al 2020 water use for industry wuind significantly increased for nearly all the basins fig 4j which was partly related to increasing gdp during the latest two decades fig s2c overall no apparent spatial correlation between n and environmental factors could be observed for the whole study area because the spatial patterns of their trends were different fig 3c and fig 4 however spatial similarity could be found between the trend of parameter n and several environmental factors e g e 0 pforest especially in the northern basins i e the huangfu river gushan river and kuye river basins fig 3c and fig 4b d given complex relationships between n and environmental factors over time and space it was necessary to identify the controlling factors i e explanatory variables of n before constructing the model 4 2 selection of explanatory variables for parameter n the variable selection procedure was carried out by random forest according to the steps described in section 3 2 fig 5 a shows the variable importance denoted by var imp values between 0 and 100 of each environmental factor the most important variable was pcrop var imp 100 followed by p var imp 52 pshrub var imp 21 e 0 var imp 18 pbuilt up var imp 16 and wuirr var imp 10 fig 5b shows the performance indicators i e rmse and r2 for the rf regression model with variables removed successively according to their relative importance rmse and r2 changed slightly when the four least important variables were removed as the remaining variables continued to be removed the changes in rmse and r2 increased according to the principle of retaining the least variables but the highest prediction accuracy of the model the first four least important variables were removed ultimately six environmental factors were selected as the controlling factors of n including those related to land use i e pcrop pshrub and pbuilt up climate i e p and e 0 and socioeconomic activity i e wuirr basin specific correlations between n and environmental factors were generally consistent with the variable selection results using rf for the whole study area despite obvious spatial heterogeneity fig 6 pcrop showed significant negative correlations with n in nearly all basins with correlation coefficients of 0 433 0 988 p 0 05 indicating that pcrop was the primary controlling factor for n pshrub and pbuilt up were significantly positively correlated with n for most basins for climatic factors p and n were positively correlated in most basins the relationship between e 0 and n may be related to geographical location and showed different correlations among basins wuirr and n showed positive correlations in most northern and central basins but significant negative correlations in most southern basins overall the controlling factors of n for the whole study area were lucc climate change and water use but showed spatial variation at the basin scale 4 3 improving the choudhury yang equation with time varying parameter based on the controlling factors of n the lstm network and stepwise multiple linear regression mlr model were used to develop the estimation model of n the lstm model could not provide an explicit expression owing to its black box feature in contrast the mlr model could be expressed as follows 8 n 3 335 0 002 p 0 002 e 0 0 006 p crop 0 294 ln p shrub 1 161 p built u p 0 06 0 012 w u irr 0 091 l a t 0 091 s l where different function forms i e linear logarithm and power fig 7 were used to consider linear and nonlinear relationships between n and environmental factors overall the lstm model outperformed the mlr model for estimating n in terms of both multi year average and variation range fig 8 estimated n versus calibrated n for the mlr model showed greater dispersion than the lstm model the lstm model captured most of the variation in the n range for most basins while the mlr model had difficulty capturing the variation range of n rmse for estimating n in the validation period using the lstm and mlr models were 0 31 and 0 49 while the r2 were 0 88 and 0 67 respectively then e for all the basins was simulated using the eq 3 with parameter n estimated by lstm and mlr models the results were compared with water balance e again the lstm model outperformed the mlr model for simulating the mean and variation range of e fig 9 rmse in the validation period for the lstm and mlr models were 22 85 mm yr and 29 31 mm yr those for r2 were 0 91 and 0 86 respectively the discrepancies between simulated e and water balance e were lower than those between estimated n and calibrated n this difference may be caused by the much larger magnitude of e than that of n and thus the improvement in the e simulations was not as significant as that of n estimations moreover the sensitivity of the evaporation ratio e p to changes in n indicated that when p and e 0 were constant a 10 change in n only led to a 1 2 5 change in e for most basins of the study area fig 10 the performance of the improved choudhury yang equation eq 3 with time varying n to simulate the temporal variation of e was further evaluated two cases were compared 1 using a constant n calibrated by long term average water balance and 2 using a time varying n estimated by the lstm model fig 11 shows the comparison of simulated e from these two cases for three selected basins the kuye river basin wenjiachuan station yan river basin ansai station and wei river basin linjiacun station the kuye river and yan river basins are located in northern shaanxi with loess hilly and gully landforms and sparse vegetation cover both basins have undergone severe soil erosion and large scale soil water conservation measures before and after 1999 respectively guo et al 2016 wang et al 2013 by comparison the wei river basin is located in the southern part of the study area on the guanzhong plain which has relatively more developed socioeconomic activities and a larger population however the soil erosion issue is less severe jiang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 results indicated that the temporal variation of e simulated using time varying n reproduced the water balance e better than that using constant n r2 nse for the kuye river yan river and wei river basins improved by 0 471 0 424 0 181 0 272 and 0 154 0 224 respectively mae for the kuye river yan river and wei river basins decreased by 5 391 mm yr 6 782 mm yr and 2 879 mm yr this finding emphasized the importance of introducing a time varying parameter to partition p in the budyko framework quantitatively 5 discussion 5 1 relationship between parameter n and environmental factors for a given basin the variation of the basin specific parameter could influence the relationship between e 0 p and e p by moving the budyko curve and thus affect p partitioning into e and r such a basin specific parameter herein parameter n in the choudhury yang equation is regarded as the combined effect of environmental factors on the water balance fu 1981 yang et al 2008 many previous studies have explored the correlations between n and various environmental factors donohue et al 2012 gudmundsson et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2009 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 some environmental factors e g topographic factors and soil properties change little even over long periods whereas others constantly change over time these changes lead to spatio temporal variations of n and hence the water balance therefore accurate estimation of n is a prerequisite for the accurate simulation of p partitioning using the budyko framework it is necessary to select the appropriate number of representative environmental factors to build the model of n retaining excessive independent variables in a model would cause overfitting issues while insufficient variables may result in underfitting issues due to spatio temporal variability of environmental factors their interactions and the corresponding impacts on n vary with time and space ning et al 2019 found that vegetation coverage and climate seasonality asynchrony index were independent of each other at the annual scale but strongly correlated at the long term scale hence both should be incorporated into budyko type equations at the annual scale but not at the long term scale li et al 2013 proposed a simple linear regression model of ω based only on vegetation coverage which fitted well r2 0 63 over 26 large global basins 300 000 km2 however the controlling impact of vegetation on ω was diminished over small basins 50 000 km2 in this study correlations between n and environmental factors were complex and showed apparent spatial heterogeneity fig 6 for instance lucc mainly affected northern basins e g the huangfu river gushan river and kuye river basins while irrigation water use had a more significant impact on southern basins e g the jing river and wei river basins according to their relative importance we identified the controlling factors evaluated by rf with fivefold cross validation refaeilzadeh et al 2009 finally six environmental factors were selected to build the model of n fig 5 including three land use types i e pcrop pshrub and pbuilt up two climatic factors i e p and e 0 and a water use factor i e irrigation water use our results are consistent with previous studies that identified lucc as a critical influencing factor for many basins in the lp feng et al 2012 liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 lucc is primarily caused by large scale ecological restoration measures such as afforestation and returning steep slope cropland to forests to increase vegetation coverage and control soil erosion li et al 2016 shi et al 2019 xin et al 2008 fig 5a and fig 6 show that pcrop significantly influenced n for nearly all the basins and thus became the most important controlling factor of n however pforest was not selected as a controlling factor despite its important influence on vegetation coverage and the water cycle as reported by numerous previous studies feng et al 2016 guo et al 2016 hao et al 2019 we attributed this to the collinearity between pcrop and pforest owing to the conversion from cropland to forestland induced by ecological restoration measures such as ggp sun et al 2015 pgrass showed a decreasing trend in some basins one possible reason is the conversion of grassland to other land use types such as orchards and terraces ji et al 2021 moreover different data sources and study periods may lead to different findings among studies it should be noted that vegetation cover was not considered in this study to avoid multicollinearity among it and other factors as shown in fig s3 lai and land use factors were significantly correlated p 0 05 climatic factors also influence n the prevailing climate pattern dominates the land cover types soil properties and vegetation species among basins which results in spatial heterogeneity of basin characteristics sun et al 2015 besides extreme events and climate variability e g rainfall intensity and climate seasonality could lead to interannual variability in environmental factors and hence parameter n huang et al 2021 ning et al 2017 as the largest proportion of total water consumption irrigation water use has significantly influenced the hydrological cycle döll and siebert 2002 however irrigation water use showed a decreasing trend in some southern and eastern basins e g the jing river wei river and fen river basins fig 4i despite prosperous agricultural activities and increased irrigated area fig 4h this finding was in line with zhou et al 2020 who found that irrigation water use has decelerated in southeastern gansu province central shaanxi province i e guanzhong plain and central and southern shanxi province a primary reason was increased irrigation efficiency due to water saving irrigation techniques zhou et al 2020 generally human activities have played increasing roles in environmental conditions and hence the water cycle 5 2 comparison of simple regression model and deep learning method considering the complex interactions between environmental changes and the water balance a deep learning method i e lstm network was applied to build the estimation model of n based on the controlling factors selected using rf overall the lstm model outperformed the traditional mlr model in estimating time varying n fig 8 this finding confirms the advantage of deep learning approaches in handling nonlinear and unstable relationships between multiple variables moreover lstm is an advanced rnn which can capture both spatial and temporal features hidden in data thus improving the predictability of land surface processes kraft et al 2021 by contrast despite considering the nonlinear functional relationships between n and its controlling factors fig 7 the mlr model could not match the performance of the lstm model consistent with the performance of estimating n the choudhury yang equation with lstm estimated n outperformed mlr estimated n in simulating variations of e fig 9 comparison of time series of simulated e and water balance e for selected basins with different environmental conditions further indicated that the choudhury yang equation using time varying n better reproduced the temporal variation of e than using constant n fig 11 these findings demonstrated that budyko type equations with the time varying parameter could effectively estimate p partitioning 5 3 limitations and uncertainties it should be noted that discrepancies still existed between simulated e and water balance e figs 9 and 11 one possible reason is that the response of n to its controlling factors varied among basins fig 6 and thus could not be accurately expressed for each basin using a unified model developed over the whole study area additionally some other influencing factors were not considered in the current model such as the construction of check dams and terraces and coal mining liang et al 2015 luan et al 2020 furthermore the determination of hyperparameters e g batch and input sequence length in the lstm network could also influence simulation results konapala et al 2020 limitations and uncertainties can also be caused by sample size data quality and data scale the sampling pool issue may exist because the climate and landscape heterogeneity among basins were not significantly large however despite these limitations the improved choudhury yang equation with time varying n estimated by lstm still provides a practical tool for assessing the impact of dynamic environmental changes on the water balance especially for areas lacking continuous observations in combination with soil moisture data the proposed approach can be applied to finer time scales e g monthly scale in future studies to enhance the performance of the time varying budyko framework in this case some other representative environmental factors e g soil moisture capacity can be considered 6 conclusions in this study we used random forest with fivefold cross validation to identify the controlling factors for parameter n in the choudhury yang equation and then developed a model using the lstm network to estimate the time varying n using an 11 year moving window this model was further incorporated into the choudhury yang equation to improve the e simulations this study was applied to 30 basins located in the loess plateau lp of china and the main conclusions are as follows 1 parameter n displayed a significant increasing trend for nearly all the basins from 1981 to 2015 this was especially the case for northern e g the huangfu river gushan river and kuye river basins and central basins e g the qingjian river and yan river basins the trends of environmental factors varied among basins 2 the most important controlling factor of n was the proportion of cropland area followed by precipitation the proportion of shrubland area potential evapotranspiration the proportion of built up land area and irrigation water use the responses of n to its controlling factors presented spatial heterogeneity 3 the lstm model outperformed the mlr

3607,accurate estimation of the basin specific parameter in the budyko framework e g parameter n in the choudhury yang equation is critical to quantify precipitation partitioning into evapotranspiration e and runoff however n is difficult to estimate due to complex interactions between the water balance and various environmental factors in this study we identified the controlling factors of n using random forest during 1981 2015 for 30 basins in the loess plateau of china we then used the long short term memory lstm network combined with an 11 year moving window to develop a model to estimate time varying n this model was further incorporated into the choudhury yang equation to simulate e our results showed that correlations between parameter n and environmental factors presented obvious spatial heterogeneity three land use type factors i e the proportions of cropland shrubland and built up land area two climatic factors i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and a water use factor i e irrigation water use were identified as the controlling factors for n based on these controls the lstm model outperformed the traditional multiple linear regression model mlr model in estimating time varying n with root mean square error rmse of 0 31 0 49 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 88 0 67 for the lstm mlr model respectively moreover compared with the original choudhury yang equation using constant n calibrated by long term average water balance the improved equation using time varying n estimated by the lstm better reproduced the time series of water balance based e this study could enhance the applicability of the budyko framework and provide scientific guidance for water resources management keywords budyko framework land use change long short term memory network time varying loess plateau 1 introduction accurately estimating precipitation p partitioning into evapotranspiration e and runoff r is critical for water resources management however this is always a challenge because the p partitioning process involves complex interactions between climate vegetation soil and the hydrological cycle these interactions are influenced by anthropogenic and natural factors that change over time and space li and quiring 2021 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 at the long term scale the budyko framework provides a simple but effective approach to illustrate the p partitioning process under environmental change and is usually expressed as budyko type equations choudhury 1999 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 the budyko framework provides a simple but effective approach to illustrate the p partitioning at the basin scale which has developed from nonparametric to parametric equations budyko 1974 choudhury 1999 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 the original budyko equation postulates that e is mainly controlled by water availability indicated by p and energy availability indicated by potential evapotranspiration e 0 and so it is deterministic and nonparametric budyko 1974 however this equation was found to result in deviations between modeled and measured e because it does not consider the effects of basin characteristics on water balance except for climate conditions zhang et al 2001 to improve model performance parameters related to basin characteristics have been introduced into the original budyko equation to develop parametric equations including the fu fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 zhang zhang et al 2001 choudhury yang choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 and wang tang equations wang and tang 2014 these parametric equations consider the influence of land surface characteristics and thus better estimate e among the parametric equations two one parameter equations the choudhury yang equation with parameter n and the fu equation with parameter ω are the most widely used parameters n and ω are also termed basin specific parameters that are essentially equivalent sharing a significant linear relationship ω n 0 72 r2 0 999 yang et al 2008 in this study we focused on the choudhury yang equation with parameter n parameter n is recognized to represent the integrated effects of various environmental factors including underlying physical properties e g soil vegetation and topography climatic features e g seasonal cycle and anthropogenic factors e g land use management and irrigation on the water cycle donohue et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 ning et al 2017 yang et al 2009 yang et al 2020 as some environmental factors e g climatic factor land use type and vegetation cover change over time parameter n also changes over time and thus influences e by altering the budyko curves choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 the resulting variation of e can be estimated by the choudhury yang equation if the changes in n values are known for a specific basin for gauged basins parameter n is often calibrated by minimizing the bias between estimated e using the choudhury yang equation and water balance e i e p r however for some areas lacking continuous observations it is not feasible to obtain a priori estimates of n therefore many studies have explored the relationship between n and various environmental factors and hence developed models to estimate n bai et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2009 zhao et al 2020 yang et al 2009 built a stepwise regression model of n for the yellow river basin and the inland river basin with relative infiltration capacity vegetation coverage and average slope li et al 2013 proposed a simple linear regression model of ω only based on vegetation coverage over 26 major global river basins 300 000 km2 however they emphasized that other environmental factors should be considered for small basins 50 000 km2 jiang et al 2015 built a function between ω and the variables of climate conditions and human activities i e irrigated area for the wei river basin by using a moving window to estimate the temporal changes of ω and hence r ning et al 2017 developed an empirical formula of ω based on climate seasonality and vegetation coverage to estimate e for the loess plateau overall the relationships between n and its controlling factors depend on the environmental factors selected the area and location of the basin the study period and the analytical method as such the relationships vary over time and space therefore accurate e simulations using the budyko framework depend on the robustness of the estimation model of n when building the model of n two issues require particular consideration first it is essential to select relevant influencing factors earlier studies mainly considered the impact of underlying physical characteristics e g vegetation soil and topography on n li et al 2013 yang et al 2009 however several later studies have found that n is also related to climatic factors including prevailing climatic conditions e g p and e 0 climatic variability e g climate seasonality and even large scale climate patterns e g the arctic oscillation pacific decadal oscillation and niño 3 4 ning et al 2017 wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 most recently many studies have incorporated anthropogenic factors into budyko type equations such as land use management e g land use cover change lucc agricultural activity e g irrigated area and socioeconomic factors e g population and gross domestic product gdp jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2020 however it is a misconception that more factors in the model of n lead to improved predictive performance in reality it can cause overfitting problems conversely insufficient factors may result in underfitting problems making it challenging to capture n variations accurately hence to guarantee the effectiveness of the estimation model of n an appropriate number of representative influencing factors should be selected the second issue is to consider the time varying characteristics of n earlier studies usually treated n as a constant throughout the study period or several subperiods divided by a few change points liang et al 2015 xu et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 some factors e g topography and soil properties change slowly over time so it is reasonable to consider them constant zhang et al 2016 however many other factors e g p temperature vegetation cover and land use type change with time and thus parameter n and its corresponding budyko curve also vary over time jiang et al 2015 ning et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 it is challenging to capture temporal variations in e using equations with a constant n therefore we need to construct the model under time scales that match the study objective such as long term average annual decadal interannual or monthly scales once these issues have been addressed the estimation model of n can be incorporated into the choudhury yang equation to reproduce e over the historical period and predict its future changes the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the controlling factors of parameter n from various environmental factors and 2 to develop a model to estimate time varying n based on its controls an attempt was also made to incorporate the time varying n into the choudhury yang equation to improve the accuracy of e simulations this study was conducted over 30 typical basins in the loess plateau of china which has experienced significant human activities and climate change over recent decades this study highlights the need to consider dynamic features of the basin specific parameter in budyko type equations for assessing the effect of environmental changes on regional water balance thus contributing to water resources management 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the loess plateau lp is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin in northern china within 34 41 n and 98 114 e fig 1 it belongs to sub humid and sub arid zones and is controlled by continental monsoon climates the long term average annual precipitation is approximately 430 mm yr most of which occurs during the rainy season june to september in the form of high intensity rainstorms due to unfavorable environmental conditions e g sparse vegetation cover high intensity rainstorms and increased human activities e g urbanization overgrazing and coal mining lp suffers from severe soil erosion li et al 2016 sun et al 2001 zhang et al 2008 to address this issue the chinese government has implemented a series of ecological restoration measures over the past half century including the grain for green project ggp and the natural forest conservation project nfcp these projects have significantly improved vegetation coverage and caused large scale lucc over the lp feng et al 2016 ji et al 2021 meanwhile rapid socioeconomic development urbanization and population growth have led to increasing demand for water resources influencing the water balance through water withdrawals murray et al 2012 zhou et al 2020 2 2 data description three categories of environmental factors were considered as potential controlling factors of n 1 climatic factors including p and e 0 2 anthropogenic factors including area proportion of different land use types irrigated area and water use for irrigation and industry and 3 geographic factors including location i e latitude and longitude basin size i e drainage area and topographic factors i e elevation and slope all factors are detailed in table 1 daily meteorological data of 114 meteorological stations during 1981 2015 in and around the study area including p average air temperature maximum air temperature minimum air temperature relative moisture wind speed and sunshine duration were collected from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn accordingly the daily e 0 of all the stations was calculated by the penman monteith equation penman 1948 recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao finally all observational data were spatially interpolated by the gids method nalder and wein 1998 annual runoff data of 30 hydrological stations from 1981 to 2015 were obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission digital elevation model dem data with a spatial resolution of 90 m were obtained from the resource and environment science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn annual land use cover maps of china clud a at a spatial resolution of 1 km for 1981 2015 were obtained from xu et al 2020 this dataset is the first annual continuous land use cover product over china which was produced by integrating multi source satellite data e g advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat and using a change detection algorithm named breaks for additive seasonal and trend bfast the global land surface satellite glass leaf area index lai dataset from 1981 to 2015 was obtained from the national earth system science data center of the national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn this dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 8 days and was retrieved from avhrr and modis reflectance products using general regression neutral networks grnns annual socioeconomic data including population gdp and irrigated area were collected from the statistical yearbook for each province and autonomous region and the china statistical yearbook for regional economy annual water use data by sector and administrative region during the period of 1981 2013 was derived from zhou et al 2020 during 2000 2015 was obtained from the water resources bulletin for each province and autonomous region we compared the two datasets for the overlapping period 2000 2013 and the results showed good consistency between them then the final water use data was obtained from the combination of 1981 2013 data from zhou et al 2020 with the 2014 2015 data from the water resources bulletin finally all the socioeconomic data at the administrative scale were converted to the basin scale using the area weight average method see fig s1 this method consists of three steps 1 obtain patches by intersecting basin layer and administrative unit layer using the intersect tool of arcgis 2 calculate the area of each patch 3 calculate the area weighted average value for each basin using the equation as follows 1 x i m 1 n x i m a i m m 1 n a i m where xi is the area weighted average value of basin i xi m is the value of patch m obtained by the intersection of basin i and its surrounding administrative units n is the number of patches within basin i and ai m is the area of patch m information of all environmental factors for each basin is listed in table s1 3 methods 3 1 budyko framework the water balance for a specific basin can be simplified as e p r δs where δs is water storage change budyko budyko 1974 developed a framework that describes the relationships among e p and e 0 for large basins 10 000 km2 on a long term average annual scale the large area and long term period allow the assumption that δs can be considered negligible donohue et al 2007 this framework essentially estimates the evaporation ratio e p as a nonlinear function of the climatic aridity index e 0 p among which e 0 and p reflect the available energy and water that control e the original budyko framework can be expressed as 2 e p e 0 p tanh p e 0 1 exp e 0 p choudhury 1999 adjusted the empirical relationship between e p and e 0 p by introducing a basin specific parameter n as follows 3 e p e 0 p 1 e 0 p n 1 n where n is a parameter related to various environmental factors for a given basin yang et al 2008 for gauged basins parameter n can be calibrated using eq 3 based on long term average e p and e 0 to minimize the impacts of δs and natural climate variation on the water balance an 11 year moving window was taken to obtain multi year moving averages of hydro meteorological factors referring to previous studies in the lp jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2020 shao et al 2021 also showed that ignoring δs on a nearly 10 year scale has the least influence on water budget closure in the budyko framework for most basins of the lp then the original annual data of 1981 2015 were transformed into 11 year moving average data from 1986 to 2010 the moving average data for each year represents the 11 year average centered on it 3 2 variable selection using random forest random forest rf is a well known machine learning algorithm for variable selection especially in multivariate regression or classification issues breiman 1996 breiman 2001 gregorutti et al 2016 rf can help avoid overfitting and has been widely used in hydrological and climate change studies desai and ouarda 2021 tan et al 2021 zeng et al 2020 herein rf was used to select the optimal variable subset i e controlling factors of n from the original variables i e all the environmental factors the rf modeling was conducted using the train function in the r package caret kuhn et al 2020 the model was then validated by the fivefold cross validation approach de ath and fabricius 2000 refaeilzadeh et al 2009 where the entire dataset was divided into five subsets and each subset was dropped out in turn while the other subsets were used to train the model when the random forest model was built the relative importance of each variable was estimated and scaled to a maximum value of 100 using the varimp function in the caret package this value reflected the magnitude of each variable s contribution to the model the variable selection process was carried out based on the principle of keeping the least number of variables but with comparable or even better performance compared with retaining all variables this process was conducted using the sequential backward selection method zeng et al 2020 including five steps 1 sort variables in ascending order of their relative importance 2 remove the least important variable and build the model with the remaining variables 3 repeat step 2 until only one variable remains in the model 4 evaluate the prediction accuracy of each model based on the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse 5 select the variable subset with the least number of variables and the highest prediction accuracy more information about the variable selection method can be found in zeng et al 2020 this procedure was applied to non geographic factors that change over time i e climatic and anthropogenic factors geographic factors were treated as static variables due to their relative stability compared to time varying factors 3 3 long short term memory network the long short term memory lstm network is a special type of recurrent neural networks rnns which is capable of learning long term dependencies between inputs and outputs greff et al 2017 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 in this study lstm was used to build the estimation model of n from its controlling factors relying on the specially designed memory block and an efficient gradient based learning algorithm lstm can overcome the vanishing gradient problem in traditional rnn the problem is that the gradient signal becomes exponentially smaller for the long term sequence as it propagates through the network via the chain rule eventually making the backpropagation ineffective hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 each memory block in the lstm network consists of a cell state forget gate input gate output gate and hidden state fig 2 the cell state is served as the memory in which information can be stored the three gates which are essentially neurons with learnable weights control the information flow within the lstm cell specifically the forget gate determines which past state should be retained in the cell the input gate controls the extent to which a new input flows into the cell the output gate decides how much memory is used to produce the output kratzert et al 2018 together these gates enable lstm to learn from long sequence data e g length of over 10 more efficiently than conventional rnn the calibration and validation periods were set to the first 80 1986 2005 and the last 20 2006 2010 of the 11 year moving average time series for a given time step t x t is the input vector containing all the explanatory variables i e climatic factors anthropogenic factors and geographic factors and ht is the output hidden state that flows into the next time step t 1 the complete sequence of input matrix x x 1 xm is processed time step by time step where m is the sequence length and the output h h 1 hm is calculated correspondingly finally the output parameter n for time step t yt can be calculated based on hm more details can be found in kratzert et al 2018 3 4 statistical analysis the nonparametric mann kendall method mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to test the trends of hydro meteorological and anthropogenic factors rmse

2015 ranged from 1 14 to 3 98 table s1 with a low to high spatial pattern from north to south fig 3 a the highest values of n occurred in the eastern and southern parts of the study area such as the shiwang river fenchuan river and jing river basins the long term average value also showed an approximately normal distribution being 2 3 in half of the basins fig 3b by contrast the trend and degree of variation of n based on the 11 year moving averages displayed spatial heterogeneity the n values showed an increasing trend in all basins fig 3c with the highest increasing rate of 0 38 0 60 found in the northern e g the huangfu river and gushan river basins and central e g the qingjian river and yan river basins parts of the study area additionally the highest coefficients of variation cv of n values were found in the northern and central basins fig 3d indicating that the effect of environmental factors on the water balance fluctuated more in these basins than the remaining basins the basins with high cv were mainly small basins e g the huangfu river gushan river and kuye river basins while those with low cv were mainly large basins e g the wuding river jinghe river wei river and fen river basins the trends of environmental factors are shown in fig 4 for climatic factors p showed an increasing trend for most basins but a decreasing trend in some southern basins all changes were insignificant e 0 for most basins showed a significant increasing trend however the aridity index e 0 p increased in these basins because the variation magnitude of e 0 was higher than that of p land use types significantly changed owing to large scale ecological restoration and urbanization over the past two decades ji et al 2021 li et al 2016 specifically the proportion of cropland area pcrop decreased in almost all basins and was accompanied by increasing proportions of forestland pforest shrubland pshrub and built up land pbuilt up the proportion of grassland pgrass increased in some basins e g the tuwei river jialu river and wei river basins but decreased in others e g the kuye river wuding river and fen river basins fig 4e socioeconomic activities reflected by irrigated area airr and water use for irrigation wuirr displayed an intensifying trend for all the basins except those in southern and eastern areas i e the jing river wei river xinshui river and fen river basins fig 4h and i interestingly airr expanded while wuirr decreased for these basins with a large population and prosperous agricultural activities a possible reason was the improved irrigation efficiency owing to utilizing water saving irrigation techniques over southeastern gansu province central shaanxi province i e the guanzhong plain and central and southern shanxi province zhou et al 2020 water use for industry wuind significantly increased for nearly all the basins fig 4j which was partly related to increasing gdp during the latest two decades fig s2c overall no apparent spatial correlation between n and environmental factors could be observed for the whole study area because the spatial patterns of their trends were different fig 3c and fig 4 however spatial similarity could be found between the trend of parameter n and several environmental factors e g e 0 pforest especially in the northern basins i e the huangfu river gushan river and kuye river basins fig 3c and fig 4b d given complex relationships between n and environmental factors over time and space it was necessary to identify the controlling factors i e explanatory variables of n before constructing the model 4 2 selection of explanatory variables for parameter n the variable selection procedure was carried out by random forest according to the steps described in section 3 2 fig 5 a shows the variable importance denoted by var imp values between 0 and 100 of each environmental factor the most important variable was pcrop var imp 100 followed by p var imp 52 pshrub var imp 21 e 0 var imp 18 pbuilt up var imp 16 and wuirr var imp 10 fig 5b shows the performance indicators i e rmse and r2 for the rf regression model with variables removed successively according to their relative importance rmse and r2 changed slightly when the four least important variables were removed as the remaining variables continued to be removed the changes in rmse and r2 increased according to the principle of retaining the least variables but the highest prediction accuracy of the model the first four least important variables were removed ultimately six environmental factors were selected as the controlling factors of n including those related to land use i e pcrop pshrub and pbuilt up climate i e p and e 0 and socioeconomic activity i e wuirr basin specific correlations between n and environmental factors were generally consistent with the variable selection results using rf for the whole study area despite obvious spatial heterogeneity fig 6 pcrop showed significant negative correlations with n in nearly all basins with correlation coefficients of 0 433 0 988 p 0 05 indicating that pcrop was the primary controlling factor for n pshrub and pbuilt up were significantly positively correlated with n for most basins for climatic factors p and n were positively correlated in most basins the relationship between e 0 and n may be related to geographical location and showed different correlations among basins wuirr and n showed positive correlations in most northern and central basins but significant negative correlations in most southern basins overall the controlling factors of n for the whole study area were lucc climate change and water use but showed spatial variation at the basin scale 4 3 improving the choudhury yang equation with time varying parameter based on the controlling factors of n the lstm network and stepwise multiple linear regression mlr model were used to develop the estimation model of n the lstm model could not provide an explicit expression owing to its black box feature in contrast the mlr model could be expressed as follows 8 n 3 335 0 002 p 0 002 e 0 0 006 p crop 0 294 ln p shrub 1 161 p built u p 0 06 0 012 w u irr 0 091 l a t 0 091 s l where different function forms i e linear logarithm and power fig 7 were used to consider linear and nonlinear relationships between n and environmental factors overall the lstm model outperformed the mlr model for estimating n in terms of both multi year average and variation range fig 8 estimated n versus calibrated n for the mlr model showed greater dispersion than the lstm model the lstm model captured most of the variation in the n range for most basins while the mlr model had difficulty capturing the variation range of n rmse for estimating n in the validation period using the lstm and mlr models were 0 31 and 0 49 while the r2 were 0 88 and 0 67 respectively then e for all the basins was simulated using the eq 3 with parameter n estimated by lstm and mlr models the results were compared with water balance e again the lstm model outperformed the mlr model for simulating the mean and variation range of e fig 9 rmse in the validation period for the lstm and mlr models were 22 85 mm yr and 29 31 mm yr those for r2 were 0 91 and 0 86 respectively the discrepancies between simulated e and water balance e were lower than those between estimated n and calibrated n this difference may be caused by the much larger magnitude of e than that of n and thus the improvement in the e simulations was not as significant as that of n estimations moreover the sensitivity of the evaporation ratio e p to changes in n indicated that when p and e 0 were constant a 10 change in n only led to a 1 2 5 change in e for most basins of the study area fig 10 the performance of the improved choudhury yang equation eq 3 with time varying n to simulate the temporal variation of e was further evaluated two cases were compared 1 using a constant n calibrated by long term average water balance and 2 using a time varying n estimated by the lstm model fig 11 shows the comparison of simulated e from these two cases for three selected basins the kuye river basin wenjiachuan station yan river basin ansai station and wei river basin linjiacun station the kuye river and yan river basins are located in northern shaanxi with loess hilly and gully landforms and sparse vegetation cover both basins have undergone severe soil erosion and large scale soil water conservation measures before and after 1999 respectively guo et al 2016 wang et al 2013 by comparison the wei river basin is located in the southern part of the study area on the guanzhong plain which has relatively more developed socioeconomic activities and a larger population however the soil erosion issue is less severe jiang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 results indicated that the temporal variation of e simulated using time varying n reproduced the water balance e better than that using constant n r2 nse for the kuye river yan river and wei river basins improved by 0 471 0 424 0 181 0 272 and 0 154 0 224 respectively mae for the kuye river yan river and wei river basins decreased by 5 391 mm yr 6 782 mm yr and 2 879 mm yr this finding emphasized the importance of introducing a time varying parameter to partition p in the budyko framework quantitatively 5 discussion 5 1 relationship between parameter n and environmental factors for a given basin the variation of the basin specific parameter could influence the relationship between e 0 p and e p by moving the budyko curve and thus affect p partitioning into e and r such a basin specific parameter herein parameter n in the choudhury yang equation is regarded as the combined effect of environmental factors on the water balance fu 1981 yang et al 2008 many previous studies have explored the correlations between n and various environmental factors donohue et al 2012 gudmundsson et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 yang et al 2009 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 some environmental factors e g topographic factors and soil properties change little even over long periods whereas others constantly change over time these changes lead to spatio temporal variations of n and hence the water balance therefore accurate estimation of n is a prerequisite for the accurate simulation of p partitioning using the budyko framework it is necessary to select the appropriate number of representative environmental factors to build the model of n retaining excessive independent variables in a model would cause overfitting issues while insufficient variables may result in underfitting issues due to spatio temporal variability of environmental factors their interactions and the corresponding impacts on n vary with time and space ning et al 2019 found that vegetation coverage and climate seasonality asynchrony index were independent of each other at the annual scale but strongly correlated at the long term scale hence both should be incorporated into budyko type equations at the annual scale but not at the long term scale li et al 2013 proposed a simple linear regression model of ω based only on vegetation coverage which fitted well r2 0 63 over 26 large global basins 300 000 km2 however the controlling impact of vegetation on ω was diminished over small basins 50 000 km2 in this study correlations between n and environmental factors were complex and showed apparent spatial heterogeneity fig 6 for instance lucc mainly affected northern basins e g the huangfu river gushan river and kuye river basins while irrigation water use had a more significant impact on southern basins e g the jing river and wei river basins according to their relative importance we identified the controlling factors evaluated by rf with fivefold cross validation refaeilzadeh et al 2009 finally six environmental factors were selected to build the model of n fig 5 including three land use types i e pcrop pshrub and pbuilt up two climatic factors i e p and e 0 and a water use factor i e irrigation water use our results are consistent with previous studies that identified lucc as a critical influencing factor for many basins in the lp feng et al 2012 liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 lucc is primarily caused by large scale ecological restoration measures such as afforestation and returning steep slope cropland to forests to increase vegetation coverage and control soil erosion li et al 2016 shi et al 2019 xin et al 2008 fig 5a and fig 6 show that pcrop significantly influenced n for nearly all the basins and thus became the most important controlling factor of n however pforest was not selected as a controlling factor despite its important influence on vegetation coverage and the water cycle as reported by numerous previous studies feng et al 2016 guo et al 2016 hao et al 2019 we attributed this to the collinearity between pcrop and pforest owing to the conversion from cropland to forestland induced by ecological restoration measures such as ggp sun et al 2015 pgrass showed a decreasing trend in some basins one possible reason is the conversion of grassland to other land use types such as orchards and terraces ji et al 2021 moreover different data sources and study periods may lead to different findings among studies it should be noted that vegetation cover was not considered in this study to avoid multicollinearity among it and other factors as shown in fig s3 lai and land use factors were significantly correlated p 0 05 climatic factors also influence n the prevailing climate pattern dominates the land cover types soil properties and vegetation species among basins which results in spatial heterogeneity of basin characteristics sun et al 2015 besides extreme events and climate variability e g rainfall intensity and climate seasonality could lead to interannual variability in environmental factors and hence parameter n huang et al 2021 ning et al 2017 as the largest proportion of total water consumption irrigation water use has significantly influenced the hydrological cycle döll and siebert 2002 however irrigation water use showed a decreasing trend in some southern and eastern basins e g the jing river wei river and fen river basins fig 4i despite prosperous agricultural activities and increased irrigated area fig 4h this finding was in line with zhou et al 2020 who found that irrigation water use has decelerated in southeastern gansu province central shaanxi province i e guanzhong plain and central and southern shanxi province a primary reason was increased irrigation efficiency due to water saving irrigation techniques zhou et al 2020 generally human activities have played increasing roles in environmental conditions and hence the water cycle 5 2 comparison of simple regression model and deep learning method considering the complex interactions between environmental changes and the water balance a deep learning method i e lstm network was applied to build the estimation model of n based on the controlling factors selected using rf overall the lstm model outperformed the traditional mlr model in estimating time varying n fig 8 this finding confirms the advantage of deep learning approaches in handling nonlinear and unstable relationships between multiple variables moreover lstm is an advanced rnn which can capture both spatial and temporal features hidden in data thus improving the predictability of land surface processes kraft et al 2021 by contrast despite considering the nonlinear functional relationships between n and its controlling factors fig 7 the mlr model could not match the performance of the lstm model consistent with the performance of estimating n the choudhury yang equation with lstm estimated n outperformed mlr estimated n in simulating variations of e fig 9 comparison of time series of simulated e and water balance e for selected basins with different environmental conditions further indicated that the choudhury yang equation using time varying n better reproduced the temporal variation of e than using constant n fig 11 these findings demonstrated that budyko type equations with the time varying parameter could effectively estimate p partitioning 5 3 limitations and uncertainties it should be noted that discrepancies still existed between simulated e and water balance e figs 9 and 11 one possible reason is that the response of n to its controlling factors varied among basins fig 6 and thus could not be accurately expressed for each basin using a unified model developed over the whole study area additionally some other influencing factors were not considered in the current model such as the construction of check dams and terraces and coal mining liang et al 2015 luan et al 2020 furthermore the determination of hyperparameters e g batch and input sequence length in the lstm network could also influence simulation results konapala et al 2020 limitations and uncertainties can also be caused by sample size data quality and data scale the sampling pool issue may exist because the climate and landscape heterogeneity among basins were not significantly large however despite these limitations the improved choudhury yang equation with time varying n estimated by lstm still provides a practical tool for assessing the impact of dynamic environmental changes on the water balance especially for areas lacking continuous observations in combination with soil moisture data the proposed approach can be applied to finer time scales e g monthly scale in future studies to enhance the performance of the time varying budyko framework in this case some other representative environmental factors e g soil moisture capacity can be considered 6 conclusions in this study we used random forest with fivefold cross validation to identify the controlling factors for parameter n in the choudhury yang equation and then developed a model using the lstm network to estimate the time varying n using an 11 year moving window this model was further incorporated into the choudhury yang equation to improve the e simulations this study was applied to 30 basins located in the loess plateau lp of china and the main conclusions are as follows 1 parameter n displayed a significant increasing trend for nearly all the basins from 1981 to 2015 this was especially the case for northern e g the huangfu river gushan river and kuye river basins and central basins e g the qingjian river and yan river basins the trends of environmental factors varied among basins 2 the most important controlling factor of n was the proportion of cropland area followed by precipitation the proportion of shrubland area potential evapotranspiration the proportion of built up land area and irrigation water use the responses of n to its controlling factors presented spatial heterogeneity 3 the lstm model outperformed the mlr model in estimating both the long term average and variation range of n the choudhury yang equation with time varying n estimated using the lstm network could better reproduce the temporal variation in e than that with constant n calibrated by the long term average water balance credit authorship contribution statement feiyu wang methodology investigation software visualization writing original

3608,excess phosphorus p in freshwater lakes is a global challenge due to its potential cause of harmful algal blooms threating drinking water safety however quantifying the p sources for a specific site in a large lake is extremely challenging due to the complex interaction between internal and external p loading to surface water to address this challenge this study developed a modelling framework to track p sources of two drinking water intakes in a large shallow lake lake taihu in china the framework proposed a new developed index psci p source contribution index to quantify the contributions of various p sources for the drinking water intakes psci was derived by a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model that describes the complex processes of p sources sinks and transportation in both horizontal and vertical directions within the lake application of the framework to these two drinking water intakes jinshu and shangshan achieved a surprising finding that internal p loading from sediment was a significant p source with a contribution as high as 47 1 and 30 4 respectively central lake taihu had a large contribution of 49 5 and 68 3 for jinshu and shangshan and inflow river wangyu river had a contribution of 5 the high contribution of internal p loading was mainly due to the sediment p accumulation for years and large external p loading our study highlighted the important role of internal p loading affecting the p concentration of drinking water intake in a large eutrophic lake and demonstrated the high value of the modelling framework in quantifying the p sources for a specific site e g drinking water intake in a lake keywords water quality efdc sediment water transfer lake taihu 1 introduction under the context of groundwater depletion surface water quality of rivers lakes and reservoirs is of particularly concerned partly due to its widely use for drinking water intake qin et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 china s water pollution has been responsible for a shortage of 40 billion m3 of water per year tao and xin 2014 representing an imminent threat to the drinking water availability for 300 million people a recent nationwide assessment revealed that 29 of the total 110 surveyed lakes experienced eutrophication problems ministry of ecology and environment 2021 excess phosphorus p was widely recognized as a factor causing eutrophication schindler et al 2016 excess p have been widely reported in drinking water intakes of large lakes across china such as lakes taihu qin et al 2019 qin et al 2010 chaohu duan et al 2017 huang et al 2018 dianchi ji et al 2021 wu et al 2017 and reservoirs miyun qin et al 2020b wang et al 2014 the severe problem of excess p threatens drinking water intakes mainly due to its direct relation to harmful algal blooms habs paerl et al 2016 schindler et al 2016 there are many habs caused illnesses and even deaths of humans and animals not only in developing countries but also in developed countries albay et al 2003 in may 2007 severe habs caused a drinking water crisis in china s large city of wuxi in jiangsu province conley et al 2009 guo 2007 yang et al 2008 in particularly the problem of excess p in lakes are likely to continue over the next decades and may be even worse due to climate change sinha et al 2017 however the fact that drinking water intakes provide essential freshwater for growing populations that should be envisaged duan et al 2017 to solve the problem it is urgent for us to track p sources of the lake especially in the sensitive areas e g drinking water intakes such p source tracking can support us to take corresponding measurements for p control in lake taihu qin et al 2010 several approaches e g monitoring experiment numerical modelling see table s1 have been developed to quantify the p sources and their corresponding contributions however an accurate quantification study is still insufficient for such a large lake as lake taihu with hundreds of inflow outflow rivers and biogeochemical cycling within the lake the complex p sources for lake taihu mainly related to the large amount of inflow outflow rivers xu et al 2015 complex groundwater infiltration rosenberry et al 2015 unclear atmospheric deposition luo et al 2007 zhai et al 2009 controversial p releasing rates from sediment gibbons and bridgeman 2020 spears et al 2008 however determining the ratio of p sources is important for achieving better water environment management to solve the technical challenge of quantifying the p sources for a specific site of a large lake we developed a framework to track p sources and their corresponding contribution ratio of the drinking water intakes in a large eutrophic lake to test above framework two drinking water intakes of lake taihu in china were taken as an example a new p source contribution index psci was derived by a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model to analyze complex p cycling including p sources sinks and transportation in both horizontal and vertical directions within lake and to evaluate p contribution from internal and external loading based on the evaluation results using psci the p contribution ratio of different sources was quantified this study demonstrated the high value of the modelling framework in quantifying the p sources for a specific site e g drinking water intake in a lake 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake taihu located in the yangtze river delta in eastern china is a large surface area of 2338 km2 shallow mean depth 1 9 m eutrophic lake with a catchment area of 36 895 km2 230 inflow and outflow rivers were connected with the lake with an annual water input of 9 1 109 m3 ji et al 2019 the water retention time of the lake is 284 days huang et al 2017 the lake provided drinking water for the surrounding city population with tourism fisheries and shipping being additionally important economic functions its annually average water tp was 0 112 mg l during 2005 2020 zhu et al 2021 point source pollution from sewage treatment plants and non point source pollution from agricultural activities are found to be the critical p sources for the lake wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 gonghu bay surface area of 150 km2 and mean depth of 1 8 m is situated in the northern part of lake taihu fig 1 zhu et al 2020 two drinking water intakes shangshan and jinshu in gonghu bay provide drinking water for 16 million population in two large cities suzhou and wuxi zou et al 2016 in the southern part gonghu bay is connected with the central lake taihu in the northern part gonghu bay is connected with a large inflow river of wangyu river for water transfer from yangtze river to lake taihu huang et al 2014 the river is a large water and tp inflow for gonghu bay with an estimation of 951 million m3 yr 1 water and 122 93 t yr 1 tp 0 124 mg l during 2010 2015 zhu et al 2020 therefore the impact of water transfer from wangyu river on the drinking water intake of lake taihu cannot be ignored dai et al 2020 in addition to wangyu river the bay is connected with several small rivers that are manually controlled by sluice gates there is no water exchange between these small rivers and gonghu bay except during flooding periods tp in gonghu bay was significantly lower than that in most areas of lake taihu during the past few decades hu et al 2010 however in recent years gonghu bay is experiencing ecological degradation such as decreasing coverage of macrophytes zhao et al 2015 such ecological degradation of decreasing coverage of macrophytes can in turn enhance the nutrient releasing from sediment 2 2 data a measured dataset was collected during 2017 2019 to track p sources in two drinking water intakes of lake taihu table 1 this dataset included meteorological hydrological and water quality data the daily meteorological data were collected from the national weather station of dongshan fig 1 and suzhou ecological environment bureau the daily hydrological data was flow discharge q m3 s from taihu basin authority http www tba gov cn the daily water quality data was total phosphorus tp mg l of drinking water intake from suzhou ecological environment bureau and ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china table 1 2 3 a framework to track phosphorus sources to track p sources of the drinking water intakes in a large shallow lake a framework was developed based on three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model in the developed framework internal p loading was derived through the hydrodynamic conditions as an essential part of the model we designed eight scenario simulations and develop a new index psci to determine p sources and their contribution ratio the critical procedures of the framework were described in fig 2 2 3 1 three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model the hydrodynamic and water quality model efdc developed by hamrick 1996 was used to simulate hydrodynamic water velocity and tp dynamics in gonghu bay of lake taihu efdc solves three dimensional vertically hydrostatic free surface and turbulent averaged equations of motion for a variable density fluid arifin et al 2016 wu and xu 2011 and has been widely used in various aquatic ecosystems include rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands estuaries and coastal ocean regions huang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 further details including schematic diagram and model parameters of the used model efdc can be found in supporting information sediment nutrient fluxes across the sediment water interface were simulated based on the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the three dimensional flow field combined with the lake surface wind conditions sediments were disturbed into the water body with the p releasing and adsorption pang et al 2008 under the low wind speed conditions the sediment will not be re suspended or have a low re suspension rate and thus have limited impacts on the p concentration in surface water in case that the wind speed exceeds the threshold wind speed 4 m s used in this study for sediment re suspension qin et al 2003 tang et al 2020 the lake sediment had a significant re suspension rate and bring considerable nutrients into surface water after the large wind events the re suspended sediments containing nutrients would settle into sediment with a rate depending on its particle size therefore it is widely recognized that sediment nutrient fluxes were highly related with wind speed dai et al 2020 huang et al 2016 tang et al 2021 and we used the following empirical equation to express the relationship between sediment nutrient fluxes and wind speed in gonghu bay fig 3 1 q i x 0 4497 μ i 0 043 w s 4 0 0052 μ i 0 0034 w s 4 where q i x represents sediment nutrients po4 flux for cell i μ i is water velocity value for cell i ws is the critical wind speed empirical values used in the equation were determined using trial and error method to achieve the best model fit between measured and simulated tp efdc used a time step of 200 s and a spatial resolution of 500 m with a total of 9421 cells for the studied lake in order to capture the vertical changes of water temperature and velocity two layers were employed in the vertical direction using a sigma coordinate the initial water velocity for all the cells was assigned as 0 that is an acceptable strategy widely used in hydrodynamic modelling other initial conditions including water temperature and p were obtained from measured data in lake taihu boundary conditions including precipitation wind conditions flow discharge inflow water quality were obtained from measured data daily precipitation and wind conditions were obtained from the weather station closed to the lake dongshan station in fig 1 an inflow river wangyu river and an outflow river taipu river were considered in the model we did not consider other rivers connected to gonghu bay because these rivers were sluice controlled and generally had no water exchange with gonghu bay discharge and water quality data of wangyu river were obtained from measurement at wangyu river sampling sites fig 1 2 3 2 phosphorus source contribution estimation by investigating p measurements and analysis in gonghu bay a p source contribution index psci was proposed to quantify the impacts of different p sources on tp in surface water based on the spatial and temporal distribution of psci p source contribution maps were derived to represent dynamic change of psci under various conditions 1 designing model scenarios to calculate p sources based on the combination of wind field internal p loading water transfer and central lake taihu eight simulations were designed to evaluate the impacts of p sources change on p in drinking water intake table 2 this framework aims to analyze the contributions of p from different sources for p in drinking water intakes two base simulations s1 and s5 were carried out to simulate p dynamics under present p sources conditions two simulations s2 and s6 including water transfer were carried out to evaluate the impacts of wangyu river p contribution on drinking water intakes water transfer discharge was 80 42 m3 s that was the average flow discharges during 2017 2019 fig s1 two simulations s3 and s7 with excluding internal p loading were carried out to evaluate the impacts of internal p loading on drinking water intakes two simulations s4 s8 with excluding central lake taihu were carried out to evaluate the impacts of central lake taihu p contribution on drinking water intakes 2 quantifying the impact of p sources on water tp based on eight scenario simulations under different conditions table 2 psci was proposed to quantify the impact of p sources on water tp psci for three p sources were defined using the following equations 2 δ t p i x tp i x tp i base tp i bg w i 3 psci i x δ t p i x m i n δ t p i s 2 δ t p i s 3 δ t p i x m a x δ t p i s 2 δ t p i s 3 δ t p i x m i n δ t p i s 2 δ t p i s 3 δ t p i x where δ t p i x is the change of tp concentration for cell i in the scenarios of with and without p sources x is the scenarios of s2 s3 s4 s6 s7 s8 in table 2 tp i x was tp concentration mg l for cell i under increasing decreasing p sources x tp i base is tp concentration mg l for cell i under present p sources conditions i e the scenarios of s1 or s5 in table 2 tp i bg is reference value of water tp mg l for cell i there is no physical barrier between gonghu bay and central lake taihu therefore the background value for the p source of central lake taihu is assigned by the water tp to the two drinking water intakes we did not consider the background values for the water transfer from wangyu river and internal p releasing i e tp i bg 0 w i is weight coefficient 0 1 specifically designed for the p source of wangyu river and represents the proportion of water transfer days to total days 365 366 in a year w i is 1 for the process of water exchange with central lake taihu and internal p releasing 3 calculating p source contribution the estimated psci was used to quantify the contribution ratio of p from three p sources under different wind directions using the following equation r i x psci i x x 1 n psci i x 100 4 r i x is p contribution ratio for cell i from p sources x n is the number of p sources n 3 sediment wangyu river central lake taihu 3 results 3 1 model performance the model had an acceptable performance on simulating the dynamics of hydrodynamic and water quality conditions fig 4 compared with measured results in the summer of 1998 sun et al 2003 the model well described the flow pattern of lake taihu fig 4 a b especially in the bay of gonghu bay tp was simulated with a ns and r2 value of 0 776 and 0 877 in jinshu fig 4 c and was well simulated with a ns and r2 value of 0 824 and 0 912 in shangshan fig 4 d the short term p fluctuation of both jinshu and shangshan was not well simulated during april 5 2019 to may 5 2019 compared with previous water quality modelling practice in lake taihu we argued the above mentioned model fit is acceptable in many previous modelling cases of lake taihu hydrodynamic component is scarcely validated by water velocity due to lack of measured data as a compromise our study compared the summer water flow pattern with previous measured data in 1998 for the water quality components our model fit r2 0 85 is higher than several previous publications with a relative deviation of 39 68 hu et al 2006 a statistic p of 78 huang et al 2012 and a mean radial error of 78 2 mao et al 2008 3 2 phosphorus sources of two drinking water intakes 3 2 1 total phosphorus in response to phosphorus loading reduction from different sources the comparison between each scenario and the base scenario showed that psci in gonghu bay responded differently to various p sources fig 5 and simulated tp peaks reached stable conditions in a short term psci values for water transfer from wangyu river varied reasonably fig 5 a and d psci values 0 2 for jinshu were high implying that p in jinshu were sensitive to p reduction from water transfer psci values 0 1 for shangshan were lower than jinshu implying that p reduction from water transfer has less impacts compared with that by reducing p in shangshan furthermore this difference was more significant under northwest wind than that under southeast wind psci values for internal p loading varied significantly fig 5 b and e psci values 0 4 for jinshu and shangshan were both high implying that p in gonghu bay were all very sensitive to p reduction from internal p loading furthermore the above two differences were both more significant under northwest wind than under southeast wind psci values for central lake taihu water varied considerably fig 5 c and f psci values 0 8 for shangshan were high implying that p in shangshan were very sensitive to p reduction from central lake taihu psci values 0 5 for jinshu were low implying that p in jinshu were insensitive to p reduction from central lake taihu internal p loading from sediment and external p loading from wangyu river and central lake taihu were critical p sources influencing tp in drinking water intakes the psci values for external p loading were generally high in their river bay mouth areas the psci values for internal p loading were high in their coastal area however the psci values for internal p loading were considerably high implying that considerable contribution of internal p loading to surface water in drinking water intakes 3 2 2 contribution of each phosphorus source to drinking water intakes our comparison between internal and external p loading along drink water intakes showed that central lake taihu was dominated contribution 49 5 for jinshu 68 3 for shangshan and internal p loading was subdominant contribution 47 1 for jinshu 30 4 for shangshan for drinking water intakes fig 6 however contributions were different for two drinking water intakes with different environmental conditions for example jinshu is closed to mouth area of wangyu river while shangshan is closed to central lake taihu contributions in shangshan were sensitive to changes of wind directions that even result in changing the magnitude of the contribution from wangyu river however the above mentioned impact did not occur in jinshu 4 discussion 4 1 why internal loading explain excess phosphorus in two drinking water intakes our modelling results revealed a dominated contribution from both central lake taihu and internal p loading from sediment in two drinking water intakes fig 6 there was a large amount of water exchange between central lake taihu and gonghu bay therefore it is not surprising that central lake taihu had a large p contribution to the drinking water intakes although such a large contribution internal p loading was unexpected we argued it is convincible with several evidences reported in previous publications xu et al 2021 1 decades of high p loading resulted in an excess p in lake sediment implying a large internal p loading the increasing studies worldwide revealed that severe internal loading was caused by long term excessive nitrogen n and p paytan et al 2017 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2021 yin et al 2021 in lake taihu eutrophication had lasted 41 years with intensive external p loading qin et al 2007 implying a rich n p storage in sediments qin et al 2019 such rich p storage in sediment and thus large internal p loading has been confirmed by several previous studies via experiment qin et al 2019 wen et al 2020 xu et al 2021 our results were consistent with many previous studies that revealed a large contribution of internal p loading in the total p loading especially under the strict control of external loading table s3 the dynamic of internal p loading in drinking water intakes under different wind directions fig 5 b and e were consistent with recent studies that the rate of sediment releasing could vary monthly and seasonally spears et al 2012 2 continuing high external p loading from inflow rivers e g wangyu enhanced internal p loading in recent years an estimated value of annually external total p loading for lake taihu was 1 8 2 6 106 kg y 1 through 200 inflow rivers wang et al 2019 xu et al 2015 such large amount of external p would resulted in substantial settling of particulate p because water velocity in the lake water 10 30 cm s is lower than the wangyu river 30 cm s estimated by the water discharge in figure s1 qin et al 2007 in particularly in the central area of gonghu bay the water velocity is lower than that in the littoral area fig 7 li et al 2011 although p loading carried by wangyu river and central lake taihu was lower than many other inflow rivers external p loading would also enhance internal p loading because 63 75 of external p loading retained in the lake qin et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 sediment releasing in the p heavily settling zones was promoted after water transfer spears et al 2008 although external loading had been reduced internal p loading that accumulated due to historical p loading could delay lake recovery for approximately a decade in the lake jarvie et al 2013 søndergaard et al 2013 p had a long residence time in lakes because it was lost via outflows and lacked a gaseous phase xu et al 2021 a water residence time of 284 d in lake taihu minimized p losses by flushing and maximized p retention huang et al 2017 although sediment p exchange was a net sink on an annual scale in lake taihu xu et al 2021 sediment was only an intermediate storage to affect p loading in drinking water intakes these sediment p actually came from historical p accumulation by inflow rivers of lake taihu qin et al 2019 3 high internal p loading was triggered by high wind conditions e g cyclones particulate p was prone to re suspend into the water column due to water disturbances by wind driving force and sediment resuspension had a high relationship with wind speed in shallow lakes tang et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 the difference of critical wind speed for sediment resuspension in the different lake was caused by sediment properties aquatic vegetation lake morphology qin et al 2019 this framework applied a threshold wind speed of 4 m s that suspension of sediment as constant wind speed to simulate the internal p loading under dominant wind directions northwest and southeast in drinking water intakes qin et al 2003 tang et al 2020 meanwhile the increasing number of case studies showed that re suspended solid concentration in the surface layer was estimated in the ranges of 16 6 220 1 mg l as wind field experienced changing ranges 0 8 1 m s tang et al 2020 additionally the result in previous studies showed that the average concentration of dissolved p in the whole lake taihu was 0 021 mg l in case that wind speed was 5 m s huang et al 2016 the higher ratio of particulate p was the inevitable result of the frequent resuspension of sediment in drinking water intakes this result was consistent with previous studies revealed that particulate p was the main form of p in lake taihu zhu et al 2021 4 2 how can we control phosphorus of drinking water intakes in water management practice 1 an accurate p source tracking would be helpful to identify the hot spots and hot moments for high p qualitative analysis was generally used to determine different p sources for a whole lake system however our investigation results showed that p sources of two drinking water intakes with a short distance had significant differences fig 5 the psci maps for three p sources fig 5 revealed that hot spots for drinking water intakes in lake taihu internal p loading abatement should give first priority however the large spatial variations of psci maps fig 5 implied that the hot spots of external loading depended on the target areas to alleviate excess p in jinshu reducing external p loading from wangyu river was important however to control excess p in shangshan reducing external p loading from central lake taihu was most important the psci maps for external p loading from central lake taihu revealed that hot moments for shangshan was summer fig 5 because of the prevailing southeast winds in summer however it is important to note that such qualitative analysis has more or less uncertainty in management practice it is necessary to carry out accurate quantitative analysis of p sources especially in highly concerned areas 2 external p loading should be well controlled to achieve a low internal p loading in these two drinking water intakes although our study revealed an extremely large contribution of internal p loading this does not mean that it is not important to control external p loading in contrast a strategy that simply controlling internal p loading was not adequate to reduce tp in these two drinking water intakes in case that the internal loading had been well controlled external loading need more attentions submerged vegetation restoration and bio manipulation of fishery can be a potential option to fight against high tp before water entering into lakes mao et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 3 the large contribution of internal p loading from sediment implied a delayed effect of external p control on tp reduction of these two drinking water intakes controlling external p loading was difficult to reduce tp concentration in a short time in drinking water intakes of lake taihu considering the high cost of sediment dredging 12 5 15 0 m2 lürling and faassen 2012 van oosterhout and lürling 2011 sediment dredging was generally partly implemented in areas with high internal loading this was the reason why tp control had been carried out for 13 years in three lakes lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu council 2008 while harmful algal blooms had continued to have a considerable magnitude in recent years huang et al 2020 therefore management practice of ecological restoration should be carried out enclosures were set to reduce the water velocity by investigating conditions of lake morphology and hydrology huang and liu 2009 macrophytes were restored by artificial cultivation that absorbed nutrients including p from sediment and inhibited the resuspension of sediment it was an effective pathway to self purification of shallow lakes qin et al 2020a 4 3 what is the advantages of the framework in tracking phosphorus sources 1 compared with experimental methods the modelling framework provides us an avenue to quantify p source contribution in a complex lake ecosystem experimental methods provided excellent avenue for investigating a single process e g sediment releasing and resuspension but could not quantify the contribution of multiple processes in a complex ecosystem however the modelling framework considered various processes including sediment water interface water transfer from wangyu river water exchange from central lake taihu compared with the existing studies on tracking p sources at watershed scale table s4 lake scale model tracking phosphorus sources mainly focused on phosphorus mass balance schauser and chorus 2009 our modelling framework not only focused on tracking phosphorus sources in lake scale but also paid more attention on these areas e g drinking water intakes should be highly concerned in the emergency management of nutrients in lake taihu 2 the framework based on a well validation model was able to predict the response of tp in drinking water intakes to management strategies the modelling framework analyzed tp sources by designing a series of simulation scenarios however determining the contribution of p sources is still challenging the framework accurately evaluated contribution of p sources economic cost was saved in pollution control through determining contribution of p sources in water drinking intakes although used in tp sources tracking this framework was transferable to predict other management scenarios including but not limited to wetland construction and macrophyte restoration 3 the developed framework for tracking p source can be easily transferred to other large eutrophic lakes based on efdc the framework was generic and therefore should be readily transferable to other large shallow lakes for example it is transferable to track other water quality variables efdc has been widely used in various aquatic ecosystems huang et al 2018 tang et al 2021 and this framework can thus inherit the strengths of efdc in its wide application 5 conclusions to address the challenge of tracking p source for a specific site in a large lake a modelling framework was proposed and applied in two drinking water intakes jinshu and shangshan in lake taihu our investigation revealed that internal p loading from sediment was a large p source for these two drinking water intakes with a contribution as high as 47 1 and 30 4 respectively central lake taihu had a high contribution of 49 5 and 68 3 for jinshu and shangsha while inflow river wangyu river had a limited contribution of 5 these results implied that different specific sites even with a short distance resulted in different p source contribution due to the complex hydrodynamic and p cycling our study highlighted the important role of internal p loading affecting the p concentration of drinking water intake in a large eutrophic lake given that external p is a p source for internal p both internal and external p should be well controlled via corresponding strategies e g macrophyte restoration and reducing inflow tp concentration to achieve a tp reduction in water management

3608,excess phosphorus p in freshwater lakes is a global challenge due to its potential cause of harmful algal blooms threating drinking water safety however quantifying the p sources for a specific site in a large lake is extremely challenging due to the complex interaction between internal and external p loading to surface water to address this challenge this study developed a modelling framework to track p sources of two drinking water intakes in a large shallow lake lake taihu in china the framework proposed a new developed index psci p source contribution index to quantify the contributions of various p sources for the drinking water intakes psci was derived by a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model that describes the complex processes of p sources sinks and transportation in both horizontal and vertical directions within the lake application of the framework to these two drinking water intakes jinshu and shangshan achieved a surprising finding that internal p loading from sediment was a significant p source with a contribution as high as 47 1 and 30 4 respectively central lake taihu had a large contribution of 49 5 and 68 3 for jinshu and shangshan and inflow river wangyu river had a contribution of 5 the high contribution of internal p loading was mainly due to the sediment p accumulation for years and large external p loading our study highlighted the important role of internal p loading affecting the p concentration of drinking water intake in a large eutrophic lake and demonstrated the high value of the modelling framework in quantifying the p sources for a specific site e g drinking water intake in a lake keywords water quality efdc sediment water transfer lake taihu 1 introduction under the context of groundwater depletion surface water quality of rivers lakes and reservoirs is of particularly concerned partly due to its widely use for drinking water intake qin et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 china s water pollution has been responsible for a shortage of 40 billion m3 of water per year tao and xin 2014 representing an imminent threat to the drinking water availability for 300 million people a recent nationwide assessment revealed that 29 of the total 110 surveyed lakes experienced eutrophication problems ministry of ecology and environment 2021 excess phosphorus p was widely recognized as a factor causing eutrophication schindler et al 2016 excess p have been widely reported in drinking water intakes of large lakes across china such as lakes taihu qin et al 2019 qin et al 2010 chaohu duan et al 2017 huang et al 2018 dianchi ji et al 2021 wu et al 2017 and reservoirs miyun qin et al 2020b wang et al 2014 the severe problem of excess p threatens drinking water intakes mainly due to its direct relation to harmful algal blooms habs paerl et al 2016 schindler et al 2016 there are many habs caused illnesses and even deaths of humans and animals not only in developing countries but also in developed countries albay et al 2003 in may 2007 severe habs caused a drinking water crisis in china s large city of wuxi in jiangsu province conley et al 2009 guo 2007 yang et al 2008 in particularly the problem of excess p in lakes are likely to continue over the next decades and may be even worse due to climate change sinha et al 2017 however the fact that drinking water intakes provide essential freshwater for growing populations that should be envisaged duan et al 2017 to solve the problem it is urgent for us to track p sources of the lake especially in the sensitive areas e g drinking water intakes such p source tracking can support us to take corresponding measurements for p control in lake taihu qin et al 2010 several approaches e g monitoring experiment numerical modelling see table s1 have been developed to quantify the p sources and their corresponding contributions however an accurate quantification study is still insufficient for such a large lake as lake taihu with hundreds of inflow outflow rivers and biogeochemical cycling within the lake the complex p sources for lake taihu mainly related to the large amount of inflow outflow rivers xu et al 2015 complex groundwater infiltration rosenberry et al 2015 unclear atmospheric deposition luo et al 2007 zhai et al 2009 controversial p releasing rates from sediment gibbons and bridgeman 2020 spears et al 2008 however determining the ratio of p sources is important for achieving better water environment management to solve the technical challenge of quantifying the p sources for a specific site of a large lake we developed a framework to track p sources and their corresponding contribution ratio of the drinking water intakes in a large eutrophic lake to test above framework two drinking water intakes of lake taihu in china were taken as an example a new p source contribution index psci was derived by a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model to analyze complex p cycling including p sources sinks and transportation in both horizontal and vertical directions within lake and to evaluate p contribution from internal and external loading based on the evaluation results using psci the p contribution ratio of different sources was quantified this study demonstrated the high value of the modelling framework in quantifying the p sources for a specific site e g drinking water intake in a lake 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake taihu located in the yangtze river delta in eastern china is a large surface area of 2338 km2 shallow mean depth 1 9 m eutrophic lake with a catchment area of 36 895 km2 230 inflow and outflow rivers were connected with the lake with an annual water input of 9 1 109 m3 ji et al 2019 the water retention time of the lake is 284 days huang et al 2017 the lake provided drinking water for the surrounding city population with tourism fisheries and shipping being additionally important economic functions its annually average water tp was 0 112 mg l during 2005 2020 zhu et al 2021 point source pollution from sewage treatment plants and non point source pollution from agricultural activities are found to be the critical p sources for the lake wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 gonghu bay surface area of 150 km2 and mean depth of 1 8 m is situated in the northern part of lake taihu fig 1 zhu et al 2020 two drinking water intakes shangshan and jinshu in gonghu bay provide drinking water for 16 million population in two large cities suzhou and wuxi zou et al 2016 in the southern part gonghu bay is connected with the central lake taihu in the northern part gonghu bay is connected with a large inflow river of wangyu river for water transfer from yangtze river to lake taihu huang et al 2014 the river is a large water and tp inflow for gonghu bay with an estimation of 951 million m3 yr 1 water and 122 93 t yr 1 tp 0 124 mg l during 2010 2015 zhu et al 2020 therefore the impact of water transfer from wangyu river on the drinking water intake of lake taihu cannot be ignored dai et al 2020 in addition to wangyu river the bay is connected with several small rivers that are manually controlled by sluice gates there is no water exchange between these small rivers and gonghu bay except during flooding periods tp in gonghu bay was significantly lower than that in most areas of lake taihu during the past few decades hu et al 2010 however in recent years gonghu bay is experiencing ecological degradation such as decreasing coverage of macrophytes zhao et al 2015 such ecological degradation of decreasing coverage of macrophytes can in turn enhance the nutrient releasing from sediment 2 2 data a measured dataset was collected during 2017 2019 to track p sources in two drinking water intakes of lake taihu table 1 this dataset included meteorological hydrological and water quality data the daily meteorological data were collected from the national weather station of dongshan fig 1 and suzhou ecological environment bureau the daily hydrological data was flow discharge q m3 s from taihu basin authority http www tba gov cn the daily water quality data was total phosphorus tp mg l of drinking water intake from suzhou ecological environment bureau and ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china table 1 2 3 a framework to track phosphorus sources to track p sources of the drinking water intakes in a large shallow lake a framework was developed based on three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model in the developed framework internal p loading was derived through the hydrodynamic conditions as an essential part of the model we designed eight scenario simulations and develop a new index psci to determine p sources and their contribution ratio the critical procedures of the framework were described in fig 2 2 3 1 three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model the hydrodynamic and water quality model efdc developed by hamrick 1996 was used to simulate hydrodynamic water velocity and tp dynamics in gonghu bay of lake taihu efdc solves three dimensional vertically hydrostatic free surface and turbulent averaged equations of motion for a variable density fluid arifin et al 2016 wu and xu 2011 and has been widely used in various aquatic ecosystems include rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands estuaries and coastal ocean regions huang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 further details including schematic diagram and model parameters of the used model efdc can be found in supporting information sediment nutrient fluxes across the sediment water interface were simulated based on the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the three dimensional flow field combined with the lake surface wind conditions sediments were disturbed into the water body with the p releasing and adsorption pang et al 2008 under the low wind speed conditions the sediment will not be re suspended or have a low re suspension rate and thus have limited impacts on the p concentration in surface water in case that the wind speed exceeds the threshold wind speed 4 m s used in this study for sediment re suspension qin et al 2003 tang et al 2020 the lake sediment had a significant re suspension rate and bring considerable nutrients into surface water after the large wind events the re suspended sediments containing nutrients would settle into sediment with a rate depending on its particle size therefore it is widely recognized that sediment nutrient fluxes were highly related with wind speed dai et al 2020 huang et al 2016 tang et al 2021 and we used the following empirical equation to express the relationship between sediment nutrient fluxes and wind speed in gonghu bay fig 3 1 q i x 0 4497 μ i 0 043 w s 4 0 0052 μ i 0 0034 w s 4 where q i x represents sediment nutrients po4 flux for cell i μ i is water velocity value for cell i ws is the critical wind speed empirical values used in the equation were determined using trial and error method to achieve the best model fit between measured and simulated tp efdc used a time step of 200 s and a spatial resolution of 500 m with a total of 9421 cells for the studied lake in order to capture the vertical changes of water temperature and velocity two layers were employed in the vertical direction using a sigma coordinate the initial water velocity for all the cells was assigned as 0 that is an acceptable strategy widely used in hydrodynamic modelling other initial conditions including water temperature and p were obtained from measured data in lake taihu boundary conditions including precipitation wind conditions flow discharge inflow water quality were obtained from measured data daily precipitation and wind conditions were obtained from the weather station closed to the lake dongshan station in fig 1 an inflow river wangyu river and an outflow river taipu river were considered in the model we did not consider other rivers connected to gonghu bay because these rivers were sluice controlled and generally had no water exchange with gonghu bay discharge and water quality data of wangyu river were obtained from measurement at wangyu river sampling sites fig 1 2 3 2 phosphorus source contribution estimation by investigating p measurements and analysis in gonghu bay a p source contribution index psci was proposed to quantify the impacts of different p sources on tp in surface water based on the spatial and temporal distribution of psci p source contribution maps were derived to represent dynamic change of psci under various conditions 1 designing model scenarios to calculate p sources based on the combination of wind field internal p loading water transfer and central lake taihu eight simulations were designed to evaluate the impacts of p sources change on p in drinking water intake table 2 this framework aims to analyze the contributions of p from different sources for p in drinking water intakes two base simulations s1 and s5 were carried out to simulate p dynamics under present p sources conditions two simulations s2 and s6 including water transfer were carried out to evaluate the impacts of wangyu river p contribution on drinking water intakes water transfer discharge was 80 42 m3 s that was the average flow discharges during 2017 2019 fig s1 two simulations s3 and s7 with excluding internal p loading were carried out to evaluate the impacts of internal p loading on drinking water intakes two simulations s4 s8 with excluding central lake taihu were carried out to evaluate the impacts of central lake taihu p contribution on drinking water intakes 2 quantifying the impact of p sources on water tp based on eight scenario simulations under different conditions table 2 psci was proposed to quantify the impact of p sources on water tp psci for three p sources were defined using the following equations 2 δ t p i x tp i x tp i base tp i bg w i 3 psci i x δ t p i x m i n δ t p i s 2 δ t p i s 3 δ t p i x m a x δ t p i s 2 δ t p i s 3 δ t p i x m i n δ t p i s 2 δ t p i s 3 δ t p i x where δ t p i x is the change of tp concentration for cell i in the scenarios of with and without p sources x is the scenarios of s2 s3 s4 s6 s7 s8 in table 2 tp i x was tp concentration mg l for cell i under increasing decreasing p sources x tp i base is tp concentration mg l for cell i under present p sources conditions i e the scenarios of s1 or s5 in table 2 tp i bg is reference value of water tp mg l for cell i there is no physical barrier between gonghu bay and central lake taihu therefore the background value for the p source of central lake taihu is assigned by the water tp to the two drinking water intakes we did not consider the background values for the water transfer from wangyu river and internal p releasing i e tp i bg 0 w i is weight coefficient 0 1 specifically designed for the p source of wangyu river and represents the proportion of water transfer days to total days 365 366 in a year w i is 1 for the process of water exchange with central lake taihu and internal p releasing 3 calculating p source contribution the estimated psci was used to quantify the contribution ratio of p from three p sources under different wind directions using the following equation r i x psci i x x 1 n psci i x 100 4 r i x is p contribution ratio for cell i from p sources x n is the number of p sources n 3 sediment wangyu river central lake taihu 3 results 3 1 model performance the model had an acceptable performance on simulating the dynamics of hydrodynamic and water quality conditions fig 4 compared with measured results in the summer of 1998 sun et al 2003 the model well described the flow pattern of lake taihu fig 4 a b especially in the bay of gonghu bay tp was simulated with a ns and r2 value of 0 776 and 0 877 in jinshu fig 4 c and was well simulated with a ns and r2 value of 0 824 and 0 912 in shangshan fig 4 d the short term p fluctuation of both jinshu and shangshan was not well simulated during april 5 2019 to may 5 2019 compared with previous water quality modelling practice in lake taihu we argued the above mentioned model fit is acceptable in many previous modelling cases of lake taihu hydrodynamic component is scarcely validated by water velocity due to lack of measured data as a compromise our study compared the summer water flow pattern with previous measured data in 1998 for the water quality components our model fit r2 0 85 is higher than several previous publications with a relative deviation of 39 68 hu et al 2006 a statistic p of 78 huang et al 2012 and a mean radial error of 78 2 mao et al 2008 3 2 phosphorus sources of two drinking water intakes 3 2 1 total phosphorus in response to phosphorus loading reduction from different sources the comparison between each scenario and the base scenario showed that psci in gonghu bay responded differently to various p sources fig 5 and simulated tp peaks reached stable conditions in a short term psci values for water transfer from wangyu river varied reasonably fig 5 a and d psci values 0 2 for jinshu were high implying that p in jinshu were sensitive to p reduction from water transfer psci values 0 1 for shangshan were lower than jinshu implying that p reduction from water transfer has less impacts compared with that by reducing p in shangshan furthermore this difference was more significant under northwest wind than that under southeast wind psci values for internal p loading varied significantly fig 5 b and e psci values 0 4 for jinshu and shangshan were both high implying that p in gonghu bay were all very sensitive to p reduction from internal p loading furthermore the above two differences were both more significant under northwest wind than under southeast wind psci values for central lake taihu water varied considerably fig 5 c and f psci values 0 8 for shangshan were high implying that p in shangshan were very sensitive to p reduction from central lake taihu psci values 0 5 for jinshu were low implying that p in jinshu were insensitive to p reduction from central lake taihu internal p loading from sediment and external p loading from wangyu river and central lake taihu were critical p sources influencing tp in drinking water intakes the psci values for external p loading were generally high in their river bay mouth areas the psci values for internal p loading were high in their coastal area however the psci values for internal p loading were considerably high implying that considerable contribution of internal p loading to surface water in drinking water intakes 3 2 2 contribution of each phosphorus source to drinking water intakes our comparison between internal and external p loading along drink water intakes showed that central lake taihu was dominated contribution 49 5 for jinshu 68 3 for shangshan and internal p loading was subdominant contribution 47 1 for jinshu 30 4 for shangshan for drinking water intakes fig 6 however contributions were different for two drinking water intakes with different environmental conditions for example jinshu is closed to mouth area of wangyu river while shangshan is closed to central lake taihu contributions in shangshan were sensitive to changes of wind directions that even result in changing the magnitude of the contribution from wangyu river however the above mentioned impact did not occur in jinshu 4 discussion 4 1 why internal loading explain excess phosphorus in two drinking water intakes our modelling results revealed a dominated contribution from both central lake taihu and internal p loading from sediment in two drinking water intakes fig 6 there was a large amount of water exchange between central lake taihu and gonghu bay therefore it is not surprising that central lake taihu had a large p contribution to the drinking water intakes although such a large contribution internal p loading was unexpected we argued it is convincible with several evidences reported in previous publications xu et al 2021 1 decades of high p loading resulted in an excess p in lake sediment implying a large internal p loading the increasing studies worldwide revealed that severe internal loading was caused by long term excessive nitrogen n and p paytan et al 2017 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2021 yin et al 2021 in lake taihu eutrophication had lasted 41 years with intensive external p loading qin et al 2007 implying a rich n p storage in sediments qin et al 2019 such rich p storage in sediment and thus large internal p loading has been confirmed by several previous studies via experiment qin et al 2019 wen et al 2020 xu et al 2021 our results were consistent with many previous studies that revealed a large contribution of internal p loading in the total p loading especially under the strict control of external loading table s3 the dynamic of internal p loading in drinking water intakes under different wind directions fig 5 b and e were consistent with recent studies that the rate of sediment releasing could vary monthly and seasonally spears et al 2012 2 continuing high external p loading from inflow rivers e g wangyu enhanced internal p loading in recent years an estimated value of annually external total p loading for lake taihu was 1 8 2 6 106 kg y 1 through 200 inflow rivers wang et al 2019 xu et al 2015 such large amount of external p would resulted in substantial settling of particulate p because water velocity in the lake water 10 30 cm s is lower than the wangyu river 30 cm s estimated by the water discharge in figure s1 qin et al 2007 in particularly in the central area of gonghu bay the water velocity is lower than that in the littoral area fig 7 li et al 2011 although p loading carried by wangyu river and central lake taihu was lower than many other inflow rivers external p loading would also enhance internal p loading because 63 75 of external p loading retained in the lake qin et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 sediment releasing in the p heavily settling zones was promoted after water transfer spears et al 2008 although external loading had been reduced internal p loading that accumulated due to historical p loading could delay lake recovery for approximately a decade in the lake jarvie et al 2013 søndergaard et al 2013 p had a long residence time in lakes because it was lost via outflows and lacked a gaseous phase xu et al 2021 a water residence time of 284 d in lake taihu minimized p losses by flushing and maximized p retention huang et al 2017 although sediment p exchange was a net sink on an annual scale in lake taihu xu et al 2021 sediment was only an intermediate storage to affect p loading in drinking water intakes these sediment p actually came from historical p accumulation by inflow rivers of lake taihu qin et al 2019 3 high internal p loading was triggered by high wind conditions e g cyclones particulate p was prone to re suspend into the water column due to water disturbances by wind driving force and sediment resuspension had a high relationship with wind speed in shallow lakes tang et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 the difference of critical wind speed for sediment resuspension in the different lake was caused by sediment properties aquatic vegetation lake morphology qin et al 2019 this framework applied a threshold wind speed of 4 m s that suspension of sediment as constant wind speed to simulate the internal p loading under dominant wind directions northwest and southeast in drinking water intakes qin et al 2003 tang et al 2020 meanwhile the increasing number of case studies showed that re suspended solid concentration in the surface layer was estimated in the ranges of 16 6 220 1 mg l as wind field experienced changing ranges 0 8 1 m s tang et al 2020 additionally the result in previous studies showed that the average concentration of dissolved p in the whole lake taihu was 0 021 mg l in case that wind speed was 5 m s huang et al 2016 the higher ratio of particulate p was the inevitable result of the frequent resuspension of sediment in drinking water intakes this result was consistent with previous studies revealed that particulate p was the main form of p in lake taihu zhu et al 2021 4 2 how can we control phosphorus of drinking water intakes in water management practice 1 an accurate p source tracking would be helpful to identify the hot spots and hot moments for high p qualitative analysis was generally used to determine different p sources for a whole lake system however our investigation results showed that p sources of two drinking water intakes with a short distance had significant differences fig 5 the psci maps for three p sources fig 5 revealed that hot spots for drinking water intakes in lake taihu internal p loading abatement should give first priority however the large spatial variations of psci maps fig 5 implied that the hot spots of external loading depended on the target areas to alleviate excess p in jinshu reducing external p loading from wangyu river was important however to control excess p in shangshan reducing external p loading from central lake taihu was most important the psci maps for external p loading from central lake taihu revealed that hot moments for shangshan was summer fig 5 because of the prevailing southeast winds in summer however it is important to note that such qualitative analysis has more or less uncertainty in management practice it is necessary to carry out accurate quantitative analysis of p sources especially in highly concerned areas 2 external p loading should be well controlled to achieve a low internal p loading in these two drinking water intakes although our study revealed an extremely large contribution of internal p loading this does not mean that it is not important to control external p loading in contrast a strategy that simply controlling internal p loading was not adequate to reduce tp in these two drinking water intakes in case that the internal loading had been well controlled external loading need more attentions submerged vegetation restoration and bio manipulation of fishery can be a potential option to fight against high tp before water entering into lakes mao et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 3 the large contribution of internal p loading from sediment implied a delayed effect of external p control on tp reduction of these two drinking water intakes controlling external p loading was difficult to reduce tp concentration in a short time in drinking water intakes of lake taihu considering the high cost of sediment dredging 12 5 15 0 m2 lürling and faassen 2012 van oosterhout and lürling 2011 sediment dredging was generally partly implemented in areas with high internal loading this was the reason why tp control had been carried out for 13 years in three lakes lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu council 2008 while harmful algal blooms had continued to have a considerable magnitude in recent years huang et al 2020 therefore management practice of ecological restoration should be carried out enclosures were set to reduce the water velocity by investigating conditions of lake morphology and hydrology huang and liu 2009 macrophytes were restored by artificial cultivation that absorbed nutrients including p from sediment and inhibited the resuspension of sediment it was an effective pathway to self purification of shallow lakes qin et al 2020a 4 3 what is the advantages of the framework in tracking phosphorus sources 1 compared with experimental methods the modelling framework provides us an avenue to quantify p source contribution in a complex lake ecosystem experimental methods provided excellent avenue for investigating a single process e g sediment releasing and resuspension but could not quantify the contribution of multiple processes in a complex ecosystem however the modelling framework considered various processes including sediment water interface water transfer from wangyu river water exchange from central lake taihu compared with the existing studies on tracking p sources at watershed scale table s4 lake scale model tracking phosphorus sources mainly focused on phosphorus mass balance schauser and chorus 2009 our modelling framework not only focused on tracking phosphorus sources in lake scale but also paid more attention on these areas e g drinking water intakes should be highly concerned in the emergency management of nutrients in lake taihu 2 the framework based on a well validation model was able to predict the response of tp in drinking water intakes to management strategies the modelling framework analyzed tp sources by designing a series of simulation scenarios however determining the contribution of p sources is still challenging the framework accurately evaluated contribution of p sources economic cost was saved in pollution control through determining contribution of p sources in water drinking intakes although used in tp sources tracking this framework was transferable to predict other management scenarios including but not limited to wetland construction and macrophyte restoration 3 the developed framework for tracking p source can be easily transferred to other large eutrophic lakes based on efdc the framework was generic and therefore should be readily transferable to other large shallow lakes for example it is transferable to track other water quality variables efdc has been widely used in various aquatic ecosystems huang et al 2018 tang et al 2021 and this framework can thus inherit the strengths of efdc in its wide application 5 conclusions to address the challenge of tracking p source for a specific site in a large lake a modelling framework was proposed and applied in two drinking water intakes jinshu and shangshan in lake taihu our investigation revealed that internal p loading from sediment was a large p source for these two drinking water intakes with a contribution as high as 47 1 and 30 4 respectively central lake taihu had a high contribution of 49 5 and 68 3 for jinshu and shangsha while inflow river wangyu river had a limited contribution of 5 these results implied that different specific sites even with a short distance resulted in different p source contribution due to the complex hydrodynamic and p cycling our study highlighted the important role of internal p loading affecting the p concentration of drinking water intake in a large eutrophic lake given that external p is a p source for internal p both internal and external p should be well controlled via corresponding strategies e g macrophyte restoration and reducing inflow tp concentration to achieve a tp reduction in water management

3609,in recent decades water levels in many closed inland lakes over north western china experienced severe declines among which the daihai lake in inner mongolia china was particularly significant remotely sensed investigations indicated that the daihai lake had shrunk approximately 64 in an area with the dramatic decline of water level approximately 9 m from the 1980 s to 2010 s which has caused serious concern on the sustainable development of the surrounding region consequently several previous studies have concentrated on the possible causes of lake shrinkage however predicting climate variability and anthropogenic activities relative contributions to lake water decline is challenging due to the lack of direct water consumption upstream and watershed scale natural runoff observations in this paper a hydrological modeling approach was presented to quantitatively evaluate and separate the relative contributions of climate variations and intensifying anthropogenic activities the simulation accuracy was evaluated through comparisons with observed data and cross validation with previous studies based on a baseline period the natural streamflow draining into the lake was reconstructed using the model the results revealed that the water loss of the daihai lake was caused predominately by human activities rather than climate variability specifically for wet conditions the climate factors posed a negative effect on the water level decline of the lake and delayed the shrinking process of the lake area the anthropogenic factors took a dominant role roughly 58 of lake shrinkage at the annual average scale for normal and dry conditions while the climate factors accounted for approximately 42 hence the rational policy for water resource management ecological restoration and dam and reservoir constructions operations should be the essential precautions for sustainable development of the daihai lake and its surroundings additionally the hydrological modeling approach adopted in this investigation serves as a useful example of the quantitative assessment of climate variations and human activities especially for the ungauged catchments

closed inland lakes are vulnerable to human induced climate changes turner et al 2010 in recent decades accelerated global climate changes and enhanced anthropogenic activities have posed severe threats to the living environments of all the creatures over this blue planet chen et al 2022 gao et al 2020 under the heavy influence of these combined threats many closed inland lakes in china have shrunk sharply or disappeared wang and sun 2007 seriously affecting the sustainable socio economic development of those ecologically fragile areas in north western china inner mongolia china is in the arid semi arid transition zone with fragile ecosystems the unique characteristics of the interlaced nomadic with agricultural civilization make it the most sensitive and typical region responding to global climate changes as a typical closed inland lake of inner mongolia the daihai lake has continued shrinking in recent decades fig 1 remotely sensed information revealed the area of the lake has reduced by 64 from 148 34 km2 to 53 63 km2 during the 1980 s 2010 s period zhao and guo 2014 this phenomenon sounded the alarm on the lake s ecosystem and its surroundings meanwhile attracted extensive concerns from various communities of the national and local authorities chinese government leaders have emphasized the importance of comprehensive ecological management in the daihai lake since 2018 the local government has also proposed restoring the water level of the daihai lake through corresponding water replenishment measures and water transfer projects wang et al 2019 understanding the causes resulting in lake s shrinkage through quantitatively evaluating the contributions of the climatic and anthropogenic factors thus becomes an urgent issue towards the purpose in terms of long term lake level variations changes in lake inflow outflow evaporation and precipitation are all possible driving factors numerous approaches have been utilized to evaluate and separate the relative contributions of climate variations and intensifying anthropogenic activities dey and mishra 2017 these methods can be categorized as experimental approaches including paired catchment method and time trend method zhang et al 2012 conceptual approaches including applications of budyko s hypothesis liang et al 2013a and tomer schilling framework method tomer and schilling 2009 analytical approaches including climate elasticity method yang and yang 2011 and hydrological sensitivity method guo et al 2014 and hydrological modeling li et al 2009 these different methods provide different insights about the methodologies to separate the relative contributions along with their advantages and shortcomings the conceptual and analytical approaches are somehow physically based with certain mathematical theoretical support and less data needed for quantitative assessment dey and mishra 2017 nevertheless both approaches cannot consider the hydrological processes compared with hydrological simulations besides both approaches focus on the change of lake inflow to separate the relative influence of climate changes and human activities without considering the effects of evaporation and precipitation within the lake and their catchment upon the change of the lake s surface zhang et al 2020 in the case of an inland closed lake the hydrological modeling method considers the lake and its drainage area as a single catchment and the lake catchment relationship is comprehensively studied taking the contributions of all driving factors to the lake changes into account in this pursuit the present study envisaged quantitatively calculating the impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the change in lake water volume by using the hydrological modeling method based on hydrological models the variations of lake water volume caused by climate changes are propagated from the total lake water volume variations and the margin is considered as the influence of anthropogenic factors zhang et al 2020 however some uncertainties do exist in many hydrological models remotely sensed information integrated with hydrological models becomes the frontier and hotspot of lake hydrological studies chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 the present study aimed to examine further the key processes controlling the lake water level variations from 1960 to 2018 meanwhile a quantitative scheme to assess the impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors was developed on the water level decline of the daihai lake a well validated distributed hydrological model essi 3 was adopted to assess the spatial temporal changes of the lake hydrological regimes combined with the lulc transformation matrix within the lake watershed in the corresponding duration the comprehensive analysis enabled us to conduct joint data analyses across the lake and lake watershed scales benefited from the multi source data from both ground observed and remotely sensed in association with distributed hydrological simulations the present study aimed to 1 explore the primary cause that resulted in water level decline of the lake and clarify the key driving factors responsible for the imbalanced lake water budgets in recent decades 2 identify the climatic variations over the lake watershed and its effects on the shrinkage of the daihai lake 3 isolate impacts of the simulated hydrological processes relative to climate variability and lulc changes with two rigorously developed simulation scenarios and 4 quantify anthropogenic and climatic effects on the shrinking of the daihai lake the final goal of this study is to respond to the urgent concerns and some essential issues brought by the persistent water lever decline of the lake and the eco environment degradations over the lake watershed in recent decades 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area daihai lake 112 33 112 46 e 40 28 40 37 n located in a closed intermountain basin as presented in fig 1 is a typical rainfall naturally supplied type inland closed lake administratively belongs to the liangcheng county of the inner mongolia autonomous region china the long term lake water area is about 53 63 km2 in average with a water depth of about 5 6 m and the maximum water depth recorded was approximately 12 m in 2018 surrounding the lake the lake watershed covers approximately 2304 km2 with 519 000 000 m3 water storage the broad plain with low mountains and hills spreads out over the north western and south eastern sides of the lake watershed water supply to the lake mainly comes from streamflow discharge and precipitation among which the streamflow discharge from seasonal rivers in the nearby area takes into account the predominant part chen et al 2011 climatically the daihai lake watershed is located on the northwest margin of the east asian monsoon spans the transition zone of climate between semi humid and semi arid liang et al 2017 where the winter is long and cold and the summer is short and warm the annual mean temperature is approximately 5 9 c with the recorded extremely high temperature about 39 3 c in summer and the extremely low temperature about 34 5 c in winter precipitation is distributed unevenly throughout the year and mainly concentrates from june to september the lake watershed average annual precipitation is only in 397 1 mm but the lake watershed average annual evaporation achieves about 1962 mm the annual mean sunshine hours are about 3000 h and the annual mean wind speed is approximately 2 6 m s with the predominant wind directions towards west and northwest according to the annual mean water level recorded at the sansumu hydrological station in the daihai lake watershed in the past 60 years significant and persistent decline with periodical fluctuations of water level of the lake can be observed the peak water level of the lake lasted for more than ten years with fluctuations in the 1960 s and the water level began to decrease after the 1970 s in recent decades the water level of the daihai lake has persistently kept decreasing trend 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data the daily meteorological data from four national meteorological stations station id 53463 53478 53 480 and 53487 and one local meteorological station liangcheng station were downloaded from china meteorological administration website http data cma cn including daily precipitation daily mean temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration from 1960 to 2018 the daily precipitation and evaporation data measured at the sansumu station which was located less than 1 km from the north western shoreline of the lake were also obtained during the study period the precipitation and evaporation measured at this station can represent the precipitation and evaporation for the lake s surface the 20 cm pan was used for evaporation measurement and the coefficient 0 58 cao et al 2002 sun et al 2005 was used to convert evaporation from 20 cm pan to evaporation from lake water surface besides the time series of the lake water level and surface area of the daihai lake at the annual scale were also collected based on the previous studies cao et al 2002 sun et al 2005 wang et al 2019 the source and accuracy of this data were unclear as the details of the measurements were unknown the previous studies reported that the lake area data were most likely estimated from the statistical relationship between the water level and the lake s surface area cao et al 2002 sun et al 2005 although the lake water level and lake area data at seasonal scale were not available several landsat imageries were collected to obtain the lake area data at seasonal scale considering the imageries availability cloud interference and time costs the landsat imageries from 2000 to 2018 were collected and selected on the same day of each month in different years as many as possible the lake boundaries were vectorized by visual interpretation and the surface area data of the lake at seasonal scale from 2000 to 2018 were extracted finally 2 3 lake water balance lake water budget is defined as the balance between inflows and outflows to an enclosed inland lake jeong et al 2014 woldemichael et al 2012 the water storage change δv of an enclosed lake can be estimated with water balance equation at an annual time interval 1 p r g i e g o w δ v where p r gi e go and w represents precipitation directly into the lake streamflow into the lake groundwater leakage into the lake evaporation from the lake groundwater outflow from the lake and water consumption by anthropogenic activities respectively for the lake water budget estimation the groundwater leakage and outflow are the most difficult components to determine castle et al 2016 mohebzadeh and fallah 2019 both two components are usually estimated with groundwater model combined with groundwater observations however great uncertainty and difficulties are involved in the estimation chen et al 2019b for the daihai lake the mineral concentration of lake water was high so the contributions of groundwater leakage from the wall and the bottom of the lake are minor and its effect on δv can be ignored cao et al 2002 huang and jiang 1999 sun et al 2005 in addition no lake water consumption for any purpose was recorded net groundwater flow gi go and w can be ignored eq 1 thus can be simplified to 2 p r e δ v the empirical approach used to estimate the lake water storage variation includes estimation based on the relationship between the lake water level and the lake area or estimation from underwater topography zhang et al 2011 in this study lake water storage variation δv was estimated as below 3 δ v 1 3 h 2 h 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where h1 h2 represents the lake water surface elevation at two different measurement time respectively a1 a2 is the lake water surface area at two corresponding measurement time accordingly by equation 3 the total δv of each year was obtained in terms of million cubic meters in order to calculate the corresponding precipitation and evaporation over the lake area the observed precipitation and evaporation for the lake area were multiplied by the area of the daihai lake to obtain yearly total p and e in terms of million cubic meters in terms of the lake inflows r the lake received both groundwater discharge and surface flows in the form of river discharges however no streamflow monitoring gauges were installed in the catchment estimation of catchment discharge was a fundamental step in the water balance analysis of the lake in order to characterize the catchment hydrology and quantitatively evaluate the impacts of climate changes and anthropogenic activities on the lake a revised distributed hydrological model essi 3 was used to assess the r taking into account transport pathways through the lake catchment 2 4 the water storage and hydrological processes of the lake watershed simulated by the distributed hydrological model essi 3 a revised distributed hydrological model essi 3 based on an integration of surface and subsurface domains was adopted to adequately represent of the lake catchment s hydrology and capture spatial and temporal variability the original distributed hydrological model essi described watershed hydrology as 1 d fluxes the precipitation was first partitioned into the canopy intercepted part and the left part fell to the ground surface the effective precipitation was partitioned into direct runoff and the remained further infiltrated into deep soils partly and flowed into the channel zhang and zhang 2006 chen 2020 one significant characteristic of the model was its capability of describing both infiltration and saturation excess water yielding mechanism according to the spatial and temporal variations of rainfall intensity as well as the underlying condition of the surface atmospheric interface recently modifications were made to the previous essi model versions and the detailed improvements please referred to chen 2019 2020 the following processes of the essi 3 model were presumed to be essential for adequate representation of the lake s catchment behavior canopy interception evapotranspiration soil water storage groundwater storage surface runoff interflow base flow and groundwater recharge in short a three layer soil water balance module was used to simulate discharge and water exchange in soil water storage over the vertical soil column a first order linear reservoir approach was used to model groundwater storage and discharge which improved the spatial heterogeneity and inhibited the uncertainties in the simulation of hydrologic processes surface and subsurface flows were coupled via the third soil layer and the surface and subsurface domains were discretized into the same grid of rectangular cells the lake catchment was discretized and delineated into ten small sub watersheds fig 2 and each watershed had three main components the overland river and flow sink output grids for each overland grid the runoff outputs from model including total specific runoff consisting of saturation excess surface runoff surface runoff runoff from the third soil reservoir interflow and groundwater runoff from the lowest reservoir baseflow were defined as river discharges draining into lake among which the baseflow represented groundwater discharge to rivers the river grids represented river networks and the flow sink output grids defined the flow sink outlets of these sub watersheds soil parameters determine soil s capability to regulate hydrological flux and reserves vegetation ecological parameters also need to be calibrated when considering canopy interception evaporation transpiration and surface energy balance chen 2020 the soil and vegetation parameters were commonly parameterized by parameter lookup tables based on land cover types for the normal hydrological models and community land models one significant advantage of the essi 3 model was using many global or regional oriented spatio temporal soil characteristic parameter products and vegetation parameter products to drive the model based on the soilgrids datasets hengl et al 2017 and the pedotransfer functions dai et al 2013 the soil parameters required for model driving were calculated such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat the saturated water content θsat the field capacity θfca and the permanent wilting point θpwp besides remote sensing based datasets like leaf area index liang et al 2013b were used to calibrate the vegetation parameters thereby the essi 3 model benefits the reliable quantifications of the influence of underlying surfaces and climate changes for the hydrological regime of the daihai lake watershed to set up an essi 3 model table 1 listed the necessary datasets for driving the model together with the accessible website for free downloading these specific datasets the data type spatial temporal resolutions and duration of the datasets used for the study model simulation was carried out at 90 m 90 m resolution for the period from 1960 to 2018 using the first two years as a warm up period to allow key model states such as groundwater aquifers to reach equilibrium it should be noted that as multi spatial resolutions exist for the input gridded datasets appropriate interpolation approaches were adopted to upscale or downscale the various datasets to a consistent spatial resolution the simplest method to downscale the climate forecasts from a coarse grid to a finer grid is to utilize the bilinear interpolation method chao et al 2018 gao et al 2022 so the bilinear interpolation method was used to upscale or downscale the meteorological data soil characteristic parameter products and vegetation parameter products the hydrological model is usually validated by using hydrometric stations however when discharge data are not available the observed evaporation data is an alternative solution for validation senent aparicio et al 2021 this study used the monthly observed evaporation data from 1960 to 2018 to validate the essi 3 model the model performance was evaluated by commonly used two criteria i e the correlation coefficient r2 and the nash sutcliff efficiency nse liu et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 through the reasonable establishment of model modules the application of a variety of remote sensing data and the validation of evaporation data the simulation of runoff generation process can provide an encouraging qualitative assessment of the lake hydrology however the uncertainty of runoff prediction also comes from the calibration of the empirical parameters of the flow converging process e g clag of streamflow routing a manual trial error method was carried out to calibrate the flow converging parameters for further confidence in the model s results specifically a baseline period with little impact of human activities was defined the baseline period was commonly divided based on the human designated method and the abrupt change method schilling et al 2008 no matter which method was used to define the baseline period the results obtained had a certain uncertainty the observed streamflow during this baseline period was calculated and regarded as the natural river discharge the simulated streamflow was calibrated by comparing with the observed streamflow during the baseline period in the manual trial error process values for the relative volume error zhou et al 2021 should be smaller than 5 or 5 while r2 and nse should be higher than 0 8 then the best fit flow converging parameter sets can be determined 2 5 drought analysis to better understand the lake s dynamics the dry and wet conditions of the lake watershed were analyzed the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are the most popularized drought indices the pdsi is based on a simplified water balance with input parameters of precipitation runoff moisture supply and evaporation however the pdsi cannot identify drought for different timescales and many parameters are required to calculate the index the spi is a simplified index that can detect drought at different time scales but it only incorporates precipitation to calculate the drought index while other factors such as temperature are assumed to be stationary the spei is a relatively new drought index that combines the advantages of spi with temperature variability it was proposed as convenient for drought monitoring and analysis under climate changes and can also identify drought at different time scales like the spi continuously negative spei values define a drought period based on intensity severity magnitude and duration however no definite thresholds for the spei values and associated drought conditions were presented by vicente serrano et al 2010 in this study we classified spei values with the thresholds suggested by mckee et al 1993 the speis were calculated with the time series of historical precipitation and temperature data at the predefined time scales i e 1 month 3 month 6 month 9 month 12 month and 24 month respectively positive speis and negative speis indicate wet conditions and dry conditions respectively the higher the positive spei the more wet condition in the studied period vise a versa relatively high negative deviations characterize the drought periods a drought event starts when spei value reaches 1 0 and ends when spi becomes positive again normally the drought period characterized by the range of speis is arbitrary split into moderately dry 1 0 spei 1 49 severely dry 1 5 spei 1 99 and extremely dry conditions spei 2 0 for a detailed description of the calculation procedure please refer to vicente serrano et al 2010 2 6 quantifying the contribution of climatic and anthropogenic factors climate changes and anthropogenic activities are the two important drivers for lake water storage changes accordingly three concepts need to be discriminated and clarified for the relative contributions of climate changes and anthropogenic activities the first one is to precisely define the factors of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on the change of lake water storage in this paper the impact of climatic factors primarily refers to the variation of precipitation and evaporation into the lake s surface and the variation in streamflow caused by climate changes the impact of anthropogenic activities on the daihai lake mainly focuses on runoff response to lulc changes and the direct water consumption upstream including the residential industrial irrigational and agricultural water consumption and reservoir interception the second concept is to explicitly define the mathematical expression of the relative contribution under climate changes and anthropogenic activities in this paper the lake water loss δw caused by climate changes and anthropogenic activities can be expressed as 4 δ w δ w c δ w h where δwc and δwh is the lake water loss resulting from climate changes and anthropogenic activities respectively the relative contributions of δwc and δwh can be approximately estimated as follows 5 c c δ w c δ w c δ w h δ w p δ w e δ w r δ w c δ w h 100 6 c h δ w h δ w h δ w h δ w lulc δ w h δ w c δ w h 100 where cc and ch is the relative contribution of climate changes and anthropogenic activities on the lake water loss respectively δwp and δwe is the water loss caused by precipitation and evaporation into the lake s surface respectively δwr is the water loss caused by natural streamflow under climate changes δwlulc and δwh is the water loss caused by the lulc changes and the direct water consumption upstream respectively after the baseline period is defined the water loss caused by climate changes and anthropogenic activities can be calculated for each year in theory the values of variables mentioned above can be either positive or negative for consistency positive and negative values are used to label water loss and water surplus respectively obviously eq 5 and 6 make mathematical sense only when both δwc and δwh values are positive the third concept clarifies the difference between the simulated river discharges by essi 3 model and the calculated river discharges based on the lake water balance eq 2 the simulated river discharges by essi 3 model represent the natural streamflow under current meteorological observations and dynamic lulc conditions the essi 3 model also set up the other control scenario produced by using current meteorological observations and constant lulc conditions as inputs focused on the modification of lulc the present study investigates the partial impact of anthropogenic activities on hydrological processes based on the eq 2 the calculated streamflow is the part of natural runoff after water withdrawals from upstream rather than the total natural runoff generated by metero hydrological conditions therefore the difference between the simulated and calculated streamflow is considered as the direct water consumption upstream 3 results and discussions 3 1 hydrologic cycle within the lake watershed fig 3 presented the annual variations of water budget terms along with climate variables in the past several decades including the lake water level variations a annual precipitation b and annual evaporation c over the lake watershed in the past six decades two phases in lake water level variations can be recognized 1 natural fluctuation of lake water level from 1960 to 1973 with an average lake water level of approximately 989 68 m a s l close to the six decade average of 986 54 m a s l 2 insistent decline of lake water level from 1974 to 2018 the lake water level had fallen from 989 17 m a s l in 1974 to 979 25 m a s l in 2018 the average decline rate over the last six decades was approximately 0 23 m yr fig 3b exhibited that precipitation fluctuation of the lake region was relatively stable along average over the last six decades the mann kendall test suggested that the annual precipitation decreased slightly on average with non significant fluctuations from 1960 to 2018 however the evaporation data fig 3c exhibited an apparent decreasing trend over the lake surface from 1960 to 2018 the annual lake surface evaporation for the two periods of 1960 1973 and 1974 2018 were 964 71 and 872 55 mm yr respectively while the six decadal annual mean evaporation was approximately 894 42 mm yr it was noted from fig 4 a that the annual mean temperature had increased over the lake region but the evaporation mm tended to decrease obviously actually changes in temperature and other climate parameters caused changes in evapotranspiration therefore the critical drivers for evaporation changes in lake were investigated among the available climatic parameters annual and seasonal temperature relative humidity wind speed air pressure and sunshine duration in the lake region was presented in fig 4 a b c d and e respectively as shown in fig 4a the annual temperature exhibited an increasing trend with a six decadal average temperature of about 5 02 c characterizing one relatively cold period from 1960 to 1987 with an annual mean temperature of about 4 45 c and the following relatively warm period from 1987 to 2018 with annual mean temperature of about 5 53 c the annual mean temperature for about 24 years out of the 28 years cold period was below the six decadal average while the annual mean temperature for about 25 years out of over 31 years warm period was higher than the six decadal average the mann kendall test on temperature variations revealed a positive and significant increasing trend the average temperature increased about 0 51 per 10 years at the 5 significance levels which is faster than the average increase rate around 0 23 per 10 years for china chen et al 2019a according to the latest report from intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc no significant correlation was found between temperature and precipitation over the daihai lake as shown in fig 4b the annual mean relative humidity was stable during the cold period with an average value of 51 5 but a consecutively declining trend occurred after 2000 similarly the wind speed during the cold period was higher than the six decadal average of 2 87 m s with a mean value of 0 67 m s above the average as presented in fig 4c however the wind speed started to decrease since the 1980 s with an average of about 2 26 m s the annual mean air pressure fig 4d and sunshine duration fig 4e fluctuated over the six decade with a mean value of 857 pa and 7 9 h day respectively several potential causes for the lake evaporation variations existed and their effects are changing with time at annual seasonal and diurnal scales and with each other co variations table 2 listed the correlation analysis of the annual lake surface evaporation against the annual temperature relative humidity wind speed air pressure and sunshine duration a relatively high correlation between lake surface evaporation and wind speed in recent years suggested that the vital factor of lake evaporation variations was wind speed which had been confirmed in many other studies ito and momii 2021 lake evaporation was largely governed by the magnitude of the vapor pressure gradient between the water surface and the overlying air friedrich et al 2018 in this study the declining wind speeds at the annual scale led to a decrease in lake evaporation by reducing the evaporation rate to better understand the possible causes responsible for the lake area variations the effects of climate changes on the lake at seasonal scale were investigated seasonal lake area precipitation evaporation average temperature max temperature and min temperature in the lake region were presented in fig 5 a b c d e and f respectively as shown in fig 5a the lake area at seasonal scale started to decrease after the peak evaporation of a year in may see fig 5c while the average max and min temperature at seasonal scale reached the maximum in july relative longer sunshine duration with high wind speed was highly correlated with strong evaporation in may of a year see fig 4c and fig 4e when the precipitation reached its peak value in july of a year see fig 5b the shrinking of the lake area slowed down and the lake area gradually increased in august these phenomena revealed the effect of climate changes on the lake at seasonal scale however fig 4a exhibited that the average lake area was the largest in january but the smallest in december the continued shrinkage of the lake area at inter annual scale suggested no significant correlation existed with the climatic changes as shown in figs 3 4 and 5 climate factors cannot reasonably interpret the shrinkage of the lake surface alone at either annual or seasonal scale therefore speis calculated for the study area were used to explain climate conditions and their effects on droughts over daihai lake fig 6 presented the spei variations at the time scale of 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month for the study area drought episodes inferred from spei at the 24 month timescale as listed in table 3 revealed five periods of drought from 1966 to 1967 1987 to 1988 1994 to 1995 1998 to 2003 and 2006 to 2012 corresponding to dry episodes from 1966 to 1967 1987 to 1988 and 2001 to 2003 precipitation and river flows supplied to the daihai lake decreased obviously however the lake water level yet presented a continued decreasing trend for normal and wet climate conditions such as for the period from 1995 to 1998 2004 to 2006 and 2012 to 2015 moreover the spei results at other timescales followed the same trend as the results with spei at the 24 month timescale the drought episodes referred from spei values were also failed to explain the role of climate factors in the shrinkage of the daihai lake according to the lake water level changes and climate variable fluctuations recorded in the study area the precipitation basically remained unchanged and the evaporation had a general trend of decreasing from the past six decades however the daihai lake water level experienced substantial decreases which was against the water budget theory in a closed inland lake watershed since the daihai lake was an inland closed lake there was no water drawn from the lake for any other purpose and evaporation was the only output component for fulfilling the eq 2 the r should remain decreasing which implies that the major reason for lake water level decline was a continuous decrease of water inflow into the lake as no streamflow monitoring gauges were installed in the catchment the distributed model simulation approach was the only effective alternative to understand the hydrological processes of streamflow into the lake 3 2 the essi 3 model performance the hydrological processes of the daihai lake watershed were simulated with a distributed hydrological model essi 3 chen and zhang 2019 before using the simulated results for further studies the simulated results for these hydrological processes and relevant fluxes with essi 3 were checked and evaluated firstly the fluxes of the runoff generation process were checked and monthly evaporation was chosen to test the model s performance the simulated evaporation esim by essi 3 distributed hydrological model at the location of sansumu station was extracted and compared with the observed monthly evaporation measured at the station eobs as exhibited in fig 7 validation of the monthly time series of esim against eobs indicated the good performance of essi 3 model in simulation of evaporation measured by r2 and nse of about 0 91 and 0 90 at the sansumu station site for the observation period 1960 2018 respectively secondly the performance of runoff fluxes on the runoff generation process were tested based on a four mechanism based grid to grid routing schema that accumulates the arrival time of each upstream grid to its downstream outlet grid three main runoff components for every grid including surface runoff interflow and baseflow were simulated with the essi 3 model normally the observed and simulated daily and monthly discharges at hydrological stations were used to calibrate and validate the model however there were no available hydrological data for such purpose in the studied watershed in order to verify the runoff simulated by essi 3 model we assumed that the total runoff simulated from every grid of of the lake watershed could flow into the daihai lake then we used the simulated runoff to verify the temporal variations of the lake water storage by taking lake water budget into account fig 8 presented the observed and the simulated lake water storage at annual scale over the past six decades the yearly observed lake water storage δvobs was calculated by lake water level multiplied by the lake area based on eq 3 and the simulated lake water storage δvsim was estimated by the observed evaporation precipitation into lake surface and the simulated runoff as shown in fig 6 the trend of yearly observed lake water storage was simulated with accuracy with r value of 0 78 for the whole simulation period 1960 2018 however significant numerical difference between δvobs and δvsim existed with a poor nse value of 1 87 the reason for the difference was that the simulated runoff fluxes used here were the original data of the runoff generation process water loss of the flow converging process had not been considered due to the lack of observed streamflow data thirdly auxiliary data and results regarding the study watershed s hydrological data from published literature were also collected for cross validation the investigation on water resources of the daihai lake watershed for the 1980 s huang and jiang 1999 showed that the annual runoff of the daihai lake watershed was about 43 mm 50 mm and 55 mm in water depth for the eastern western and northern region respectively moreover according to their study the annual runoff was about 49 6 mm and the annual mean available runoff was about 283 mm in water depth for our simulated results the annual mean available runoff was about 205 mm for the 1980 s and the annual surface runoff and interflow was about 27 mm and 43 mm in water depth respectively indeed calibration and validation of streamflow is vital for evaluating the applicability of a hydrological model as an inland closed lake watershed streamflow from several perennial rivers and several seasonal rivers supply the lake making it difficult to calibrate and validate the process of river discharge due to lack of the observed streamflow data it should be noted that model simulation focused on re producing the longer term lake catchment behavior under natural status rather than attempting to mimic actual streamflow which were greatly influenced by the direct water consumption of upstream the above verification results implied the overall accuracy of the simulated results on the runoff generation process with the physically based distributed hydrological model essi 3 were reasonably approximate to the natural conditions furthermore compared to traditional watershed discharge observations the long term simulation results by essi 3 model could reflect water resource distributions at the spatial and temporal scales however the flow converging process of the model should be further checked and calibrated to better represent the long term hydrological process of lake catchments 3 3 the reconstruction of the natural streamflow according to previous studies huang and jiang 1999 and visiting local herders and households the daihai lake watershed started to extensive agricultural activities from 1975 s before 1975 s the daihai lake watershed was close to an area undisturbed by human activities as described previously the lake water level showed a natural fluctuation from 1960 to 1973 based on the human designated methods the baseline period from 1960 to 1973 was defined as a period undisturbed by human activities therefore the dynamics of lake water storage from 1960 to 1973 was considered as the natural state of the lake hydrological process then the simulated streamflow by the model was calibrated by using the actual river discharges during the baseline period the closed inland daihai lake catchments were delineated into 10 small sub watersheds as presented in fig 2 with arc hydro module of arcgis based on dem data and flow path networks the accumulation areas routing distance and routing times of every small watershed were set up with the same empirical parameters of the flow converging process the total streamflow into the lake from ten outlets of these sub watersheds were lumped together and were calibrated with the actual river discharges during the baseline period the best fit parameters of flow converging process for the long term rainfall runoff process in the closed inland daihai lake watershed were determined based on the manual trial error method and the new lake water storage changes were estimated and represented as δgvsim fig 9 plotted the δgvsim and δvobs during the calibration period the results suggested that the flow converging parameters were reliable with r2 of 0 84 and the nse of 0 81 therefore the dimensionless parameters were used for flow converging process during the whole period 1960 2018 and the annual lake water storage changes in the natural state were reconstructed fig 10 presented the estimated δgvsim and δvobs over the last 60 years the results indicated that the lake water storage changes adjusted with flow converging parameters were considered better matched to observations than the simulated results without calibrations therefore the estimated δgvsim can be considered approximately as lake water storage changes undisturbed by human activities and impacted by climate changes the δvobs represented lake water storage changes under climate changes and anthropogenic activities the good match between δgvsim and δvobs during the baseline period revealed that anthropogenic activities posed a limited influence on the daihai lake watershed region for this period nevertheless the insistently increasing discrepancy between δgvsim and δvobs after the 1980 s attributed to a combined effect of lulc changes and the increased water consumption upstream in this region moreover the discrepancy became especially larger in the water rich years such as the year 1973 1988 1995 2003 and 2013 this phenomenon probably implied that the flow converging parameters were unsuitable for the precipitation rich years due to the limited calibrations made to these years 3 4 runoff response to lulc changes fig 11 showed the annual series of surface runoff interflow and baseflow simulated by the essi 3 model over the lake watershed scale respectively the six decade average runoff was estimated approximately as 93 12 mm yr and the maximum annual runoff was taken place between 1994 and 1995 a relatively stable runoff period during1960s 1980 s followed by a somewhat fluctuating runoff period 1990 s 2010 s was observed during the fluctuating period the runoff showed a non significant decreasing trend except for the year 1995 2003 and 2013 which suggested a congruent trend to the precipitation of the period the runoff reduction over the dry period was found proportional to the reduction of precipitation rate and the increase of runoff during the wet period was also proportional to the increase of precipitation rate in the wet period the decrease of evaporation and the increase of precipitation and runoff over the lake watershed area in 1995 2003 and 2013 resulted in the decline rate of the lake water level slowed down obviously in the normal and dry period the low precipitation and runoff over the studied region made the lake water level in the continuous decreasing status in order to quantitatively estimate the contribution of lulc changes on watershed runoff the area of land use types for daihai lake watershed from 1967 to 2018 was counted based on remotely sensed information as shown in fig 12 over the inland enclosed daihe lake watershed grassland and cropland were the predominant land use types accounting for about 52 86 1219 02 km2 and 20 64 475 94 km2 of the lake watershed area respectively in 2018 the grassland changed to about 37 51 866 72 km2 and cropland turned to about 26 6 614 75 km2 in the total area of the lake watershed cropland increased rapidly from about 20 64 in 1967 to about 37 35 in 2000 in the total lake watershed area mainly were converted from grassland and wetland area of grassland wetland and water body remained decreased in area from 1967 to 2018 accounting for about 52 86 8 70 and 7 57 to 37 51 5 34 and 2 39 in the lake watershed area respectively from 1967 to 1998 area of woodland kept unchanged with about 9 occupation in the lake watershed area and increased rapidly from 2000 under the influence of the chinese government s policy about conversion of cropland to forest till 2018 woodland had increased to 23 97 occupation in the total area of the lake watershed with the economic and social development of the study region the build up land extended continually from areal occupation of about 1 25 to 4 19 within the past decades the period from 2000 to 2018 was a period of relatively drastic changes in land use types mainly characterizing the dramatic increase of forest area and the gradual decrease of cropland and grassland therefore the hydrological process variations associated with lulc changes from 2000 to 2018 were quantitatively investigated to rectify the affections of the lulc changes on hydrology of the daihai lake watershed simulation strategy was made to set up simulation scenarios of 1 distributed hydrological simulations from 2000 to 2018 with essi 3 driven by dynamic lulc dataset of 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 and 2 the same period of hydrological simulations driven by the fixed lulc data of 2000 fig 13 exhibited yearly runoff simulated by essi 3 model over the last 19 years under two scenarios mentioned above for simulation scenario 1 the annual mean surface runoff interflow and baseflow predicted was about 27 35 mm 41 05 mm and 21 80 mm respectively for the simulation scenario 2 these hydrological processes were approximately 27 37 mm 40 52 mm and 20 96 mm correspondingly the scenario 2 caused less than 1 increase in available runoff for the lake watershed compared to the scenario 1 this result suggested that the lulc changes posed very limited effects on the hydrological regimes of the lake watershed area and the climate changes are predominant in governing the changes of hydrologic processes of the watershed the question raised again how to explain the continuous decrease of water inflow into the lake the only possibility that remained was the anthropogenic effect specifically caused by the residential industrial irrigational and agricultural water consumption and reservoir interception which were needed for further analyses 3 5 quantifying the contributions of climatic and anthropogenic factors to lake water storage changes the decreases of the daihai lake water level in the past decades resulted from the decreased discharge inflow into the lake even in the precipitation rich years comprehensive analyses made in the former chapters had divided main factors that affected input discharge into two categories 1 anthropogenic factors such as agricultural irrigation water demand and reservoir interception and 2 climatic factors by climate variations since the 1970 s the irrigated area had increased rapidly with the irrigation facilities mainly used to exploit groundwater over the daihai lake watershed huang and jiang 1999 the irrigated area once reached about 18 395 hm2 at its peak time of 1998 and the groundwater was intensively exploited at meantime affected by the government policy of return the irrigated land to grass and forest land from 2000 the irrigated area over the study region began to decrease nevertheless yet remained around 13 000 hm2 since then with the economic reform movement of china started in the early 1980 s industrialization over the region also led to a gradually increased demand for groundwater exploitation additionally there are 11 small and medium sized reservoirs and 14 ponds in the daihai lake watershed the water surface area for these water bodies is about 840 km2 with total water storage of approximately 38 320 000 m3 the catchment area controlled by human accounts for about half of this region cao et al 2002 huang and jiang 1999 sun et al 2005 reservoir regulation cut off most of the region s river systems and thus dam affected rivers bear extensive water pressure dam changes the regional precipitation pattern especially the regional hydro climate and extreme precipitation which may be beneficial to the developments of regional and economy in the opposite direction of runoff hossain et al 2010 nilsson et al 2005 omer et al 2016 in general the water loss was affected by climate changes and anthropogenic activities among which anthropogenic activities were implemented mainly by various human induced water consumption and lulc changes on water loss could be ignored in this study the annual mean hydrological process variables simulated by essi 3 during the calibration period from 1960 to1973 were defined as baseline values the differences of the simulated hydrological processes relative to corresponding baseline values for each hydrological year investigated were calculated the relative contributions of anthropogenic and climatic factors on decreasing of the daihai lake for each hydrological year were presented in table 4 from table 4 it was observed for precipitation rich years such as the year 2013 the influence of climatic factors presented a negative effect for drying up of the lake in other words climatic factor delayed the decreasing process of the lake water level under the normal and dry climatic years both climatic and anthropogenic factors positively affected the decreasing of lake water levels among which climatic factors accelerated the decreasing process of the lake water level and the anthropogenic factor took major responsibility for lake shrinkage without considering the precipitation rich years the anthropogenic factor took responsibility for the lake shrinkage about 58 while the climatic factor took roughly about 42 therefore to recover daihai lake reforming the manner that water resources were used and managed detailing rules for the implementation of regulations on returning farmland to forests in the studied watershed should be the key in such an arid region 4 conclusion the severe recession of daihai lake in china had been widely reported in recent years and attracted extensive concerns from various communities of the national and local authorities in the absence of natural runoff and human induced water withdrawal observations predicting the relative contributions of climate changes and anthropogenic activities to lake water decline is challenging a hydrological modeling approach was proposed in this paper to address the above issues based on the combined use of a distributed hydrological model essi 3 remote sensing data and observed lake level and area data this research investigated the causes of lake variations and distinguished the relative contribution of climate changes and human activities on lake s recession following were the conclusions from the present study 1 hydro meteorological observations over the daihai lake watershed showed a continued decrease of the lake water level on an ongoing basis for recent decades which was mainly attributed to the decreased water inflow into the lake comprehensive analysis on temperature wind speed humidity and sunshine duration variations against pan evaporation over the recent decades suggested a good correlation between wind speed and evaporation detailed investigations suggested that the inflow to the lake was sensitive to changes in precipitation the annual and seasonal analysis between the lake hydrology and climate factors and the drought analysis inferred from spei studies indicated that the daihai lake was jointly affected by both anthropogenic and climatic factors and drought events had accelerated the lake shrinkage 2 through the reasonable establishment of model modules the integration of remote sensing data with the hydrological model the model provided an encouraging qualitative assessment of the lake hydrology the comparisons between the monthly observed and simulated evaporation data at the sansumu station showed high consistency with r2 and nse of about 0 91 and 0 90 respectively the trend of δvobs was well simulated by the un calibrated δvsim with r value of 0 78 the cross validation with previous studies also showed that the overall accuracy of the simulated results on the runoff generation process with the model were reasonably approximate to the natural conditions 3 due to the slight impact of human activities the period of 1960 1973 was adopted as the baseline the simulated streamflow was calibrated using the actual river discharges during the baseline period based on the manual trial error method the best fit parameters of the flow converging process were determined and the natural state s lake water storage changes were reconstructed the good match between δgvsim and δvobs with r2 of 0 84 and the nse of 0 81 suggested that the flow converging parameters were reliable 4 results from two comprehensively designed simulation scenarios indicated runoff response to lulc changes could be ignored the influence of climatic factors presented a negative effect for drying up the lake and delayed the decreasing process of the lake water level for wet conditions under the normal and dry climatic years both climatic and anthropogenic factors positively affected the decreasing of lake water levels among which climatic factors accelerated the decreasing process of the lake water level and the anthropogenic factors took major responsibility for lake shrinkage without considering the high water years the anthropogenic factor took responsibility for the lake shrinkage about 58 while the climatic factor took roughly about 42 in 1974 2018 this investigation will underpin the formulation of management strategies to maintain the lake s water balance additionally this investigation serves as a useful example of applying a distributed model to the assessment of lake hydrology especially for the lake catchments with limited observations although this research still suffers from certain uncertainties credit authorship

3609,in recent decades water levels in many closed inland lakes over north western china experienced severe declines among which the daihai lake in inner mongolia china was particularly significant remotely sensed investigations indicated that the daihai lake had shrunk approximately 64 in an area with the dramatic decline of water level approximately 9 m from the 1980 s to 2010 s which has caused serious concern on the sustainable development of the surrounding region consequently several previous studies have concentrated on the possible causes of lake shrinkage however predicting climate variability and anthropogenic activities relative contributions to lake water decline is challenging due to the lack of direct water consumption upstream and watershed scale natural runoff observations in this paper a hydrological modeling approach was presented to quantitatively evaluate and separate the relative contributions of climate variations and intensifying anthropogenic activities the simulation accuracy was evaluated through comparisons with observed data and cross validation with previous studies based on a baseline period the natural streamflow draining into the lake was reconstructed using the model the results revealed that the water loss of the daihai lake was caused predominately by human activities rather than climate variability specifically for wet conditions the climate factors posed a negative effect on the water level decline of the lake and delayed the shrinking process of the lake area the anthropogenic factors took a dominant role roughly 58 of lake shrinkage at the annual average scale for normal and dry conditions while the climate factors accounted for approximately 42 hence the rational policy for water resource management ecological restoration and dam and reservoir constructions operations should be the essential precautions for sustainable development of the daihai lake and its surroundings additionally the hydrological modeling approach adopted in this investigation serves as a useful example of the quantitative assessment of climate variations and human activities especially for the ungauged catchments keywords daihai lake lake water budget distributed hydrological model essi 3 anthropogenic and climatic factors the closed inland lake 1 introduction as an essential part of the inland hydrosphere the closed inland lakes are vulnerable to human induced climate changes turner et al 2010 in recent decades accelerated global climate changes and enhanced anthropogenic activities have posed severe threats to the living environments of all the creatures over this blue planet chen et al 2022 gao et al 2020 under the heavy influence of these combined threats many closed inland lakes in china have shrunk sharply or disappeared wang and sun 2007 seriously affecting the sustainable socio economic development of those ecologically fragile areas in north western china inner mongolia china is in the arid semi arid transition zone with fragile ecosystems the unique characteristics of the interlaced nomadic with agricultural civilization make it the most sensitive and typical region responding to global climate changes as a typical closed inland lake of inner mongolia the daihai lake has continued shrinking in recent decades fig 1 remotely sensed information revealed the area of the lake has reduced by 64 from 148 34 km2 to 53 63 km2 during the 1980 s 2010 s period zhao and guo 2014 this phenomenon sounded the alarm on the lake s ecosystem and its surroundings meanwhile attracted extensive concerns from various communities of the national and local authorities chinese government leaders have emphasized the importance of comprehensive ecological management in the daihai lake since 2018 the local government has also proposed restoring the water level of the daihai lake through corresponding water replenishment measures and water transfer projects wang et al 2019 understanding the causes resulting in lake s shrinkage through quantitatively evaluating the contributions of the climatic and anthropogenic factors thus becomes an urgent issue towards the purpose in terms of long term lake level variations changes in lake inflow outflow evaporation and precipitation are all possible driving factors numerous approaches have been utilized to evaluate and separate the relative contributions of climate variations and intensifying anthropogenic activities dey and mishra 2017 these methods can be categorized as experimental approaches including paired catchment method and time trend method zhang et al 2012 conceptual approaches including applications of budyko s hypothesis liang et al 2013a and tomer schilling framework method tomer and schilling 2009 analytical approaches including climate elasticity method yang and yang 2011 and hydrological sensitivity method guo et al 2014 and hydrological modeling li et al 2009 these different methods provide different insights about the methodologies to separate the relative contributions along with their advantages and shortcomings the conceptual and analytical approaches are somehow physically based with certain mathematical theoretical support and less data needed for quantitative assessment dey and mishra 2017 nevertheless both approaches cannot consider the hydrological processes compared with hydrological simulations besides both approaches focus on the change of lake inflow to separate the relative influence of climate changes and human activities without considering the effects of evaporation and precipitation within the lake and their catchment upon the change of the lake s surface zhang et al 2020 in the case of an inland closed lake the hydrological modeling method considers the lake and its drainage area as a single catchment and the lake catchment relationship is comprehensively studied taking the contributions of all driving factors to the lake changes into account in this pursuit the present study envisaged quantitatively calculating the impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the change in lake water volume by using the hydrological modeling method based on hydrological models the variations of lake water volume caused by climate changes are propagated from the total lake water volume variations and the margin is considered as the influence of anthropogenic factors zhang et al 2020 however some uncertainties do exist in many hydrological models remotely sensed information integrated with hydrological models becomes the frontier and hotspot of lake hydrological studies chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 the present study aimed to examine further the key processes controlling the lake water level variations from 1960 to 2018 meanwhile a quantitative scheme to assess the impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors was developed on the water level decline of the daihai lake a well validated distributed hydrological model essi 3 was adopted to assess the spatial temporal changes of the lake hydrological regimes combined with the lulc transformation matrix within the lake watershed in the corresponding duration the comprehensive analysis enabled us to conduct joint data analyses across the lake and lake watershed scales benefited from the multi source data from both ground observed and remotely sensed in association with distributed hydrological simulations the present study aimed to 1 explore the primary cause that resulted in water level decline of the lake and clarify the key driving factors responsible for the imbalanced lake water budgets in recent decades 2 identify the climatic variations over the lake watershed and its effects on the shrinkage of the daihai lake 3 isolate impacts of the simulated hydrological processes relative to climate variability and lulc changes with two rigorously developed simulation scenarios and 4 quantify anthropogenic and climatic effects on the shrinking of the daihai lake the final goal of this study is to respond to the urgent concerns and some essential issues brought by the persistent water lever decline of the lake and the eco environment degradations over the lake watershed in recent decades 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area daihai lake 112 33 112 46 e 40 28 40 37 n located in a closed intermountain basin as presented in fig 1 is a typical rainfall naturally supplied type inland closed lake administratively belongs to the liangcheng county of the inner mongolia autonomous region china the long term lake water area is about 53 63 km2 in average with a water depth of about 5 6 m and the maximum water depth recorded was approximately 12 m in 2018 surrounding the lake the lake watershed covers approximately 2304 km2 with 519 000 000 m3 water storage the broad plain with low mountains and hills spreads out over the north western and south eastern sides of the lake watershed water supply to the lake mainly comes from streamflow discharge and precipitation among which the streamflow discharge from seasonal rivers in the nearby area takes into account the predominant part chen et al 2011 climatically the daihai lake watershed is located on the northwest margin of the east asian monsoon spans the transition zone of climate between semi humid and semi arid liang et al 2017 where the winter is long and cold and the summer is short and warm the annual mean temperature is approximately 5 9 c with the recorded extremely high temperature about 39 3 c in summer and the extremely low temperature about 34 5 c in winter precipitation is distributed unevenly throughout the year and mainly concentrates from june to september the lake watershed average annual precipitation is only in 397 1 mm but the lake watershed average annual evaporation achieves about 1962 mm the annual mean sunshine hours are about 3000 h and the annual mean wind speed is approximately 2 6 m s with the predominant wind directions towards west and northwest according to the annual mean water level recorded at the sansumu hydrological station in the daihai lake watershed in the past 60 years significant and persistent decline with periodical fluctuations of water level of the lake can be observed the peak water level of the lake lasted for more than ten years with fluctuations in the 1960 s and the water level began to decrease after the 1970 s in recent decades the water level of the daihai lake has persistently kept decreasing trend 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data the daily meteorological data from four national meteorological stations station id 53463 53478 53 480 and 53487 and one local meteorological station liangcheng station were downloaded from china meteorological administration website http data cma cn including daily precipitation daily mean temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration from 1960 to 2018 the daily precipitation and evaporation data measured at the sansumu station which was located less than 1 km from the north western shoreline of the lake were also obtained during the study period the precipitation and evaporation measured at this station can represent the precipitation and evaporation for the lake s surface the 20 cm pan was used for evaporation measurement and the coefficient 0 58 cao et al 2002 sun et al 2005 was used to convert evaporation from 20 cm pan to evaporation from lake water surface besides the time series of the lake water level and surface area of the daihai lake at the annual scale were also collected based on the previous studies cao et al 2002 sun et al 2005 wang et al 2019 the source and accuracy of this data were unclear as the details of the measurements were unknown the previous studies reported that the lake area data were most likely estimated from the statistical relationship between the water level and the lake s surface area cao et al 2002 sun et al 2005 although the lake water level and lake area data at seasonal scale were not available several landsat imageries were collected to obtain the lake area data at seasonal scale considering the imageries availability cloud interference and time costs the landsat imageries from 2000 to 2018 were collected and selected on the same day of each month in different years as many as possible the lake boundaries were vectorized by visual interpretation and the surface area data of the lake at seasonal scale from 2000 to 2018 were extracted finally 2 3 lake water balance lake water budget is defined as the balance between inflows and outflows to an enclosed inland lake jeong et al 2014 woldemichael et al 2012 the water storage change δv of an enclosed lake can be estimated with water balance equation at an annual time interval 1 p r g i e g o w δ v where p r gi e go and w represents precipitation directly into the lake streamflow into the lake groundwater leakage into the lake evaporation from the lake groundwater outflow from the lake and water consumption by anthropogenic activities respectively for the lake water budget estimation the groundwater leakage and outflow are the most difficult components to determine castle et al 2016 mohebzadeh and fallah 2019 both two components are usually estimated with groundwater model combined with groundwater observations however great uncertainty and difficulties are involved in the estimation chen et al 2019b for the daihai lake the mineral concentration of lake water was high so the contributions of groundwater leakage from the wall and the bottom of the lake are minor and its effect on δv can be ignored cao et al 2002 huang and jiang 1999 sun et al 2005 in addition no lake water consumption for any purpose was recorded net groundwater flow gi go and w can be ignored eq 1 thus can be simplified to 2 p r e δ v the empirical approach used to estimate the lake water storage variation includes estimation based on the relationship between the lake water level and the lake area or estimation from underwater topography zhang et al 2011 in this study lake water storage variation δv was estimated as below 3 δ v 1 3 h 2 h 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where h1 h2 represents the lake water surface elevation at two different measurement time respectively a1 a2 is the lake water surface area at two corresponding measurement time accordingly by equation 3 the total δv of each year was obtained in terms of million cubic meters in order to calculate the corresponding precipitation and evaporation over the lake area the observed precipitation and evaporation for the lake area were multiplied by the area of the daihai lake to obtain yearly total p and e in terms of million cubic meters in terms of the lake inflows r the lake received both groundwater discharge and surface flows in the form of river discharges however no streamflow monitoring gauges were installed in the catchment estimation of catchment discharge was a fundamental step in the water balance analysis of the lake in order to characterize the catchment hydrology and quantitatively evaluate the impacts of climate changes and anthropogenic activities on the lake a revised distributed hydrological model essi 3 was used to assess the r taking into account transport pathways through the lake catchment 2 4 the water storage and hydrological processes of the lake watershed simulated by the distributed hydrological model essi 3 a revised distributed hydrological model essi 3 based on an integration of surface and subsurface domains was adopted to adequately represent of the lake catchment s hydrology and capture spatial and temporal variability the original distributed hydrological model essi described watershed hydrology as 1 d fluxes the precipitation was first partitioned into the canopy intercepted part and the left part fell to the ground surface the effective precipitation was partitioned into direct runoff and the remained further infiltrated into deep soils partly and flowed into the channel zhang and zhang 2006 chen 2020 one significant characteristic of the model was its capability of describing both infiltration and saturation excess water yielding mechanism according to the spatial and temporal variations of rainfall intensity as well as the underlying condition of the surface atmospheric interface recently modifications were made to the previous essi model versions and the detailed improvements please referred to chen 2019 2020 the following processes of the essi 3 model were presumed to be essential for adequate representation of the lake s catchment behavior canopy interception evapotranspiration soil water storage groundwater storage surface runoff interflow base flow and groundwater recharge in short a three layer soil water balance module was used to simulate discharge and water exchange in soil water storage over the vertical soil column a first order linear reservoir approach was used to model groundwater storage and discharge which improved the spatial heterogeneity and inhibited the uncertainties in the simulation of hydrologic processes surface and subsurface flows were coupled via the third soil layer and the surface and subsurface domains were discretized into the same grid of rectangular cells the lake catchment was discretized and delineated into ten small sub watersheds fig 2 and each watershed had three main components the overland river and flow sink output grids for each overland grid the runoff outputs from model including total specific runoff consisting of saturation excess surface runoff surface runoff runoff from the third soil reservoir interflow and groundwater runoff from the lowest reservoir baseflow were defined as river discharges draining into lake among which the baseflow represented groundwater discharge to rivers the river grids represented river networks and the flow sink output grids defined the flow sink outlets of these sub watersheds soil parameters determine soil s capability to regulate hydrological flux and reserves vegetation ecological parameters also need to be calibrated when considering canopy interception evaporation transpiration and surface energy balance chen 2020 the soil and vegetation parameters were commonly parameterized by parameter lookup tables based on land cover types for the normal hydrological models and community land models one significant advantage of the essi 3 model was using many global or regional oriented spatio temporal soil characteristic parameter products and vegetation parameter products to drive the model based on the soilgrids datasets hengl et al 2017 and the pedotransfer functions dai et al 2013 the soil parameters required for model driving were calculated such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat the saturated water content θsat the field capacity θfca and the permanent wilting point θpwp besides remote sensing based datasets like leaf area index liang et al 2013b were used to calibrate the vegetation parameters thereby the essi 3 model benefits the reliable quantifications of the influence of underlying surfaces and climate changes for the hydrological regime of the daihai lake watershed to set up an essi 3 model table 1 listed the necessary datasets for driving the model together with the accessible website for free downloading these specific datasets the data type spatial temporal resolutions and duration of the datasets used for the study model simulation was carried out at 90 m 90 m resolution for the period from 1960 to 2018 using the first two years as a warm up period to allow key model states such as groundwater aquifers to reach equilibrium it should be noted that as multi spatial resolutions exist for the input gridded datasets appropriate interpolation approaches were adopted to upscale or downscale the various datasets to a consistent spatial resolution the simplest method to downscale the climate forecasts from a coarse grid to a finer grid is to utilize the bilinear interpolation method chao et al 2018 gao et al 2022 so the bilinear interpolation method was used to upscale or downscale the meteorological data soil characteristic parameter products and vegetation parameter products the hydrological model is usually validated by using hydrometric stations however when discharge data are not available the observed evaporation data is an alternative solution for validation senent aparicio et al 2021 this study used the monthly observed evaporation data from 1960 to 2018 to validate the essi 3 model the model performance was evaluated by commonly used two criteria i e the correlation coefficient r2 and the nash sutcliff efficiency nse liu et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 through the reasonable establishment of model modules the application of a variety of remote sensing data and the validation of evaporation data the simulation of runoff generation process can provide an encouraging qualitative assessment of the lake hydrology however the uncertainty of runoff prediction also comes from the calibration of the empirical parameters of the flow converging process e g clag of streamflow routing a manual trial error method was carried out to calibrate the flow converging parameters for further confidence in the model s results specifically a baseline period with little impact of human activities was defined the baseline period was commonly divided based on the human designated method and the abrupt change method schilling et al 2008 no matter which method was used to define the baseline period the results obtained had a certain uncertainty the observed streamflow during this baseline period was calculated and regarded as the natural river discharge the simulated streamflow was calibrated by comparing with the observed streamflow during the baseline period in the manual trial error process values for the relative volume error zhou et al 2021 should be smaller than 5 or 5 while r2 and nse should be higher than 0 8 then the best fit flow converging parameter sets can be determined 2 5 drought analysis to better understand the lake s dynamics the dry and wet conditions of the lake watershed were analyzed the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee 1993 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are the most popularized drought indices the pdsi is based on a simplified water balance with input parameters of precipitation runoff moisture supply and evaporation however the pdsi cannot identify drought for different timescales and many parameters are required to calculate the index the spi is a simplified index that can detect drought at different time scales but it only incorporates precipitation to calculate the drought index while other factors such as temperature are assumed to be stationary the spei is a relatively new drought index that combines the advantages of spi with temperature variability it was proposed as convenient for drought monitoring and analysis under climate changes and can also identify drought at different time scales like the spi continuously negative spei values define a drought period based on intensity severity magnitude and duration however no definite thresholds for the spei values and associated drought conditions were presented by vicente serrano et al 2010 in this study we classified spei values with the thresholds suggested by mckee et al 1993 the speis were calculated with the time series of historical precipitation and temperature data at the predefined time scales i e 1 month 3 month 6 month 9 month 12 month and 24 month respectively positive speis and negative speis indicate wet conditions and dry conditions respectively the higher the positive spei the more wet condition in the studied period vise a versa relatively high negative deviations characterize the drought periods a drought event starts when spei value reaches 1 0 and ends when spi becomes positive again normally the drought period characterized by the range of speis is arbitrary split into moderately dry 1 0 spei 1 49 severely dry 1 5 spei 1 99 and extremely dry conditions spei 2 0 for a detailed description of the calculation procedure please refer to vicente serrano et al 2010 2 6 quantifying the contribution of climatic and anthropogenic factors climate changes and anthropogenic activities are the two important drivers for lake water storage changes accordingly three concepts need to be discriminated and clarified for the relative contributions of climate changes and anthropogenic activities the first one is to precisely define the factors of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on the change of lake water storage in this paper the impact of climatic factors primarily refers to the variation of precipitation and evaporation into the lake s surface and the variation in streamflow caused by climate changes the impact of anthropogenic activities on the daihai lake mainly focuses on runoff response to lulc changes and the direct water consumption upstream including the residential industrial irrigational and agricultural water consumption and reservoir interception the second concept is to explicitly define the mathematical expression of the relative contribution under climate changes and anthropogenic activities in this paper the lake water loss δw caused by climate changes and anthropogenic activities can be expressed as 4 δ w δ w c δ w h where δwc and δwh is the lake water loss resulting from climate changes and anthropogenic activities respectively the relative contributions of δwc and δwh can be approximately estimated as follows 5 c c δ w c δ w c δ w h δ w p δ w e δ w r δ w c δ w h 100 6 c h δ w h δ w h δ w h δ w lulc δ w h δ w c δ w h 100 where cc and ch is the relative contribution of climate changes and anthropogenic activities on the lake water loss respectively δwp and δwe is the water loss caused by precipitation and evaporation into the lake s surface respectively δwr is the water loss caused by natural streamflow under climate changes δwlulc and δwh is the water loss caused by the lulc changes and the direct water consumption upstream respectively after the baseline period is defined the water loss caused by climate changes and anthropogenic activities can be calculated for each year in theory the values of variables mentioned above can be either positive or negative for consistency positive and negative values are used to label water loss and water surplus respectively obviously eq 5 and 6 make mathematical sense only when both δwc and δwh values are positive the third concept clarifies the difference between the simulated river discharges by essi 3 model and the calculated river discharges based on the lake water balance eq 2 the simulated river discharges by essi 3 model represent the natural streamflow under current meteorological observations and dynamic lulc conditions the essi 3 model also set up the other control scenario produced by using current meteorological observations and constant lulc conditions as inputs focused on the modification of lulc the present study investigates the partial impact of anthropogenic activities on hydrological processes based on the eq 2 the calculated streamflow is the part of natural runoff after water withdrawals from upstream rather than the total natural runoff generated by metero hydrological conditions therefore the difference between the simulated and calculated streamflow is considered as the direct water consumption upstream 3 results and discussions 3 1 hydrologic cycle within the lake watershed fig 3 presented the annual variations of water budget terms along with climate variables in the past several decades including the lake water level variations a annual precipitation b and annual evaporation c over the lake watershed in the past six decades two phases in lake water level variations can be recognized 1 natural fluctuation of lake water level from 1960 to 1973 with an average lake water level of approximately 989 68 m a s l close to the six decade average of 986 54 m a s l 2 insistent decline of lake water level from 1974 to 2018 the lake water level had fallen from 989 17 m a s l in 1974 to 979 25 m a s l in 2018 the average decline rate over the last six decades was approximately 0 23 m yr fig 3b exhibited that precipitation fluctuation of the lake region was relatively stable along average over the last six decades the mann kendall test suggested that the annual precipitation decreased slightly on average with non significant fluctuations from 1960 to 2018 however the evaporation data fig 3c exhibited an apparent decreasing trend over the lake surface from 1960 to 2018 the annual lake surface evaporation for the two periods of 1960 1973 and 1974 2018 were 964 71 and 872 55 mm yr respectively while the six decadal annual mean evaporation was approximately 894 42 mm yr it was noted from fig 4 a that the annual mean temperature had increased over the lake region but the evaporation mm tended to decrease obviously actually changes in temperature and other climate parameters caused changes in evapotranspiration therefore the critical drivers for evaporation changes in lake were investigated among the available climatic parameters annual and seasonal temperature relative humidity wind speed air pressure and sunshine duration in the lake region was presented in fig 4 a b c d and e respectively as shown in fig 4a the annual temperature exhibited an increasing trend with a six decadal average temperature of about 5 02 c characterizing one relatively cold period from 1960 to 1987 with an annual mean temperature of about 4 45 c and the following relatively warm period from 1987 to 2018 with annual mean temperature of about 5 53 c the annual mean temperature for about 24 years out of the 28 years cold period was below the six decadal average while the annual mean temperature for about 25 years out of over 31 years warm period was higher than the six decadal average the mann kendall test on temperature variations revealed a positive and significant increasing trend the average temperature increased about 0 51 per 10 years at the 5 significance levels which is faster than the average increase rate around 0 23 per 10 years for china chen et al 2019a according to the latest report from intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc no significant correlation was found between temperature and precipitation over the daihai lake as shown in fig 4b the annual mean relative humidity was stable during the cold period with an average value of 51 5 but a consecutively declining trend occurred after 2000 similarly the wind speed during the cold period was higher than the six decadal average of 2 87 m s with a mean value of 0 67 m s above the average as presented in fig 4c however the wind speed started to decrease since the 1980 s with an average of about 2 26 m s the annual mean air pressure fig 4d and sunshine duration fig 4e fluctuated over the six decade with a mean value of 857 pa and 7 9 h day respectively several potential causes for the lake evaporation variations existed and their effects are changing with time at annual seasonal and diurnal scales and with each other co variations table 2 listed the correlation analysis of the annual lake surface evaporation against the annual temperature relative humidity wind speed air pressure and sunshine duration a relatively high correlation between lake surface evaporation and wind speed in recent years suggested that the vital factor of lake evaporation variations was wind speed which had been confirmed in many other studies ito and momii 2021 lake evaporation was largely governed by the magnitude of the vapor pressure gradient between the water surface and the overlying air friedrich et al 2018 in this study the declining wind speeds at the annual scale led to a decrease in lake evaporation by reducing the evaporation rate to better understand the possible causes responsible for the lake area variations the effects of climate changes on the lake at seasonal scale were investigated seasonal lake area precipitation evaporation average temperature max temperature and min temperature in the lake region were presented in fig 5 a b c d e and f respectively as shown in fig 5a the lake area at seasonal scale started to decrease after the peak evaporation of a year in may see fig 5c while the average max and min temperature at seasonal scale reached the maximum in july relative longer sunshine duration with high wind speed was highly correlated with strong evaporation in may of a year see fig 4c and fig 4e when the precipitation reached its peak value in july of a year see fig 5b the shrinking of the lake area slowed down and the lake area gradually increased in august these phenomena revealed the effect of climate changes on the lake at seasonal scale however fig 4a exhibited that the average lake area was the largest in january but the smallest in december the continued shrinkage of the lake area at inter annual scale suggested no significant correlation existed with the climatic changes as shown in figs 3 4 and 5 climate factors cannot reasonably interpret the shrinkage of the lake surface alone at either annual or seasonal scale therefore speis calculated for the study area were used to explain climate conditions and their effects on droughts over daihai lake fig 6 presented the spei variations at the time scale of 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month for the study area drought episodes inferred from spei at the 24 month timescale as listed in table 3 revealed five periods of drought from 1966 to 1967 1987 to 1988 1994 to 1995 1998 to 2003 and 2006 to 2012 corresponding to dry episodes from 1966 to 1967 1987 to 1988 and 2001 to 2003 precipitation and river flows supplied to the daihai lake decreased obviously however the lake water level yet presented a continued decreasing trend for normal and wet climate conditions such as for the period from 1995 to 1998 2004 to 2006 and 2012 to 2015 moreover the spei results at other timescales followed the same trend as the results with spei at the 24 month timescale the drought episodes referred from spei values were also failed to explain the role of climate factors in the shrinkage of the daihai lake according to the lake water level changes and climate variable fluctuations recorded in the study area the precipitation basically remained unchanged and the evaporation had a general trend of decreasing from the past six decades however the daihai lake water level experienced substantial decreases which was against the water budget theory in a closed inland lake watershed since the daihai lake was an inland closed lake there was no water drawn from the lake for any other purpose and evaporation was the only output component for fulfilling the eq 2 the r should remain decreasing which implies that the major reason for lake water level decline was a continuous decrease of water inflow into the lake as no streamflow monitoring gauges were installed in the catchment the distributed model simulation approach was the only effective alternative to understand the hydrological processes of streamflow into the lake 3 2 the essi 3 model performance the hydrological processes of the daihai lake watershed were simulated with a distributed hydrological model essi 3 chen and zhang 2019 before using the simulated results for further studies the simulated results for these hydrological processes and relevant fluxes with essi 3 were checked and evaluated firstly the fluxes of the runoff generation process were checked and monthly evaporation was chosen to test the model s performance the simulated evaporation esim by essi 3 distributed hydrological model at the location of sansumu station was extracted and compared with the observed monthly evaporation measured at the station eobs as exhibited in fig 7 validation of the monthly time series of esim against eobs indicated the good performance of essi 3 model in simulation of evaporation measured by r2 and nse of about 0 91 and 0 90 at the sansumu station site for the observation period 1960 2018 respectively secondly the performance of runoff fluxes on the runoff generation process were tested based on a four mechanism based grid to grid routing schema that accumulates the arrival time of each upstream grid to its downstream outlet grid three main runoff components for every grid including surface runoff interflow and baseflow were simulated with the essi 3 model normally the observed and simulated daily and monthly discharges at hydrological stations were used to calibrate and validate the model however there were no available hydrological data for such purpose in the studied watershed in order to verify the runoff simulated by essi 3 model we assumed that the total runoff simulated from every grid of of the lake watershed could flow into the daihai lake then we used the simulated runoff to verify the temporal variations of the lake water storage by taking lake water budget into account fig 8 presented the observed and the simulated lake water storage at annual scale over the past six decades the yearly observed lake water storage δvobs was calculated by lake water level multiplied by the lake area based on eq 3 and the simulated lake water storage δvsim was estimated by the observed evaporation precipitation into lake surface and the simulated runoff as shown in fig 6 the trend of yearly observed lake water storage was simulated with accuracy with r value of 0 78 for the whole simulation period 1960 2018 however significant numerical difference between δvobs and δvsim existed with a poor nse value of 1 87 the reason for the difference was that the simulated runoff fluxes used here were the original data of the runoff generation process water loss of the flow converging process had not been considered due to the lack of observed streamflow data thirdly auxiliary data and results regarding the study watershed s hydrological data from published literature were also collected for cross validation the investigation on water resources of the daihai lake watershed for the 1980 s huang and jiang 1999 showed that the annual runoff of the daihai lake watershed was about 43 mm 50 mm and 55 mm in water depth for the eastern western and northern region respectively moreover according to their study the annual runoff was about 49 6 mm and the annual mean available runoff was about 283 mm in water depth for our simulated results the annual mean available runoff was about 205 mm for the 1980 s and the annual surface runoff and interflow was about 27 mm and 43 mm in water depth respectively indeed calibration and validation of streamflow is vital for evaluating the applicability of a hydrological model as an inland closed lake watershed streamflow from several perennial rivers and several seasonal rivers supply the lake making it difficult to calibrate and validate the process of river discharge due to lack of the observed streamflow data it should be noted that model simulation focused on re producing the longer term lake catchment behavior under natural status rather than attempting to mimic actual streamflow which were greatly influenced by the direct water consumption of upstream the above verification results implied the overall accuracy of the simulated results on the runoff generation process with the physically based distributed hydrological model essi 3 were reasonably approximate to the natural conditions furthermore compared to traditional watershed discharge observations the long term simulation results by essi 3 model could reflect water resource distributions at the spatial and temporal scales however the flow converging process of the model should be further checked and calibrated to better represent the long term hydrological process of lake catchments 3 3 the reconstruction of the natural streamflow according to previous studies huang and jiang 1999 and visiting local herders and households the daihai lake watershed started to extensive agricultural activities from 1975 s before 1975 s the daihai lake watershed was close to an area undisturbed by human activities as described previously the lake water level showed a natural fluctuation from 1960 to 1973 based on the human designated methods the baseline period from 1960 to 1973 was defined as a period undisturbed by human activities therefore the dynamics of lake water storage from 1960 to 1973 was considered as the natural state of the lake hydrological process then the simulated streamflow by the model was calibrated by using the actual river discharges during the baseline period the closed inland daihai lake catchments were delineated into 10 small sub watersheds as presented in fig 2 with arc hydro module of arcgis based on dem data and flow path networks the accumulation areas routing distance and routing times of every small watershed were set up with the same empirical parameters of the flow converging process the total streamflow into the lake from ten outlets of these sub watersheds were lumped together and were calibrated with the actual river discharges during the baseline period the best fit parameters of flow converging process for the long term rainfall runoff process in the closed inland daihai lake watershed were determined based on the manual trial error method and the new lake water storage changes were estimated and represented as δgvsim fig 9 plotted the δgvsim and δvobs during the calibration period the results suggested that the flow converging parameters were reliable with r2 of 0 84 and the nse of 0 81 therefore the dimensionless parameters were used for flow converging process during the whole period 1960 2018 and the annual lake water storage changes in the natural state were reconstructed fig 10 presented the estimated δgvsim and δvobs over the last 60 years the results indicated that the lake water storage changes adjusted with flow converging parameters were considered better matched to observations than the simulated results without calibrations therefore the estimated δgvsim can be considered approximately as lake water storage changes undisturbed by human activities and impacted by climate changes the δvobs represented lake water storage changes under climate changes and anthropogenic activities the good match between δgvsim and δvobs during the baseline period revealed that anthropogenic activities posed a limited influence on the daihai lake watershed region for this period nevertheless the insistently increasing discrepancy between δgvsim and δvobs after the 1980 s attributed to a combined effect of lulc changes and the increased water consumption upstream in this region moreover the discrepancy became especially larger in the water rich years such as the year 1973 1988 1995 2003 and 2013 this phenomenon probably implied that the flow converging parameters were unsuitable for the precipitation rich years due to the limited calibrations made to these years 3 4 runoff response to lulc changes fig 11 showed the annual series of surface runoff interflow and baseflow simulated by the essi 3 model over the lake watershed scale respectively the six decade average runoff was estimated approximately as 93 12 mm yr and the maximum annual runoff was taken place between 1994 and 1995 a relatively stable runoff period during1960s 1980 s followed by a somewhat fluctuating runoff period 1990 s 2010 s was observed during the fluctuating period the runoff showed a non significant decreasing trend except for the year 1995 2003 and 2013 which suggested a congruent trend to the precipitation of the period the runoff reduction over the dry period was found proportional to the reduction of precipitation rate and the increase of runoff during the wet period was also proportional to the increase of precipitation rate in the wet period the decrease of evaporation and the increase of precipitation and runoff over the lake watershed area in 1995 2003 and 2013 resulted in the decline rate of the lake water level slowed down obviously in the normal and dry period the low precipitation and runoff over the studied region made the lake water level in the continuous decreasing status in order to quantitatively estimate the contribution of lulc changes on watershed runoff the area of land use types for daihai lake watershed from 1967 to 2018 was counted based on remotely sensed information as shown in fig 12 over the inland enclosed daihe lake watershed grassland and cropland were the predominant land use types accounting for about 52 86 1219 02 km2 and 20 64 475 94 km2 of the lake watershed area respectively in 2018 the grassland changed to about 37 51 866 72 km2 and cropland turned to about 26 6 614 75 km2 in the total area of the lake watershed cropland increased rapidly from about 20 64 in 1967 to about 37 35 in 2000 in the total lake watershed area mainly were converted from grassland and wetland area of grassland wetland and water body remained decreased in area from 1967 to 2018 accounting for about 52 86 8 70 and 7 57 to 37 51 5 34 and 2 39 in the lake watershed area respectively from 1967 to 1998 area of woodland kept unchanged with about 9 occupation in the lake watershed area and increased rapidly from 2000 under the influence of the chinese government s policy about conversion of cropland to forest till 2018 woodland had increased to 23 97 occupation in the total area of the lake watershed with the economic and social development of the study region the build up land extended continually from areal occupation of about 1 25 to 4 19 within the past decades the period from 2000 to 2018 was a period of relatively drastic changes in land use types mainly characterizing the dramatic increase of forest area and the gradual decrease of cropland and grassland therefore the hydrological process variations associated with lulc changes from 2000 to 2018 were quantitatively investigated to rectify the affections of the lulc changes on hydrology of the daihai lake watershed simulation strategy was made to set up simulation scenarios of 1 distributed hydrological simulations from 2000 to 2018 with essi 3 driven by dynamic lulc dataset of 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 and 2 the same period of hydrological simulations driven by the fixed lulc data of 2000 fig 13 exhibited yearly runoff simulated by essi 3 model over the last 19 years under two scenarios mentioned above for simulation scenario 1 the annual mean surface runoff interflow and baseflow predicted was about 27 35 mm 41 05 mm and 21 80 mm respectively for the simulation scenario 2 these hydrological processes were approximately 27 37 mm 40 52 mm and 20 96 mm correspondingly the scenario 2 caused less than 1 increase in available runoff for the lake watershed compared to the scenario 1 this result suggested that the lulc changes posed very limited effects on the hydrological regimes of the lake watershed area and the climate changes are predominant in governing the changes of hydrologic processes of the watershed the question raised again how to explain the continuous decrease of water inflow into the lake the only possibility that remained was the anthropogenic effect specifically caused by the residential industrial irrigational and agricultural water consumption and reservoir interception which were needed for further analyses 3 5 quantifying the contributions of climatic and anthropogenic factors to lake water storage changes the decreases of the daihai lake water level in the past decades resulted from the decreased discharge inflow into the lake even in the precipitation rich years comprehensive analyses made in the former chapters had divided main factors that affected input discharge into two categories 1 anthropogenic factors such as agricultural irrigation water demand and reservoir interception and 2 climatic factors by climate variations since the 1970 s the irrigated area had increased rapidly with the irrigation facilities mainly used to exploit groundwater over the daihai lake watershed huang and jiang 1999 the irrigated area once reached about 18 395 hm2 at its peak time of 1998 and the groundwater was intensively exploited at meantime affected by the government policy of return the irrigated land to grass and forest land from 2000 the irrigated area over the study region began to decrease nevertheless yet remained around 13 000 hm2 since then with the economic reform movement of china started in the early 1980 s industrialization over the region also led to a gradually increased demand for groundwater exploitation additionally there are 11 small and medium sized reservoirs and 14 ponds in the daihai lake watershed the water surface area for these water bodies is about 840 km2 with total water storage of approximately 38 320 000 m3 the catchment area controlled by human accounts for about half of this region cao et al 2002 huang and jiang 1999 sun et al 2005 reservoir regulation cut off most of the region s river systems and thus dam affected rivers bear extensive water pressure dam changes the regional precipitation pattern especially the regional hydro climate and extreme precipitation which may be beneficial to the developments of regional and economy in the opposite direction of runoff hossain et al 2010 nilsson et al 2005 omer et al 2016 in general the water loss was affected by climate changes and anthropogenic activities among which anthropogenic activities were implemented mainly by various human induced water consumption and lulc changes on water loss could be ignored in this study the annual mean hydrological process variables simulated by essi 3 during the calibration period from 1960 to1973 were defined as baseline values the differences of the simulated hydrological processes relative to corresponding baseline values for each hydrological year investigated were calculated the relative contributions of anthropogenic and climatic factors on decreasing of the daihai lake for each hydrological year were presented in table 4 from table 4 it was observed for precipitation rich years such as the year 2013 the influence of climatic factors presented a negative effect for drying up of the lake in other words climatic factor delayed the decreasing process of the lake water level under the normal and dry climatic years both climatic and anthropogenic factors positively affected the decreasing of lake water levels among which climatic factors accelerated the decreasing process of the lake water level and the anthropogenic factor took major responsibility for lake shrinkage without considering the precipitation rich years the anthropogenic factor took responsibility for the lake shrinkage about 58 while the climatic factor took roughly about 42 therefore to recover daihai lake reforming the manner that water resources were used and managed detailing rules for the implementation of regulations on returning farmland to forests in the studied watershed should be the key in such an arid region 4 conclusion the severe recession of daihai lake in china had been widely reported in recent years and attracted extensive concerns from various communities of the national and local authorities in the absence of natural runoff and human induced water withdrawal observations predicting the relative contributions of climate changes and anthropogenic activities to lake water decline is challenging a hydrological modeling approach was proposed in this paper to address the above issues based on the combined use of a distributed hydrological model essi 3 remote sensing data and observed lake level and area data this research investigated the causes of lake variations and distinguished the relative contribution of climate changes and human activities on lake s recession following were the conclusions from the present study 1 hydro meteorological observations over the daihai lake watershed showed a continued decrease of the lake water level on an ongoing basis for recent decades which was mainly attributed to the decreased water inflow into the lake comprehensive analysis on temperature wind speed humidity and sunshine duration variations against pan evaporation over the recent decades suggested a good correlation between wind speed and evaporation detailed investigations suggested that the inflow to the lake was sensitive to changes in precipitation the annual and seasonal analysis between the lake hydrology and climate factors and the drought analysis inferred from spei studies indicated that the daihai lake was jointly affected by both anthropogenic and climatic factors and drought events had accelerated the lake shrinkage 2 through the reasonable establishment of model modules the integration of remote sensing data with the hydrological model the model provided an encouraging qualitative assessment of the lake hydrology the comparisons between the monthly observed and simulated evaporation data at the sansumu station showed high consistency with r2 and nse of about 0 91 and 0 90 respectively the trend of δvobs was well simulated by the un calibrated δvsim with r value of 0 78 the cross validation with previous studies also showed that the overall accuracy of the simulated results on the runoff generation process with the model were reasonably approximate to the natural conditions 3 due to the slight impact of human activities the period of 1960 1973 was adopted as the baseline the simulated streamflow was calibrated using the actual river discharges during the baseline period based on the manual trial error method the best fit parameters of the flow converging process were determined and the natural state s lake water storage changes were reconstructed the good match between δgvsim and δvobs with r2 of 0 84 and the nse of 0 81 suggested that the flow converging parameters were reliable 4 results from two comprehensively designed simulation scenarios indicated runoff response to lulc changes could be ignored the influence of climatic factors presented a negative effect for drying up the lake and delayed the decreasing process of the lake water level for wet conditions under the normal and dry climatic years both climatic and anthropogenic factors positively affected the decreasing of lake water levels among which climatic factors accelerated the decreasing process of the lake water level and the anthropogenic factors took major responsibility for lake shrinkage without considering the high water years the anthropogenic factor took responsibility for the lake shrinkage about 58 while the climatic factor took roughly about 42 in 1974 2018 this investigation will underpin the formulation of management strategies to maintain the lake s water balance additionally this investigation serves as a useful example of applying a distributed model to the assessment of lake hydrology especially for the lake catchments with limited observations although this research still suffers from certain uncertainties credit authorship
