17055,as a clean and renewable energy biogas is an important alternative to fossil fuels however the high carbon dioxide co2 content in biogas limits its value as a fuel biogas upgrading is an advanced process which removes co2 from biogas thereby converting biogas to biomethane which has a higher commercial value microbial technologies offer a sustainable and cost effective way to upgrade biogas removing co2 using hydrogen h2 as electron donor generated by surplus electricity from renewable wind or solar energy hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be applied to convert co2 with h2 to methane ch4 or alternatively homoacetogens can convert both co2 and h2 into value added chemicals here we comprehensively review the current state of biogas generation and utilization and describe the advances in biological h2 dependent biogas upgrading technologies with particular attention to key challenges associated with the processes e g metabolic limitations low h2 transfer rate and finite co2 conversion rate we also highlight several new strategies for overcoming technical barriers to achieve efficient co2 conversion including process optimization to eliminate metabolic limitation novel reactor designs to improve h2 transfer rate and utilization efficiency and employing advanced genetic engineering tools to generate more efficient microorganisms the insights offered in this review will promote further exploration into microbial h2 driven biogas upgrading towards addressing the global energy crisis and climate change associated with use of fossil fuels graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biogas upgrading biomethane carbon dioxide methanogens homoacetogens genetic engineering 1 global biogas production and utilization with rapid economic development urbanization and population growth global primary energy consumption grew by 2 9 in 2018 reaching 13 87 billion tonnes oil equivalent bp 2019 while over past decades the world has been heavily dependent on fossil fuels e g oil coal and natural gas as the main source of energy fossil fuels are expected to be depleted within 200 years shafiee and topal 2009 in addition large amounts of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 are released during the burning of fossil fuels causing serious environmental issues including global warming and climate change for example a new high of 136 billion tonnes of co2 was calculated to be released into the atmosphere in 2018 caused by fossil fuels combustion le quéré et al 2018 therefore a renewable energy transition is required to alleviate the depletion of fossil fuels and dramatically reduce the global carbon footprint in contrast to fossil fuels biomass is a clean and renewable energy source with huge reserves it is estimated that the total global production of biomass is approximately 150 billion metric tons annually balat and ayar 2005 however much of the biomass ends up in waste streams including sewage food wastes straw stalks horticulture residues and livestock manure the energy embedded in biomass can be recovered by anaerobic digestion ad a robust and widely applied bioprocess that converts waste organic carbon to biogas an important biofuel with methane ch4 as the main component it has been estimated that at least 25 of all bioenergy can originate from biogas in the future holm nielsen et al 2009 there are currently 130 000 small to large scale digesters and 50 million micro digesters in operation around the world jain 2019 even though the energy derived from current ad facilities is huge only 1 6 2 2 of the potential of ad has been unlocked due to limitations in collection storage and transport equipment systems irena 2019 if the majority of feedstocks could be sustainably captured the ad process has the potential to generate 10 100 to 14 000 twh of energy equivalent to 6 9 of global primary energy consumption iea 2018 furthermore by capturing carbon from various biomass the ad process is potentially able to reduce 3000 4000 million metric tonnes of co2 which is more than 10 of global greenhouse gas ghg emission jain 2019 in addition the global biogas industry is experiencing extraordinary growth international renewable energy agency irena statistics show that the quantity of global electricity generated from biogas in 2016 was twice as much as that in 2010 irena 2019 therefore biogas production from the ad process significantly contributes to not only energy supply but also carbon emission reduction energy extraction and ghg mitigation via ad is particularly important for wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are large energy consumers and ghg emitters for example the electricity consumed by wwtps in the united states comprises 3 4 of the country s total energy demand wrf 2013 while the cost of electricity accounts for over 30 of total costs at wwtps nationally usepa 2010 however a large amount of energy is embedded in wastewater mainly in the form of sewage sludge equivalent to around 13 mj kg chemical oxygen demand cod gandiglio et al 2017 this is 3 5 times the amount of energy required for the overall wastewater treatment process werf 2014 if all available wastewater is treated via ad globally the generated biogas has the potential to provide 210 to 300 twh of energy equivalent to the energy demand of 27 38 million people jain 2019 therefore efficient utilization of biogas from ad in wwtps will enable a paradigm shift in wastewater treatment from an energy consuming to an energy neutral or energy positive process and accelerate the development of a green circular economy for the water treatment industry europe is leading the world in biogas production and utilization with 17 783 biogas plants an annual yield of 30 billion cubic meters bcm of biogas and 63 511 gwh of electricity generated from biogas in 2018 fig 1 in europe 74 of biogas is generated from anaerobic digestion of energy crops manure and agricultural waste 17 of biogas is derived from landfill and 9 of biogas is from sewage sludge in wwtps scarlat et al 2018 the biogas produced in europe is mainly used for heat and electricity generation with electrical efficiency of 30 45 through using gas engines van foreest 2012 in germany for instance more than 800 wwtps utilize biogas for generating electricity 900 gwh year or heat 1800 gwh year which can support a quarter of total energy required by the wwtps dos santos et al 2016 recently a new renewable energy directive has been established by the european union for increasing the proportion of renewable energy to 32 by 2030 nissen et al 2018 creating strong support for further biogas industry development in europe in addition to european countries china united states and brazil are large biogas producers 11 16 bcm year for each country fig 1 these countries have tremendous biogas feedstocks including food wastes energy crops manures and slurries xue et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 in 2015 the actual total biogas production in china reached up to 15 8 bcm mara 2017 recently new policies and regulations such as the national 13th five year plan set by china mara 2017 and the national biofuel policy renovabio announced by brazil have been established for stimulating biogas production and utilization however the development of the biogas industry in these countries lags behind europe due to the low volume loading rate the efficiency of biogas generators is very low 20 30 limiting commercial profits and the sustainability of biogas production cheng et al 2013 hui et al 2018 moreover the majority of biogas in china is used for domestic cooking while a large portion of biogas is directly flared in the united states further contributing to low energy efficiency and environmental issues ren21 2019 therefore it is vital to upgrade biogas industrial infrastructure and develop innovative technologies for advancing biogas utilization many other countries with large populations and vast territories e g russia australia india and nigeria also have great potential for biogas production fig 1 these countries have a widely available feedstock supply e g organic wastes from agriculture landfill and wwtps however the actual biogas yield in these countries is far behind that of europe for example although the annual biogas potential of russia is estimated to be up to73 7 bcm which is comparable to that of europe only 10 biogas plants have been established in russia gielen and saygin 2017 in addition the utilization of biogas in these countries is generally unsustainable with the properties of low energy efficiency and high carbon emission for example most biogas is being used for generating electricity and heat or flared in australia 2 biogas upgrading and current technologies 2 1 biogas upgrading necessities and policy support biogas mostly comprises methane ch4 40 75 and carbon dioxide co2 15 60 accompanied by trace gasses including hydrogen sulfide h2s 0 005 2 nitrogen n2 0 2 water vapor h2o 5 10 halogenated hydrocarbons voc 0 0 6 siloxanes 0 0 02 oxygen o2 0 1 carbon monoxide co 0 6 ammonia nh3 and dust particles andriani et al 2014 kapoor et al 2019 while ch4 is the energy rich compound in biogas all other components are undesired and limit the advanced utilization of biogas firstly the presence of gas contaminants mainly co2 in biogas leads to its low calorific value 6 kwh m3 and effectively decreases the volumetric capacity of gas cylinders making biogas only suitable for applications with low energy utilization efficiency e g cooking and lighting secondly biogas can only be cost effectively stored for a few hours in the limited infrastructure and biogas transportation is difficult because co2 readily transforms into dry ice under high pressure when biogas is compressed angelidaki et al 2018 kapoor et al 2019 thirdly the corrosive gas h2s in the raw biogas can cause significant damage to gas engine units due to so2 emission from combustion angelidaki et al 2018 biogas upgrading can be used to remove these gas contaminants mainly targeting co2 removal and simultaneously convert biogas to biomethane methane content 96 based on germany s standard compared to raw biogas biomethane has a much higher energy content 10 kwh m3 and wider applications biomethane can be directly injected into the existing natural gas grids thus solving the issues of transportation and storage for biogas khan et al 2017 in addition biomethane can be utilized as a vehicle fuel in place of fossil fuels thereby reducing overall co2 emissions in terms of these advantages a number of national policies have been established worldwide for facilitating the biogas upgrading industry for example the european commission has established the 2030 climate and energy framework to boost the development of renewable energy aiming to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 40 increase renewable energy to 32 and improve energy efficiency by 32 commission 2014 as a completely renewable energy biomethane is an ideal substitute for natural gas with net zero ghg emissions the european biogas association eba has proposed policy incentives for stimulating biomethane production e g facilitating biomethane application in heavy industries and shipping de fossilizing the gas grid and sector and giving biomethane priority access to the gas grid eba 2019 moreover according to the national 13th five year plan china aims to increase annual national biomethane production up to 10 20 and 40 bcm in years 2020 2025 and 2030 respectively de clercq et al 2017 in 2016 the united states environmental protection agency usepa included biomethane as an advanced biofuel specifically california issued assembly bill no 1900 to promote the utilization of pipeline biomethane pasqual et al 2018 europe is also leading the world in biogas upgrading and commercialization the number of biomethane plants in europe has increased from 187 in 2011 to 540 in 2017 accompanied by a significant increase in biomethane yield from 0 07 bcm in 2011 to 1 8 bcm in 2017 bioenergy europe 2019 the physicochemical upgrading technologies implemented on an industrial scale include pressure swing adsorption separating biogas components using special adsorbent materials e g zeolites and activated carbon augelletti et al 2017 high pressure water scrubbing employing water to remove co2 and h2s from biogas due to much higher water solubility of co2 than that of ch4 budzianowski et al 2017 chemical scrubbing applying organic solvent e g methanol and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol or aqueous amine solutions for absorbing co2 and h2s petersson and wellinger 2009 membrane separation hierarchically separating biogas components based on selective permeability properties of membranes bauer et al 2013 cryogenic separation acquiring liquified ch4 by gradually decreasing biogas temperature baena moreno et al 2019 and chemical hydrogenation reducing co2 with h2 catalyzed by nickel or ruthenium jürgensen et al 2015 although many of these technologies have been well developed they have multiple disadvantages in high investment operating and maintenance costs high energy demands requirement for a large amount of water e g high pressure water scrubbing or regeneration of expensive adsorbent e g pressure swing adsorption and production of waste chemicals that are toxic to humans and the environment e g chemical scrubbing and unsustainability e g chemical hydrogenation 2 2 hydrogen driven chemoautotrophic biogas upgrading technologies in contrast to physicochemical methods hydrogen h2 driven biogas upgrading via biological technologies can be carried out at ambient conditions i e atmospheric pressure and moderate temperature without the use of expensive catalysts and chemicals in such biotechnologies co2 in the biogas is chemoautotrophically converted to ch4 or other value added chemicals with renewable h2 which can be generated from water electrolysis driven by wind or solar angelidaki et al 2018 generating electricity from solar and wind has drawn increasing attention since these energy sources are renewable sustainable and clean the production cost of electricity from renewable sources has also experienced a sharp decrease during recent decades the cost of solar has fell from 0 378 kwh to 0 068 kwh dropped by 82 from 2010 to 2020 irena and is expected to continue to drop to 0 02 0 04 kwh in 2050 mayer 2015 in several european countries e g denmark 26 of electricity is generated from wind sovacool 2013 efficiently storage or utilization of the surplus electricity is important otherwise excess energy will be wasted and the power grid will be unstable carton and olabi 2010 georgilakis 2008 batteries can be utilized for storing electricity but they have the disadvantages of limited capacity to store electricity high manufacturing cost and high risk of environmental pollution caused by obsolete materials converting solar and wind energies into h2 is appealing since h2 is a clean energy that can be directly derived from water electrolysis however h2 has a very low volumetric energy density 10 88 mj m3 giving rise to difficulties for storage and its utilization as a fuel for transportation is still under development in contrast ch4 has a remarkably higher energy content 36 mj m3 than h2 with existing infrastructure for storage e g natural gas grid and has extensive applications e g as vehicle fuel therefore h2 assisted chemoautotrophic biogas upgrading technologies have excellent potential for converting intermittent energy wind solar and raw biogas to stable energy carriers biomethane that can be easily stored contributing to the development of a sustainable environmentally friendly and circular economy 2 2 1 biogas upgrading using hydrogenotrophic methanogens hydrogenotrophic methanogens are chemoautotrophic microorganisms capable of converting co2 to ch4 using h2 as an electron donor reaction 1 1 4h2 co2 ch4 2 h2o δg 130 7 kj mol a diverse range of methanogenic microorganisms including methanobacterium methanothermobacter methanobrevibacter and methanococcus harbor their particular pathways to convert h2 and co2 into ch4 fig 2 a costa and leigh 2014 zabranska and pokorna 2018 firstly co2 is reduced to methanofuran bound formyl group formyl mfr with reduced ferredoxin fdred as the electron carrier the formyl group is transferred to tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt and dehydrated to methenyl h4mpt the electron carrier f420h2 then reduces methenyl h4mpt to methylene h4mpt and further to methyl h4mpt transfer of the methyl group from methyl h4mpt to sulfhydryl coenzyme m hs com forming com ch3 is carried out by a membrane bound methyltransferase mtr com ch3 is finally reduced to ch4 accompanied by oxidation of hs com and hs cob to com s s cob heterodisulfide moreover the soluble f420 reducing hydrogenase frh catalyzes the oxidation of h2 and reduction of cofactor f420 to f420h2 while a heterodisulfide reductase hdrabc reduces oxidized ferredoxin fdox to fdred and reduces the heterodisulfide com s s cob to com sh and cob sh via electron bifurcation kaster et al 2011 during the process of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis energy is conserved by the action of mtr which expels sodium ions across the membrane forming a sodium motive force for atp synthesis the biogas upgrading configurations which use hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be divided into three categories in situ ex situ and hybrid technologies kougias et al 2017 the in situ biogas upgrading technology has the advantage of low capital investment without the need for extra infrastructure for this technology h2 is directly delivered into anaerobic digesters to stimulate activity of endogenous hydrogenotrophic methanogens therefore promoting co2 conversion to ch4 in situ biogas upgrading has been successfully achieved in anaerobic digesters treating various organics including manure luo et al 2012 and food waste okoro shekwaga et al 2019 table 1 in this way ch4 content can generally be enhanced to 75 and up to 100 reported by agneessens et al 2017 table 1 luo angelidaki 2013a found that in situ supply of h2 to an anaerobic reactor co digesting manure and whey enhanced the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens enriching methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus in the system in addition temperature was found to be crucial in shaping microbial communities and h2 utilization pathway in situ biogas upgrading reactors zhu et al 2019 under mesophilic conditions 35 c the majority of h2 was utilized by both aceticlastic methanogens and homoacetogens in contrast under thermophilic conditions 55 c h2 was mostly consumed for supporting cell growth and a portion of h2 was used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens and aceticlastic methanogens zhu et al 2019 for the ex situ technology biogas supplied from an external source is introduced into an anaerobic reactor together with h2 giving rise to bioconversion of h2 and co2 to biomethane via hydrogenotrophic methanogens table 2 for instance bassani et al 2015 designed a biogas upgrading system integrating two continuous stirred tank reactors with one reactor for biogas production and another for biogas upgrading biomethane with ch4 purity above 85 was produced under both thermophilic and mesophilic conditions when h2 was injected into the second reactor it was found that the introduction of h2 promoted the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanoculleus kougias et al 2017 achieved methane purity 98 using a bubble column reactor for ex situ biogas upgrading microbial community analysis indicated that a mba08 a potential acetogen affiliated to clostridia as well as hydrogenotrophic methanogens including methanothermobacter and methanoculleus became the dominant genera the hybrid technology combines in situ and ex situ biogas upgrading into an integrated system in which a portion of co2 is captured by the in situ technology to produce a higher grade biogas followed by the ex situ process for further removing residual co2 for example a hybrid system consisting of two thermophilic upflow reactors was set up by corbellini et al 2018 h2 was injected into the first reactor fed with cattle manure and potato starch for in situ biogas upgrading and an enriched hydrogenotrophic culture was inoculated into the second reactor for ex situ biogas upgrading biomethane with 91 ch4 content and a ch4 production rate of 355 ml ch4 lreactor day was attained at steady state the utilization of co2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the second reactor helped to buffer the ph drop induced by production of volatile fatty acids vfas in the first reactor 2 2 2 biogas upgrading using homoacetogens a new concept gaining attention is the conversion of co2 in biogas into value added liquid chemicals while simultaneously upgrading biogas to biomethane using homoacetogens various homoacetogens e g clostridium scatologenes liu et al 2018 c autoethanogenum heffernan et al 2020 and acetobacterium woodii cheng et al 2018 are capable of producing biofuels or their precursors e g acetate butyrate and ethanol using hydrogen as the electron donor and co2 as the carbon source table 3 compared to ch4 these biofuels or liquid chemicals have higher energy density and commercial value and are more convenient for storage and transportation the majority of homoacetogens utilize h2 and co2 to produce acetate reaction 2 via the wood ljungdahl pathway reductive acetyl coa pathway fig 2b latif et al 2014 schiel bengelsdorf and dürre 2012 wood 1991 which is the most efficient metabolic pathway for carbon fixation and energy generation lever 2016 the conversion of co2 is associated with two branches the carbonyl and methyl branches while acetyl coa serves as the main intermediate and precursor for liquid chemicals production in the carbonyl branch co2 is reduced to co catalyzed by the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthase complex codh acs in the methyl branch co2 is successively reduced to formyl tetrahydrofolate thf methyl thf and further methyl cofesp co and methyl cofesp are then bound to generate acetyl coa catalyzed by the codh acs reducing equivalents electrons are acquired through h2 oxidation catalyzed by hydrogenase and are conserved in the form of nad p h and ferredoxin which serve as electron donors for reducing co2 acetyl coa is then converted to acetate catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase ragsdale and pierce 2008 several acetogens e g c autoethanogenum and c ljungdahlii can also generate ethanol with acetaldehyde as the intermediate catalyzed by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ald aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase adhe and alcohol dehydrogenase adh liew et al 2017 longer chain fatty acids e g butyrate can be generated by chain elongation reactions batlle vilanova et al 2017 2 2co2 4h2 ch3coo h 2h2o δg 95 kj mol compared to a pure culture mixed cultures are more versatile considering their co2 conversion process does not require sterilization simplifying process operation the reduction of co2 to diverse organic acids including acetate propionate butyrate valerate and hexanoate has been reported using a mixed culture supplied with h2 levy et al 1981 zhang et al 2013 acetogens e g c kluyveri and c ljungdahlii in the mixed culture are reported to play crucial roles in co2 conversion zhang et al 2013 although homoacetogens exhibit potential for value added chemical production from co2 there is limited application of homoacetogens for biogas upgrading omar et al 2018 2019 zhao et al 2020 an interesting study was carried out by zhao et al 2020 in which a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr inoculated with homoacetogen c ragsdalei p11 was employed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production they upgraded biogas to biomethane with ch4 content up to 97 6 and obtained acetate and ethanol production rates of 37 8 and 13 5 mmol l 1d 1 respectively omar et al 2018 2019 also achieved co2 conversion to alcohols or vfas with moorella sp or acetoanaerobium noterae as the major functional microorganisms these findings indicate that in addition methanogens homoacetogens are also suitable for biogas upgrading however because the final products converted from h2 and co2 by homoacetogens are generally mixed chemicals i e mixed organics and alcohols rather than a single product it is challenging to extract these products from reactor systems more exploration is required to make homoacetogen dependent biogas upgrading a feasible and widely adopted biotechnology in the future 3 key barriers of current biotechnologies for biogas upgrading 3 1 metabolic limitations in in situ biogas upgrading the in situ biogas upgrading process relies on existing infrastructure i e anaerobic digesters for h2 addition having the advantages of simplicity and low construction cost however metabolic limitation associated with vfas accumulation dramatic ph change and co2 depletion is a big issue in situ biogas upgrading typically leading to low biomethane production rate and ch4 content fu et al 2020a simon 2015 the ad process is composed of four steps including hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis complex organics are firstly hydrolyzed to monomers hydrolysis which are then fermented to alcohols and vfas e g acetate butyrate and propionate acidogenesis these chemicals are further bio converted to h2 co2 formate and acetate acetogenesis which are utilized as substrates by methanogens for generating ch4 methanogenesis li et al 2019 therefore the syntrophic interactions among different functional microorganisms play a critical role in sustaining ad performance and stability sudden introduction of a high amount of h2 could result in imbalance among syntrophic microorganisms hydrolyzing bacteria acetogens and methanogens thus influencing not only methanogenesis but also the three upstream steps for example exogenous h2 addition could suppress the activity of syntrophic bacteria for degrading vfas and alcohols because acetogenesis is thermodynamically unfavorable when h2 concentration is high 10 pa batstone et al 2002 liu and whitman 2008 the accumulated vfas e g propionate concentration 900 mg l could exhibit inhibitory effects on methanogens wang et al 2009 additionally h2 introduction may stimulate homoacetogens thus promoting co2 conversion to acetate with h2 if acetate consumption rate cannot keep up with its production rate the overall ad process would be suppressed mulat et al 2017 a ph range of 6 8 to 7 4 has been recommended for maintaining optimal synergistic reactions in the ad process dohányos et al 2001 nevertheless the accumulation of vfas and alcohols in anaerobic digesters induced by direct h2 introduction could cause acidification leading to deterioration of the biological processes in ad angelidaki et al 2018 on the contrary it is worth noting that the methanogenic process could create alkaline conditions according to ionization reaction 4 the consumption of co2 by methanogens could result in reduction of h in the liquid phase thus increasing ph typically a ph of 8 5 is the threshold for optimal methanogenesis while a higher ph would restrict the activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens angelidaki et al 2018 o flaherty et al 1998 4 h2o co2 h hco3 it has also been observed that co2 could be depleted by hydrogenotrophic methanogens when the ratio of h2 to co2 is higher than 4 1 luo and angelidaki 2013a on one hand the depletion of co2 will limit the carbon source for hydrogenotrophic methanogens thus negatively influencing methanogenesis process liu and whitman 2008 on the other hand homoacetogens that have low h2 affinity inversely related to the h2 saturation constant ks may have competitive advantages over hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 when co2 concentration is low and h2 concentration is high agneessens et al 2018 collectively although in situ biogas upgrading is a promising approach for improving ch4 content in biogas respective microorganisms associated with the four functional steps in the ad process are interactive it is critical to optimally balance the syntrophic and methanogenic activities to maximize biomethane production from biogas 3 2 low hydrogen gas transfer rate one of the major challenges for h2 assisted biogas upgrading technology is the low h2 transfer rate from the gas to the liquid phase which is caused by the quite low h2 solubility 1 6 mg l under 20 c and 101 kpa kaye and laby 1986 because the biological processes occur mainly in liquid phase h2 must transfer across the interface between the gas and the liquid phase to be accessible to hydrogenotrophic microorganisms as a consequence the low h2 transfer rate is a major rate limiting step for hydrogenotrophic bio processes this issue is particularly serious for the in situ biogas upgrading process due to the very limited h2 penetration even massive h2 is introduced into biogas upgrading systems h2 is only available to superficial margins of the methanogenic consortium due to limited h2 mass transfer in anaerobic fermenting sludge matrix aryal et al 2018 garcia robledo et al 2016 the typical equation for describing the rate of h2 diffusion in a liquid is shown in eq 5 5 rt 22 4 kla h2gth h21 where rt represents h2 mass transfer rate mol l h kla represents linear gas transfer coefficient h 1 h2gth represents h2 concentration in gas phase mol l and h2l is measured dissolved h2 in liquid phase mol l moreover proper h2 diffusion equipment is needed since unused h2 easily escapes from the system the resultant low gas utilization efficiency will significantly increase the cost of h2 supply therefore decreasing the economic benefits in addition the h2 which escapes could form a combustible localised atmosphere posing safety risks 3 3 limited production rates of biomethane and value added chemicals the production rate of biomethane via in situ and ex situ methanogenesis processes are typically in the range of 0 1 1 l lreactor day and 0 1 3 l lreactor day respectively while the production rate of liquid chemicals e g acetate via homoacetogens is generally less than 5 g l d table 1 6 a higher production rate is required to make the biological biogas upgrading process more economically viable and technically feasible for industrial applications homoacetogens are efficient in converting co2 with h2 to multiple chemicals daniell et al 2012 but homoacetogenesis exhibits very low selectivity for final products although acetate is the predominant final product converted from co2 the target chemicals are multicarbon molecules such as butyrate ethanol butanol and 2 3 butanediol which have much higher commercial value than acetate for instance it was found that moorella sp generated 40 times higher concentration of acetate than ethanol with provision of co2 and h2 even when the ph 5 8 was optimal for ethanol production sakai et al 2005 moreover the concentrations of butyrate caproate and caprylate were 1 8 0 98 and 0 42 g l respectively which is much lower than the acetate concentration 7 4 g l produced in an mbfr system supplied with h2 zhang et al 2013 4 potential solutions for overcoming barriers 4 1 relieving metabolic limitation in in situ biogas upgrading pulsed h2 addition could be a feasible strategy to relieve metabolic limitation for in situ biogas upgrading agneessens et al 2017 it has been found that as long as the concentration ratio of injected h2 to daily produced co2 from ad is less than 8 1 the ph rise was limited to 0 17 while co2 concentration could be maintained above 11 8 thus eliminating negative impacts induced by alkalization and co2 depletion the ch4 content in the raw biogas can be upgraded to 100 provided that the h2 to co2 ratio exceeds 6 1 while the accumulated vfas were far below their inhibitory concentration the pulsed h2 injection could stimulate the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanobacteriales and methanomicrobiales giving rise to an increased h2 uptake rate agneessens et al 2017 as mentioned in section 3 1 the ph in anaerobic digesters tends to decrease during acidogenesis and increase in methanogenesis the ph balance associated with the two steps is crucial for maintaining favourable microbial metabolism involved in both anaerobic digestion and in situ biogas upgrading the vfa producing potential of feedstocks impacts the trends in ph feeding substrate that contains highly abundant organics e g food waste yu et al 2018 readily induces excessive acidification during organic decomposition co digestion of different feedstocks could be a strategy for avoiding dramatic ph change for instance waste activated sludge a substrate that can release nh4 to buffer acidity has been generally used for co digestion with food waste dai et al 2013 nevertheless if the feedstock has low vfa producing potential e g cattle slurry the vfas generated from acidogenesis might not be sufficient to buffer the increased alkalinity from methanogenesis in order to prevent a dramatic ph increase by methanogenesis luo angelidaki 2013a carried out co digestion of manure and acidic whey for in situ biogas upgrading consequently the ph was maintained below 8 0 and the introduced h2 was almost 100 utilized for co2 conversion to ch4 the degradation of vfas e g propionate is thermodynamically favourable giving rise to minor vfa accumulation in effluent in addition operational parameters of stock feeding e g the organic loading rate are also crucial in controlling ph agneessens et al 2018 additives such as biochar zhang et al 2020 zero valent iron zvi su et al 2013 and ash yin et al 2019 have potential to accelerate methanogenesis for in situ biogas upgrading biochar supplementation can provide additional nutrients e g p k ca and mg to boost the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens shen et al 2015 for example biochar amendment was found to selectively enrich methanothermobacter and methanosarcina in a thermophilic anaerobic digester treating food waste zhang et al 2020 su et al 2013 assessed the impact of nano zvi zero valent iron on an anaerobic digester treating sewage sludge and found the ch4 content in biogas increased by 5 13 with the amendment of 0 10 wt of nano zvi hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was promoted by enhanced h2 generation from anaerobic corrosion of zvi dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 additionally it has also been reported that stepwise introduction of ash could promote methanogenesis via inhibiting the activity of hydrolytic and acidifying enzymes while improving the activity of coenzyme f420 which is critical to methanogenesis thus leading to a 10 increase in ch4 content of biogas in an anaerobic digester yin et al 2019 since introducing additives leads to increased treatment costs and potentially negative impacts on the environment low cost and environmentally compatible alternatives need to be developed compared to the in situ process ex situ biogas upgrading in which biogas production and biogas upgrading take place separately has fewer microbial metabolic limitations and higher flexibility firstly the ex situ biogas upgrading process performed by hydrogenotrophic microorganisms proceeds in a separate unit without imposing negative impacts on the ad process secondly the biological processes involved are easier to control and adjust with minor interference of organics moreover the ex situ biogas upgrading unit can be flexibly connected to a remote power source angelidaki et al 2018 making the integrated system more controllable 4 2 enhancing h2 mass transfer rate and utilization efficiency by optimizing reactor configuration and operational conditions the major challenge for implementing both in situ and ex situ biogas upgrading is h2 mass transfer limitation according to eq 5 the h2 transfer rate can be improved by enhancing kla which is dependent on reactor configuration and operating conditions bassani et al 2017 pauss et al 1990 luo and angelidaki 2012 established a reactor equipped with a continuous stirrer for maintaining liquid homogeneity and a gassing device for introducing h2 and biogas when the speed was increased from 500 to 800 rpm in the continuously stirred tank reactor cstr the biogas loading rate increased from 12 to 24 l lreactor day while the ch4 content in the upgraded biogas was maintained at 90 however h2 mass transfer rate was still the limiting factor for efficient h2 utilization in this system for in situ biogas upgrading the intense mixing leads to high shear forces which disrupt synergistic associations between h2 producing fermenters and h2 utilizing methanogens microorganisms thereby slowing down or disrupting both fermentation and methanogenesis in addition the intense mixing consumes a lot of energy and continuous stirring is not appropriate for industrial application in order to overcome h2 transfer limitation a series of new reactor designs have been developed including the bubble column reactor solid state bioreactor trickling bed reactor biofilm plug flow reactor and hollow fiber mbfr for efficient biogas upgrading fig 3 bubble column reactor the bubble column reactor which generally has a high height width ratio is equipped with gas diffusers e g stainless steel diffusers or alumina ceramic membranes for h2 dispersion fig 3b bassani et al 2017 the h2 mass transfer rate was improved by changing the diffuser pore size e g increasing diameter from 0 4 µm to 2 µm and gas recirculation rate and installing a ceramic sponge above the h2 diffusers bassani et al 2016 2017 by employing this system for ex situ biogas upgrading bassani et al 2017 achieved a ch4 yield of 0 25 lch4 lh2 and biomethane purity of 96 moreover it was reported that the bubble column reactor has a much higher efficiency for biogas upgrading 98 ch4 content in the output gas than the cstr 79 ch4 content in the output gas with the same gas feeding rate kougias et al 2017 solid state bioreactor the unique feature of the solid state bioreactor is the packing of solid particle materials e g vermiculite and granular perlite for immobilizing functional microorganisms e g methanogens fig 3c the high specific surface area of the particles creates sufficient contact among microorganisms gas and liquid thus increasing the gas transfer rate rittmann et al 2015 the ex situ biogas upgrading potential of a fixed bed bioreactor composed of two solid state reactors in series was assessed by alitalo et al 2015 in which a maximal methane productivity of 6 35 l lreactor d and a hydrogen conversion rate of 100 were obtained in addition waste materials e g wood ash can be mixed in the packing materials as inorganic nutrient for supporting the growth of methanogens alitalo et al 2015 trickle bed reactor the trickle bed reactor contains carriers for biofilm attachment supplied with a continuous liquid flow for wetting the biofilm and providing nutrients fig 3d burkhardt and busch 2013 this reactor design creates a unique three phase biofilm liquid gas structure which has a high concentration gradient and a quick diffusion route ensuring a high gas transfer rate in addition the specific surface area of the carriers could further confer a high h2 and co2 conversion efficiency gas recirculation an energy consuming process that has been commonly used in other reactor designs is not necessary in the trickle bed reactor the use of this system for biological methanation from h2 and co2 was tested in a study by burkhardt et al 2015 which achieved a ch4 production rate of 1 17 nm3 m3 d and 100 h2 utilization efficiency moreover rachbauer et al 2016 operated a trickle bed reactor inoculated with hydrogenotrophic culture and fed the reactor with h2 and raw biogas under mesophilic conditions with a gas retention time of 2 3 h the biogas could be upgraded to biomethane 96 at a productivity of 2 52 m3 ch4 m3 reactor vol d equivalent to a biogas upgrading capacity of 6 9 m3 biogas m3 reactor vol d rachbauer et al 2016 biofilm plug flow reactor an innovative biofilm plug flow reactor was also proposed for biogas upgrading savvas et al 2017 a pvc tube 7 m length and 13 mm internal diameter containing polyethylene wheels as carriers for attaching biofilm was hung on a frame to form vertical loops biogas was continuously fed through the tube while liquid medium was recirculated very slowly 10 ml min after reaching steady state the tube was placed horizontally and gas was uniformly delivered across the biofilms which were kept wet via intermittently introduced medium with this configuration the gas residence time and the effective volume of the biofilms were maximized giving rise to 99 co2 conversion efficiency at total gas flux rate of 100 v v d with highest reported methane evolution rate of 40 v v d moreover a high mass transfer rate was achieved without the gas liquid agitation which was generally used for cstr minimizing energy consumption hollow fiber mbfr the mbfr has also been utilized in both in situ and ex situ biogas upgrading processes the core component of the mbfr system is the gas permeable hollow fiber membranes which not only provide a suitable surface for microorganisms to grow and form biofilms lai et al 2016a 2016b 2018a 2018b ontiveros valencia et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 but also confer a high gas utilizing efficiency and transfer rate that is not achievable via gas sparging fig 3e martin and nerenberg 2012 when delivered through the membrane lumen h2 efficiently disperses through the membrane wall to the biofilm on the outer surface luo and angelidaki 2013 achieved a ch4 content 90 by installing bubble less hollow fibers in an anaerobic reactor digesting cattle manure and whey luo and angelidaki 2013b díaz et al 2015 further set up a pilot scale mbfr for converting h2 and co2 to ch4 demonstrating a kla of 430 h 1 biomethane yield of 0 22 lch4 lh2 and biomethane purity of 95 ch4 with a maximum h2 loading rate of 40 2 l l reactor d interestingly when the mbfr was inoculated with a mixed culture from an anaerobic digester zhang et al 2014 achieved bio conversion of co2 and h2 to multiple value added chemicals including acetate butyrate and medium chain fatty acids caproate and caprylate with 100 hydrogen utilization efficiency in general increasing reactor pressure and gassing rate promotes the rate of gas liquid mass transfer thereby improving the purity of upgraded biomethane and the volumetric biomethane production rate seifert et al 2014 in addition temperature significantly impacts methanogenesis and gas fermentation it has been reported that for an in situ biogas upgrading system the co2 and h2 conversion rate was 60 higher under thermophilic conditions than that with mesophilic temperatures 37 luo and angelidaki 2012 although higher temperature resulted in lower gas dissolution 4 3 bioelectrochemical system bes as an innovative technique for biogas upgrading biogas upgrading using bes has drawn considerable interest owing to multiple advantages including low energy input ability to recover multiple resources from wastes and generation of value added chemicals bajracharya et al 2017 zeppilli et al 2019 bes assisted co2 conversion is also resistant to fluctuations in electricity supply potentially able to overcome the instability of renewable energy in practical applications rojas et al 2018 a membrane e g proton exchange membrane pem or anion exchange membrane aem is generally installed to divide the bes system into anode and cathode chambers and external power is required to overcome the kinetic and thermodynamic limitation of the biological reactions fig 3f villano et al 2012 typically organics lu and ren 2016 or water van eerten jansen et al 2012 are decomposed at the anode transferring electrons to the cathode where h2 is generated and then utilized by methanogens for biogas upgrading alternatively electroactive methanogens carry out co2 reduction by directly utilizing electrons from electrodes through extracellular electron transfer villano et al 2010 alkali production and co2 absorption could also favor biogas upgrading in the bes xu et al 2014 moreover h2s in the raw biogas can be removed via microbial or electrochemical h2s oxidation generally with sulfur or sulfate as the final products buisman et al 1990 guiot et al 1997 ni et al 2019 tartakovsky et al 2014 in a reported in situ bes assisted biogas upgrading process electrodes were directly placed into an anaerobic reactor to generate h2 or electrons for co2 reduction table 4 tartakovsky et al 2011 a portion of h2 was utilized by methanogens to convert co2 to ch4 to purify the biogas while the presence of o2 facilitated hydrolysis of organics and desulphurization of biogas tartakovsky et al 2011 bes has been found to shorten stabilization time and boost organic and vfa degradation for anaerobic digestion tartakovsky et al 2014 moreover bes is an attractive approach for simultaneous ex situ biogas upgrading and resource recovery table 5 an innovative three chamber bes was established to simultaneously upgrade biogas treat digestate and recover ammonia zeppilli et al 2019 an aem and a cem were installed to divide the system into one anode chamber in the middle and two cathode chambers on two sides biogas was injected into the cem cathode chamber while digestate containing a high concentration of organics and nh4 was introduced into the anode chamber in this system organics were decomposed in the anode chamber while co2 in the biogas was removed in both cathode chambers via methanogenesis and co2 sorption due to alkali production via methanogenesis zeppilli et al 2019 the process of methanogenesis in the cem cathode could also drive nh4 migration from the anode chamber for maintaining electroneutrality thereby enabling the recovery of concentrated ammonium in this chamber recently fu et al 2020 set up a bes equipped with a proton exchange membrane and added ferrous ion into the anode chamber for simultaneously upgrading biogas and sulfur recovery when biogas was injected into the system sulfide was oxidized to recoverable sulfur particles via a ferrous ion mediated redox reaction in the anode chamber fu et al 2020b meanwhile h2 was generated via incorporation of electrons from the cathode and protons that migrated from the anode during sulfide oxidation the h2 generated was then used for driving co2 conversion to ch4 through the action of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathode chamber it is worth noting that co2 conversion to value added liquid chemicals e g formate zhao et al 2012 acetate jourdin et al 2015 and ethanol anwer et al 2019 can also be realized by bes table 6 acetogens such as c ljungdahlii jabeen and farooq 2016 and sporomusa ovata im et al 2016 can survive and catalyze bioelectrochemical reactions in a bes for example using a bes jourdin et al 2015 achieved a high acetate production rate up to 685 g m 2 day 1 and final acetate concentration of 11 g l with electron and co2 utilization efficiency at 94 and 100 respectively electrodes with advanced or modified materials e g cobalt tetra amino phthalocyanine and multiwalled carbon nanotubes zhao et al 2012 synthesized epd 3d electrodes jourdin et al 2015 and mno2 coated carbon felt anwer et al 2019 are to promote co2 conversion and liquid chemicals production moreover the spectrum of chemicals produced from bes can be expanded to longer chain fatty acids which have higher commercial value than acetate generally both acetate and ethanol are needed by acetogens for chain elongation however in the bes h2 or electrons from the cathode could act as electron donors for producing acetate and ethanol which are combined to generate longer chain fatty acids via chain elongation prévoteau et al 2020 for example by employing a laboratory scale bes installed with carbon felt electrodes the production rates of co2 derived butyrate and caproate can reach up to 3 2 and 0 95 g l 1 day 1 respectively jourdin et al 2018 although a few studies have demonstrated the potential of bes for biogas upgrading and value added chemicals production it is still at an early stage of development most of bes systems are lab scale studies using bio reactors of a few liters with drawbacks including low current densities low production yields high capital cost of electrodes and membrane and biofouling thus hampering economical scale up christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 promising strategies are proposed to make bes more suitable for industrial application e g inoculating bes with highly active genetically engineered microorganisms as discussed below 4 4 maximizing production of targeted chemicals using genetic engineering tools genetic modification using technologies such as genetic recombination gene overexpressing and in frame deletion of targeted genes is a powerful way to reprogram metabolic pathways to obtain the desired carbon transformation recently a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to constructing genetically engineered microorganisms for improving the concentration and production rate of value added chemicals batstone et al 2002 bi et al 2013 chakravarty and brigham 2018 khan et al 2014 liew et al 2017 murphy et al 2020 although genetic engineering is an effective approach for reinforcing microbial co2 conversion and controllably generating value added multicarbon molecules its applications in biogas upgrading are extremely limited here we put forward several potential strategies including carbon flux redirection co2 fixation reinforcement and more advanced genetic engineering technologies which potentially can be employed for maximizing desired value added chemical production during biogas upgrading fig 4 4 4 1 redirecting carbon flux reconstructing microbial metabolic networks using genetic engineering tools is a useful approach for generating the desired products from co2 by using such a strategy carbon flux is redirected from general pathways to targeted pathways for synthesizing chemicals of interest in fact a few hydrogenotrophic methanogens have been genetically modified to realize co2 conversion to value added chemicals e g geraniol and isoprene that have a much higher commercial value than ch4 lyu et al 2016 murphy et al 2020 recombinant methanogen methanococcus maripaludis was constructed with the insertion of an exogenous gene encoding geraniol synthase lyu et al 2016 this modified strain was able to convert co2 to geraniol with the supply of h2 thus generating geraniol at 2 8 mg g of cell dry weight similarly recombinant expression of isoprene synthase in methanosarcina acetivorans yielded isoprene murphy et al 2020 moreover ch4 conversion to lactate was achieved by constructing a recombinant methanosarcina acetivorans cloned with three genes associated with mcr for activating ch4 by the reverse methanogenesis pathway and one gene involved in 3 hydroxybutyryl coa dehydrogenase hbd for generating lactate mcanulty et al 2017 in addition to methanogens other anaerobic or aerobic hydrogenotrophic bacteria have also been genetically manipulated toward synthesising desired products a woodii an anaerobic bacterium able to grow with h2 and co2 has been engineered with a pathway to divert carbon flow to acetate with accumulation of up to 51 g l of acetate within 3 8 days genes involved in the wood ljungdahl pathway e g acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase were overexpressed straub et al 2014 likewise modifying the ethanol synthesis route via inactivating aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase adhe in c autoethanogenum was found to raise ethanol production up to 180 over the wildtype strain liew et al 2017 of particular interest some aerobic gas fermenting bacteria e g cupriavidus necator ralstonia eutropha and rhodobacter capsulatus have been genetically engineered for producing highly valuable biofuels and chemicals e g pentadecane methyl ketones heptadecane and botryococcene with the supply of h2 bi et al 2013 chakravarty and brigham 2018 khan et al 2014 krieg et al 2018 engineered cupriavidus necator to heterologously express α humulene synthase and the mevalonate pathway supplied with h2 and o2 this engineered strain converted co2 to terpene α humulene an important compound in medicine perfumes and advanced biofuels with a product content of 10 mg α humulene g cell dry mass 4 4 2 reinforcing co2 fixation by converting heterotrophs to autotrophs compared to autotrophs heterotrophs growing on organics like sucrose glycerol and glucose are more widely applied for industrial scale production of various chemicals due to their high activity and versatility nevertheless using these organic feedstocks for biotechnological manufacturing competes with their use as food and animal feeds therefore it is more sustainable and economically viable if co2 in the biogas can be utilized as a carbon source by heterotrophs for producing desired chemicals engineering heterotrophs to be autotrophic microorganisms is a promising approach to achieve this objective for example although the wild type archaeon pyrococcus furiosus cannot utilize co2 a recombinant strain can express heterologous genes involved in the hydroxypropionate hydroxybutylate 3 hp 4 hb cycle for co2 fixation after insertion of a related operon thus conferring the ability to convert h2 and co2 to 3 hydroxypropionate keller et al 2013 in order to produce a high yield of chemicals like butanol from co2 fast papoutsakis 2018 engineered core heterologous genes associated with the wood ljungdahl pathway from autotrophic c ljungdahlii to c acetobutylicum which are wild type obligate heterotrophs furthermore by endogenous metabolic network rewiring and continuous laboratory evolution gleizer et al 2019 reconstructed an escherichia coli which fixed co2 autotrophically via the calvin benson bassham cbb pathway and acquired reducing power and energy from formate that was produced electrochemically 4 4 3 advanced genetic engineering techniques for biogas upgrading with the rapid development of tools for genetic engineering and synthetic biology progress towards highly efficient and accurately targeted production of biofuels and chemicals from co2 is gathering pace crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats is a powerful and sophisticated technology enabling high throughput genetic screening and scarless metabolic pathway modification some acetogens e g c ljungdahlii huang et al 2016 and c autoethanogenum nagaraju et al 2016 have been genetically edited using crispr cas9 for influencing metabolic co2 co conversion to ethanol genome scale metabolic models gems are another robust tool for targeted chemicals production by computationally integrating genomic transcriptomic and proteomic data gems support a global and comprehensive view of metabolism enabling prediction of metabolic fluxes and further facilitation of reconstructing desired metabolic networks reed et al 2003 roberts et al 2010 although the aforementioned techniques may be employed for converting co2 to value added chemicals application of these genetic engineering technologies in biogas upgrading is extremely limited and requires further exploration 5 conclusions and perspectives upgrading biogas to biomethane improves the calorific value of biogas and broadens the range of application compared to the challenges of physicochemical methods that need expensive catalysts or intensive energy h2 driven biogas upgrading is promising particularly from a long term perspective considering that the cost of h2 from water hydrolysis powered by renewable wind and solar energy is consistently declining the biological h2 driven biogas upgrading process consists of two approaches i using hydrogenotrophic methanogens to convert co2 with h2 to ch4 and ii employing homoacetogens to convert co2 and h2 into value added chemicals fig 5 based on substantial progress from lab scale studies focusing on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for biogas upgrading several large scale plants have been established so far located in allendorf germany biopower2gas is the first commercial biological h2 driven biogas plant in the world bailera et al 2017 in this plant h2 is generated by a 2 150 kwe electrolyser and delivered into the biogas reactor from the base for biological methanation with co2 at a loading of 15 nm3 h consequently the ch4 content in biogas increased from 50 to 75 in addition an in situ biogas upgrading plant was established in foulum denmark a 1200 m3 thermophilic reactor was fed with agricultural waste at an organic loading rate of 4 6 vs l reactor d and injected with up to 33 5 m3 h2 jensen et al 2018 moreover electrochaea constructed an ex situ biogas upgrading plant in foulum denmark a 10 000 liter reactor was inoculated with methanogens and supplied with h2 generated by a 1 mwe alkaline electrolyser which was powered by excess wind power thereby converting raw biogas to biomethane with ch4 content 97 bailera et al 2017 electrochaea 2021 in addition to methanogens homoacetogens also show potential for utilization in biogas upgrading different from methanogens homoacetogens are able to generate a broad range of value added chemicals which are more transportable and commercially valuable than ch4 although conversion of co2 and h2 to fatty acids e g acetate propionate and butyrate and alcohol e g ethanol by homoacetogens has been extensively studied application in biogas upgrading e g using mbfr and bes systems is still in early stage lanzatech a company which develops advanced technologies for gas fermentation is employing homoacetogens to convert syngas gas mixture of h2 co2 and co to liquid fuels the commercialization potential of biogas upgrading using homoacetogens is worth exploring technical bottlenecks for implementing industrial scale h2 driven biogas upgrading include h2 mass transfer limitation jensen et al 2018 in order to address these issues improved reactor designs and appropriate genetic manipulation are necessary to enable biogas upgrading with high h2 and co2 conversion efficiency and final products selectivity moreover integrating different functional microorganisms using two stage biological processes is a promising strategy to realize co2 and h2 conversion to specialty chemicals e g triacylglycerides and single cell proteins scps that cannot be efficiently synthesized by pure culture hu et al 2016 molitor et al 2019 for example using two stage design 18 g l of c16 c18 triacylglycerides was generated by integrating homoacetogen moorella thermoacetica and metabolically engineered yeast yarrowia lipolytica hu et al 2016 and a scps mass fraction of 40 50 in cells was produced by combination of c ljungdahlii and saccharomyces cerevisiae molitor et al 2019 this review summarizes recent findings in biological h2 dependent biogas upgrading technologies this review particularly highlights key challenges associated with the current technologies such as metabolic limitations low h2 transfer rate and limited co2 conversion rate more importantly we also propose new strategies for overcoming technical barriers including process optimization to eliminate metabolic limitation novel reactor designs to improve hydrogen gas transfer rate and utilization efficiency as well as employing advanced genetic engineering tools to improve biogas upgrading efficiency and rate it is expected that the insights offered

17055,as a clean and renewable energy biogas is an important alternative to fossil fuels however the high carbon dioxide co2 content in biogas limits its value as a fuel biogas upgrading is an advanced process which removes co2 from biogas thereby converting biogas to biomethane which has a higher commercial value microbial technologies offer a sustainable and cost effective way to upgrade biogas removing co2 using hydrogen h2 as electron donor generated by surplus electricity from renewable wind or solar energy hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be applied to convert co2 with h2 to methane ch4 or alternatively homoacetogens can convert both co2 and h2 into value added chemicals here we comprehensively review the current state of biogas generation and utilization and describe the advances in biological h2 dependent biogas upgrading technologies with particular attention to key challenges associated with the processes e g metabolic limitations low h2 transfer rate and finite co2 conversion rate we also highlight several new strategies for overcoming technical barriers to achieve efficient co2 conversion including process optimization to eliminate metabolic limitation novel reactor designs to improve h2 transfer rate and utilization efficiency and employing advanced genetic engineering tools to generate more efficient microorganisms the insights offered in this review will promote further exploration into microbial h2 driven biogas upgrading towards addressing the global energy crisis and climate change associated with use of fossil fuels graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biogas upgrading biomethane carbon dioxide methanogens homoacetogens genetic engineering 1 global biogas production and utilization with rapid economic development urbanization and population growth global primary energy consumption grew by 2 9 in 2018 reaching 13 87 billion tonnes oil equivalent bp 2019 while over past decades the world has been heavily dependent on fossil fuels e g oil coal and natural gas as the main source of energy fossil fuels are expected to be depleted within 200 years shafiee and topal 2009 in addition large amounts of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 are released during the burning of fossil fuels causing serious environmental issues including global warming and climate change for example a new high of 136 billion tonnes of co2 was calculated to be released into the atmosphere in 2018 caused by fossil fuels combustion le quéré et al 2018 therefore a renewable energy transition is required to alleviate the depletion of fossil fuels and dramatically reduce the global carbon footprint in contrast to fossil fuels biomass is a clean and renewable energy source with huge reserves it is estimated that the total global production of biomass is approximately 150 billion metric tons annually balat and ayar 2005 however much of the biomass ends up in waste streams including sewage food wastes straw stalks horticulture residues and livestock manure the energy embedded in biomass can be recovered by anaerobic digestion ad a robust and widely applied bioprocess that converts waste organic carbon to biogas an important biofuel with methane ch4 as the main component it has been estimated that at least 25 of all bioenergy can originate from biogas in the future holm nielsen et al 2009 there are currently 130 000 small to large scale digesters and 50 million micro digesters in operation around the world jain 2019 even though the energy derived from current ad facilities is huge only 1 6 2 2 of the potential of ad has been unlocked due to limitations in collection storage and transport equipment systems irena 2019 if the majority of feedstocks could be sustainably captured the ad process has the potential to generate 10 100 to 14 000 twh of energy equivalent to 6 9 of global primary energy consumption iea 2018 furthermore by capturing carbon from various biomass the ad process is potentially able to reduce 3000 4000 million metric tonnes of co2 which is more than 10 of global greenhouse gas ghg emission jain 2019 in addition the global biogas industry is experiencing extraordinary growth international renewable energy agency irena statistics show that the quantity of global electricity generated from biogas in 2016 was twice as much as that in 2010 irena 2019 therefore biogas production from the ad process significantly contributes to not only energy supply but also carbon emission reduction energy extraction and ghg mitigation via ad is particularly important for wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are large energy consumers and ghg emitters for example the electricity consumed by wwtps in the united states comprises 3 4 of the country s total energy demand wrf 2013 while the cost of electricity accounts for over 30 of total costs at wwtps nationally usepa 2010 however a large amount of energy is embedded in wastewater mainly in the form of sewage sludge equivalent to around 13 mj kg chemical oxygen demand cod gandiglio et al 2017 this is 3 5 times the amount of energy required for the overall wastewater treatment process werf 2014 if all available wastewater is treated via ad globally the generated biogas has the potential to provide 210 to 300 twh of energy equivalent to the energy demand of 27 38 million people jain 2019 therefore efficient utilization of biogas from ad in wwtps will enable a paradigm shift in wastewater treatment from an energy consuming to an energy neutral or energy positive process and accelerate the development of a green circular economy for the water treatment industry europe is leading the world in biogas production and utilization with 17 783 biogas plants an annual yield of 30 billion cubic meters bcm of biogas and 63 511 gwh of electricity generated from biogas in 2018 fig 1 in europe 74 of biogas is generated from anaerobic digestion of energy crops manure and agricultural waste 17 of biogas is derived from landfill and 9 of biogas is from sewage sludge in wwtps scarlat et al 2018 the biogas produced in europe is mainly used for heat and electricity generation with electrical efficiency of 30 45 through using gas engines van foreest 2012 in germany for instance more than 800 wwtps utilize biogas for generating electricity 900 gwh year or heat 1800 gwh year which can support a quarter of total energy required by the wwtps dos santos et al 2016 recently a new renewable energy directive has been established by the european union for increasing the proportion of renewable energy to 32 by 2030 nissen et al 2018 creating strong support for further biogas industry development in europe in addition to european countries china united states and brazil are large biogas producers 11 16 bcm year for each country fig 1 these countries have tremendous biogas feedstocks including food wastes energy crops manures and slurries xue et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 in 2015 the actual total biogas production in china reached up to 15 8 bcm mara 2017 recently new policies and regulations such as the national 13th five year plan set by china mara 2017 and the national biofuel policy renovabio announced by brazil have been established for stimulating biogas production and utilization however the development of the biogas industry in these countries lags behind europe due to the low volume loading rate the efficiency of biogas generators is very low 20 30 limiting commercial profits and the sustainability of biogas production cheng et al 2013 hui et al 2018 moreover the majority of biogas in china is used for domestic cooking while a large portion of biogas is directly flared in the united states further contributing to low energy efficiency and environmental issues ren21 2019 therefore it is vital to upgrade biogas industrial infrastructure and develop innovative technologies for advancing biogas utilization many other countries with large populations and vast territories e g russia australia india and nigeria also have great potential for biogas production fig 1 these countries have a widely available feedstock supply e g organic wastes from agriculture landfill and wwtps however the actual biogas yield in these countries is far behind that of europe for example although the annual biogas potential of russia is estimated to be up to73 7 bcm which is comparable to that of europe only 10 biogas plants have been established in russia gielen and saygin 2017 in addition the utilization of biogas in these countries is generally unsustainable with the properties of low energy efficiency and high carbon emission for example most biogas is being used for generating electricity and heat or flared in australia 2 biogas upgrading and current technologies 2 1 biogas upgrading necessities and policy support biogas mostly comprises methane ch4 40 75 and carbon dioxide co2 15 60 accompanied by trace gasses including hydrogen sulfide h2s 0 005 2 nitrogen n2 0 2 water vapor h2o 5 10 halogenated hydrocarbons voc 0 0 6 siloxanes 0 0 02 oxygen o2 0 1 carbon monoxide co 0 6 ammonia nh3 and dust particles andriani et al 2014 kapoor et al 2019 while ch4 is the energy rich compound in biogas all other components are undesired and limit the advanced utilization of biogas firstly the presence of gas contaminants mainly co2 in biogas leads to its low calorific value 6 kwh m3 and effectively decreases the volumetric capacity of gas cylinders making biogas only suitable for applications with low energy utilization efficiency e g cooking and lighting secondly biogas can only be cost effectively stored for a few hours in the limited infrastructure and biogas transportation is difficult because co2 readily transforms into dry ice under high pressure when biogas is compressed angelidaki et al 2018 kapoor et al 2019 thirdly the corrosive gas h2s in the raw biogas can cause significant damage to gas engine units due to so2 emission from combustion angelidaki et al 2018 biogas upgrading can be used to remove these gas contaminants mainly targeting co2 removal and simultaneously convert biogas to biomethane methane content 96 based on germany s standard compared to raw biogas biomethane has a much higher energy content 10 kwh m3 and wider applications biomethane can be directly injected into the existing natural gas grids thus solving the issues of transportation and storage for biogas khan et al 2017 in addition biomethane can be utilized as a vehicle fuel in place of fossil fuels thereby reducing overall co2 emissions in terms of these advantages a number of national policies have been established worldwide for facilitating the biogas upgrading industry for example the european commission has established the 2030 climate and energy framework to boost the development of renewable energy aiming to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 40 increase renewable energy to 32 and improve energy efficiency by 32 commission 2014 as a completely renewable energy biomethane is an ideal substitute for natural gas with net zero ghg emissions the european biogas association eba has proposed policy incentives for stimulating biomethane production e g facilitating biomethane application in heavy industries and shipping de fossilizing the gas grid and sector and giving biomethane priority access to the gas grid eba 2019 moreover according to the national 13th five year plan china aims to increase annual national biomethane production up to 10 20 and 40 bcm in years 2020 2025 and 2030 respectively de clercq et al 2017 in 2016 the united states environmental protection agency usepa included biomethane as an advanced biofuel specifically california issued assembly bill no 1900 to promote the utilization of pipeline biomethane pasqual et al 2018 europe is also leading the world in biogas upgrading and commercialization the number of biomethane plants in europe has increased from 187 in 2011 to 540 in 2017 accompanied by a significant increase in biomethane yield from 0 07 bcm in 2011 to 1 8 bcm in 2017 bioenergy europe 2019 the physicochemical upgrading technologies implemented on an industrial scale include pressure swing adsorption separating biogas components using special adsorbent materials e g zeolites and activated carbon augelletti et al 2017 high pressure water scrubbing employing water to remove co2 and h2s from biogas due to much higher water solubility of co2 than that of ch4 budzianowski et al 2017 chemical scrubbing applying organic solvent e g methanol and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol or aqueous amine solutions for absorbing co2 and h2s petersson and wellinger 2009 membrane separation hierarchically separating biogas components based on selective permeability properties of membranes bauer et al 2013 cryogenic separation acquiring liquified ch4 by gradually decreasing biogas temperature baena moreno et al 2019 and chemical hydrogenation reducing co2 with h2 catalyzed by nickel or ruthenium jürgensen et al 2015 although many of these technologies have been well developed they have multiple disadvantages in high investment operating and maintenance costs high energy demands requirement for a large amount of water e g high pressure water scrubbing or regeneration of expensive adsorbent e g pressure swing adsorption and production of waste chemicals that are toxic to humans and the environment e g chemical scrubbing and unsustainability e g chemical hydrogenation 2 2 hydrogen driven chemoautotrophic biogas upgrading technologies in contrast to physicochemical methods hydrogen h2 driven biogas upgrading via biological technologies can be carried out at ambient conditions i e atmospheric pressure and moderate temperature without the use of expensive catalysts and chemicals in such biotechnologies co2 in the biogas is chemoautotrophically converted to ch4 or other value added chemicals with renewable h2 which can be generated from water electrolysis driven by wind or solar angelidaki et al 2018 generating electricity from solar and wind has drawn increasing attention since these energy sources are renewable sustainable and clean the production cost of electricity from renewable sources has also experienced a sharp decrease during recent decades the cost of solar has fell from 0 378 kwh to 0 068 kwh dropped by 82 from 2010 to 2020 irena and is expected to continue to drop to 0 02 0 04 kwh in 2050 mayer 2015 in several european countries e g denmark 26 of electricity is generated from wind sovacool 2013 efficiently storage or utilization of the surplus electricity is important otherwise excess energy will be wasted and the power grid will be unstable carton and olabi 2010 georgilakis 2008 batteries can be utilized for storing electricity but they have the disadvantages of limited capacity to store electricity high manufacturing cost and high risk of environmental pollution caused by obsolete materials converting solar and wind energies into h2 is appealing since h2 is a clean energy that can be directly derived from water electrolysis however h2 has a very low volumetric energy density 10 88 mj m3 giving rise to difficulties for storage and its utilization as a fuel for transportation is still under development in contrast ch4 has a remarkably higher energy content 36 mj m3 than h2 with existing infrastructure for storage e g natural gas grid and has extensive applications e g as vehicle fuel therefore h2 assisted chemoautotrophic biogas upgrading technologies have excellent potential for converting intermittent energy wind solar and raw biogas to stable energy carriers biomethane that can be easily stored contributing to the development of a sustainable environmentally friendly and circular economy 2 2 1 biogas upgrading using hydrogenotrophic methanogens hydrogenotrophic methanogens are chemoautotrophic microorganisms capable of converting co2 to ch4 using h2 as an electron donor reaction 1 1 4h2 co2 ch4 2 h2o δg 130 7 kj mol a diverse range of methanogenic microorganisms including methanobacterium methanothermobacter methanobrevibacter and methanococcus harbor their particular pathways to convert h2 and co2 into ch4 fig 2 a costa and leigh 2014 zabranska and pokorna 2018 firstly co2 is reduced to methanofuran bound formyl group formyl mfr with reduced ferredoxin fdred as the electron carrier the formyl group is transferred to tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt and dehydrated to methenyl h4mpt the electron carrier f420h2 then reduces methenyl h4mpt to methylene h4mpt and further to methyl h4mpt transfer of the methyl group from methyl h4mpt to sulfhydryl coenzyme m hs com forming com ch3 is carried out by a membrane bound methyltransferase mtr com ch3 is finally reduced to ch4 accompanied by oxidation of hs com and hs cob to com s s cob heterodisulfide moreover the soluble f420 reducing hydrogenase frh catalyzes the oxidation of h2 and reduction of cofactor f420 to f420h2 while a heterodisulfide reductase hdrabc reduces oxidized ferredoxin fdox to fdred and reduces the heterodisulfide com s s cob to com sh and cob sh via electron bifurcation kaster et al 2011 during the process of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis energy is conserved by the action of mtr which expels sodium ions across the membrane forming a sodium motive force for atp synthesis the biogas upgrading configurations which use hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be divided into three categories in situ ex situ and hybrid technologies kougias et al 2017 the in situ biogas upgrading technology has the advantage of low capital investment without the need for extra infrastructure for this technology h2 is directly delivered into anaerobic digesters to stimulate activity of endogenous hydrogenotrophic methanogens therefore promoting co2 conversion to ch4 in situ biogas upgrading has been successfully achieved in anaerobic digesters treating various organics including manure luo et al 2012 and food waste okoro shekwaga et al 2019 table 1 in this way ch4 content can generally be enhanced to 75 and up to 100 reported by agneessens et al 2017 table 1 luo angelidaki 2013a found that in situ supply of h2 to an anaerobic reactor co digesting manure and whey enhanced the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens enriching methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus in the system in addition temperature was found to be crucial in shaping microbial communities and h2 utilization pathway in situ biogas upgrading reactors zhu et al 2019 under mesophilic conditions 35 c the majority of h2 was utilized by both aceticlastic methanogens and homoacetogens in contrast under thermophilic conditions 55 c h2 was mostly consumed for supporting cell growth and a portion of h2 was used by hydrogenotrophic methanogens and aceticlastic methanogens zhu et al 2019 for the ex situ technology biogas supplied from an external source is introduced into an anaerobic reactor together with h2 giving rise to bioconversion of h2 and co2 to biomethane via hydrogenotrophic methanogens table 2 for instance bassani et al 2015 designed a biogas upgrading system integrating two continuous stirred tank reactors with one reactor for biogas production and another for biogas upgrading biomethane with ch4 purity above 85 was produced under both thermophilic and mesophilic conditions when h2 was injected into the second reactor it was found that the introduction of h2 promoted the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanoculleus kougias et al 2017 achieved methane purity 98 using a bubble column reactor for ex situ biogas upgrading microbial community analysis indicated that a mba08 a potential acetogen affiliated to clostridia as well as hydrogenotrophic methanogens including methanothermobacter and methanoculleus became the dominant genera the hybrid technology combines in situ and ex situ biogas upgrading into an integrated system in which a portion of co2 is captured by the in situ technology to produce a higher grade biogas followed by the ex situ process for further removing residual co2 for example a hybrid system consisting of two thermophilic upflow reactors was set up by corbellini et al 2018 h2 was injected into the first reactor fed with cattle manure and potato starch for in situ biogas upgrading and an enriched hydrogenotrophic culture was inoculated into the second reactor for ex situ biogas upgrading biomethane with 91 ch4 content and a ch4 production rate of 355 ml ch4 lreactor day was attained at steady state the utilization of co2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the second reactor helped to buffer the ph drop induced by production of volatile fatty acids vfas in the first reactor 2 2 2 biogas upgrading using homoacetogens a new concept gaining attention is the conversion of co2 in biogas into value added liquid chemicals while simultaneously upgrading biogas to biomethane using homoacetogens various homoacetogens e g clostridium scatologenes liu et al 2018 c autoethanogenum heffernan et al 2020 and acetobacterium woodii cheng et al 2018 are capable of producing biofuels or their precursors e g acetate butyrate and ethanol using hydrogen as the electron donor and co2 as the carbon source table 3 compared to ch4 these biofuels or liquid chemicals have higher energy density and commercial value and are more convenient for storage and transportation the majority of homoacetogens utilize h2 and co2 to produce acetate reaction 2 via the wood ljungdahl pathway reductive acetyl coa pathway fig 2b latif et al 2014 schiel bengelsdorf and dürre 2012 wood 1991 which is the most efficient metabolic pathway for carbon fixation and energy generation lever 2016 the conversion of co2 is associated with two branches the carbonyl and methyl branches while acetyl coa serves as the main intermediate and precursor for liquid chemicals production in the carbonyl branch co2 is reduced to co catalyzed by the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthase complex codh acs in the methyl branch co2 is successively reduced to formyl tetrahydrofolate thf methyl thf and further methyl cofesp co and methyl cofesp are then bound to generate acetyl coa catalyzed by the codh acs reducing equivalents electrons are acquired through h2 oxidation catalyzed by hydrogenase and are conserved in the form of nad p h and ferredoxin which serve as electron donors for reducing co2 acetyl coa is then converted to acetate catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase ragsdale and pierce 2008 several acetogens e g c autoethanogenum and c ljungdahlii can also generate ethanol with acetaldehyde as the intermediate catalyzed by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ald aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase adhe and alcohol dehydrogenase adh liew et al 2017 longer chain fatty acids e g butyrate can be generated by chain elongation reactions batlle vilanova et al 2017 2 2co2 4h2 ch3coo h 2h2o δg 95 kj mol compared to a pure culture mixed cultures are more versatile considering their co2 conversion process does not require sterilization simplifying process operation the reduction of co2 to diverse organic acids including acetate propionate butyrate valerate and hexanoate has been reported using a mixed culture supplied with h2 levy et al 1981 zhang et al 2013 acetogens e g c kluyveri and c ljungdahlii in the mixed culture are reported to play crucial roles in co2 conversion zhang et al 2013 although homoacetogens exhibit potential for value added chemical production from co2 there is limited application of homoacetogens for biogas upgrading omar et al 2018 2019 zhao et al 2020 an interesting study was carried out by zhao et al 2020 in which a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr inoculated with homoacetogen c ragsdalei p11 was employed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and liquid chemicals production they upgraded biogas to biomethane with ch4 content up to 97 6 and obtained acetate and ethanol production rates of 37 8 and 13 5 mmol l 1d 1 respectively omar et al 2018 2019 also achieved co2 conversion to alcohols or vfas with moorella sp or acetoanaerobium noterae as the major functional microorganisms these findings indicate that in addition methanogens homoacetogens are also suitable for biogas upgrading however because the final products converted from h2 and co2 by homoacetogens are generally mixed chemicals i e mixed organics and alcohols rather than a single product it is challenging to extract these products from reactor systems more exploration is required to make homoacetogen dependent biogas upgrading a feasible and widely adopted biotechnology in the future 3 key barriers of current biotechnologies for biogas upgrading 3 1 metabolic limitations in in situ biogas upgrading the in situ biogas upgrading process relies on existing infrastructure i e anaerobic digesters for h2 addition having the advantages of simplicity and low construction cost however metabolic limitation associated with vfas accumulation dramatic ph change and co2 depletion is a big issue in situ biogas upgrading typically leading to low biomethane production rate and ch4 content fu et al 2020a simon 2015 the ad process is composed of four steps including hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis complex organics are firstly hydrolyzed to monomers hydrolysis which are then fermented to alcohols and vfas e g acetate butyrate and propionate acidogenesis these chemicals are further bio converted to h2 co2 formate and acetate acetogenesis which are utilized as substrates by methanogens for generating ch4 methanogenesis li et al 2019 therefore the syntrophic interactions among different functional microorganisms play a critical role in sustaining ad performance and stability sudden introduction of a high amount of h2 could result in imbalance among syntrophic microorganisms hydrolyzing bacteria acetogens and methanogens thus influencing not only methanogenesis but also the three upstream steps for example exogenous h2 addition could suppress the activity of syntrophic bacteria for degrading vfas and alcohols because acetogenesis is thermodynamically unfavorable when h2 concentration is high 10 pa batstone et al 2002 liu and whitman 2008 the accumulated vfas e g propionate concentration 900 mg l could exhibit inhibitory effects on methanogens wang et al 2009 additionally h2 introduction may stimulate homoacetogens thus promoting co2 conversion to acetate with h2 if acetate consumption rate cannot keep up with its production rate the overall ad process would be suppressed mulat et al 2017 a ph range of 6 8 to 7 4 has been recommended for maintaining optimal synergistic reactions in the ad process dohányos et al 2001 nevertheless the accumulation of vfas and alcohols in anaerobic digesters induced by direct h2 introduction could cause acidification leading to deterioration of the biological processes in ad angelidaki et al 2018 on the contrary it is worth noting that the methanogenic process could create alkaline conditions according to ionization reaction 4 the consumption of co2 by methanogens could result in reduction of h in the liquid phase thus increasing ph typically a ph of 8 5 is the threshold for optimal methanogenesis while a higher ph would restrict the activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens angelidaki et al 2018 o flaherty et al 1998 4 h2o co2 h hco3 it has also been observed that co2 could be depleted by hydrogenotrophic methanogens when the ratio of h2 to co2 is higher than 4 1 luo and angelidaki 2013a on one hand the depletion of co2 will limit the carbon source for hydrogenotrophic methanogens thus negatively influencing methanogenesis process liu and whitman 2008 on the other hand homoacetogens that have low h2 affinity inversely related to the h2 saturation constant ks may have competitive advantages over hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 when co2 concentration is low and h2 concentration is high agneessens et al 2018 collectively although in situ biogas upgrading is a promising approach for improving ch4 content in biogas respective microorganisms associated with the four functional steps in the ad process are interactive it is critical to optimally balance the syntrophic and methanogenic activities to maximize biomethane production from biogas 3 2 low hydrogen gas transfer rate one of the major challenges for h2 assisted biogas upgrading technology is the low h2 transfer rate from the gas to the liquid phase which is caused by the quite low h2 solubility 1 6 mg l under 20 c and 101 kpa kaye and laby 1986 because the biological processes occur mainly in liquid phase h2 must transfer across the interface between the gas and the liquid phase to be accessible to hydrogenotrophic microorganisms as a consequence the low h2 transfer rate is a major rate limiting step for hydrogenotrophic bio processes this issue is particularly serious for the in situ biogas upgrading process due to the very limited h2 penetration even massive h2 is introduced into biogas upgrading systems h2 is only available to superficial margins of the methanogenic consortium due to limited h2 mass transfer in anaerobic fermenting sludge matrix aryal et al 2018 garcia robledo et al 2016 the typical equation for describing the rate of h2 diffusion in a liquid is shown in eq 5 5 rt 22 4 kla h2gth h21 where rt represents h2 mass transfer rate mol l h kla represents linear gas transfer coefficient h 1 h2gth represents h2 concentration in gas phase mol l and h2l is measured dissolved h2 in liquid phase mol l moreover proper h2 diffusion equipment is needed since unused h2 easily escapes from the system the resultant low gas utilization efficiency will significantly increase the cost of h2 supply therefore decreasing the economic benefits in addition the h2 which escapes could form a combustible localised atmosphere posing safety risks 3 3 limited production rates of biomethane and value added chemicals the production rate of biomethane via in situ and ex situ methanogenesis processes are typically in the range of 0 1 1 l lreactor day and 0 1 3 l lreactor day respectively while the production rate of liquid chemicals e g acetate via homoacetogens is generally less than 5 g l d table 1 6 a higher production rate is required to make the biological biogas upgrading process more economically viable and technically feasible for industrial applications homoacetogens are efficient in converting co2 with h2 to multiple chemicals daniell et al 2012 but homoacetogenesis exhibits very low selectivity for final products although acetate is the predominant final product converted from co2 the target chemicals are multicarbon molecules such as butyrate ethanol butanol and 2 3 butanediol which have much higher commercial value than acetate for instance it was found that moorella sp generated 40 times higher concentration of acetate than ethanol with provision of co2 and h2 even when the ph 5 8 was optimal for ethanol production sakai et al 2005 moreover the concentrations of butyrate caproate and caprylate were 1 8 0 98 and 0 42 g l respectively which is much lower than the acetate concentration 7 4 g l produced in an mbfr system supplied with h2 zhang et al 2013 4 potential solutions for overcoming barriers 4 1 relieving metabolic limitation in in situ biogas upgrading pulsed h2 addition could be a feasible strategy to relieve metabolic limitation for in situ biogas upgrading agneessens et al 2017 it has been found that as long as the concentration ratio of injected h2 to daily produced co2 from ad is less than 8 1 the ph rise was limited to 0 17 while co2 concentration could be maintained above 11 8 thus eliminating negative impacts induced by alkalization and co2 depletion the ch4 content in the raw biogas can be upgraded to 100 provided that the h2 to co2 ratio exceeds 6 1 while the accumulated vfas were far below their inhibitory concentration the pulsed h2 injection could stimulate the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens e g methanobacteriales and methanomicrobiales giving rise to an increased h2 uptake rate agneessens et al 2017 as mentioned in section 3 1 the ph in anaerobic digesters tends to decrease during acidogenesis and increase in methanogenesis the ph balance associated with the two steps is crucial for maintaining favourable microbial metabolism involved in both anaerobic digestion and in situ biogas upgrading the vfa producing potential of feedstocks impacts the trends in ph feeding substrate that contains highly abundant organics e g food waste yu et al 2018 readily induces excessive acidification during organic decomposition co digestion of different feedstocks could be a strategy for avoiding dramatic ph change for instance waste activated sludge a substrate that can release nh4 to buffer acidity has been generally used for co digestion with food waste dai et al 2013 nevertheless if the feedstock has low vfa producing potential e g cattle slurry the vfas generated from acidogenesis might not be sufficient to buffer the increased alkalinity from methanogenesis in order to prevent a dramatic ph increase by methanogenesis luo angelidaki 2013a carried out co digestion of manure and acidic whey for in situ biogas upgrading consequently the ph was maintained below 8 0 and the introduced h2 was almost 100 utilized for co2 conversion to ch4 the degradation of vfas e g propionate is thermodynamically favourable giving rise to minor vfa accumulation in effluent in addition operational parameters of stock feeding e g the organic loading rate are also crucial in controlling ph agneessens et al 2018 additives such as biochar zhang et al 2020 zero valent iron zvi su et al 2013 and ash yin et al 2019 have potential to accelerate methanogenesis for in situ biogas upgrading biochar supplementation can provide additional nutrients e g p k ca and mg to boost the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens shen et al 2015 for example biochar amendment was found to selectively enrich methanothermobacter and methanosarcina in a thermophilic anaerobic digester treating food waste zhang et al 2020 su et al 2013 assessed the impact of nano zvi zero valent iron on an anaerobic digester treating sewage sludge and found the ch4 content in biogas increased by 5 13 with the amendment of 0 10 wt of nano zvi hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was promoted by enhanced h2 generation from anaerobic corrosion of zvi dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 additionally it has also been reported that stepwise introduction of ash could promote methanogenesis via inhibiting the activity of hydrolytic and acidifying enzymes while improving the activity of coenzyme f420 which is critical to methanogenesis thus leading to a 10 increase in ch4 content of biogas in an anaerobic digester yin et al 2019 since introducing additives leads to increased treatment costs and potentially negative impacts on the environment low cost and environmentally compatible alternatives need to be developed compared to the in situ process ex situ biogas upgrading in which biogas production and biogas upgrading take place separately has fewer microbial metabolic limitations and higher flexibility firstly the ex situ biogas upgrading process performed by hydrogenotrophic microorganisms proceeds in a separate unit without imposing negative impacts on the ad process secondly the biological processes involved are easier to control and adjust with minor interference of organics moreover the ex situ biogas upgrading unit can be flexibly connected to a remote power source angelidaki et al 2018 making the integrated system more controllable 4 2 enhancing h2 mass transfer rate and utilization efficiency by optimizing reactor configuration and operational conditions the major challenge for implementing both in situ and ex situ biogas upgrading is h2 mass transfer limitation according to eq 5 the h2 transfer rate can be improved by enhancing kla which is dependent on reactor configuration and operating conditions bassani et al 2017 pauss et al 1990 luo and angelidaki 2012 established a reactor equipped with a continuous stirrer for maintaining liquid homogeneity and a gassing device for introducing h2 and biogas when the speed was increased from 500 to 800 rpm in the continuously stirred tank reactor cstr the biogas loading rate increased from 12 to 24 l lreactor day while the ch4 content in the upgraded biogas was maintained at 90 however h2 mass transfer rate was still the limiting factor for efficient h2 utilization in this system for in situ biogas upgrading the intense mixing leads to high shear forces which disrupt synergistic associations between h2 producing fermenters and h2 utilizing methanogens microorganisms thereby slowing down or disrupting both fermentation and methanogenesis in addition the intense mixing consumes a lot of energy and continuous stirring is not appropriate for industrial application in order to overcome h2 transfer limitation a series of new reactor designs have been developed including the bubble column reactor solid state bioreactor trickling bed reactor biofilm plug flow reactor and hollow fiber mbfr for efficient biogas upgrading fig 3 bubble column reactor the bubble column reactor which generally has a high height width ratio is equipped with gas diffusers e g stainless steel diffusers or alumina ceramic membranes for h2 dispersion fig 3b bassani et al 2017 the h2 mass transfer rate was improved by changing the diffuser pore size e g increasing diameter from 0 4 µm to 2 µm and gas recirculation rate and installing a ceramic sponge above the h2 diffusers bassani et al 2016 2017 by employing this system for ex situ biogas upgrading bassani et al 2017 achieved a ch4 yield of 0 25 lch4 lh2 and biomethane purity of 96 moreover it was reported that the bubble column reactor has a much higher efficiency for biogas upgrading 98 ch4 content in the output gas than the cstr 79 ch4 content in the output gas with the same gas feeding rate kougias et al 2017 solid state bioreactor the unique feature of the solid state bioreactor is the packing of solid particle materials e g vermiculite and granular perlite for immobilizing functional microorganisms e g methanogens fig 3c the high specific surface area of the particles creates sufficient contact among microorganisms gas and liquid thus increasing the gas transfer rate rittmann et al 2015 the ex situ biogas upgrading potential of a fixed bed bioreactor composed of two solid state reactors in series was assessed by alitalo et al 2015 in which a maximal methane productivity of 6 35 l lreactor d and a hydrogen conversion rate of 100 were obtained in addition waste materials e g wood ash can be mixed in the packing materials as inorganic nutrient for supporting the growth of methanogens alitalo et al 2015 trickle bed reactor the trickle bed reactor contains carriers for biofilm attachment supplied with a continuous liquid flow for wetting the biofilm and providing nutrients fig 3d burkhardt and busch 2013 this reactor design creates a unique three phase biofilm liquid gas structure which has a high concentration gradient and a quick diffusion route ensuring a high gas transfer rate in addition the specific surface area of the carriers could further confer a high h2 and co2 conversion efficiency gas recirculation an energy consuming process that has been commonly used in other reactor designs is not necessary in the trickle bed reactor the use of this system for biological methanation from h2 and co2 was tested in a study by burkhardt et al 2015 which achieved a ch4 production rate of 1 17 nm3 m3 d and 100 h2 utilization efficiency moreover rachbauer et al 2016 operated a trickle bed reactor inoculated with hydrogenotrophic culture and fed the reactor with h2 and raw biogas under mesophilic conditions with a gas retention time of 2 3 h the biogas could be upgraded to biomethane 96 at a productivity of 2 52 m3 ch4 m3 reactor vol d equivalent to a biogas upgrading capacity of 6 9 m3 biogas m3 reactor vol d rachbauer et al 2016 biofilm plug flow reactor an innovative biofilm plug flow reactor was also proposed for biogas upgrading savvas et al 2017 a pvc tube 7 m length and 13 mm internal diameter containing polyethylene wheels as carriers for attaching biofilm was hung on a frame to form vertical loops biogas was continuously fed through the tube while liquid medium was recirculated very slowly 10 ml min after reaching steady state the tube was placed horizontally and gas was uniformly delivered across the biofilms which were kept wet via intermittently introduced medium with this configuration the gas residence time and the effective volume of the biofilms were maximized giving rise to 99 co2 conversion efficiency at total gas flux rate of 100 v v d with highest reported methane evolution rate of 40 v v d moreover a high mass transfer rate was achieved without the gas liquid agitation which was generally used for cstr minimizing energy consumption hollow fiber mbfr the mbfr has also been utilized in both in situ and ex situ biogas upgrading processes the core component of the mbfr system is the gas permeable hollow fiber membranes which not only provide a suitable surface for microorganisms to grow and form biofilms lai et al 2016a 2016b 2018a 2018b ontiveros valencia et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 but also confer a high gas utilizing efficiency and transfer rate that is not achievable via gas sparging fig 3e martin and nerenberg 2012 when delivered through the membrane lumen h2 efficiently disperses through the membrane wall to the biofilm on the outer surface luo and angelidaki 2013 achieved a ch4 content 90 by installing bubble less hollow fibers in an anaerobic reactor digesting cattle manure and whey luo and angelidaki 2013b díaz et al 2015 further set up a pilot scale mbfr for converting h2 and co2 to ch4 demonstrating a kla of 430 h 1 biomethane yield of 0 22 lch4 lh2 and biomethane purity of 95 ch4 with a maximum h2 loading rate of 40 2 l l reactor d interestingly when the mbfr was inoculated with a mixed culture from an anaerobic digester zhang et al 2014 achieved bio conversion of co2 and h2 to multiple value added chemicals including acetate butyrate and medium chain fatty acids caproate and caprylate with 100 hydrogen utilization efficiency in general increasing reactor pressure and gassing rate promotes the rate of gas liquid mass transfer thereby improving the purity of upgraded biomethane and the volumetric biomethane production rate seifert et al 2014 in addition temperature significantly impacts methanogenesis and gas fermentation it has been reported that for an in situ biogas upgrading system the co2 and h2 conversion rate was 60 higher under thermophilic conditions than that with mesophilic temperatures 37 luo and angelidaki 2012 although higher temperature resulted in lower gas dissolution 4 3 bioelectrochemical system bes as an innovative technique for biogas upgrading biogas upgrading using bes has drawn considerable interest owing to multiple advantages including low energy input ability to recover multiple resources from wastes and generation of value added chemicals bajracharya et al 2017 zeppilli et al 2019 bes assisted co2 conversion is also resistant to fluctuations in electricity supply potentially able to overcome the instability of renewable energy in practical applications rojas et al 2018 a membrane e g proton exchange membrane pem or anion exchange membrane aem is generally installed to divide the bes system into anode and cathode chambers and external power is required to overcome the kinetic and thermodynamic limitation of the biological reactions fig 3f villano et al 2012 typically organics lu and ren 2016 or water van eerten jansen et al 2012 are decomposed at the anode transferring electrons to the cathode where h2 is generated and then utilized by methanogens for biogas upgrading alternatively electroactive methanogens carry out co2 reduction by directly utilizing electrons from electrodes through extracellular electron transfer villano et al 2010 alkali production and co2 absorption could also favor biogas upgrading in the bes xu et al 2014 moreover h2s in the raw biogas can be removed via microbial or electrochemical h2s oxidation generally with sulfur or sulfate as the final products buisman et al 1990 guiot et al 1997 ni et al 2019 tartakovsky et al 2014 in a reported in situ bes assisted biogas upgrading process electrodes were directly placed into an anaerobic reactor to generate h2 or electrons for co2 reduction table 4 tartakovsky et al 2011 a portion of h2 was utilized by methanogens to convert co2 to ch4 to purify the biogas while the presence of o2 facilitated hydrolysis of organics and desulphurization of biogas tartakovsky et al 2011 bes has been found to shorten stabilization time and boost organic and vfa degradation for anaerobic digestion tartakovsky et al 2014 moreover bes is an attractive approach for simultaneous ex situ biogas upgrading and resource recovery table 5 an innovative three chamber bes was established to simultaneously upgrade biogas treat digestate and recover ammonia zeppilli et al 2019 an aem and a cem were installed to divide the system into one anode chamber in the middle and two cathode chambers on two sides biogas was injected into the cem cathode chamber while digestate containing a high concentration of organics and nh4 was introduced into the anode chamber in this system organics were decomposed in the anode chamber while co2 in the biogas was removed in both cathode chambers via methanogenesis and co2 sorption due to alkali production via methanogenesis zeppilli et al 2019 the process of methanogenesis in the cem cathode could also drive nh4 migration from the anode chamber for maintaining electroneutrality thereby enabling the recovery of concentrated ammonium in this chamber recently fu et al 2020 set up a bes equipped with a proton exchange membrane and added ferrous ion into the anode chamber for simultaneously upgrading biogas and sulfur recovery when biogas was injected into the system sulfide was oxidized to recoverable sulfur particles via a ferrous ion mediated redox reaction in the anode chamber fu et al 2020b meanwhile h2 was generated via incorporation of electrons from the cathode and protons that migrated from the anode during sulfide oxidation the h2 generated was then used for driving co2 conversion to ch4 through the action of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cathode chamber it is worth noting that co2 conversion to value added liquid chemicals e g formate zhao et al 2012 acetate jourdin et al 2015 and ethanol anwer et al 2019 can also be realized by bes table 6 acetogens such as c ljungdahlii jabeen and farooq 2016 and sporomusa ovata im et al 2016 can survive and catalyze bioelectrochemical reactions in a bes for example using a bes jourdin et al 2015 achieved a high acetate production rate up to 685 g m 2 day 1 and final acetate concentration of 11 g l with electron and co2 utilization efficiency at 94 and 100 respectively electrodes with advanced or modified materials e g cobalt tetra amino phthalocyanine and multiwalled carbon nanotubes zhao et al 2012 synthesized epd 3d electrodes jourdin et al 2015 and mno2 coated carbon felt anwer et al 2019 are to promote co2 conversion and liquid chemicals production moreover the spectrum of chemicals produced from bes can be expanded to longer chain fatty acids which have higher commercial value than acetate generally both acetate and ethanol are needed by acetogens for chain elongation however in the bes h2 or electrons from the cathode could act as electron donors for producing acetate and ethanol which are combined to generate longer chain fatty acids via chain elongation prévoteau et al 2020 for example by employing a laboratory scale bes installed with carbon felt electrodes the production rates of co2 derived butyrate and caproate can reach up to 3 2 and 0 95 g l 1 day 1 respectively jourdin et al 2018 although a few studies have demonstrated the potential of bes for biogas upgrading and value added chemicals production it is still at an early stage of development most of bes systems are lab scale studies using bio reactors of a few liters with drawbacks including low current densities low production yields high capital cost of electrodes and membrane and biofouling thus hampering economical scale up christodoulou and velasquez orta 2016 promising strategies are proposed to make bes more suitable for industrial application e g inoculating bes with highly active genetically engineered microorganisms as discussed below 4 4 maximizing production of targeted chemicals using genetic engineering tools genetic modification using technologies such as genetic recombination gene overexpressing and in frame deletion of targeted genes is a powerful way to reprogram metabolic pathways to obtain the desired carbon transformation recently a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to constructing genetically engineered microorganisms for improving the concentration and production rate of value added chemicals batstone et al 2002 bi et al 2013 chakravarty and brigham 2018 khan et al 2014 liew et al 2017 murphy et al 2020 although genetic engineering is an effective approach for reinforcing microbial co2 conversion and controllably generating value added multicarbon molecules its applications in biogas upgrading are extremely limited here we put forward several potential strategies including carbon flux redirection co2 fixation reinforcement and more advanced genetic engineering technologies which potentially can be employed for maximizing desired value added chemical production during biogas upgrading fig 4 4 4 1 redirecting carbon flux reconstructing microbial metabolic networks using genetic engineering tools is a useful approach for generating the desired products from co2 by using such a strategy carbon flux is redirected from general pathways to targeted pathways for synthesizing chemicals of interest in fact a few hydrogenotrophic methanogens have been genetically modified to realize co2 conversion to value added chemicals e g geraniol and isoprene that have a much higher commercial value than ch4 lyu et al 2016 murphy et al 2020 recombinant methanogen methanococcus maripaludis was constructed with the insertion of an exogenous gene encoding geraniol synthase lyu et al 2016 this modified strain was able to convert co2 to geraniol with the supply of h2 thus generating geraniol at 2 8 mg g of cell dry weight similarly recombinant expression of isoprene synthase in methanosarcina acetivorans yielded isoprene murphy et al 2020 moreover ch4 conversion to lactate was achieved by constructing a recombinant methanosarcina acetivorans cloned with three genes associated with mcr for activating ch4 by the reverse methanogenesis pathway and one gene involved in 3 hydroxybutyryl coa dehydrogenase hbd for generating lactate mcanulty et al 2017 in addition to methanogens other anaerobic or aerobic hydrogenotrophic bacteria have also been genetically manipulated toward synthesising desired products a woodii an anaerobic bacterium able to grow with h2 and co2 has been engineered with a pathway to divert carbon flow to acetate with accumulation of up to 51 g l of acetate within 3 8 days genes involved in the wood ljungdahl pathway e g acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase were overexpressed straub et al 2014 likewise modifying the ethanol synthesis route via inactivating aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase adhe in c autoethanogenum was found to raise ethanol production up to 180 over the wildtype strain liew et al 2017 of particular interest some aerobic gas fermenting bacteria e g cupriavidus necator ralstonia eutropha and rhodobacter capsulatus have been genetically engineered for producing highly valuable biofuels and chemicals e g pentadecane methyl ketones heptadecane and botryococcene with the supply of h2 bi et al 2013 chakravarty and brigham 2018 khan et al 2014 krieg et al 2018 engineered cupriavidus necator to heterologously express α humulene synthase and the mevalonate pathway supplied with h2 and o2 this engineered strain converted co2 to terpene α humulene an important compound in medicine perfumes and advanced biofuels with a product content of 10 mg α humulene g cell dry mass 4 4 2 reinforcing co2 fixation by converting heterotrophs to autotrophs compared to autotrophs heterotrophs growing on organics like sucrose glycerol and glucose are more widely applied for industrial scale production of various chemicals due to their high activity and versatility nevertheless using these organic feedstocks for biotechnological manufacturing competes with their use as food and animal feeds therefore it is more sustainable and economically viable if co2 in the biogas can be utilized as a carbon source by heterotrophs for producing desired chemicals engineering heterotrophs to be autotrophic microorganisms is a promising approach to achieve this objective for example although the wild type archaeon pyrococcus furiosus cannot utilize co2 a recombinant strain can express heterologous genes involved in the hydroxypropionate hydroxybutylate 3 hp 4 hb cycle for co2 fixation after insertion of a related operon thus conferring the ability to convert h2 and co2 to 3 hydroxypropionate keller et al 2013 in order to produce a high yield of chemicals like butanol from co2 fast papoutsakis 2018 engineered core heterologous genes associated with the wood ljungdahl pathway from autotrophic c ljungdahlii to c acetobutylicum which are wild type obligate heterotrophs furthermore by endogenous metabolic network rewiring and continuous laboratory evolution gleizer et al 2019 reconstructed an escherichia coli which fixed co2 autotrophically via the calvin benson bassham cbb pathway and acquired reducing power and energy from formate that was produced electrochemically 4 4 3 advanced genetic engineering techniques for biogas upgrading with the rapid development of tools for genetic engineering and synthetic biology progress towards highly efficient and accurately targeted production of biofuels and chemicals from co2 is gathering pace crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats is a powerful and sophisticated technology enabling high throughput genetic screening and scarless metabolic pathway modification some acetogens e g c ljungdahlii huang et al 2016 and c autoethanogenum nagaraju et al 2016 have been genetically edited using crispr cas9 for influencing metabolic co2 co conversion to ethanol genome scale metabolic models gems are another robust tool for targeted chemicals production by computationally integrating genomic transcriptomic and proteomic data gems support a global and comprehensive view of metabolism enabling prediction of metabolic fluxes and further facilitation of reconstructing desired metabolic networks reed et al 2003 roberts et al 2010 although the aforementioned techniques may be employed for converting co2 to value added chemicals application of these genetic engineering technologies in biogas upgrading is extremely limited and requires further exploration 5 conclusions and perspectives upgrading biogas to biomethane improves the calorific value of biogas and broadens the range of application compared to the challenges of physicochemical methods that need expensive catalysts or intensive energy h2 driven biogas upgrading is promising particularly from a long term perspective considering that the cost of h2 from water hydrolysis powered by renewable wind and solar energy is consistently declining the biological h2 driven biogas upgrading process consists of two approaches i using hydrogenotrophic methanogens to convert co2 with h2 to ch4 and ii employing homoacetogens to convert co2 and h2 into value added chemicals fig 5 based on substantial progress from lab scale studies focusing on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for biogas upgrading several large scale plants have been established so far located in allendorf germany biopower2gas is the first commercial biological h2 driven biogas plant in the world bailera et al 2017 in this plant h2 is generated by a 2 150 kwe electrolyser and delivered into the biogas reactor from the base for biological methanation with co2 at a loading of 15 nm3 h consequently the ch4 content in biogas increased from 50 to 75 in addition an in situ biogas upgrading plant was established in foulum denmark a 1200 m3 thermophilic reactor was fed with agricultural waste at an organic loading rate of 4 6 vs l reactor d and injected with up to 33 5 m3 h2 jensen et al 2018 moreover electrochaea constructed an ex situ biogas upgrading plant in foulum denmark a 10 000 liter reactor was inoculated with methanogens and supplied with h2 generated by a 1 mwe alkaline electrolyser which was powered by excess wind power thereby converting raw biogas to biomethane with ch4 content 97 bailera et al 2017 electrochaea 2021 in addition to methanogens homoacetogens also show potential for utilization in biogas upgrading different from methanogens homoacetogens are able to generate a broad range of value added chemicals which are more transportable and commercially valuable than ch4 although conversion of co2 and h2 to fatty acids e g acetate propionate and butyrate and alcohol e g ethanol by homoacetogens has been extensively studied application in biogas upgrading e g using mbfr and bes systems is still in early stage lanzatech a company which develops advanced technologies for gas fermentation is employing homoacetogens to convert syngas gas mixture of h2 co2 and co to liquid fuels the commercialization potential of biogas upgrading using homoacetogens is worth exploring technical bottlenecks for implementing industrial scale h2 driven biogas upgrading include h2 mass transfer limitation jensen et al 2018 in order to address these issues improved reactor designs and appropriate genetic manipulation are necessary to enable biogas upgrading with high h2 and co2 conversion efficiency and final products selectivity moreover integrating different functional microorganisms using two stage biological processes is a promising strategy to realize co2 and h2 conversion to specialty chemicals e g triacylglycerides and single cell proteins scps that cannot be efficiently synthesized by pure culture hu et al 2016 molitor et al 2019 for example using two stage design 18 g l of c16 c18 triacylglycerides was generated by integrating homoacetogen moorella thermoacetica and metabolically engineered yeast yarrowia lipolytica hu et al 2016 and a scps mass fraction of 40 50 in cells was produced by combination of c ljungdahlii and saccharomyces cerevisiae molitor et al 2019 this review summarizes recent findings in biological h2 dependent biogas upgrading technologies this review particularly highlights key challenges associated with the current technologies such as metabolic limitations low h2 transfer rate and limited co2 conversion rate more importantly we also propose new strategies for overcoming technical barriers including process optimization to eliminate metabolic limitation novel reactor designs to improve hydrogen gas transfer rate and utilization efficiency as well as employing advanced genetic engineering tools to improve biogas upgrading efficiency and rate it is expected that the insights offered in this review will stimulate more efforts to explore biological h2 dependent biogas upgrading thus boosting application of the relevant technologies declaration of competing interest the authors

17056,a 300m3 d demonstration project of soybean process wastewater has been established recently with a spiral symmetric stream anaerobic bioreactor sssab as the core in order to obtain the optimal operation strategy for a full scale sssab and to make it run efficiently and stably in a demonstration project a pilot scale sssab p sssab effective volume 100 l was performed for the treatment of soybean process wastewater over 216 days the volumetric load rate vlr range of the p sssab was 0 32 27 17 kg cod m3 d where the highest vlr 27 17 kg cod m3 d was 2 01 times to the highest value 13 5 kg cod m3 d reported the ph and vfa alk of the effluent from the p sssab were in the range of 6 9 up to 9 2 and 0 03 up to 0 17 respectively the methane yield of the p sssab increased from 0 03 m3 kg cod to 0 47 m3 kg cod which was 3 36 times to the maximum value 0 14 m3 kg cod reported to meet the influent requirement of the aerobic biological treatment in demonstration project influent cod 1 5 g l the maximum vlr of sssab was optimal at about 22 kg cod m3 d by analyzing the sludge bed characteristics of the p sssab it was obvious that zone i the bottom of the bed was the major contributor of the cod removal while zone iii the upper part of the bed was the major contributor for the nh4 n increase the anaerobic granular sludge ags in the bed showed a good granulation the average mlvss mlss value in sludge bed was about 0 7 and pn ps in tb eps zone i ii and iii increased to 6 830 4 257 and 3 747 respectively sma and coenzyme f420 values of zone iii were the maximum 666 35 ml ch4 g vss d and 0 690 mol g vss respectively according to the analysis obtained from the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing the microbial community in the ags had been more specific to the soybean process wastewater since the bacteria firmicutes were increased the relative abundance of microbe which perform direct interspecies electron transfer diet for the syntrophic degradation of vfas and production of the methane has been increased significantly such as the bacteria syntrophomonas and archaea methanosaeta graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords spiral symmetric steam anaerobic bioreactor anaerobic granular sludge soybean product processing wastewater operation strategy sludge bed characteristics 1 introduction soybean is one of the major industrial and food crops grown on every continent tummino et al 2020 it has been reported by the organization for economic co operation and development and the food and agriculture organization that the united states brazil and argentina are the leading soybean growers and soybean meal producers oecd fao 2018 spiller et al 2020 during 2018 2019 the global soybean production exceeded 360 million tons tummino et al 2020 with the increasing demand for soybean meal it is estimated that its annual increase of soybean meal will be 1 6 until 2027 spiller et al 2020 at the same time soybean products are traditional nutritious and popular food because of its high protein contents and rational amino acid composition wolfe et al 2018 these are popular all over the world especially in korea japan and china kim et al 2011 but their production process consumes large amounts of freshwater and generates a very large volume of high concentration organic wastewater yu et al 2002 zheng et al 2010 which are mainly soaking water and yellow swill water xue et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 soybean process wastewater is characterized by its high chemical oxygen demand cod generally 10 20 g l high nitrogen content and low ph value li et al 2014 liu et al 2016 yu 2015 if this wastewater is discharged directly to the environment without any treatment it will do great harm to the environment and human beings wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 because of the seasonal production of the food industry the influent of the wastewater treatment plants is unstable dong et al 2010 zhao et al 2008 as a consequence the reactor operation is seasonally unstable dong et al 2010 which indicates that the reactor should have excellent tolerance to variations of organic loading and other external disturbances therefore improving the soybean process wastewater treatment technique is necessary there are many soybean process wastewater treatment methods some studies focus on membrane separation technology xiao et al 2009 since a large number of oligosaccharides soluble proteins and other substances can be recovered from wastewater which have great economic value wang and serventi 2019 but this technology has a lot of disadvantages such as blockage of membrane pores high construction and operating costs and so on which make it difficult to apply to the actual project because the soybean process wastewater is rich in biodegradable organic nutrients many studies have been devoted to the use of biological methods to achieve the biotransformation of the soybean process wastewater an aerobic biological treatment su and yu 2005 can remove a large amount of organics from wastewater but for eliminating the high concentration organics compounds from wastewater necessitates high aeration rates which cause high operation cost aerobic reactors also have numerous demerits such as high sludge yield and high influent water quality which greatly restrict the utilization for a field treatment system it is regarded that anaerobic biological treatment is the most efficient technology to deal with high concentration organic wastewater partially because of the low energy consumption little residual sludge generation high concentration tolerance for organic compounds and efficient energy recovery sun et al 2010 studied the performance of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb for soybean process wastewater treatment under different organic loading rates olr and hydraulic retention times hrt the result show that the most suitable olr and hrt were 6 kg cod m3 d and 24 h if the influent cod was 6 g l for these values the cod removal efficiency was 85 and the methane contents accounted for 72 of the biogas zhu et al 2015 used an anaerobic baffled reactor abr to study the production of methane from soybean process wastewater the results show that for an olr of 1 9 2 6 kg cod m3 d the cod removal efficiency accounted to 95 and the methane yield to 13 89 l d if hrt was 48 h and the temperature was 35 1 c zhu et al 2008 also operated a laboratory scale abr with four compartments and investigated the influence of the olr for the performance and phase separation characteristics the cod removal efficiencies were between 92 and 97 at 1 2 6 0 kg cod m3 d feeding a proper anaerobic consortium in each separate compartment had developed along as a consequence of the substrate availability and specific environmental conditions guo et al 2018 operated a pilot scale internal circulation anoxic oxic ic a o coupling reactor which was used for soybean process wastewater treatment results indicate that the hrt of the ic reactor were during 24 h at a constant cod removal efficiency of 90 according to the table 1 it can be seen that the volume loading rate vlr of anaerobic reactors is mostly below 10 kg cod m3 d in the existing literature the highest value is only 13 5 kg cod m3 d yu et al 2002 so far most of the anaerobic bioreactors used to treat wastewater have a high hrt and a low vlr which makes the biotransformation efficiency low the microbial anaerobic fermentation can be divided into three stages hydrolysis acidification hydrogen production acetogenesis and methanogenisis tan et al 2020 yu et al 2019 the three stages are not independent but synergistically connected during the degradation of the organic matter some anaerobic reactor sludge beds have obvious microbial zoning yu 2015 zhu et al 2008 the dominant bacteria of the different stages of the anaerobic fermentation are enriched in different zones of the reactor which help to improve the reactor processing efficiency based on this we have developed a highly efficiency anaerobic reactor with own intellectual property rights the spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor sssab in the reaction zone of sssab three elliptic plates were spirally and symmetrically set then the sludge bed was divided into three zones by the elliptic plates each zone was provided with a gas collection pipe to achieve respective biogas collection chen et al 2016 according to the previous studies chen et al 2015 2017 dai et al 2017 2016 the sssab has a superior operating performance for methanol sodium acetate wastewater chen et al 2016 the suitable treatment concentration is 24 g l and the recovery time of the sssab after inhibition accounts to 7 days super high rate olr volumetric removal rate vrr and improved volumetric methane production vmp were 361 5 kg cod m3 d 268 3 kg cod m3 d and 73 0 m3 m3 d respectively which were in a leading position compared with what has been reported in the existing literature the reactor also has been successfully applied to different types of wastewater treatment such as traditional chinese pharmaceutical wastewater chen et al 2019 azo dye wastewater dai et al 2018 and so on taking this reactor as the core three actual projects have been designed constructed operated all have produced a good cleaning effect like for the soybean product wastewater treatment project the polyacrylate slurry wastewater treatment project and the traditional chinese pharmaceutical wastewater treatment project in this study a pilot scale sssab p sssab was built for soybean process wastewater treatment the objective of this study was to obtain the optimal operation strategy for the sssab and to run efficiently and stably in a demonstration project the focus was on the maximum vlr and the methane production capacity of the p sssab the hrt was shortened to explore the efficient reliable process parameters enabling cod removal and methane production additionally the sludge bed characteristics of the p sssab was also analyzed through the continuous treatment of the soybean process wastewater 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental set up the apparatus is shown in fig 1 the p sssab is made of stainless steel and has a diameter of 0 4 m a height of 2 2 m and an effective volume of 100 l the p sssab contains three semi elliptical plates which divide it into four regions zones i ii and iii make up the sludge bed and the top zone is the separation zone for studying the sludge bed characteristics 3 sampling tubes are designed in zone i ii and iii respectively the distances between each sampling tube and the bottom of the p sssab were 30 60 and 90 cm respectively the soybean process wastewater gets into the p sssab from the storge tank by a metering pump then reacts in the sludge bed and leaves the reactor through a three phase separator in the separation zone during the experiment the circulation volume of the system is controlled by an external circulation pump to control the reflux ratio influent circulation 1 3 the p sssab was continuously fed with soybean process wastewater produced by jiangxi changhuaxuan food technology co ltd the sludge for inoculation was the anaerobic granular sludge ags obtained from the bottom of sssab operating in the demonstration project we established in this company the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was 41 81 0 52 g l and the mlvss mlss value was 0 74 these data show that the sedimentation performance of the ags was good before the start of the operating of the p sssab 30 l ags were inoculated into the reactor which account for about 30 of the total volume of the reactor 2 2 operation strategy for p sssab as data in table 2 showed the p sssab was operated over 216 days the vlr was gradually increased by shortening the hrt according to the vlr the operation period of the p sssab was divided into 11 stages the vlr was gradually increased from 0 91 kg cod m3 d to 1 39 2 60 3 24 6 41 9 47 11 95 16 05 22 64 20 59 kg cod m3 d and then decreased to 13 17 kg cod m3 d the corresponding hrts were 218 18 120 00 60 00 40 00 24 00 17 14 12 63 10 00 7 62 6 32 and 12 63 h respectively during the operation time the effluent cod should be kept below 1 5 g l even better at 1 0 g l in order to meet aerobic treatment requirements each operation cycle was consisted of at least 3 hrt the hrt can be shortened if the effluent cod is less than 1 5 g l and the cod removal efficiency is stable for more than one week aiyuk et al 2006 luostarinen et al 2006 wang et al 2012 the operating stages were classified based on the effluent cod and vlr of the reactor it can be seen from table 2 that s1 is the startup period where the cod removal efficiency exceeds 90 for the first time s2 s6 are classified as vlr increase period where the vlr gradually increases to about 10 kg cod m3 d s7 s11 are seen as the high vlr operation period where the vlr is greater than 10 kg cod m3 d 2 3 sampling and analytical methods during the continuous operations water samples were collected from three sampling tubes plus the water inlet and outlet cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n mlss and mlvss were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 1992 volatile fatty acids vfas and alkalinity were analyzed by combined titration method dos et al 2007 biogas samples were collected from the biogas outlet the content of the biogas and the ch4 was determined by the drainage method with the smith fermentation tubes three parallel controlled trials are done to control the error ags samples were collected from three sampling tubes after 53 102 159 184 201 215 d respectively the granulometric distribution of the ags was analyzed by sieving method laguna et al 1999 extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted by thermal extraction zhen et al 2013 and the protein pn and polysaccharide ps content were analyzed by bicinchoninic acid bca method ras et al 2008 and anthrone sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 respectively coenzyme f420 was analyzed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry dong et al 2010 the granular sludge was pretreated tang et al 2011 and visualized with the s 3400 n ii hitachi japan scanning electron microscope sem 2 4 specific methanogenic activity a cumulative methane curve was determined by smith fermentation method sma chu et al 2005 first a certain amount of ags is added to the 100 ml serum bottles then the corresponding amount of soybean process wastewater with a cod mlvss of 0 7 1 6 is added nitrogen is blow into the serum bottles for 2 min and then they are sealed to ensure that the serum bottles provided in an anaerobic environment the serum bottles are placed in a constant temperature water bath shaker with a temperature of 37 c the 50 ml smith fermentation tubes are connected to the serum bottles through an infusion set to collect methane this set is filled with 2 m naohnacl solution to remove other gasses from the biogas the amount of methane produced is recorded at regular intervals the entire test process takes about 13 h after the test the mlvss of the sludge is measured and the relationship between cumulative methane production and test time is drawn based on the recorded data the sma u maxch4 ml ch4 g vss d is calculated according to formula 1 1 u maxc h 4 24 k m a x x v r where k max ml ch4 h is the maximum slope of the cumulative methane production curve x g vss l is the mlvss of the ags and v r l is the volume of soybean process wastewater used in smith fermentation assay 2 5 microbial community analysis throughout the study a total of four sludge samples were collected one sample for the inoculated ags namely one sample for the zone i one sample for the zone ii and one sample for the zone iii these samples were labeled as seed i ii and iii respectively the samples i ii and iii were collected from the zone i ii and iii respectively at day 210 amplicon library preparation and illumina miseq sequencing illumina san diego ca united states were carried out by shanghai personalbio technology co ltd shanghai china the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction pcr using the primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactachvtwtctaat while the v4 v5 region of archaeal 16s rrna genes was amplified using the primers 524f tgycagccgccgcggtaa and 958r yccggcgttgavtccaatt the original sequence that passed the quality screening is divided into the library and the sample according to the index and barcode information and the barcode sequence is removed microbiome bioinformatics were performed with qiime 2 2017 4 bolyen et al 2019 raw sequence data were demultiplexed and quality filtered using the q2 demux plugin followed by denoising with dada2 callahan et al 2016 each deduplicated sequence generated after dada2 quality control is called amplicon sequence variants asvs or feature sequence corresponding to otu representative sequence and the abundance table of these sequences in the sample is called feature table corresponding to otu table according to the distribution of asv otu in different samples evaluate the alpha diversity metrics observed otus and shannon shannon 1948 of each sample and use the sparse curve to reflect whether the sequencing depth is appropriate taxonomy was assigned to asvs using the classify sklearn naïve bayes taxonomy classifier in feature classifier plugin bokulich et al 2018 against the silva v132 99 otus reference sequences quast et al 2013 3 results and discussions 3 1 p sssab performance characteristic 3 1 1 cod removal efficiency according to fig 2 a the cod removal efficiency reached 91 06 after operating the p sssab for 30 days this indicated that the reactor had been started successfully with the increasing vlr the capacity of the reactor to adapt to load changes also increased the cod removal efficiency recovered to 86 00 within about 7 days in the beginning of the vlr increase period and only about 3 days at the later stage if the hrt was reduced to 6 32 h s10 the cod removal efficiency decreased from 85 90 to 78 80 after the effluent was stable under this condition the effluent cod was close to 2 0 g l which was not suitable for the subsequent aerobic biological treatment this could have been caused by the short hrt in the p sssab which was insufficient for the biodegradation of the substrate if the hrt was extended to 12 63 h s11 the cod removal recovered to 86 00 within one day and gradually rose to over 91 00 here the effluent cod was 0 5 1 0 g l it can be seen from the data in fig 2 b that the highest vlr of p sssab was 27 17 kg cod m3 d this value is higher than the vlr of other anaerobic reactors treating soybean process wastewater see table 1 most of them were under 10 kg cod m3 d and the highest vlr in table 1 was 13 5 kg cod m3 d performed by anaerobic filters af if the effluent cod was below 1 0 g l the most suitable vlr was about 16 0 kg cod m3 d which is still higher than that of the af table 1 3 1 2 ammonification characteristic fig 3 shows the nh4 n trend during the operation time the concentration of the influent nh4 n went up and down in general it increased from 51 1 mg l to 302 28 mg l due to the seasonal product production changes but remained stable in the high vlr operation period average of 237 55 mg l the effluent nh4 n increased relative to the influent during operation time and the nh4 n increment 44 28 69 77 mg l was stable in the high vlr operation period the average nh4 n increase efficiency was 29 16 3 1 3 operation stability during operation the effluent ph increased together with the vlr fig 4 a it was relatively stable in the start up phase and the vlr increase period average values 7 39 and 7 85 respectively but increased slightly in the high vlr operation period the average value was 8 03 as shown in figs 4 b and c both the effluent vfa and alk exhibited an obvious upward trend and tended to be stable during the high vlr operation period the average values were 165 4 mg l and 4960 8 mg l respectively fig 4 d indicated that the effluent vfa alk decreased rapidly during the start up period gradually decreased from 0 8 at the beginning and stabilized at 0 047 0 166 the effluent vfa alk during the vlr increase and high vlr operation period was relatively stable their average values were 0 056 and 0 039 respectively which indicated that the p sssab did not produce acidification therefore p sssab has a strong impact load resistance and still has a great load lifting potential 3 1 4 biogas and methane yield values in fig 5 b indicated that the methane content increased from 15 2 day 9 and stabilized at 69 98 72 22 in the early stage of the start up period the methane yield was low fig 5 a the result corroborated with those of wong et al 2008 they found that bacterial anabolism was the main reason for the cod removal in the initial stage of the anaerobic reactor startup during the start up period the biogas production rate stabilized at 0 14 0 16 m³ kg cod while the methane production rate increased from about 0 03 m³ kg cod and stabilized at 0 46 0 53 m³ kg cod the biogas production rate in the early stage of the vlr increase period s2 and s3 average value was 0 42 m³ kg cod continued to increase in the later stage s4 s6 it was basically consistent with that in the high vlr operation period s7 s11 average values were 0 69 and 0 67 m³ kg cod respectively the trend of the methane production rates average values were 0 29 0 48 and 0 47 m³ kg cod respectively were similar to the ones of the biogas production rates obviously the p sssab has a superior methane production performance these methane production rates are significantly better than the value 0 08 0 14 m³ kg cod reported by zhu et al 2008 in order to predict the methane yield in the actual project a linear relationship fomula 2 was used to fit the relationship between methane production rate y and vlr x 2 y kx b after linear fitting the following values were obtained k 0 4588 b 0 0024 corresponding r2 0 9773 fig 5 c the r2 indicate that this formula has a high reliability and can be used to predict the methane production rates when the vlr of the p sssab ranges between 0 32 and 27 17 kg cod m3 d 3 2 p sssab sludge bed characteristic 3 2 1 cod removal and ammonification in the p sssab sludge bed during the operation the effluent cod values of zone ii and zone iii were comparable fig 6 a the effluent cod of zone iii was slightly higher than that of zone ii the difference fluctuates between 0 04 and 0 62 g l in the start up period and in the early stage of the vlr increase period the effluent cod values of these sections tended to be stable in the later stage of vlr increase period and in the high vlr operation period values of zone iii average value was 0 93 g l was slightly lower than that of zone ii average 1 2 g l data in fig 6 b showed that at the same time the cod removal efficiency of zone i rose significantly throughout the whole experiment while the values of zone ii gradually increased from 17 83 to 91 83 in the start up period but subsequently decreased and stabilized during the high vlr operation period around 44 85 2 85 compared with zone i the cod removal efficiency of zone ii was higher than that of zone i in the start up period and in the early stage of the vlr increase period but lower in the other periods this shows that ags is adapted to the p sssab the cod removal efficiency gradually increased with the increase of the vlr it also can be seen from fig 6 b that the cod removal in zone iii was negative before the later vlr increase period around 124 days and only afterward became positive this may be caused by a mixed flow inside the p sssab and a low content of microorganisms in zone iii the contribution of the three zones of the p sssab to the cod removal efficiency were basically stable codi removal codii removal codiii removal 16 3 1 during the high vlr operation period with the contribution of zone i being the largest according to the figs 6 c and d the ammonification characteristic was synchronized with the change of the cod removal efficiency the transition period occurred in the later vlr increase period the contribution of zone ii is the largest before the middle vlr increase period around 124 d the contribution of the three zones to the ammonification tended to be stable nh4 ni increase nh4 nii increase nh4 n iii increase 2 3 4 see fig 6 d in the high vlr operation period here zone iii contributed most 3 2 2 operation stability of each zone of the p sssab sludge bed compared with the graphs in figs 7 a b c and d the trends of vfa alk vfa alk and ph obviously changed in the vlr increase period this occurred synchronized with the changes in the cod removal efficiency and the nh4 n increase during the high vlr operation period the ph averages for zones i ii and iii were 8 10 8 34 and 8 54 respectively while the vfa alk average values were 0 069 0 031 and 0 026 respectively these data indicate that none of the zones were acidified and that the p sssab operated stably 3 3 ags gradient distribution along the sludge bed and microbial community structure 3 3 1 ags gradient distribution along the sludge bed and its characteristic 1 ags particle size distribution and appearance fig 8 a shows the change of the particle size distribution of the ags in each zone of the p sssab sludge bed during operating time the ags mean diameters of zone i ii and iii gradually increased from 0 93 mm 0 33 mm and 0 20 mm t 53 d to 1 06 mm 0 43 mm and 0 25 mm t 184 d respectively this increase indicates that the ags was adapted successfully and formed granules in the p sssab sludge bed the ags proportions of all zones in the sludge bed which particle size were smaller than 0 7 mm rose slightly after increasing vlr hrt 6 32 h the average diameters of zone i ii and iii gradually increased from 0 99 mm 0 40 mm and 0 24 mm hrt 6 32 h to 1 07 mm 0 45 mm and 0 26 mm hrt 12 63 h respectively that indicate that high vlr has certain effects on ags diameters but these effects were reversible moreover with increase of the vlr fig 8 b the amount of ags in each zone grew gradually in the p sssab sludge bed the average diameter became increased and the color changed from brownish gray to black for the same vlr the particle size of the ags decreased gradually from zone i to zone iii in vertical direction of the sludge bed zone i was dominated by larger sludge granular whereas zone ii and iii were dominated by small sludge granular it is obvious that with the increase of the vlr in the p sssab the amount and average diameter of the ags in the vertical direction of the sludge bed had a certain gradient distribution which were suitable for soybean process wastewater treatment 2 sludge concentration as the fig 9 shows the mlss and mlvss of the ags increased in different zones gradually the increase of the mlvss during the start up period was slow while the mlvss increased rapidly during the vlr increase period from 27 9 5 12 and 1 74 kg m³ to 48 056 13 190 and 13 505 kg m³ in zones i ii and iii respectively during the high vlr operation period the mlvss was kept at a stable level 45 933 51 440 kg m³ for zone i 11 190 13 065 kg m³ for zone ii and 10 505 12 330 kg m³ for zone iii the mlss of the ags exhibited the same trend as the mlvss in the same period it can also be seen from fig 9 that mlvss mlss of ags in zone i remained relatively stable during the overall operation time average value of 0 758 while the mlvss mlss of the ags in zone ii and iii were improved significantly during the vlr increase period the values gradually increased from 0 524 to 0 456 to 0 687 and 0 692 respectively therefore during the high vlr operation period a high average value of the mlvss mlss of about 0 7 was calculated for the sludge bed this indicated that the ags had good activity 3 eps the stability of the ags is affected by the ratio of the pn and the ps in the eps the data in fig 10 showed that the trends for pn and ps in s eps lb eps and tb eps of the ags in each zone were almost same the pn ps ratio of s eps in zone i was the lowest among the three zones average value was 4 438 see fig 10 a while the pn ps ratios of the lb eps and tb eps were the highest ones average values are 6 244 and 4 956 respectively see figs 10 b and c this indicates that the ags in zone i agglomerated better and had a large particle size which is consistent with the ags appearance shown in fig 8 the pn ps ratio for the tb eps in zone iii was the lowest value among the three zones average value was 3 049 see fig 10 c while the pn ps ratios for the s eps and lb eps average values are 8 376 and 3 195 respectively see figs 10 a and b were slightly higher than those of zone ii average values are 7 725 and 3 175 respectively this means that the particle size of the ags in zone iii was low but increased with the increasing of the vlr it is also consistent with the ags appearance shown in fig 8 thus the eps of the ags in the zones i ii and iii increased with the vlr and the pn ps also increased gradually this causes the ags to be stable and tight and being well adapted to a high concentration soybean process wastewater treatment 4 sma and coenzyme f420 the sma and coenzyme f420 were measured for the inoculated asg and the ags sampled from each sampling tube at the 215th day see figs 11 a and b the sma values of the inoculated asg and sampling ags for zones i ii and iii were 5 83 316 79 642 63 and 666 35 ml ch4 g vss d respectively for coenzyme f420 values of 0 054 0 220 0 630 and 0 690 μmol g vss were measured respectively after 215 days the values for sma and f420 in the three zones all increased the differences between zone i and zones ii iii were relatively large while the differences between zone ii and zone iii were small the sma and coenzyme f420 values have a significant linear relationship y 1303 7x 107 55 r² 0 9866 see fig 11 c which is consistent with the report by dong et al 2010 as a result the methanogenic activity of the p sssab increased gradually from the bottom of the p sssab to the upper part the sma and coenzyme f420 contents in zone iii were 666 35 ml ch4 g vss d and 0 690μmol g vss respectively 3 3 2 sem morphology of the ags along the p sssab sludge bed compared with zones ii and iii see fig 12 it became obvious that the microbial flora of the ags in zone i was more diverse and complex at 45 d this allows the p sssab to adapt to variable water qualitied compared with zones i and ii the microbial flora in the ags in zone iii was quite dissimilar at 210 d most of the microorganisms in ags of zone iii were spherical cells and there were also a small number of rod cells and filamentous cells compared with the sem images in 45 day the microbial flora seem to be various and complex after 210 days microorganisms in ags of zones i and ii were mainly rod like cells while in zone iii mainly spherical cells occured 3 3 3 microbial community distributions of the ags along the p sssab sludge bed according to the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing an analysis of the microbial community in four microbial samples of the inoculated ags seed and the ags collected from zone i ii and iii i ii and iii for the respective in 210 days revealed the microbe distribution in the p sssab table 3 showed the alpha diversity of the bacteria and archaea in each sample good s coverage index refers to the coverage of each sample library the good s coverages of bacteria and archaea were all 0 98 which indicated that the probability of the sequence being detected in the samples was 98 it showed that the current sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the diversity level of the microbial flora in ags and the sequencing data can be used for subsequent analysis shannon diversity index and simpson index comprehensively reflects the diversity and evenness of the community compared with the inoculate sludge the microbial community of the ags collected from zone i ii and iii became more specific since the value of shannon diversity index and simpson index becomes smaller after the operation the chao1 estimator and observed species reflects the richness of the community compared with the inoculate sludge the bacteria species of the ags collected from zone i ii and iii became richer while the archaea species decreased therefore that indicated that after the operation the diversity of the microbial community in the ags had been improved but it was more specific in order to study the distribution of the flora in different zones and the contribution of different types of flora to the overall flora all sequences were compared with the silva online database to obtain the proportion of the overall flora under different taxonomic positions numerous bacterial phyla with varying dominance were detected in these four microbial samples among them dominant bacterial phyla relative abundance 1 0 which conducted critical roles in different phases of anaerobic degradation are shown in fig 13 a the seed i ii and iii majorly comprised of chloroflexi followed by firmicutes proteobacteria and acidobacteria these phyla were commonly found in the anaerobic degradation process and are known to be involved in carbohydrate fermentation tao et al 2020 wu et al 2021 compared with the seed the chloroflexi in i ii and iii were decreased after the 210 days operation while the firmicutes were increased it has been studied that the increase in the abundance of firmicutes can improve the ability of microorganisms to adapt to the environment of high ammonia nitrogen anaerobic digestion niu et al 2015 chloroflexi is common in anaerobic digestion systems that use carbohydrates as substrates and can help accelerate the hydrolysis and acidification of anaerobic digestion of organic matter but its abundance is greatly reduced as anaerobic digestion progresses yi et al 2014 that indicated that the ags in the p sssab became more adaptable to the soybean process wastewater and the p sssab was operated well at the genus level 20 dominant genera were detected relative abundance 1 0 fig 13 c considering the functional complexity and interactions between bacterial communities the functional expression of the bacterial species will not be discussed item by item in this work remarkably the abundance of syntrophomonas in i ii and iii had risen sharply compared to the seed it has been proven that syntrophomonadaceae such as syntrophomonas can perform direct interspecies electron transfer diet with methanogens methanosaeta and methanosarcina for the syntrophic degradation of vfas li et al 2015 that indicated that the methane production capacity of the p sssab was enhanced according to the results of the archaea sequencing samples on the phylum level fig 13 b the euryarchaeota the phylum that most methanogens belong to with a few exceptions evans et al 2015 is absolutely dominant assigned to archaea the results of the archaea sequencing samples on the genus level are presented in fig 13 d the relative abundance of methanosaeta in i ii and iii increased rapidly compared to that in seed methanosaeta microbes produce methane by means of acetic acid pyrolysis during methanation in the anaerobic digestion system it also is one of the methanogenic archaea that has been proven to be able to produce the methane through the diet mechanism li et al 2015 therefore the methane production capacity of the p sssab was enhanced 4 conclusions 1 p sssab can operate efficiently and stably during 216 days of operation the vlr range was 0 32 27 17 kg cod m3 d by shortening hrt which the highest vlr 27 17 kg cod m3 d was 2 01 times to the highest value 13 5 kg cod m3 d reported in the existing literature the optimum vlr was 22 kg cod m3 d to satisfy the influent quality of the follow up aerobic biological system influent cod 1 5 g l the ph and vfa alk of effluent were in the range of 6 9 9 2 and 0 017 0 066 respectively and ammonification rate was 29 16 2 the sludge bed of p sssab had obvious regional characteristics along the vertical direction zone i the bottom of the bed was the major contributor to the cod removal while zone iii the upper of the bed was the major contributor to the ammoniation the average mlvss mlss value in sludge bed was about 0 7 and the pn ps of the tb eps increased to 6 830 4 257 and 3 747 in zones i ii and iii respectively as the vlr of p sssab increased the ags activity and stability were simultaneously strengthened 3 p sssab had great methanogenic activity the cod based methane yield was 0 47 m³ kg cod which was 3 36 times to the highest value reported in the existing literature 0 08 0 14 m³ kg cod and sma and coenzyme f420 of zone iii is the highest which were 666 35 ml ch4 g vss d and 0 690 mol g vss respectively the relative abundance of microbe which perform diet for the syntrophic degradation of vfas and production of the methane has been increased significantly such as the bacteria syntrophomonas and archaea methanosaeta declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was sponsored by shanghai pujiang program no 2020pjd001 and

17056,a 300m3 d demonstration project of soybean process wastewater has been established recently with a spiral symmetric stream anaerobic bioreactor sssab as the core in order to obtain the optimal operation strategy for a full scale sssab and to make it run efficiently and stably in a demonstration project a pilot scale sssab p sssab effective volume 100 l was performed for the treatment of soybean process wastewater over 216 days the volumetric load rate vlr range of the p sssab was 0 32 27 17 kg cod m3 d where the highest vlr 27 17 kg cod m3 d was 2 01 times to the highest value 13 5 kg cod m3 d reported the ph and vfa alk of the effluent from the p sssab were in the range of 6 9 up to 9 2 and 0 03 up to 0 17 respectively the methane yield of the p sssab increased from 0 03 m3 kg cod to 0 47 m3 kg cod which was 3 36 times to the maximum value 0 14 m3 kg cod reported to meet the influent requirement of the aerobic biological treatment in demonstration project influent cod 1 5 g l the maximum vlr of sssab was optimal at about 22 kg cod m3 d by analyzing the sludge bed characteristics of the p sssab it was obvious that zone i the bottom of the bed was the major contributor of the cod removal while zone iii the upper part of the bed was the major contributor for the nh4 n increase the anaerobic granular sludge ags in the bed showed a good granulation the average mlvss mlss value in sludge bed was about 0 7 and pn ps in tb eps zone i ii and iii increased to 6 830 4 257 and 3 747 respectively sma and coenzyme f420 values of zone iii were the maximum 666 35 ml ch4 g vss d and 0 690 mol g vss respectively according to the analysis obtained from the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing the microbial community in the ags had been more specific to the soybean process wastewater since the bacteria firmicutes were increased the relative abundance of microbe which perform direct interspecies electron transfer diet for the syntrophic degradation of vfas and production of the methane has been increased significantly such as the bacteria syntrophomonas and archaea methanosaeta graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords spiral symmetric steam anaerobic bioreactor anaerobic granular sludge soybean product processing wastewater operation strategy sludge bed characteristics 1 introduction soybean is one of the major industrial and food crops grown on every continent tummino et al 2020 it has been reported by the organization for economic co operation and development and the food and agriculture organization that the united states brazil and argentina are the leading soybean growers and soybean meal producers oecd fao 2018 spiller et al 2020 during 2018 2019 the global soybean production exceeded 360 million tons tummino et al 2020 with the increasing demand for soybean meal it is estimated that its annual increase of soybean meal will be 1 6 until 2027 spiller et al 2020 at the same time soybean products are traditional nutritious and popular food because of its high protein contents and rational amino acid composition wolfe et al 2018 these are popular all over the world especially in korea japan and china kim et al 2011 but their production process consumes large amounts of freshwater and generates a very large volume of high concentration organic wastewater yu et al 2002 zheng et al 2010 which are mainly soaking water and yellow swill water xue et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 soybean process wastewater is characterized by its high chemical oxygen demand cod generally 10 20 g l high nitrogen content and low ph value li et al 2014 liu et al 2016 yu 2015 if this wastewater is discharged directly to the environment without any treatment it will do great harm to the environment and human beings wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 because of the seasonal production of the food industry the influent of the wastewater treatment plants is unstable dong et al 2010 zhao et al 2008 as a consequence the reactor operation is seasonally unstable dong et al 2010 which indicates that the reactor should have excellent tolerance to variations of organic loading and other external disturbances therefore improving the soybean process wastewater treatment technique is necessary there are many soybean process wastewater treatment methods some studies focus on membrane separation technology xiao et al 2009 since a large number of oligosaccharides soluble proteins and other substances can be recovered from wastewater which have great economic value wang and serventi 2019 but this technology has a lot of disadvantages such as blockage of membrane pores high construction and operating costs and so on which make it difficult to apply to the actual project because the soybean process wastewater is rich in biodegradable organic nutrients many studies have been devoted to the use of biological methods to achieve the biotransformation of the soybean process wastewater an aerobic biological treatment su and yu 2005 can remove a large amount of organics from wastewater but for eliminating the high concentration organics compounds from wastewater necessitates high aeration rates which cause high operation cost aerobic reactors also have numerous demerits such as high sludge yield and high influent water quality which greatly restrict the utilization for a field treatment system it is regarded that anaerobic biological treatment is the most efficient technology to deal with high concentration organic wastewater partially because of the low energy consumption little residual sludge generation high concentration tolerance for organic compounds and efficient energy recovery sun et al 2010 studied the performance of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb for soybean process wastewater treatment under different organic loading rates olr and hydraulic retention times hrt the result show that the most suitable olr and hrt were 6 kg cod m3 d and 24 h if the influent cod was 6 g l for these values the cod removal efficiency was 85 and the methane contents accounted for 72 of the biogas zhu et al 2015 used an anaerobic baffled reactor abr to study the production of methane from soybean process wastewater the results show that for an olr of 1 9 2 6 kg cod m3 d the cod removal efficiency accounted to 95 and the methane yield to 13 89 l d if hrt was 48 h and the temperature was 35 1 c zhu et al 2008 also operated a laboratory scale abr with four compartments and investigated the influence of the olr for the performance and phase separation characteristics the cod removal efficiencies were between 92 and 97 at 1 2 6 0 kg cod m3 d feeding a proper anaerobic consortium in each separate compartment had developed along as a consequence of the substrate availability and specific environmental conditions guo et al 2018 operated a pilot scale internal circulation anoxic oxic ic a o coupling reactor which was used for soybean process wastewater treatment results indicate that the hrt of the ic reactor were during 24 h at a constant cod removal efficiency of 90 according to the table 1 it can be seen that the volume loading rate vlr of anaerobic reactors is mostly below 10 kg cod m3 d in the existing literature the highest value is only 13 5 kg cod m3 d yu et al 2002 so far most of the anaerobic bioreactors used to treat wastewater have a high hrt and a low vlr which makes the biotransformation efficiency low the microbial anaerobic fermentation can be divided into three stages hydrolysis acidification hydrogen production acetogenesis and methanogenisis tan et al 2020 yu et al 2019 the three stages are not independent but synergistically connected during the degradation of the organic matter some anaerobic reactor sludge beds have obvious microbial zoning yu 2015 zhu et al 2008 the dominant bacteria of the different stages of the anaerobic fermentation are enriched in different zones of the reactor which help to improve the reactor processing efficiency based on this we have developed a highly efficiency anaerobic reactor with own intellectual property rights the spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor sssab in the reaction zone of sssab three elliptic plates were spirally and symmetrically set then the sludge bed was divided into three zones by the elliptic plates each zone was provided with a gas collection pipe to achieve respective biogas collection chen et al 2016 according to the previous studies chen et al 2015 2017 dai et al 2017 2016 the sssab has a superior operating performance for methanol sodium acetate wastewater chen et al 2016 the suitable treatment concentration is 24 g l and the recovery time of the sssab after inhibition accounts to 7 days super high rate olr volumetric removal rate vrr and improved volumetric methane production vmp were 361 5 kg cod m3 d 268 3 kg cod m3 d and 73 0 m3 m3 d respectively which were in a leading position compared with what has been reported in the existing literature the reactor also has been successfully applied to different types of wastewater treatment such as traditional chinese pharmaceutical wastewater chen et al 2019 azo dye wastewater dai et al 2018 and so on taking this reactor as the core three actual projects have been designed constructed operated all have produced a good cleaning effect like for the soybean product wastewater treatment project the polyacrylate slurry wastewater treatment project and the traditional chinese pharmaceutical wastewater treatment project in this study a pilot scale sssab p sssab was built for soybean process wastewater treatment the objective of this study was to obtain the optimal operation strategy for the sssab and to run efficiently and stably in a demonstration project the focus was on the maximum vlr and the methane production capacity of the p sssab the hrt was shortened to explore the efficient reliable process parameters enabling cod removal and methane production additionally the sludge bed characteristics of the p sssab was also analyzed through the continuous treatment of the soybean process wastewater 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental set up the apparatus is shown in fig 1 the p sssab is made of stainless steel and has a diameter of 0 4 m a height of 2 2 m and an effective volume of 100 l the p sssab contains three semi elliptical plates which divide it into four regions zones i ii and iii make up the sludge bed and the top zone is the separation zone for studying the sludge bed characteristics 3 sampling tubes are designed in zone i ii and iii respectively the distances between each sampling tube and the bottom of the p sssab were 30 60 and 90 cm respectively the soybean process wastewater gets into the p sssab from the storge tank by a metering pump then reacts in the sludge bed and leaves the reactor through a three phase separator in the separation zone during the experiment the circulation volume of the system is controlled by an external circulation pump to control the reflux ratio influent circulation 1 3 the p sssab was continuously fed with soybean process wastewater produced by jiangxi changhuaxuan food technology co ltd the sludge for inoculation was the anaerobic granular sludge ags obtained from the bottom of sssab operating in the demonstration project we established in this company the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was 41 81 0 52 g l and the mlvss mlss value was 0 74 these data show that the sedimentation performance of the ags was good before the start of the operating of the p sssab 30 l ags were inoculated into the reactor which account for about 30 of the total volume of the reactor 2 2 operation strategy for p sssab as data in table 2 showed the p sssab was operated over 216 days the vlr was gradually increased by shortening the hrt according to the vlr the operation period of the p sssab was divided into 11 stages the vlr was gradually increased from 0 91 kg cod m3 d to 1 39 2 60 3 24 6 41 9 47 11 95 16 05 22 64 20 59 kg cod m3 d and then decreased to 13 17 kg cod m3 d the corresponding hrts were 218 18 120 00 60 00 40 00 24 00 17 14 12 63 10 00 7 62 6 32 and 12 63 h respectively during the operation time the effluent cod should be kept below 1 5 g l even better at 1 0 g l in order to meet aerobic treatment requirements each operation cycle was consisted of at least 3 hrt the hrt can be shortened if the effluent cod is less than 1 5 g l and the cod removal efficiency is stable for more than one week aiyuk et al 2006 luostarinen et al 2006 wang et al 2012 the operating stages were classified based on the effluent cod and vlr of the reactor it can be seen from table 2 that s1 is the startup period where the cod removal efficiency exceeds 90 for the first time s2 s6 are classified as vlr increase period where the vlr gradually increases to about 10 kg cod m3 d s7 s11 are seen as the high vlr operation period where the vlr is greater than 10 kg cod m3 d 2 3 sampling and analytical methods during the continuous operations water samples were collected from three sampling tubes plus the water inlet and outlet cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n mlss and mlvss were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 1992 volatile fatty acids vfas and alkalinity were analyzed by combined titration method dos et al 2007 biogas samples were collected from the biogas outlet the content of the biogas and the ch4 was determined by the drainage method with the smith fermentation tubes three parallel controlled trials are done to control the error ags samples were collected from three sampling tubes after 53 102 159 184 201 215 d respectively the granulometric distribution of the ags was analyzed by sieving method laguna et al 1999 extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted by thermal extraction zhen et al 2013 and the protein pn and polysaccharide ps content were analyzed by bicinchoninic acid bca method ras et al 2008 and anthrone sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 respectively coenzyme f420 was analyzed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry dong et al 2010 the granular sludge was pretreated tang et al 2011 and visualized with the s 3400 n ii hitachi japan scanning electron microscope sem 2 4 specific methanogenic activity a cumulative methane curve was determined by smith fermentation method sma chu et al 2005 first a certain amount of ags is added to the 100 ml serum bottles then the corresponding amount of soybean process wastewater with a cod mlvss of 0 7 1 6 is added nitrogen is blow into the serum bottles for 2 min and then they are sealed to ensure that the serum bottles provided in an anaerobic environment the serum bottles are placed in a constant temperature water bath shaker with a temperature of 37 c the 50 ml smith fermentation tubes are connected to the serum bottles through an infusion set to collect methane this set is filled with 2 m naohnacl solution to remove other gasses from the biogas the amount of methane produced is recorded at regular intervals the entire test process takes about 13 h after the test the mlvss of the sludge is measured and the relationship between cumulative methane production and test time is drawn based on the recorded data the sma u maxch4 ml ch4 g vss d is calculated according to formula 1 1 u maxc h 4 24 k m a x x v r where k max ml ch4 h is the maximum slope of the cumulative methane production curve x g vss l is the mlvss of the ags and v r l is the volume of soybean process wastewater used in smith fermentation assay 2 5 microbial community analysis throughout the study a total of four sludge samples were collected one sample for the inoculated ags namely one sample for the zone i one sample for the zone ii and one sample for the zone iii these samples were labeled as seed i ii and iii respectively the samples i ii and iii were collected from the zone i ii and iii respectively at day 210 amplicon library preparation and illumina miseq sequencing illumina san diego ca united states were carried out by shanghai personalbio technology co ltd shanghai china the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction pcr using the primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactachvtwtctaat while the v4 v5 region of archaeal 16s rrna genes was amplified using the primers 524f tgycagccgccgcggtaa and 958r yccggcgttgavtccaatt the original sequence that passed the quality screening is divided into the library and the sample according to the index and barcode information and the barcode sequence is removed microbiome bioinformatics were performed with qiime 2 2017 4 bolyen et al 2019 raw sequence data were demultiplexed and quality filtered using the q2 demux plugin followed by denoising with dada2 callahan et al 2016 each deduplicated sequence generated after dada2 quality control is called amplicon sequence variants asvs or feature sequence corresponding to otu representative sequence and the abundance table of these sequences in the sample is called feature table corresponding to otu table according to the distribution of asv otu in different samples evaluate the alpha diversity metrics observed otus and shannon shannon 1948 of each sample and use the sparse curve to reflect whether the sequencing depth is appropriate taxonomy was assigned to asvs using the classify sklearn naïve bayes taxonomy classifier in feature classifier plugin bokulich et al 2018 against the silva v132 99 otus reference sequences quast et al 2013 3 results and discussions 3 1 p sssab performance characteristic 3 1 1 cod removal efficiency according to fig 2 a the cod removal efficiency reached 91 06 after operating the p sssab for 30 days this indicated that the reactor had been started successfully with the increasing vlr the capacity of the reactor to adapt to load changes also increased the cod removal efficiency recovered to 86 00 within about 7 days in the beginning of the vlr increase period and only about 3 days at the later stage if the hrt was reduced to 6 32 h s10 the cod removal efficiency decreased from 85 90 to 78 80 after the effluent was stable under this condition the effluent cod was close to 2 0 g l which was not suitable for the subsequent aerobic biological treatment this could have been caused by the short hrt in the p sssab which was insufficient for the biodegradation of the substrate if the hrt was extended to 12 63 h s11 the cod removal recovered to 86 00 within one day and gradually rose to over 91 00 here the effluent cod was 0 5 1 0 g l it can be seen from the data in fig 2 b that the highest vlr of p sssab was 27 17 kg cod m3 d this value is higher than the vlr of other anaerobic reactors treating soybean process wastewater see table 1 most of them were under 10 kg cod m3 d and the highest vlr in table 1 was 13 5 kg cod m3 d performed by anaerobic filters af if the effluent cod was below 1 0 g l the most suitable vlr was about 16 0 kg cod m3 d which is still higher than that of the af table 1 3 1 2 ammonification characteristic fig 3 shows the nh4 n trend during the operation time the concentration of the influent nh4 n went up and down in general it increased from 51 1 mg l to 302 28 mg l due to the seasonal product production changes but remained stable in the high vlr operation period average of 237 55 mg l the effluent nh4 n increased relative to the influent during operation time and the nh4 n increment 44 28 69 77 mg l was stable in the high vlr operation period the average nh4 n increase efficiency was 29 16 3 1 3 operation stability during operation the effluent ph increased together with the vlr fig 4 a it was relatively stable in the start up phase and the vlr increase period average values 7 39 and 7 85 respectively but increased slightly in the high vlr operation period the average value was 8 03 as shown in figs 4 b and c both the effluent vfa and alk exhibited an obvious upward trend and tended to be stable during the high vlr operation period the average values were 165 4 mg l and 4960 8 mg l respectively fig 4 d indicated that the effluent vfa alk decreased rapidly during the start up period gradually decreased from 0 8 at the beginning and stabilized at 0 047 0 166 the effluent vfa alk during the vlr increase and high vlr operation period was relatively stable their average values were 0 056 and 0 039 respectively which indicated that the p sssab did not produce acidification therefore p sssab has a strong impact load resistance and still has a great load lifting potential 3 1 4 biogas and methane yield values in fig 5 b indicated that the methane content increased from 15 2 day 9 and stabilized at 69 98 72 22 in the early stage of the start up period the methane yield was low fig 5 a the result corroborated with those of wong et al 2008 they found that bacterial anabolism was the main reason for the cod removal in the initial stage of the anaerobic reactor startup during the start up period the biogas production rate stabilized at 0 14 0 16 m³ kg cod while the methane production rate increased from about 0 03 m³ kg cod and stabilized at 0 46 0 53 m³ kg cod the biogas production rate in the early stage of the vlr increase period s2 and s3 average value was 0 42 m³ kg cod continued to increase in the later stage s4 s6 it was basically consistent with that in the high vlr operation period s7 s11 average values were 0 69 and 0 67 m³ kg cod respectively the trend of the methane production rates average values were 0 29 0 48 and 0 47 m³ kg cod respectively were similar to the ones of the biogas production rates obviously the p sssab has a superior methane production performance these methane production rates are significantly better than the value 0 08 0 14 m³ kg cod reported by zhu et al 2008 in order to predict the methane yield in the actual project a linear relationship fomula 2 was used to fit the relationship between methane production rate y and vlr x 2 y kx b after linear fitting the following values were obtained k 0 4588 b 0 0024 corresponding r2 0 9773 fig 5 c the r2 indicate that this formula has a high reliability and can be used to predict the methane production rates when the vlr of the p sssab ranges between 0 32 and 27 17 kg cod m3 d 3 2 p sssab sludge bed characteristic 3 2 1 cod removal and ammonification in the p sssab sludge bed during the operation the effluent cod values of zone ii and zone iii were comparable fig 6 a the effluent cod of zone iii was slightly higher than that of zone ii the difference fluctuates between 0 04 and 0 62 g l in the start up period and in the early stage of the vlr increase period the effluent cod values of these sections tended to be stable in the later stage of vlr increase period and in the high vlr operation period values of zone iii average value was 0 93 g l was slightly lower than that of zone ii average 1 2 g l data in fig 6 b showed that at the same time the cod removal efficiency of zone i rose significantly throughout the whole experiment while the values of zone ii gradually increased from 17 83 to 91 83 in the start up period but subsequently decreased and stabilized during the high vlr operation period around 44 85 2 85 compared with zone i the cod removal efficiency of zone ii was higher than that of zone i in the start up period and in the early stage of the vlr increase period but lower in the other periods this shows that ags is adapted to the p sssab the cod removal efficiency gradually increased with the increase of the vlr it also can be seen from fig 6 b that the cod removal in zone iii was negative before the later vlr increase period around 124 days and only afterward became positive this may be caused by a mixed flow inside the p sssab and a low content of microorganisms in zone iii the contribution of the three zones of the p sssab to the cod removal efficiency were basically stable codi removal codii removal codiii removal 16 3 1 during the high vlr operation period with the contribution of zone i being the largest according to the figs 6 c and d the ammonification characteristic was synchronized with the change of the cod removal efficiency the transition period occurred in the later vlr increase period the contribution of zone ii is the largest before the middle vlr increase period around 124 d the contribution of the three zones to the ammonification tended to be stable nh4 ni increase nh4 nii increase nh4 n iii increase 2 3 4 see fig 6 d in the high vlr operation period here zone iii contributed most 3 2 2 operation stability of each zone of the p sssab sludge bed compared with the graphs in figs 7 a b c and d the trends of vfa alk vfa alk and ph obviously changed in the vlr increase period this occurred synchronized with the changes in the cod removal efficiency and the nh4 n increase during the high vlr operation period the ph averages for zones i ii and iii were 8 10 8 34 and 8 54 respectively while the vfa alk average values were 0 069 0 031 and 0 026 respectively these data indicate that none of the zones were acidified and that the p sssab operated stably 3 3 ags gradient distribution along the sludge bed and microbial community structure 3 3 1 ags gradient distribution along the sludge bed and its characteristic 1 ags particle size distribution and appearance fig 8 a shows the change of the particle size distribution of the ags in each zone of the p sssab sludge bed during operating time the ags mean diameters of zone i ii and iii gradually increased from 0 93 mm 0 33 mm and 0 20 mm t 53 d to 1 06 mm 0 43 mm and 0 25 mm t 184 d respectively this increase indicates that the ags was adapted successfully and formed granules in the p sssab sludge bed the ags proportions of all zones in the sludge bed which particle size were smaller than 0 7 mm rose slightly after increasing vlr hrt 6 32 h the average diameters of zone i ii and iii gradually increased from 0 99 mm 0 40 mm and 0 24 mm hrt 6 32 h to 1 07 mm 0 45 mm and 0 26 mm hrt 12 63 h respectively that indicate that high vlr has certain effects on ags diameters but these effects were reversible moreover with increase of the vlr fig 8 b the amount of ags in each zone grew gradually in the p sssab sludge bed the average diameter became increased and the color changed from brownish gray to black for the same vlr the particle size of the ags decreased gradually from zone i to zone iii in vertical direction of the sludge bed zone i was dominated by larger sludge granular whereas zone ii and iii were dominated by small sludge granular it is obvious that with the increase of the vlr in the p sssab the amount and average diameter of the ags in the vertical direction of the sludge bed had a certain gradient distribution which were suitable for soybean process wastewater treatment 2 sludge concentration as the fig 9 shows the mlss and mlvss of the ags increased in different zones gradually the increase of the mlvss during the start up period was slow while the mlvss increased rapidly during the vlr increase period from 27 9 5 12 and 1 74 kg m³ to 48 056 13 190 and 13 505 kg m³ in zones i ii and iii respectively during the high vlr operation period the mlvss was kept at a stable level 45 933 51 440 kg m³ for zone i 11 190 13 065 kg m³ for zone ii and 10 505 12 330 kg m³ for zone iii the mlss of the ags exhibited the same trend as the mlvss in the same period it can also be seen from fig 9 that mlvss mlss of ags in zone i remained relatively stable during the overall operation time average value of 0 758 while the mlvss mlss of the ags in zone ii and iii were improved significantly during the vlr increase period the values gradually increased from 0 524 to 0 456 to 0 687 and 0 692 respectively therefore during the high vlr operation period a high average value of the mlvss mlss of about 0 7 was calculated for the sludge bed this indicated that the ags had good activity 3 eps the stability of the ags is affected by the ratio of the pn and the ps in the eps the data in fig 10 showed that the trends for pn and ps in s eps lb eps and tb eps of the ags in each zone were almost same the pn ps ratio of s eps in zone i was the lowest among the three zones average value was 4 438 see fig 10 a while the pn ps ratios of the lb eps and tb eps were the highest ones average values are 6 244 and 4 956 respectively see figs 10 b and c this indicates that the ags in zone i agglomerated better and had a large particle size which is consistent with the ags appearance shown in fig 8 the pn ps ratio for the tb eps in zone iii was the lowest value among the three zones average value was 3 049 see fig 10 c while the pn ps ratios for the s eps and lb eps average values are 8 376 and 3 195 respectively see figs 10 a and b were slightly higher than those of zone ii average values are 7 725 and 3 175 respectively this means that the particle size of the ags in zone iii was low but increased with the increasing of the vlr it is also consistent with the ags appearance shown in fig 8 thus the eps of the ags in the zones i ii and iii increased with the vlr and the pn ps also increased gradually this causes the ags to be stable and tight and being well adapted to a high concentration soybean process wastewater treatment 4 sma and coenzyme f420 the sma and coenzyme f420 were measured for the inoculated asg and the ags sampled from each sampling tube at the 215th day see figs 11 a and b the sma values of the inoculated asg and sampling ags for zones i ii and iii were 5 83 316 79 642 63 and 666 35 ml ch4 g vss d respectively for coenzyme f420 values of 0 054 0 220 0 630 and 0 690 μmol g vss were measured respectively after 215 days the values for sma and f420 in the three zones all increased the differences between zone i and zones ii iii were relatively large while the differences between zone ii and zone iii were small the sma and coenzyme f420 values have a significant linear relationship y 1303 7x 107 55 r² 0 9866 see fig 11 c which is consistent with the report by dong et al 2010 as a result the methanogenic activity of the p sssab increased gradually from the bottom of the p sssab to the upper part the sma and coenzyme f420 contents in zone iii were 666 35 ml ch4 g vss d and 0 690μmol g vss respectively 3 3 2 sem morphology of the ags along the p sssab sludge bed compared with zones ii and iii see fig 12 it became obvious that the microbial flora of the ags in zone i was more diverse and complex at 45 d this allows the p sssab to adapt to variable water qualitied compared with zones i and ii the microbial flora in the ags in zone iii was quite dissimilar at 210 d most of the microorganisms in ags of zone iii were spherical cells and there were also a small number of rod cells and filamentous cells compared with the sem images in 45 day the microbial flora seem to be various and complex after 210 days microorganisms in ags of zones i and ii were mainly rod like cells while in zone iii mainly spherical cells occured 3 3 3 microbial community distributions of the ags along the p sssab sludge bed according to the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing an analysis of the microbial community in four microbial samples of the inoculated ags seed and the ags collected from zone i ii and iii i ii and iii for the respective in 210 days revealed the microbe distribution in the p sssab table 3 showed the alpha diversity of the bacteria and archaea in each sample good s coverage index refers to the coverage of each sample library the good s coverages of bacteria and archaea were all 0 98 which indicated that the probability of the sequence being detected in the samples was 98 it showed that the current sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the diversity level of the microbial flora in ags and the sequencing data can be used for subsequent analysis shannon diversity index and simpson index comprehensively reflects the diversity and evenness of the community compared with the inoculate sludge the microbial community of the ags collected from zone i ii and iii became more specific since the value of shannon diversity index and simpson index becomes smaller after the operation the chao1 estimator and observed species reflects the richness of the community compared with the inoculate sludge the bacteria species of the ags collected from zone i ii and iii became richer while the archaea species decreased therefore that indicated that after the operation the diversity of the microbial community in the ags had been improved but it was more specific in order to study the distribution of the flora in different zones and the contribution of different types of flora to the overall flora all sequences were compared with the silva online database to obtain the proportion of the overall flora under different taxonomic positions numerous bacterial phyla with varying dominance were detected in these four microbial samples among them dominant bacterial phyla relative abundance 1 0 which conducted critical roles in different phases of anaerobic degradation are shown in fig 13 a the seed i ii and iii majorly comprised of chloroflexi followed by firmicutes proteobacteria and acidobacteria these phyla were commonly found in the anaerobic degradation process and are known to be involved in carbohydrate fermentation tao et al 2020 wu et al 2021 compared with the seed the chloroflexi in i ii and iii were decreased after the 210 days operation while the firmicutes were increased it has been studied that the increase in the abundance of firmicutes can improve the ability of microorganisms to adapt to the environment of high ammonia nitrogen anaerobic digestion niu et al 2015 chloroflexi is common in anaerobic digestion systems that use carbohydrates as substrates and can help accelerate the hydrolysis and acidification of anaerobic digestion of organic matter but its abundance is greatly reduced as anaerobic digestion progresses yi et al 2014 that indicated that the ags in the p sssab became more adaptable to the soybean process wastewater and the p sssab was operated well at the genus level 20 dominant genera were detected relative abundance 1 0 fig 13 c considering the functional complexity and interactions between bacterial communities the functional expression of the bacterial species will not be discussed item by item in this work remarkably the abundance of syntrophomonas in i ii and iii had risen sharply compared to the seed it has been proven that syntrophomonadaceae such as syntrophomonas can perform direct interspecies electron transfer diet with methanogens methanosaeta and methanosarcina for the syntrophic degradation of vfas li et al 2015 that indicated that the methane production capacity of the p sssab was enhanced according to the results of the archaea sequencing samples on the phylum level fig 13 b the euryarchaeota the phylum that most methanogens belong to with a few exceptions evans et al 2015 is absolutely dominant assigned to archaea the results of the archaea sequencing samples on the genus level are presented in fig 13 d the relative abundance of methanosaeta in i ii and iii increased rapidly compared to that in seed methanosaeta microbes produce methane by means of acetic acid pyrolysis during methanation in the anaerobic digestion system it also is one of the methanogenic archaea that has been proven to be able to produce the methane through the diet mechanism li et al 2015 therefore the methane production capacity of the p sssab was enhanced 4 conclusions 1 p sssab can operate efficiently and stably during 216 days of operation the vlr range was 0 32 27 17 kg cod m3 d by shortening hrt which the highest vlr 27 17 kg cod m3 d was 2 01 times to the highest value 13 5 kg cod m3 d reported in the existing literature the optimum vlr was 22 kg cod m3 d to satisfy the influent quality of the follow up aerobic biological system influent cod 1 5 g l the ph and vfa alk of effluent were in the range of 6 9 9 2 and 0 017 0 066 respectively and ammonification rate was 29 16 2 the sludge bed of p sssab had obvious regional characteristics along the vertical direction zone i the bottom of the bed was the major contributor to the cod removal while zone iii the upper of the bed was the major contributor to the ammoniation the average mlvss mlss value in sludge bed was about 0 7 and the pn ps of the tb eps increased to 6 830 4 257 and 3 747 in zones i ii and iii respectively as the vlr of p sssab increased the ags activity and stability were simultaneously strengthened 3 p sssab had great methanogenic activity the cod based methane yield was 0 47 m³ kg cod which was 3 36 times to the highest value reported in the existing literature 0 08 0 14 m³ kg cod and sma and coenzyme f420 of zone iii is the highest which were 666 35 ml ch4 g vss d and 0 690 mol g vss respectively the relative abundance of microbe which perform diet for the syntrophic degradation of vfas and production of the methane has been increased significantly such as the bacteria syntrophomonas and archaea methanosaeta declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was sponsored by shanghai pujiang program no 2020pjd001 and

17057,utilization of biogas from wastewater treatment plants wwtps as a kind of renewable energy can effectively alleviate the escalating energy crisis however volatile methylsiloxanes vms exist in biogas as impurities and hinder its efficient use adsorption is the main technology to achieve high efficiency purification of vms currently yet studies on the adsorption processes and mechanisms are quite insufficient here we use the static vapor adsorption method to investigate the adsorption performances and mechanisms of four typical zeolite adsorbents hbeta sba 15 mor and mcm 41 towards hexamethyldisiloxane l2 which is a representative of vms results suggest the adsorption interaction of l2 and zeolite is closely related to the pore size of zeolite and follows the order of hbeta mcm 41 sba 15 mor the adsorption rate constants of l2 on mcm 41 are larger than the others in the most relative pressure ranges besides cyclic adsorption desorption performances of l2 on mcm 41 sba 15 and hbeta show their super recycling properties these studies would provide important information on designing an effective zeolite l2 adsorption system and are helpful to understand the deeper adsorption

wastewater treatment plants xrd x ray diffraction 1 introduction ever potential risk of the depletion of traditional fossil fuel has encouraging people to seek green and renewable energy and biogas from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is an effective choice omar et al 2018 zabed et al 2020 holding a combustion heat of approximately 15 30 mj nm3 biogas can be used as clean energy in gas turbines engines boilers and fuel cells abatzoglou and boivin 2009 ciccoli et al 2010 papurello et al 2018a however the composition of biogas is complex and some impurities contained in biogas seriously affect its use of which volatile methylsiloxanes vms are especially concerned the precursors of vms are various anthropogenic methylsiloxanes which decompose and transform into vms during the anaerobic digestion process in wwtps and finally exist in biogas wang et al 2015a huang et al 2020 the main structure of vms contains alternating silicon oxygen bonds with a certain number of organic groups such as methyl and ethyl bounding to the silicon atoms dewil et al 2006 during the process of combustion vms converts to silicon dioxide deposits on the inner walls of gas turbines or clog the anode pores of fuel cells and finally reduces their thermal efficiency gersen et al 2019 mcbean 2008 papurello et al 2018b thus the removal of vms is necessary until now technologies including catalytic decomposition divsalar et al 2019 liquid absorption santiago et al 2020 microbial degradation zhang et al 2020 membrane separation žák et al 2018 and adsorption durán et al 2018 are tried to remove vms from biogas among them adsorption is widely used for its convenience and low cost and activated carbon and silica gel are the two main adsorbents for example papurello et al tested the feasibility of applying waste based activated carbons for the removal of vms considering their cost advantage over commercial carbons papurello et al 2018b 2019 cabrera codony et al investigated the adsorbed amounts of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane d4 a kind of vms on 12 different activated carbons results provided evidences that their total pore volumes the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas and the mesopore volumes had high correlation with the adsorbed amounts cabrera codony et al 2014 the significance of these mesopores lies in their supplying of sufficiently wide transport channels for vms molecules which increases the accessibility of adsorption sites in the inner parts of adsorbents cabrera codony et al 2018 sigot et al found that although the bet surface area of silica gel was lower than activated carbon the d4 adsorbed amount was 4 5 times higher than that of activated carbon this might because silica gel contained many silicon oxygen bonds which had a high affinity with vms sigot et al 2014 these studies proved the effectiveness of activated carbon and silica gel in vms adsorption papurello et al 2018c nyamukamba et al 2020 however some structural defects hinder the further improvement on their adsorption properties as for activated carbon its main component is carbon and cannot adapt to high temperature in an oxidation atmosphere during the thermal regenerated process after saturation they are prone to burn and have a fire risk wang et al 2019 for silica gel although its adsorbed amount towards vms is higher than activated carbon the value would significantly decrease with the increase of relative humidity because stronger adsorption occurs between the oxygen containing functional groups and water molecules on the surface of silica gel ortega and subrenat 2009 thus more suitable adsorbents are in need to overcome these defects recently zeolites are paid more and more attention to their potential adsorption properties towards vms cabrera codony et al found that the uptake of d4 on zeolite bea reached about 140 mg g they attributed this amount to the chemical conversion through which vms molecules were catalyzed into chain products however this explanation seemed unreasonable considering all the adsorbates were catalytically decomposed at 295 k cabrera codony et al 2017 on the contrary we believed the uptake of d4 was mainly caused by adsorption sigot et al found that the adsorbed amount of d4 on zeolite 13x was about 113 mg g sigot et al 2016 in a recent study lin et al predicted the adsorption properties of 50 959 kinds of hypothetical pure silica zeolites towards linear siloxanes through machine learning method finally they identified 230 zeolites possessed better adsorbed properties towards the target linear siloxanes lin et al 2020 however the real absorptive capacities of these adsorbents need further verification through experimental research before industrial application generally at the current stage information on the adsorption isotherms and mechanisms of vms on zeolites is insufficient or not easily available in literatures yet it is pretty important for understanding the adsorption processes in this research we choose four typical zeolites with different porous structures as adsorbents and use the static gravimetric method to study their adsorption properties towards hexamethyldisiloxane l2 which is a representative of vms in biogas gislon et al 2013 rasi et al 2014 the selection of these adsorbents is mainly based on the relationship between their pore sizes and the molecular size of l2 which is approximately 1 0 nanometer wang et al 2020 the adsorption heats and diffusion mechanisms are discussed based on their porous structures besides their recycling performances are studied these results are helpful to screen adsorbent with good vms adsorption performance and can provide important information to achieve a deeper understanding of the adsorption mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents and adsorbate four zeolites were used in this study including mordenite mor hbeta mcm 41 and sba 15 mor and hbeta was supplied by nankai university catalyst co ltd tianjin china before using the zeolites were calcined at 773 k for 2 h to remove water and other adsorbed substances with a heating rate of 5 k min mcm 41 and sba 15 were synthesized from the template method deng et al 2017 after synthesis they were placed in a desiccator and ready for use l2 with purity greater than 99 was used as adsorbate aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china 2 2 material characterization the crystal parameters and characteristics of the zeolites were obtained on a powder diffractometer x per pro mpd panalytical b v holland through the x ray diffraction xrd method the excitation source of x ray is cu kα and the wavelength is 0 154 nanometers before testing the samples were ground into powder and then spread on the slide the porous structures of zeolites were analyzed using the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms which were measured on a gas sorption analyzer micromeritics asap 2020 micromeritics instrument corporation usa wang et al 2020 their bet specific surface areas were calculated based on the bet theory using the adsorbed amounts of nitrogen within the relative pressure from 0 05 to 0 20 the total pore volumes were calculated from the adsorbed values when the relative pressures were about 0 99 and the micropore volumes were obtained based on the t plot method for the pore size distributions in order to facilitate the consistent comparison density functional theory dft calculation using the adsorption branch of the isotherm was adopted 2 3 static adsorption adsorption properties of l2 on zeolites were measured on an intelligent gravimetric analyzer iga 002 hiden analytical company the united kingdom iga device is effective and widely used to study the adsorption processes and mechanisms han et al 2020 lin et al 2006 the instrument can accurately control the temperature and pressure and record the weight changes of adsorbent during the whole adsorption process with time the accuracy of the instrument is 0 2 μg by adjusting the temperature adsorption isotherms at different temperatures can be obtained in this study l2 was used as adsorbate and its saturated vapor pressure is calculated from the antoine equation 1 log p 0 a b t c where p 0 is the saturated vapor pressure 0 1 mpa at a specific temperature t kelvin a b c are antoine constants in the temperature range studied they are 3 90199 1203 916 and 64 673 respectively flaningam 1986 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents the xrd patterns of zeolites are depicted in fig s1 for mcm 41 three diffraction peaks in the range of 2 6 correspond to the 100 110 and 200 crystal planes respectively suggesting the formation of ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure sepehrian et al 2009 similarly sba 15 also has the typical two dimensional hexagonal structure do et al 2004 for mor and hbeta zeolites the characteristic peaks of their crystal structures were consistent with those in the literatures indicating the phase integrity of their skeleton structures the typical characteristic peaks of mor molecular sieves are mainly at 6 5 9 8 13 5 19 7 22 4 and 25 8 cai et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 while those of hbeta are mainly at 7 6 14 6 and 22 4 morais et al 2019 sujeerakulkai and jitkarnka 2016 fig 1 displays the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of various zeolites mor shows a typical i a isotherm indicating its intrinsic microporous property the adsorption isotherm of hbeta is similar to that of mor in the low and medium pressure stage but the adsorbed amount seems to grow infinitely at the higher relative pressure stage which may because of unlimited multi layer adsorption according to the recommendation of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac thommes et al 2015 for mcm 41 the adsorption capacity of nitrogen is higher at the low relative pressure stage because its microporous volume is higher than others with the rise of relative pressure the adsorption capacity increases due to capillary condensation similar to mcm 41 sba 15 also exhibits capillary condensation and shows type iv adsorption isotherm besides the larger type h1 hysteresis loop of sba 15 suggests that its pore size is wider than that of mcm 41 the specific surface areas and pore volumes of various zeolites are calculated by the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and listed in table 1 clearly mcm 41 has a higher specific surface area and sba 15 has a higher pore volume these values are relatively larger than other zeolites from references shown in table 1 the pore sizes follow the order of sba 15 mcm 41 hbeta mor in addition for mcm 41 considering it is a pure mesoporous adsorbent the micropore area and micropore volume are regarded as 0 and the total specific surface area is equal to the external specific surface area 3 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of l2 on zeolites at 298 k 308 k and 318 k are shown in fig 2 in general the saturated adsorption capacities of zeolites follow an order of sba 15 mcm 41 hbeta mor implying more l2 can be adsorbed by sba 15 and mcm 41 in practical application for all zeolites the adsorption capacity of l2 decreases partly with the increase of temperature these apparent changes suggest the adsorption process may be caused by the intrinsic physical adsorption meanwhile different zeolites also display unique properties for hbeta the adsorption of l2 vapor shows typical characteristics of unrestricted monolayer multilayer adsorption thommes et al 2015 however this seems unreasonable if we notice that the pore size of hbeta is only about 1 nanometer and this narrow pore would not support the formation of multilayer adsorption one possible reason might be the multilayer adsorption occurs in the three dimensional channels of hbeta which connecting the inside and outside surfaces thus no spatial constraints exist janda et al 2016 for sba 15 the adsorption isotherm is similar to that of nitrogen and represents the characteristics of type iv isotherm this is because the pore size is larger than the molecular size of l2 and capillary condensation effect occurs besides in the nitrogen adsorption desorption curves of sba 15 the relative pressure value that starts to form capillary condensation is about 0 7 where the adsorbed amount of nitrogen increases significantly while the corresponding value of l2 is about 0 43 2500 pa to 585 700 pa in fig 3 b 298 k the reason of this phenomenon may be that an adsorbate molecule with larger size is more likely to form capillary condensation in the interconnected channels unexpectedly for mcm 41 when the adsorbate changes from nitrogen to l2 the adsorption isotherms changed clearly from type iv to type i indicating monolayer adsorption occurs this is the first time that we have observed this kind of change caused by the replace of inorganic gas with an organic vapor we infer that it was because the molecular size of l2 is closer to the pore size of mcm 41 than nitrogen wang et al 2020 thus mcm 41 can be regarded as a conceptual microporous adsorbent for l2 for mor its adsorbed amount towards l2 decreases greatly with the increase of temperature besides the adsorbed amount is quite small compared with other adsorbents considering the pore size of mor is smaller than the molecular sizes of l2 it seems unable for l2 to enter the inner pores of mor thus the small amount of adsorption may be caused by the adsorption of l2 in some collapsed pores or on its outer surface a series of adsorption equations with different physical significances are used to fit the experimental adsorption data in this study as the zeolites have different structures and the isotherms show different shapes here we choose the widely used virial equation to fit the isotherms bell et al 2011 the expression is 2 in n p a 0 a 1 n a 2 n 2 a 3 n 3 where n is the adsorption capacity at pressure p pa a 0 is the first virial coefficient which is related to the henry s law constant k h k h exp a 0 the constant reflects the degree of the interaction force between the adsorbent and adsorbate molecules at the low relative pressures and is closely related with the spatial density of available adsorption sites bell et al 2011 jeong et al 2017 generally the larger the constant is the more available adsorption sites are the parameters and henry s law constants of l2 on zeolites fitted by virial equation are listed in table 2 clearly the henry s law constants follow the order of hbeta mcm 41 sba 15 mor these constants provide a reference for the preliminary screening of candidates for industrial application and hbeta mcm 41 and sba 15 show relatively better suitability considering their available adsorption sites for l2 adsorption are more than mor the magnitude of henry s law constants is closely related to the pore sizes of zeolites from fig 1 the pore size of hbeta is mainly about 1 0 nanometer this value is pretty close to the molecular diameter of l2 and finally shows a relatively strong adsorption force comparatively the pore size of mcm 41 is about 2 3 times of the molecular diameter of l2 thus their interaction decreases to a certain extent which is reflected in the decrease of henry s law constant from 3 21 10 4 to 6 88 10 5 at 298 k the constants of sba 15 are the same order of magnitude as mcm 41 because of their similar mesoporous property their constants are slightly higher than the values of organic vapors with smaller molecular sizes wang et al 2015b 2014 the pore size of mor is about 0 8 nanometer and smaller than the molecular size of l2 thus l2 cannot diffuse into the inner pores of mor to promote the effective adsorption with the increase of temperature the numbers of l2 molecules that can enter the pores continuously decrease and the finally adsorbed amount reduces 3 3 isosteric heat of adsorption the isosteric heat of adsorption is a commonly used index to evaluate the strength and distribution of adsorption energy between the adsorption sites and the adsorbate molecules jeong et al 2017 in this research the isosteric heats of adsorption of l2 on zeolites were calculated by the van t hoff equation wang et al 2015b and the results are depicted in fig 3 obviously all the isosteric heats of adsorption show a non linear variation qualitatively suggesting that the energy distribution of adsorption sites on surfaces is heterogeneous a significant difference in the adsorption heats of l2 on the four zeolites can be found in fig 3 for sba 15 the adsorption heat gradually decreases to the molar enthalpy of l2 δhvap 36 9 kj mol with the increase of adsorbed amount this is the typical variation rule of the adsorption heat when adsorption process occurs on an adsorbent with pore size larger than the adsorbate dou et al 2010 wang et al 2020 the adsorption heat of l2 on hbeta slightly increased and then fluctuates around the molar enthalpy of l2 during the whole adsorption process which illustrating the weak interaction between the l2 molecules in contrast the heat on mcm 41 increased with the rise of adsorbed amount this implies the strong interaction forces between l2 molecules especially as the adsorption occurs in the small and narrow mesopores wang et al 2020 quite abnormally the heat of l2 on mor is much higher than the molar enthalpy of l2 the cause of this phenomenon is unclear and might be related to some adsorption sites with high adsorption energy 3 4 adsorption kinetics in this study the linear driving force ldf model was used to calculate the adsorption kinetics of l2 on the four zeolites for its concise expression and wide application wang et al 2015b 2014 fig 4 shows the typical weight change curves with time during the adsorption process of l2 on the four zeolites and the pressure points of l2 are 499 pa and 3299 pa respectively the points represent the experimental records and the red curve represents the fitting equation these curves show that the ldf equation can well fit the adsorption kinetics of l2 on the four zeolites indicating in the range of large micropores and narrow mesopores as in this study the diffusion of l2 molecules through the barrier at the pore entrance of zeolite is the main diffusion barriers wang et al 2015b bell et al 2011 the ldf model was further used to fit the adsorption kinetics of l2 in the whole range of relative pressure the adsorption rate constants are shown in fig 5 generally the adsorption kinetics of hbeta and mcm 41 are similar to each other with the increase of relative pressure the diffusion rate constants show obvious fluctuation indicating the adsorption process may be mainly in the form of continuous adsorption diffusion adsorption wang et al 2015b besides the adsorption rate constants on hbeta are mainly between 10 10 3 and 15 10 3 while the parameters on mcm 41 are between 15 10 3 and 20 10 3 this is because of the larger pore size of mcm 41 than hbeta considering the pore size of mcm 41 is about 3 times that of hbeta the rate constants of l2 on hbeta do not seem to decrease significantly which might be benefited from its three dimensional pores for sba 15 the adsorption rate constant decreases with the increase of relative pressure and reaches the lowest value when the relative pressure is between 0 4 and 0 5 i e about 3 10 3 at this relative pressure capillary condensation occurs and finally results in a dramatic decrease when the relative pressure continues to increase from 0 5 to 0 8 the adsorption rate gradually rises to 15 10 3 and remains unchanged however the adsorption rate of l2 on mor remains about 1 10 3 in most of the relative pressure suggesting the adsorbate molecules can hardly diffuse into the inner pores of mor this corresponds to the lower adsorption capacity in fig 2 as the relative pressure gradually reaches 0 5 the adsorption rate increases to approximately 7 10 3 yet no matter what the change of the adsorption rates they are lower than the values on other zeolites in the most of pressure ranges implying the narrow pore size of mor limits its adsorption property both in capacity and the adsorption rate 3 5 cyclic adsorption performance the adsorption vacuum desorption experiments were performed to evaluate the cyclic adsorption performance of l2 on different zeolites in this section only sba 15 mcm 41 and hbeta were tested since the adsorbed amount of l2 on mor was much lower than others in the cyclic operation the pressure of l2 circulates and the adsorbed amounts of l2 on zeolites were then recorded concomitantly the upper limit of the pressure is set at 2500 pa because this is the critical pressure at which l2 begins to condense in sba 15 clearly as shown in fig 6 the adsorbed amounts of l2 on the three zeolites remain unchanged after eight consecutive cycles of adsorption and desorption besides the absolute adsorption capacity of l2 on mcm 41 is larger than sba 15 and hbeta benefiting from the more proper pore size mcm 41 is more suitable for the l2 adsorption this implies its potential in industrial application especially at lower concentrations in the real situation 4 conclusion four zeolites with different porous structures hbeta sba 15 mcm 41 and mor were used as adsorbents to study their adsorption properties towards l2 the adsorption isotherms isosteric heats and adsorption kinetics of l2 on these zeolites were investigated by the static adsorption method results show that the henry s law constants of l2 on zeolites follow the order of hbeta mcm 41 sba 15 mor and are closely related to the pore size of zeolites the adsorption rate constants of l2 on mcm 41 are higher than hbeta and mor while the constants on sba 15 decrease greatly when capillary condensation occurs cyclic adsorption vacuum desorption studies verify the super recycling performance of the zeolites except mor generally the relatively higher adsorption capacity the larger adsorption rate constants as well as the superior recycling performance identify mcm 41 is more suitable for the adsorption of l2 at low concentrations in the real industrial situation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that no conflict of interest exists in the submission of

17057,utilization of biogas from wastewater treatment plants wwtps as a kind of renewable energy can effectively alleviate the escalating energy crisis however volatile methylsiloxanes vms exist in biogas as impurities and hinder its efficient use adsorption is the main technology to achieve high efficiency purification of vms currently yet studies on the adsorption processes and mechanisms are quite insufficient here we use the static vapor adsorption method to investigate the adsorption performances and mechanisms of four typical zeolite adsorbents hbeta sba 15 mor and mcm 41 towards hexamethyldisiloxane l2 which is a representative of vms results suggest the adsorption interaction of l2 and zeolite is closely related to the pore size of zeolite and follows the order of hbeta mcm 41 sba 15 mor the adsorption rate constants of l2 on mcm 41 are larger than the others in the most relative pressure ranges besides cyclic adsorption desorption performances of l2 on mcm 41 sba 15 and hbeta show their super recycling properties these studies would provide important information on designing an effective zeolite l2 adsorption system and are helpful to understand the deeper adsorption

wastewater treatment plants xrd x ray diffraction 1 introduction ever potential risk of the depletion of traditional fossil fuel has encouraging people to seek green and renewable energy and biogas from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is an effective choice omar et al 2018 zabed et al 2020 holding a combustion heat of approximately 15 30 mj nm3 biogas can be used as clean energy in gas turbines engines boilers and fuel cells abatzoglou and boivin 2009 ciccoli et al 2010 papurello et al 2018a however the composition of biogas is complex and some impurities contained in biogas seriously affect its use of which volatile methylsiloxanes vms are especially concerned the precursors of vms are various anthropogenic methylsiloxanes which decompose and transform into vms during the anaerobic digestion process in wwtps and finally exist in biogas wang et al 2015a huang et al 2020 the main structure of vms contains alternating silicon oxygen bonds with a certain number of organic groups such as methyl and ethyl bounding to the silicon atoms dewil et al 2006 during the process of combustion vms converts to silicon dioxide deposits on the inner walls of gas turbines or clog the anode pores of fuel cells and finally reduces their thermal efficiency gersen et al 2019 mcbean 2008 papurello et al 2018b thus the removal of vms is necessary until now technologies including catalytic decomposition divsalar et al 2019 liquid absorption santiago et al 2020 microbial degradation zhang et al 2020 membrane separation žák et al 2018 and adsorption durán et al 2018 are tried to remove vms from biogas among them adsorption is widely used for its convenience and low cost and activated carbon and silica gel are the two main adsorbents for example papurello et al tested the feasibility of applying waste based activated carbons for the removal of vms considering their cost advantage over commercial carbons papurello et al 2018b 2019 cabrera codony et al investigated the adsorbed amounts of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane d4 a kind of vms on 12 different activated carbons results provided evidences that their total pore volumes the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas and the mesopore volumes had high correlation with the adsorbed amounts cabrera codony et al 2014 the significance of these mesopores lies in their supplying of sufficiently wide transport channels for vms molecules which increases the accessibility of adsorption sites in the inner parts of adsorbents cabrera codony et al 2018 sigot et al found that although the bet surface area of silica gel was lower than activated carbon the d4 adsorbed amount was 4 5 times higher than that of activated carbon this might because silica gel contained many silicon oxygen bonds which had a high affinity with vms sigot et al 2014 these studies proved the effectiveness of activated carbon and silica gel in vms adsorption papurello et al 2018c nyamukamba et al 2020 however some structural defects hinder the further improvement on their adsorption properties as for activated carbon its main component is carbon and cannot adapt to high temperature in an oxidation atmosphere during the thermal regenerated process after saturation they are prone to burn and have a fire risk wang et al 2019 for silica gel although its adsorbed amount towards vms is higher than activated carbon the value would significantly decrease with the increase of relative humidity because stronger adsorption occurs between the oxygen containing functional groups and water molecules on the surface of silica gel ortega and subrenat 2009 thus more suitable adsorbents are in need to overcome these defects recently zeolites are paid more and more attention to their potential adsorption properties towards vms cabrera codony et al found that the uptake of d4 on zeolite bea reached about 140 mg g they attributed this amount to the chemical conversion through which vms molecules were catalyzed into chain products however this explanation seemed unreasonable considering all the adsorbates were catalytically decomposed at 295 k cabrera codony et al 2017 on the contrary we believed the uptake of d4 was mainly caused by adsorption sigot et al found that the adsorbed amount of d4 on zeolite 13x was about 113 mg g sigot et al 2016 in a recent study lin et al predicted the adsorption properties of 50 959 kinds of hypothetical pure silica zeolites towards linear siloxanes through machine learning method finally they identified 230 zeolites possessed better adsorbed properties towards the target linear siloxanes lin et al 2020 however the real absorptive capacities of these adsorbents need further verification through experimental research before industrial application generally at the current stage information on the adsorption isotherms and mechanisms of vms on zeolites is insufficient or not easily available in literatures yet it is pretty important for understanding the adsorption processes in this research we choose four typical zeolites with different porous structures as adsorbents and use the static gravimetric method to study their adsorption properties towards hexamethyldisiloxane l2 which is a representative of vms in biogas gislon et al 2013 rasi et al 2014 the selection of these adsorbents is mainly based on the relationship between their pore sizes and the molecular size of l2 which is approximately 1 0 nanometer wang et al 2020 the adsorption heats and diffusion mechanisms are discussed based on their porous structures besides their recycling performances are studied these results are helpful to screen adsorbent with good vms adsorption performance and can provide important information to achieve a deeper understanding of the adsorption mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents and adsorbate four zeolites were used in this study including mordenite mor hbeta mcm 41 and sba 15 mor and hbeta was supplied by nankai university catalyst co ltd tianjin china before using the zeolites were calcined at 773 k for 2 h to remove water and other adsorbed substances with a heating rate of 5 k min mcm 41 and sba 15 were synthesized from the template method deng et al 2017 after synthesis they were placed in a desiccator and ready for use l2 with purity greater than 99 was used as adsorbate aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china 2 2 material characterization the crystal parameters and characteristics of the zeolites were obtained on a powder diffractometer x per pro mpd panalytical b v holland through the x ray diffraction xrd method the excitation source of x ray is cu kα and the wavelength is 0 154 nanometers before testing the samples were ground into powder and then spread on the slide the porous structures of zeolites were analyzed using the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms which were measured on a gas sorption analyzer micromeritics asap 2020 micromeritics instrument corporation usa wang et al 2020 their bet specific surface areas were calculated based on the bet theory using the adsorbed amounts of nitrogen within the relative pressure from 0 05 to 0 20 the total pore volumes were calculated from the adsorbed values when the relative pressures were about 0 99 and the micropore volumes were obtained based on the t plot method for the pore size distributions in order to facilitate the consistent comparison density functional theory dft calculation using the adsorption branch of the isotherm was adopted 2 3 static adsorption adsorption properties of l2 on zeolites were measured on an intelligent gravimetric analyzer iga 002 hiden analytical company the united kingdom iga device is effective and widely used to study the adsorption processes and mechanisms han et al 2020 lin et al 2006 the instrument can accurately control the temperature and pressure and record the weight changes of adsorbent during the whole adsorption process with time the accuracy of the instrument is 0 2 μg by adjusting the temperature adsorption isotherms at different temperatures can be obtained in this study l2 was used as adsorbate and its saturated vapor pressure is calculated from the antoine equation 1 log p 0 a b t c where p 0 is the saturated vapor pressure 0 1 mpa at a specific temperature t kelvin a b c are antoine constants in the temperature range studied they are 3 90199 1203 916 and 64 673 respectively flaningam 1986 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbents the xrd patterns of zeolites are depicted in fig s1 for mcm 41 three diffraction peaks in the range of 2 6 correspond to the 100 110 and 200 crystal planes respectively suggesting the formation of ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure sepehrian et al 2009 similarly sba 15 also has the typical two dimensional hexagonal structure do et al 2004 for mor and hbeta zeolites the characteristic peaks of their crystal structures were consistent with those in the literatures indicating the phase integrity of their skeleton structures the typical characteristic peaks of mor molecular sieves are mainly at 6 5 9 8 13 5 19 7 22 4 and 25 8 cai et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 while those of hbeta are mainly at 7 6 14 6 and 22 4 morais et al 2019 sujeerakulkai and jitkarnka 2016 fig 1 displays the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of various zeolites mor shows a typical i a isotherm indicating its intrinsic microporous property the adsorption isotherm of hbeta is similar to that of mor in the low and medium pressure stage but the adsorbed amount seems to grow infinitely at the higher relative pressure stage which may because of unlimited multi layer adsorption according to the recommendation of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac thommes et al 2015 for mcm 41 the adsorption capacity of nitrogen is higher at the low relative pressure stage because its microporous volume is higher than others with the rise of relative pressure the adsorption capacity increases due to capillary condensation similar to mcm 41 sba 15 also exhibits capillary condensation and shows type iv adsorption isotherm besides the larger type h1 hysteresis loop of sba 15 suggests that its pore size is wider than that of mcm 41 the specific surface areas and pore volumes of various zeolites are calculated by the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and listed in table 1 clearly mcm 41 has a higher specific surface area and sba 15 has a higher pore volume these values are relatively larger than other zeolites from references shown in table 1 the pore sizes follow the order of sba 15 mcm 41 hbeta mor in addition for mcm 41 considering it is a pure mesoporous adsorbent the micropore area and micropore volume are regarded as 0 and the total specific surface area is equal to the external specific surface area 3 2 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of l2 on zeolites at 298 k 308 k and 318 k are shown in fig 2 in general the saturated adsorption capacities of zeolites follow an order of sba 15 mcm 41 hbeta mor implying more l2 can be adsorbed by sba 15 and mcm 41 in practical application for all zeolites the adsorption capacity of l2 decreases partly with the increase of temperature these apparent changes suggest the adsorption process may be caused by the intrinsic physical adsorption meanwhile different zeolites also display unique properties for hbeta the adsorption of l2 vapor shows typical characteristics of unrestricted monolayer multilayer adsorption thommes et al 2015 however this seems unreasonable if we notice that the pore size of hbeta is only about 1 nanometer and this narrow pore would not support the formation of multilayer adsorption one possible reason might be the multilayer adsorption occurs in the three dimensional channels of hbeta which connecting the inside and outside surfaces thus no spatial constraints exist janda et al 2016 for sba 15 the adsorption isotherm is similar to that of nitrogen and represents the characteristics of type iv isotherm this is because the pore size is larger than the molecular size of l2 and capillary condensation effect occurs besides in the nitrogen adsorption desorption curves of sba 15 the relative pressure value that starts to form capillary condensation is about 0 7 where the adsorbed amount of nitrogen increases significantly while the corresponding value of l2 is about 0 43 2500 pa to 585 700 pa in fig 3 b 298 k the reason of this phenomenon may be that an adsorbate molecule with larger size is more likely to form capillary condensation in the interconnected channels unexpectedly for mcm 41 when the adsorbate changes from nitrogen to l2 the adsorption isotherms changed clearly from type iv to type i indicating monolayer adsorption occurs this is the first time that we have observed this kind of change caused by the replace of inorganic gas with an organic vapor we infer that it was because the molecular size of l2 is closer to the pore size of mcm 41 than nitrogen wang et al 2020 thus mcm 41 can be regarded as a conceptual microporous adsorbent for l2 for mor its adsorbed amount towards l2 decreases greatly with the increase of temperature besides the adsorbed amount is quite small compared with other adsorbents considering the pore size of mor is smaller than the molecular sizes of l2 it seems unable for l2 to enter the inner pores of mor thus the small amount of adsorption may be caused by the adsorption of l2 in some collapsed pores or on its outer surface a series of adsorption equations with different physical significances are used to fit the experimental adsorption data in this study as the zeolites have different structures and the isotherms show different shapes here we choose the widely used virial equation to fit the isotherms bell et al 2011 the expression is 2 in n p a 0 a 1 n a 2 n 2 a 3 n 3 where n is the adsorption capacity at pressure p pa a 0 is the first virial coefficient which is related to the henry s law constant k h k h exp a 0 the constant reflects the degree of the interaction force between the adsorbent and adsorbate molecules at the low relative pressures and is closely related with the spatial density of available adsorption sites bell et al 2011 jeong et al 2017 generally the larger the constant is the more available adsorption sites are the parameters and henry s law constants of l2 on zeolites fitted by virial equation are listed in table 2 clearly the henry s law constants follow the order of hbeta mcm 41 sba 15 mor these constants provide a reference for the preliminary screening of candidates for industrial application and hbeta mcm 41 and sba 15 show relatively better suitability considering their available adsorption sites for l2 adsorption are more than mor the magnitude of henry s law constants is closely related to the pore sizes of zeolites from fig 1 the pore size of hbeta is mainly about 1 0 nanometer this value is pretty close to the molecular diameter of l2 and finally shows a relatively strong adsorption force comparatively the pore size of mcm 41 is about 2 3 times of the molecular diameter of l2 thus their interaction decreases to a certain extent which is reflected in the decrease of henry s law constant from 3 21 10 4 to 6 88 10 5 at 298 k the constants of sba 15 are the same order of magnitude as mcm 41 because of their similar mesoporous property their constants are slightly higher than the values of organic vapors with smaller molecular sizes wang et al 2015b 2014 the pore size of mor is about 0 8 nanometer and smaller than the molecular size of l2 thus l2 cannot diffuse into the inner pores of mor to promote the effective adsorption with the increase of temperature the numbers of l2 molecules that can enter the pores continuously decrease and the finally adsorbed amount reduces 3 3 isosteric heat of adsorption the isosteric heat of adsorption is a commonly used index to evaluate the strength and distribution of adsorption energy between the adsorption sites and the adsorbate molecules jeong et al 2017 in this

17058,engineered nanoparticles are observed to be released into the environment and ended up in wastewater treatment plants it has been reported that these nanoparticles in sewage might have a toxic effect on microorganisms and thus affect anaerobic microbial fermentation however the mechanisms involved in nanoparticles induced effects on the anaerobic acidification process and its related bacterial metabolism are still unclear this work indicated that copper nanoparticles cu nps were able to cause cell membrane oxidative damage and inhibit the growth and metabolism of moorella thermoacetica a model acetogen the od600 and acetic acid production of m thermoacetica in the presence of 1 mg l of cu nps were decreased to 29 2 and 40 7 of the control respectively the key mechanism of the inhibitory effect was governed by the fact that cu nps significantly reduced the glucose consumption and led to the decreased pyruvate metabolism levels additionally cu nps inhibited the gene expressions and catalytic activities of the key enzymes related to acetic acid production it was identified that the relative activities of phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase of m thermoacetica in the presence of 1 mg l of cu nps decreased to only 70 1 69 3 50 1 and 65 2 of the control respectively these results demonstrated that the release of cu nps in the environment could pose risks to anaerobic fermentation processes via regulating microbial transcriptional response and enzyme activity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords copper nanoparticles acetic acid production moorella thermoacetica glycolysis enzyme activity transcriptional expression 1 introduction nanomaterials have attractive and unique physical chemical and biological properties relative to those of bulk materials grillo et al 2015 parada et al 2018 srivastava et al 2015 among all nanomaterials copper nanoparticles cu nps have garnered significant attention because of their low production cost the abundance of raw materials and attractive properties for example a composite made up of an agar film coated with cu nps demonstrated excellent efficiency for killing bacteria and has been applied as a wound dressing material in clinical medicine tang et al 2018 additionally copper based nanoparticles have been used for electrocatalysis photocatalysis and gas phase catalysis gawande et al 2016 with the increasing use of nanomaterials in various applications it has incited significant concern because these nanomaterials are eventually released into the atmospheric terrestrial and aquatic environments lehutso et al 2020 research conducted by mueller and nowack showed that about 75 of engineered nanomaterials ultimately entered sewage treatment plants and were accumulated in sludge mueller and nowack 2008 tou et al investigated samples from 193 wastewater treatment plants in 111 chinese cities and discovered that the concentration of cu in sludge samples was about 908 4 mg kg 1 making it the third most abundant metal contaminant in sludge tou et al 2017 meanwhile sludge contains many diverse microorganisms and organic substances which could be used to produce high value added organic acids during anaerobic fermentation luo et al 2021 thus it is necessary to focus on the potential impact of cu nps on anaerobic sludge fermentation especially for acid production previous literature had shown that cu nps potentially inhibited the activity of various microbial trophic groups involved in anaerobic fermentation processes for example gonzalez estrella et al tested 11 different types of inorganic nanoparticles and found that cu nps had the most toxic effect on methanogenesis and further that cu nps inhibited the activity of acetoclastic methanogens but not h2 utilizing methanogens gonzalez estrella et al 2013 similarly chen et al determined that the addition of cu nps into an anaerobic sludge fermentation reactor significantly reduced the yield of volatile fatty acids vfas because cu nps decrease the rate of hydrolysis and acid production by inhibiting the activity of relevant enzymes chen et al 2014 nevertheless since sludge fermentation involves plenty of microorganisms and different processes such as hydrolysis acidification and methanation it is challenging to investigate in depth of cu nps adsorbed in sludge on the acid production process moreover acetate is the dominant component of vfas which can be used as the carbon substrate for removing nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater kim et al 2016 besides to our best knowledge the specific investigation of cu nps on the anaerobic acidogenic behavior of acetogens and its mechanism was lacked which needs to be further studied the aim of this work is to investigate the influence of cu nps on the anaerobic fermentation metabolism of moorella thermoacetica a model acetogen and the underlying mechanisms

thermoacetica in the presence of different levels of cu nps was investigated finally in order to determine how the functional profiles such as key pathways and genes related to acetate production are influenced by cu nps the transcriptomics analysis was performed to further reveal the genetic mechanisms of the inhibited production of acetic acid by the presence of cu nps this study would give a

on the growth structure and acetate production of moorella thermoacetica experiments were conducted in anaerobic fermentation reactors with working volumes of 250 ml four cu np concentrations 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 mg l were selected to explore the potential toxicity of the nanoparticles toward m thermoacetica the no 221 medium was prepared as described above and 4 reactors were filled with 90 ml each nitrogen was bubbled through the solution for 30 min and then flowed above the liquid level for 1 2 min to maintain the anaerobic state before the reactors were placed into the autoclave after sterilizing at high temperature 120 c 20 min the four reactors were placed in the anaerobic glove compartment for ultraviolet sterilization 20 min and finally cooled to room temperature the 200 mg l stock suspension of cu nps was diluted by adding sterile water to concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l then saturated with nitrogen to obtain an anaerobic state followed by 30 min of ultrasonication based on the desired concentration of cu nps in each reactor 5 ml of a corresponding concentration of cu np suspension was added to the medium for each test sample and 5 ml of sterile water was added to the control reactor then m thermoacetica was inoculated such that the initial maximum optical density at 600 nm od600 of the medium was maintained at 0 01 finally all reactors were sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in an air batch shaker 160 rpm at 55 1 c after 120 hours of culture the acetic acid production was observed to be stable therefore in this study day 5 was selected as the end point of experiment the effects of cu nps on the growth and structure of the acetogen was obtained by measuring the od600 and lactate dehydrogenase ldh malondialdehyde mda and sem meanwhile the effects of cu nps on acetic acid production was determined by measuring the content of acetate glucose consumption dissolved cu ions glucose transport and the key acidified enzymes at the end of fermentation 5d the m thermoacetica was stored immediately at 80 for further gene transcriptomics analysis 2 3 analytical methods the od600 of m thermoacetica was determined using uv 1800

evaluate the damage of cell membrane the concentration of ldh and mda were measured by roche applied science kit and the thiobarbituric acid test respectively meanwhile the acetate concentrations were determined using a gas chromatograph gc agilent 7820 equipped with an innowax column and flame ionization detector the concentration of nadh was determined by applying the enzyme cycling method described by liu et al liu et al 2012 the content of dissolved cu ions was measured by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7500 usa glucose consumption was determined by measuring the glucose concentration in the supernatant collected from the reactors using anthrone colorimetry glucose transport was characterized by detecting the fluorescence intensity of 2 n 7

pyruvate kinase pk phosphotransacetylase pta and acetate kinase ak were determined according to methods described previously luo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 besides the rna sequencing rna seq technique

differential gene expression 2 4 statistical analysis all experiments and tests in this study were performed in triplicate analysis of variance was used to test the significance of the obtained results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cu nps on the anaerobic growth and structure of m thermoacetica microorganisms play an important role in anaerobic sludge fermentation but nanoparticles can react with or adsorb onto cell membranes of microorganisms thereby disrupting their metabolic activities zhang et al 2019 cu nps are particularly toxic to bacteria and affect their community richness alum et al 2018 the effect of different concentrations of cu nps on the growth of m thermoacetica is illustrated in figure 1 it is clear that the tests with different cu np concentrations showed no significant difference from the control after 24 hours which may be ascribed to the microorganisms were experiencing an adaptation period at the initial stage of the experiment after culturing for 24 hours the microorganisms commenced their logarithmic growth period following five days of culturing the od600 of the samples with 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu np concentrations decreased to 75 8 45 7 and 29 2 of the control with 0 mg l cu nps respectively figure 1a the fastest growth rate of any sample was observed as the control on the second to the third day and the fastest growth rate of the sample with 1 0 mg l cu nps was far below that of the control figure 1b increasing the cu nps concentrations caused the growth rate of m thermoacetica to be declined which further decreased the quantity of m thermoacetica present in those samples thus the presence of cu nps inhibits microbial activity at these test concentrations however ganesh et al reported that cu nps did not have significant short term inhibitory effects on the growth of either coliform bacteria or activated sludge microorganisms suggesting that pure m thermoacetica is relatively more sensitive to cu nps ganesh et al 2010 the surface morphology of cells in the control and the sample with 1 0 mg l cu nps are shown in figure 2 a and 2b respectively the cell surfaces of m thermoacetica in the control 0 mg l cu nps were smooth and complete whereas the cells exposed to 1 0 mg l cu nps exhibited significant membrane damage and the surface of some cells was attached to cu nps the damaged membranes allow the release of ldh sharan and nara 2020 and the tests with 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu nps released 1 36 1 8 and 2 35 times the amount of ldh as the cells in the control 0 mg l cu nps respectively figure 2c p 0 05 increasing cu np concentration would exacerbate cell membrane damage which further caused damage to the cellular structure zhang et al reported that cu nps destroyed the cell membrane integrity of anammox microorganisms and induced the ldh release zhang et al 2017 similarly miao et al studied the response of wastewater biofilm to the cuo np exposure and found that 1 and 10 mg l concentrations of cuo nps did not significantly influence the ldh release however the exposure to 50 mg l of cuo nps significantly increased the ldh release miao et al 2016 besides malondialdehyde mda is one of the end products of polyunsaturated fatty acids peroxidation in cells and thus is widely used as a lipid peroxidation marker of oxidative stress chacana et al 2017 this study revealed that the mda content in tests with 0 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l cu nps were 116 9 and 129 2 of the mda content in the control figure 2d respectively which demonstrates that the presence of 0 5 and 1 mg l cu np concentrations caused a certain extent of lipid peroxidation of m thermoacetica moreover the correlation analysis of mda and ldh showed that with the increase of mda concentration the release of ldh was correspondingly improved figure s2 supplementary materials 3 2 effects of cu nps on the anaerobic acetic acid production of m thermoacetica it was previously known that cu nps could effectively inhibit anaerobic fermentation but gonzalez estrella et al found that cu nps also completely inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity gonzalez estrella et al 2013 otero gonzalez et al similarly concluded that extended exposure to cuo nps caused severe toxicity and reduced acetoclastic methanogenic activity by more than 85 otero gonzalez et al 2014 however few reports had investigated the specific effect of cu nps on anaerobic fermentation thus this study explored the impact of cu nps on the acetic acid production as shown in figure 3 a p 0 05 the acetic acid production of the control was quite similar to the samples including cu nps in the first 24 hours because microorganisms are still in the adaptive stage after the first day the different responses became clear and continued to become more pronounced over time the acetic acid production in the samples containing cu nps was much lower than that of the control by the fifth day the yield of acetic acid in the control was 1152 39 mg cod l while the acetic acid production in the samples exposed to 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu nps were 1018 64 578 87 and 468 66 mg cod l respectively these correspond to 88 4 50 2 and 40 7 respectively of the production observed in the control figure 1a confirmed that the presence of cu nps could decrease the cell number of m thermoacetica the less cell number might be one reason for the reduction of acetic acid production chen et al reported that 50 mg l cu nps caused the maximal vfa production from sludge decreasing 46 1 from 223 5 to 120 5 mg cod g vss chen et al 2014 comparing the results in this study with those presented by chen et al the pure microorganisms were more sensitive to cu nps the acetic acid production rate in all tests first increased and then decreased the higher cu np concentrations led the acetic acid production rate to become ultimately slower the nadh is an important carrier involved in energy production and electron transfer in microbial cells as the main reductive coenzyme in cells nadh plays an important role in regulating cellular redox states based on the data presented in figure 3b p 0 05 the nadh content in tests with 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu nps were 72 2 59 9 and 45 9 of the nadh content in the control the nadh content decreased significantly with increasing the cu np concentrations which had an adverse effect on balancing the extracellular reductive state and causing damage to the bacterial cells additionally the inadequate nadh content further led to the insufficient electron donation for subsequent acetic acid production thus affecting the acetic acid production of m thermoacetica during fermentation several studies had reported that the toxicity of metal nanoparticles is caused by the release of soluble metal ions su et al 2016 however gonzalez estrella et al found that cu nps completely inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity which was a result of corrosion and dissolution of the nanoparticles gonzalez estrella et al 2013 otero gonzalez et al also reported that the cu ion concentrations were low 0 02 0 40 mg l and represented less than 0 75 of the total cu in all tests otero gonzalez et al 2014 in this study the concentrations of cu ions in the test medium containing 0 5 and 1 mg l cu nps were measured and the results discovered that the dissolution of cu nps is only 1 2 below 0 009 mg l and 0 02 mg l cu ions respectively in the medium of 0 5 and 1 mg l cu np tests shown in figure s3 supplementary materials moreover the effects of the dissolved cu ions on the acetic acid production 0 01 and 0 02 mg l corresponding to the released cu ions during anaerobic fermentation were explored it was found that such low concentrations of cu ions had no impacts on anaerobic fermentation metabolism and acetic acid production of m thermoacetica figure s4 supplementary materials however it is clear that the presence of cu nps does affect the activity of the studied acetogen by inhibiting the acetate production therefore the possible inhibition mechanisms were also explored in this study 3 3 effects of cu nps on the glucose transport and intracellular metabolism of m thermoacetica acetate production during anaerobic fermentation involves hydrolytic fermentation syntrophic acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis syntrophic acetogens cannot complete most of these reactions spontaneously the homoacetogenesis is only observed under psychrophilic conditions in the unfavorable environments jin et al 2013 m thermoacetica can utilize co2 as a carbon source to produce acetate via the wood ljungdahl pathway and can also use glucose as a carbon source to produce acetate through glycolysis and or pyruvate metabolism charubin and papoutsakis 2018 huang et al 2012 in this study glucose was used as a model substrate to investigate the effect of cu nps on the acidification of anaerobic fermentation glucose consumption and utilization occur in two stages namely transmembrane transport and intracellular metabolism as shown in figure 4 a in the presence of 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu nps the glucose concentrations at day 1 were reduced only 0 34 0 28 0 24 and 0 16 g l respectively it can be found from figure 1a that the microbial population and growth was at a relatively low level at day 1 because the microorganisms were in the lag phase these results indicated that the lower biomass led to the less glucose consumption at the initial stage glucose consumption increased i e glucose concentration in the samples decreased with the growth of microorganism concentrations longer culturing times therefore as expected glucose consumption decreased in the presence of higher cu np concentrations after five days the glucose consumption in the control was 70 3 but in the presence of 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l of cu nps the consumption decreased to 59 1 39 0 and 28 4 respectively similarly mohanraj et al found that when the cu np concentration increased from 2 5 to 12 5 mg l the glucose utilization efficiency of e cloacae decreased significantly from 97 to 37 sunderasan et al 2016 gonzalez estrella et al found that cu nps greatly inhibited glucose consumption at concentrations as low as 0 040 mm gonzalez estrella et al 2015 these findings support the observation that the presence of cu nps notably reduced the glucose utilization in the fermentative process of m thermoacetica transmembrane transport is the rate limiting step governing intracellular glucose concentration however after incubation with 2 nbdg there was no significant difference between the measured intracellular fluorescence of the control versus the samples containing cu nps figure s5 supplementary materials the analysis of transcriptome data revealed that no significant up regulation or down regulation of genes related to abc transporters or glucose transporters was observed this was consistent with the results presented above indicating that the exposure to cu nps did not inhibit the glucose transmembrane transport process the process of intracellular glucose metabolism i e conversion of glucose to pyruvate is illustrated in figure 4c which further highlights the enzymes involved the gene expression relevant for glycolysis was explored to determine the effect of cu nps on glucose metabolism compared with the control most genes related to the key enzymes active during glycolysis were down regulated in test samples containing cu nps in the test with 1 0 mg l cu nps the relative gene expression of phosphoglucose isomerase pgi triosephosphate isomerase tpia and pyruvate kinase pyk were 98 1 55 0 and 70 0 of the control respectively the inhibitory effect of cu nps at this concentration was even higher considering the relative gene expression of phosphoglycerate kinase pgk phosphoglycerate mutase gpma and enolase eno which were 49 2 48 5 and 48 2 of the control respectively figure 4b p 0 05 intracellular glucose metabolism can generate nadh through the series of reactions shown in figure 4c so decreased glucose consumption may lower the nadh content although cu nps did not affect glucose transport these nanoparticles inhibited glucose consumption and glycolysis which reduced the pyruvate levels and ultimately affected the acetic acid production 3 4 effects of cu nps on the key enzymes related to acetate production of m thermoacetica cellular metabolic processes depend on biochemical reactions that are carried out by various enzymes the expression and activity of the enzymes are closely related to the biochemical reaction rates andersch et al 1983 according to the metabolic pathways involved in the acid production during substrate fermentation i hk pfk and pk convert glucose into pyruvate ii pta converts acetyl coa to acetyl phosphate and iii ak transforms acetyl phosphate to acetic acid this study examined the gene expressions and catalytic activities of all of these enzymes in the context of how cu nps impact the acetic acid production by m thermoacetica the effect of cu nps on the enzyme expression was analyzed at the transcriptional level as shown in figure 5 a p 0 05 most genes involved in the compiling enzymes were down regulated in experimental tests relative to the control the expressions of enzymes responsible for glycolysis and acidification all declined especially the expression of ak when exposed to 1 0 mg l cu nps the expression of ak was 44 4 of the control and the expressions of pfk pk and pta were 73 4 70 0 and 57 1 of the control respectively cu nps inhibited the acidification reactions by affecting the expressions of the key enzymes previous studies showed that cu nps impacted metal resistance gene mrg expression in the anammox process zhang et al 2019 and functional gene expression for ammonium oxidation amoa and nitrite reduction nirk reyes et al 2014 those studies reported that cu2 played an important role in affecting the transcription of genes involved in signaling routes the changes in enzyme activities depend on the enzyme expression figure 5b the activity of hk in the sample containing 1 0 mg l cu nps was not significantly different from that of the control which means that cu nps did not inhibit hk activity however the activities of pfk pk pta and ak in all samples containing cu nps were lower than their activities observed in the control specifically when exposed to 1 0 mg l cu nps the activities of pfk pk pta and ak were 70 1 69 3 50 1 and 65 2 of the control respectively among these enzymes the activity of pta is most affected chen et al also reported that cu nps inhibited the activity of enzymes involved in hydrolysis and acidification upon exposure to cu nps they found that α glucosidase pta and ak activities decreased to 64 50 and 60 respectively chen et al 2014 similarly su found that the activity of ak was inhibited by 22 9 in the presence of 150 mg g tss zno nps su et al 2016 suggesting that cu nps have a more significant inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity than zno nps cu nps inhibited the enzyme activities because they are metallic nanomaterials that can bind to proteins enzymes to form a corona and reduce the catalytic activity of enzymes the results presented herein showed that the gene expressions and catalytic activities of pfk pk pta and ak were inhibited in the presence of cu nps therefore the cu nps further hindered glycolysis and acidification processes and ultimately decreased the acetic acid production in summary the mechanisms of inhibition to the metabolism of m thermoacetica by cu nps could be described as figure 6 m thermoacetica could use glucose as the substrate to produce acetic acid through the transmembrane transport and intracellular metabolism however the presence of cu nps inhibited the growth of m thermoacetica and damaged its cell membrane which could suppress the microbial activity meanwhile cu nps significantly down regulated the gene expression and catalytic activities of key enzymes involved in acetic acid production glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism and thereby decreasing the acetic acid production of m thermoacetica these results explained the inhibited effects of cu nps on anaerobic acetic acid production in terms of functional traits at the genetic level 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that cu nps inhibited the anaerobic growth of m thermoacetica and damaged their cell membranes the severity of this effect increased with elevating concentrations of cu nps the exposure to cu nps also affected the anaerobic production of acetic acid by m thermoacetica the inhibitory effect of the key mechanism was governed by the fact that cu nps down regulate the gene expressions related to glycolysis which could reduce glucose consumption the lower glucose consumption further led to decrease pyruvate levels and subsequently suppressed acetic acid production additionally cu nps affected the expressions and catalytic activities of key enzymes related to acetic acid production in the presence of 1 0 mg l of cu nps the relative activities of pfk pk pta and ak enzymes decreased to only 70 1 69 3 50 1 and 65 2 of the control respectively overall the results indicated that cu nps could present a cause for concern regarding sludge anaerobic fermentation if they become concentrated in the activated sludge environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have influenced the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national science foundation of china 51778450 the shanghai rising

17058,engineered nanoparticles are observed to be released into the environment and ended up in wastewater treatment plants it has been reported that these nanoparticles in sewage might have a toxic effect on microorganisms and thus affect anaerobic microbial fermentation however the mechanisms involved in nanoparticles induced effects on the anaerobic acidification process and its related bacterial metabolism are still unclear this work indicated that copper nanoparticles cu nps were able to cause cell membrane oxidative damage and inhibit the growth and metabolism of moorella thermoacetica a model acetogen the od600 and acetic acid production of m thermoacetica in the presence of 1 mg l of cu nps were decreased to 29 2 and 40 7 of the control respectively the key mechanism of the inhibitory effect was governed by the fact that cu nps significantly reduced the glucose consumption and led to the decreased pyruvate metabolism levels additionally cu nps inhibited the gene expressions and catalytic activities of the key enzymes related to acetic acid production it was identified that the relative activities of phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase of m thermoacetica in the presence of 1 mg l of cu nps decreased to only 70 1 69 3 50 1 and 65 2 of the control respectively these results demonstrated that the release of cu nps in the environment could pose risks to anaerobic fermentation processes via regulating microbial transcriptional response and enzyme activity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords copper

biological properties relative to those of bulk materials grillo et al 2015 parada et al 2018 srivastava et al 2015 among all nanomaterials copper nanoparticles cu nps have garnered significant attention because of their low production cost the abundance of raw materials and attractive properties for example a composite made up of an agar film coated with cu nps demonstrated excellent efficiency for killing bacteria and has been applied as a wound dressing material in clinical medicine tang et al 2018 additionally copper based nanoparticles have been used for electrocatalysis photocatalysis and gas phase catalysis gawande et al 2016 with the increasing use of nanomaterials in various applications it has incited significant concern because these nanomaterials are eventually released into the atmospheric terrestrial and aquatic environments lehutso et al 2020 research conducted by mueller and nowack showed that about 75 of engineered nanomaterials ultimately entered sewage treatment plants and were accumulated in sludge mueller and nowack 2008 tou et al investigated samples from 193 wastewater treatment plants in 111 chinese cities and discovered that the concentration of cu in sludge samples was about 908 4 mg kg 1 making it the third most abundant metal contaminant in sludge tou et al 2017 meanwhile sludge contains many diverse microorganisms and organic substances which could be used to produce high value added organic acids during anaerobic fermentation luo et al 2021 thus it is necessary to focus on the potential impact of cu nps on anaerobic sludge fermentation especially for acid production previous literature had shown that cu nps potentially inhibited the activity of various microbial trophic groups involved in anaerobic fermentation processes for example gonzalez estrella et al tested 11 different types of inorganic nanoparticles and found that cu nps had the most toxic effect on methanogenesis and further that cu nps inhibited the activity of acetoclastic methanogens but not h2 utilizing methanogens gonzalez estrella et al 2013 similarly chen et al determined that the addition of cu nps into an anaerobic sludge fermentation reactor significantly reduced the yield of volatile fatty acids vfas because cu nps decrease the rate of hydrolysis and acid production by inhibiting the activity of relevant enzymes chen et al 2014 nevertheless since sludge fermentation involves plenty of microorganisms and different processes such as hydrolysis acidification and methanation it is challenging to

differential gene expression 2 4 statistical analysis all experiments and tests in this study were performed in triplicate analysis of variance was used to test the significance of the obtained results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cu nps on the anaerobic growth and structure of m thermoacetica microorganisms play an important role in anaerobic sludge fermentation but nanoparticles can react with or adsorb onto cell membranes of microorganisms thereby disrupting their metabolic activities zhang et al 2019 cu nps are particularly toxic to bacteria and affect their community richness alum et al 2018 the effect of different concentrations of cu nps on the growth of m thermoacetica is illustrated in figure 1 it is clear that the tests with different cu np concentrations showed no significant difference from the control after 24 hours which may be ascribed to the microorganisms were experiencing an adaptation period at the initial stage of the experiment after culturing for 24 hours the microorganisms commenced their logarithmic growth period following five days of culturing the od600 of the samples with 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu np concentrations decreased to 75 8 45 7 and 29 2 of the control with 0 mg l cu nps respectively figure 1a the fastest growth rate of any sample was observed as the control on the second to the third day and the fastest growth rate of the sample with 1 0 mg l cu nps was far below that of the control figure 1b increasing the cu nps concentrations caused the growth rate of m thermoacetica to be declined which further decreased the quantity of m thermoacetica present in those samples thus the presence of cu nps inhibits microbial activity at these test concentrations however ganesh et al reported that cu nps did not have significant short term inhibitory effects on the growth of either coliform bacteria or activated sludge microorganisms suggesting that pure m thermoacetica is relatively more sensitive to cu nps ganesh et al 2010 the surface morphology of cells in the control and the sample with 1 0 mg l cu nps are shown in figure 2 a and 2b respectively the cell surfaces of m thermoacetica in the control 0 mg l cu nps were smooth and complete whereas the cells exposed to 1 0 mg l cu nps exhibited significant membrane damage and the surface of some cells was attached to cu nps the damaged membranes allow the release of ldh sharan and nara 2020 and the tests with 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu nps released 1 36 1 8 and 2 35 times the amount of ldh as the cells in the control 0 mg l cu nps respectively figure 2c p 0 05 increasing cu np concentration would exacerbate cell membrane damage which further caused damage to the cellular structure zhang et al reported that cu nps destroyed the cell membrane integrity of anammox microorganisms and induced the ldh release zhang et al 2017 similarly miao et al studied the response of wastewater biofilm to the cuo np exposure and found that 1 and 10 mg l concentrations of cuo nps did not significantly influence the ldh release however the exposure to 50 mg l of cuo nps significantly increased the ldh release miao et al 2016 besides malondialdehyde mda is one of the end products of polyunsaturated fatty acids peroxidation in cells and thus is widely used as a lipid peroxidation marker of oxidative stress chacana et al 2017 this study revealed that the mda content in tests with 0 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l cu nps were 116 9 and 129 2 of the mda content in the control figure 2d respectively which demonstrates that the presence of 0 5 and 1 mg l cu np concentrations caused a certain extent of lipid peroxidation of m thermoacetica moreover the correlation analysis of mda and ldh showed that with the increase of mda concentration the release of ldh was correspondingly improved figure s2 supplementary materials 3 2 effects of cu nps on the anaerobic acetic acid production of m thermoacetica it was previously known that cu nps could effectively inhibit anaerobic fermentation but gonzalez estrella et al found that cu nps also completely inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity gonzalez estrella et al 2013 otero gonzalez et al similarly concluded that extended exposure to cuo nps caused severe toxicity and reduced acetoclastic methanogenic activity by more than 85 otero gonzalez et al 2014 however few reports had investigated the specific effect of cu nps on anaerobic fermentation thus this study explored the impact of cu nps on the acetic acid production as shown in figure 3 a p 0 05 the acetic acid production of the control was quite similar to the samples including cu nps in the first 24 hours because microorganisms are still in the adaptive stage after the first day the different responses became clear and continued to become more pronounced over time the acetic acid production in the samples containing cu nps was much lower than that of the control by the fifth day the yield of acetic acid in the control was 1152 39 mg cod l while the acetic acid production in the samples exposed to 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu nps were 1018 64 578 87 and 468 66 mg cod l respectively these correspond to 88 4 50 2 and 40 7 respectively of the production observed in the control figure 1a confirmed that the presence of cu nps could decrease the cell number of m thermoacetica the less cell number might be one reason for the reduction of acetic acid production chen et al reported that 50 mg l cu nps caused the maximal vfa production from sludge decreasing 46 1 from 223 5 to 120 5 mg cod g vss chen et al 2014 comparing the results in this study with those presented by chen et al the pure microorganisms were more sensitive to cu nps the acetic acid production rate in all tests first increased and then decreased the higher cu np concentrations led the acetic acid production rate to become ultimately slower the nadh is an important carrier involved in energy production and electron transfer in microbial cells as the main reductive coenzyme in cells nadh plays an important role in regulating cellular redox states based on the data presented in figure 3b p 0 05 the nadh content in tests with 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu nps were 72 2 59 9 and 45 9 of the nadh content in the control the nadh content decreased significantly with increasing the cu np concentrations which had an adverse effect on balancing the extracellular reductive state and causing damage to the bacterial cells additionally the inadequate nadh content further led to the insufficient electron donation for subsequent acetic acid production thus affecting the acetic acid production of m thermoacetica during fermentation several studies had reported that the toxicity of metal nanoparticles is caused by the release of soluble metal ions su et al 2016 however gonzalez estrella et al found that cu nps completely inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity which was a result of corrosion and dissolution of the nanoparticles gonzalez estrella et al 2013 otero gonzalez et al also reported that the cu ion concentrations were low 0 02 0 40 mg l and represented less than 0 75 of the total cu in all tests otero gonzalez et al 2014 in this study the concentrations of cu ions in the test medium containing 0 5 and 1 mg l cu nps were measured and the results discovered that the dissolution of cu nps is only 1 2 below 0 009 mg l and 0 02 mg l cu ions respectively in the medium of 0 5 and 1 mg l cu np tests shown in figure s3 supplementary materials moreover the effects of the dissolved cu ions on the acetic acid production 0 01 and 0 02 mg l corresponding to the released cu ions during anaerobic fermentation were explored it was found that such low concentrations of cu ions had no impacts on anaerobic fermentation metabolism and acetic acid production of m thermoacetica figure s4 supplementary materials however it is clear that the presence of cu nps does affect the activity of the studied acetogen by inhibiting the acetate production therefore the possible inhibition mechanisms were also explored in this study 3 3 effects of cu nps on the glucose transport and intracellular metabolism of m thermoacetica acetate production during anaerobic fermentation involves hydrolytic fermentation syntrophic acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis syntrophic acetogens cannot complete most of these reactions spontaneously the homoacetogenesis is only observed under psychrophilic conditions in the unfavorable environments jin et al 2013 m thermoacetica can utilize co2 as a carbon source to produce acetate via the wood ljungdahl pathway and can also use glucose as a carbon source to produce acetate through glycolysis and or pyruvate metabolism charubin and papoutsakis 2018 huang et al 2012 in this study glucose was used as a model substrate to investigate the effect of cu nps on the acidification of anaerobic fermentation glucose consumption and utilization occur in two stages namely transmembrane transport and intracellular metabolism as shown in figure 4 a in the presence of 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l cu nps the glucose concentrations at day 1 were reduced only 0 34 0 28 0 24 and 0 16 g l respectively it can be found from figure 1a that the microbial population and growth was at a relatively low level at day 1 because the microorganisms were in the lag phase these results indicated that the lower biomass led to the less glucose consumption at the initial stage glucose consumption increased i e glucose concentration in the samples decreased with the growth of microorganism concentrations longer culturing times therefore as expected glucose consumption decreased in the presence of higher cu np concentrations after five days the glucose consumption in the control was 70 3 but in the presence of 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 mg l of cu nps the consumption decreased to 59 1 39 0 and 28 4 respectively similarly mohanraj et al found that when the cu np concentration increased from 2 5 to 12 5 mg l the glucose utilization efficiency of e cloacae decreased significantly from 97 to 37 sunderasan et al 2016 gonzalez estrella et al found that cu nps greatly inhibited glucose consumption at concentrations as low as 0 040 mm gonzalez estrella et al 2015 these findings support the observation that the presence of cu nps notably reduced the glucose utilization in the fermentative process of m thermoacetica transmembrane transport is the rate limiting step governing intracellular glucose concentration however after incubation with 2 nbdg there was no significant difference between the measured intracellular fluorescence of the control versus the samples containing cu nps figure s5 supplementary materials the analysis of transcriptome data revealed that no significant up regulation or down regulation of genes related to abc transporters or glucose transporters was observed this was consistent with the results presented above indicating that the exposure to cu nps did not inhibit the glucose transmembrane transport process the process of intracellular glucose metabolism i e conversion of glucose to pyruvate is illustrated in figure 4c which further highlights the enzymes involved the gene expression relevant for glycolysis was explored to determine the effect of cu nps on glucose metabolism compared with the control most genes related to the key enzymes active during glycolysis were down regulated in test samples containing cu nps in the test with 1 0 mg l cu nps the relative gene expression of phosphoglucose isomerase pgi triosephosphate isomerase tpia and pyruvate kinase pyk were 98 1 55 0 and 70 0 of the control respectively the inhibitory effect of cu nps at this concentration was even higher considering the relative gene expression of phosphoglycerate kinase pgk phosphoglycerate mutase gpma and enolase eno which were 49 2 48 5 and 48 2 of the control respectively figure 4b p 0 05 intracellular glucose metabolism can generate nadh through the series of reactions shown in figure 4c so decreased glucose consumption may lower the nadh content although cu nps did not affect glucose transport these nanoparticles inhibited glucose consumption and glycolysis which reduced the pyruvate levels and ultimately affected the acetic acid production 3 4 effects of cu nps on the key enzymes related to acetate production of m thermoacetica cellular metabolic processes depend on biochemical reactions that are carried out by various enzymes the expression and activity of the enzymes are closely related to the biochemical reaction rates andersch et al 1983 according to the metabolic pathways involved in the acid production during substrate fermentation i hk pfk and pk convert glucose into pyruvate ii pta converts acetyl coa to acetyl phosphate and iii ak transforms acetyl phosphate to acetic acid this study examined the gene expressions and catalytic activities of all of these enzymes in the context of how cu nps impact the acetic acid production by m thermoacetica the effect of cu nps on the enzyme expression was analyzed at the transcriptional level as shown in figure 5 a p 0 05 most genes involved in the compiling enzymes were down regulated in experimental tests relative to the control the expressions of enzymes responsible for glycolysis and acidification all declined especially the expression of ak when exposed to 1 0 mg l cu nps the expression of ak was 44 4 of the control and the expressions of pfk pk and pta were 73 4 70 0 and 57 1 of the control respectively cu nps inhibited the acidification reactions by affecting the expressions of the key enzymes previous studies showed that cu nps impacted metal resistance gene mrg expression in the anammox process zhang et al 2019 and functional gene expression for ammonium oxidation amoa and nitrite reduction nirk reyes et al 2014 those studies reported that cu2 played an important role in affecting the transcription of genes involved in signaling routes the changes in enzyme activities depend on the enzyme expression figure 5b the activity of hk in the sample containing 1 0 mg l cu nps was not significantly different from that of the control which means that cu nps did not inhibit hk activity however the activities of pfk pk pta and ak in all samples containing cu nps were lower than their activities observed in the control specifically when exposed to 1 0 mg l cu nps the activities of pfk pk pta and ak were 70 1 69 3 50 1 and 65 2 of the control respectively among these enzymes the activity of pta is most affected chen et al also reported that cu nps inhibited the activity of enzymes involved in hydrolysis and acidification upon exposure to cu nps they found that α glucosidase pta and ak activities decreased to 64 50 and 60 respectively chen et al 2014 similarly su found that the activity of ak was inhibited by 22 9 in the presence of 150 mg g tss zno nps su et al 2016 suggesting that cu nps have a more significant inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity than zno nps cu nps inhibited the enzyme activities because they are metallic nanomaterials that can bind to proteins enzymes to form a corona and reduce the catalytic activity of enzymes the results presented herein showed that the gene expressions and catalytic activities of pfk pk pta and ak were inhibited in the presence of cu nps therefore the cu nps further hindered glycolysis and acidification processes and ultimately decreased the acetic acid production in summary the mechanisms of inhibition to the metabolism of m thermoacetica by cu nps could be described as figure 6 m thermoacetica could use glucose as the substrate to produce acetic acid through the transmembrane transport and intracellular metabolism however the presence of cu nps inhibited the growth of m thermoacetica and damaged its cell membrane which could suppress the microbial activity meanwhile cu nps significantly down regulated the gene expression and catalytic activities of key enzymes involved in acetic acid production glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism and thereby decreasing the acetic acid production of m thermoacetica these results explained the inhibited effects of cu nps on anaerobic acetic acid production in terms of functional traits at the genetic level 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that cu nps inhibited the anaerobic growth of m thermoacetica and damaged their cell membranes the severity of this effect increased with elevating concentrations of cu nps the exposure to cu nps also affected the anaerobic production of acetic acid by m thermoacetica the inhibitory effect of the key mechanism was governed by the fact that cu nps down regulate the gene expressions related to glycolysis which could reduce glucose consumption the lower glucose consumption further led to decrease pyruvate levels and subsequently suppressed acetic acid production additionally cu nps affected the expressions and catalytic activities of key enzymes related to acetic acid production in the presence of 1 0 mg l of cu nps the relative activities of pfk pk pta and ak enzymes decreased to only 70 1 69 3 50 1 and 65 2 of the control respectively overall the results indicated that cu nps could present a cause for concern regarding sludge anaerobic fermentation if they become concentrated in the activated sludge environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17059,being an energetic fuel methane is able to support microbial growth and drive the reduction of various electron acceptors these acceptors include a broad range of oxidized contaminants e g nitrate nitrite perchlorate bromate selenate chromate antimonate and vanadate that are ubiquitously detected in water environments and pose threats to human and ecological health using methane as electron donor to biologically reduce these contaminants into nontoxic forms is a promising solution to remediate polluted water considering that methane is a widely available and inexpensive electron donor the understanding of methane based biological reduction processes and the responsible microorganisms has grown in the past decade this review summarizes the fundamentals of metabolic pathways and microorganisms mediating microbial methane oxidation experimental demonstrations of methane as an electron donor to remove oxidized contaminants are summarized compared and evaluated finally the review identifies opportunities and unsolved questions that deserve future explorations for broadening understanding of methane oxidation and promoting its practical applications keywords aerobic methane oxidation anaerobic methane oxidation nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo oxidized contaminants membrane biofilm reactor mbfr 1 introduction methane ch4 exists widely in natural and engineered ecosystems including paddy soils and wetland sediments in nature ruff et al 2016 vaksmaa et al 2016 and anaerobic digestors in wastewater treatment plants wwtps maaz et al 2019 young et al 2013 methane is a potent greenhouse gas having a global warming potential 28 times that of co2 ipcc 2019 for example ch4 emissions can be a larger contributor than co2 and n2o emissions in some wwtps daelman et al 2012 conversely ch4 is an excellent source of energy for heating and generating electrical power due to its high enthalpy of combustion i e 55 7 kj g schmidt rohr 2015 methane as a carbon source and electron donor also can support microbial respiratory metabolisms that bring about the reduction of diverse electron acceptors in addition to oxygen o2 a series of oxyanions can be respired by bacteria that oxidize ch4 consisting of nitrate no3 nitrite no2 perchlorate clo4 bromate bro3 selenate seo4 2 chromate cro4 2 antimonate sb oh 6 and vanadate h2vo4 the thermodynamics of potential energy yielding reactions for ch4 and the oxyanions are summarized in table 1 these oxyanions are also water contaminants and have been widely detected in various water environments schwarzenbach et al 2010 tan et al 2016 the majority of these oxyanions can cause acute or chronic toxicity to human beings and they have negative effects on ecological health coates and achenbach 2004 costa and klein 2006 nancharaiah and lens 2015 oremland and stolz 2003 sundar and chakravarty 2010 for example excess uptake of selenate would lead to skin discoloration nervous disorders and even death boyd 2011 generally the solubility toxicity and mobility of the oxyanions decline remarkably when being reduced because the reduced products are susceptible to the precipitation adsorption or volatilization thus biological reduction of oxyanions is one of promising solutions to detoxify them from both municipal and industrial contaminated wastewater compared to other organic electron donors that could be used to reduce the oxyanions ch4 has several advantages e g widely available and relatively less expensive meulepas et al 2010 however two major barriers may have limited the use of ch4 as a microbiological electron donor first ch4 is a gas with a low solubility in water which will restrict microbial reaction activities second it is difficult to enrich microorganisms that can utilize methane as the electron donor to reduce various contaminants in particular in anaerobic conditions based on recent progress in environmental microbiology and environmental biotechnology recent findings have not only advanced our understandings of methane cycling microorganisms and their metabolic pathways but also provided technology opportunities for applying methane based processes this review summarizes the currently known microorganisms and corresponding metabolic pathways for the biological ch4 oxidation processes which are well studied moreover the technologies for applying methane to remove pollutants are compared and evaluated based on recent experimental demonstrations especially for the reactions of which mechanisms lack solid evidences finally we present opportunities and challenges for using methane to remove oxidized contaminants 2 metabolic pathways and microorganisms mediating biological methane oxidation 2 1 aerobic methane oxidation 2 1 1 aerobic methanotrophs aerobic oxidation of methane is carried out by aerobic methanotrophs a subset of methylotrophs so far all microorganisms performing aerobic methane oxidation belong to the bacteria domain according to cell morphology ultrastructure phylogeny and carbon assimilation pathway aerobic methanotrophs are classified into three groups type i γ proteobacteria type ii α proteobacteria and type iii verrucomicrobia knief 2015 strong et al 2015 in terms of cell morphology and ultrastructure bundles of intra cytoplasmic membranes are arranged as vesicular discs in type i methanotrophs while type ii generally has intra cytoplasmic membranes aligned to the periphery of cells murrell 2010 carbon assimilation is also different among types i ii and iii type i methanotrophs use the ribulose monophosphate pathway as their primary route to assimilate carbon into cellular materials type ii utilize the serine pathway and type iii employ the calvin bensen bashsham pathway meraz et al 2020 murrell 2010 in terms of the environmental distribution of aerobic methanotrophs they appear to be ubiquitous in environments where methane and oxygen can be detected in freshwaters and sediments type i methanotrophs including methylomonas methylobacter methylosarcina methylococcus and methylosoma were predominant it was estimated that in lake washington sediments type i methanotrophs are 10 to 100 fold more abundant than type ii costello et al 2002 however methylocystis which belongs to the type ii methanotroph was ubiquitously distributed in forest and upland soil environments baani and liesack 2008 in addition methanotrophs were also found in extreme environments ranging from 0 70 c and ph 1 5 12 e g hot spring and volcanic mud trotsenko and khmelenina 2002 the widespread distribution of aerobic methanotrophs suggests that they play a significant role in mitigating methane emissions for example approximately 20 of the methane produced in rice fields is oxidized in situ by aerobic methanotrophs therefore preventing large amounts of methane reaching the atmosphere conrad 2009 2 1 2 enzymes and pathways involved in aerobic methane oxidation during the obligately aerobic methane oxidation methanotrophic bacteria respire o2 as their electron acceptor a summary of the mechanisms involved in aerobic methane oxidation is illustrated in fig 1 aerobic methanotrophs possess a key methane monooxygenase mmo that inserts one oxygen atom from o2 into a c h bond of methane to form methanol ch3oh and h2o as the initial step of methane oxidation methane monooxygenase has two distinct forms particulate and soluble the particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo encoded by most methanotrophs is a membrane bound enzyme that requires copper at the active site balasubramanian et al 2010 ross et al 2019 it contains three polypeptides a 45 kda α subunit pmob a 26 kda β subunit pmoa and a 23 kda γ subunit pmoc that together assemble into an αβγ 3 homotrimer lieberman and rosenzweig 2005 the pmob subunit is composed of periplasmic and transmembrane regions while the pmoa and pmoc subunits contain primarily transmembrane helices the soluble methane monooxygenase smmo is found in fewer methanotrophs and uses iron for its catalytic activity rosenzweig et al 1993 it includes three components a 251 kda hydroxylase mmoh a 38 kda reductase mmor and a 16 kda regulatory protein mmob that together support optimal activity the hydroxylase mmoh in the form of αβγ 2 polypeptide arrangement with mmox mmoy and mmoz subunits provides the carboxylate bridged di iron center for methane oxidation the auxiliary reductase mmor and regulator mmob are responsible for transferring electrons from nadh to mmoh and adjusting substrate access to the active site respectively dewitt et al 1995 lee et al 2013 lund et al 1985 pulver et al 1997 generally the smmo has lower affinity for methane and oxygen with k m values of 3 μm for methane and 16 8 μm for oxygen compared to the pmmo which has k m 1 2 μm for methane and k m 0 1 μm for oxygen trotsenko and murrell 2008 the subsequent oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is catalyzed by a periplasmic methanol dehydrogenase mdh fig 1 the mxaf type mdh is a classic heterotetramer α2β2 that includes two 67 kda α subunits and two 8 5 kda β subunits which are encoded by genes mxafi anthony and williams 2003 it contains the cofactors pyrroloquinoline quinone pqq and calcium and it also requires cytochrome c as electron acceptor blake et al 1994 another mdh is an xoxf type one found in verrucomicrobia khadem et al 2012 it is a homodimer α2 lacking the small subunit and requires lanthanides instead of calcium for the activity pol et al 2014 compared to mxaf mdh the xoxf type catalyzes a four electron oxidation of methanol directly into formate khadem et al 2012 in the absence of xoxf type methanol dehydrogenase the oxidation of formaldehyde to formate comprises multiple steps mainly through the tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt pathway fig 1 briefly a homotrimeric formaldehyde activating enzyme fae first condenses formaldehyde and h4mpt forming n5 n10 methylene h4mpt vorholt et al 2000 then nad p dependent methylene h4mpt dehydrogenase mtd oxidizes the intermediate to n5 n10 methenyl h4mpt hagemeier et al 2000 followed by the conversion into n10 formyl h4mpt with the assistance of methenyl h4mpt cyclohydrolase mch vorholt 2002 finally the formyltransferase complex fhcabcd catalyzes the transformation of n10 formyl h4mpt to formate completing the whole h4mpt mediated pathway chistoserdova et al 1998 one exceptional enzyme for oxidizing formaldehyde to formate by a linear pathway was isolated from the methylococcus capsulatus bath zahn et al 2001 this membrane associated and dye linked formaldehyde dehydrogenase has a homotetrameric structure that consists of 49 5 kda subunits and requires the cytochrome b 559 569 complex as the electron acceptor the final step of aerobic methane oxidation i e formate oxidation to co2 is generally catalyzed by nad dependent formate dehydrogenase fdh fig 1 yoch et al 1990 this enzyme contains two polypeptides of 53 8 kda and 102 6 kda which form an apparently heterotetrameric α2β2 arrangement different fdhs may require tungsten or molybdenum as their catalytic cofactor chistoserdova et al 2004 laukel et al 2003 2 2 anaerobic methane oxidation due to the high activation energy required to break the c h bond in methane 439 kj mol thauer and shima 2008 methane was long believed to be stable in strictly anoxic conditions anaerobic oxidation of methane aom was first observed on ecosystem level without knowing what microorganisms were involved barnes and goldberg 1976 panganiban et al 1979 about 20 years later microorganisms involved in aom coupled to sulfate reduction were gradually characterized by the combination of new analytical methods and the discovery of enriched communities boetius et al 2000 hinrichs et al 1999 since then our understandings of aom processes and relevant microorganisms have been frequently renewed and are now still evolving all known microorganisms responsible for aom to date are anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme affiliated to the phylum euryarchaeota with one exception a bacterial group belonging to the nc10 phylum according to 16s rrna gene phylogeny anme are generally clustered in three distinct groups anme 1 anme 2 and anme 3 knittel and boetius 2009 different subgroups are also formed for anme 1 a b and anme 2 a b c d knittel et al 2005 orphan et al 2001 in most cases anme need to form syntrophic consortia with bacterial partners such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb for example anme 1 and anme 2 were usually detected in psychrophilic and mesophilic environments associated with srb belonging to the desulfosarcina desulfococcus dss branch of the deltaproteobacteria knittel et al 2003 knittel et al 2005 michaelis et al 2002 while anme 3 was mostly observed in consortia with srb of the desulfobulbus branch at cold temperatures niemann et al 2006 although most anme perform aom with bacterial partners one exception is anme 2d a representative of anme 2d candidatus methanoperedens has been proven to independently carry out aom coupled to the reduction of nitrate haroon et al 2013 iron cai et al 2018b ettwig et al 2016 and manganese leu et al 2020a moreover another bacterium temporarily named candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera m oxyfera and affiliated to the nc10 phylum was shown independently coupling aom to nitrite reduction ettwig et al 2010 collectively sulfate nitrate nitrite and metal ions fe iii and mn iv have been reported to be involved in aom all of them are reviewed in the following sections 2 2 1 sulfate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation sulfate was the first confirmed electron acceptor to drive aom microbial consortium of anme anme 1 2 3 and srb coupled methane oxidation to the reduction of sulfate to sulfide knittel and boetius 2009 fig 2 shows that methane is initially activated by methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr along with hetero disulphide com s s cob forming methyl coenzyme m com s ch3 and coenzyme b h s cob including the first step most reactions during sulfate dependent aom are identical to methanogenesis but in the reverse direction thus this pathway is designated as reverse methanogenesis hallam et al 2004 kruger et al 2003 sulfate dependent aom requires interspecies electron transfer between anme and srb fig 2 methyl sulfide generated by the reaction of ch4 and hs was proposed to act as the intermediate transferring electrons from anme to srb while srb could couple the oxidation of methyl sulfide to sulfate reduction and replenish hs for anme moran et al 2008 in addition zero valent sulfur s0 produced by anme 2 cells was suggested to link aom and sulfate reduction milucka et al 2012 in this case s0 reacts with sulfide to form soluble polysulfides disulfide s2 which were then disproportionated to sulfate and sulfide by the associated δ proteobacteria supplementing sulfate for the anme in addition to electron transfer mediated by the intermediates direct interspecies electron transfer also occurred during the syntrophy fig 2 the genomes of anme 2 possess genes encoding multi heme cytochromes which are known for extracellular electron transfer in microorganisms such as geobacter and shewanella suggesting their roles in transferring electrons extracellularly to bacterial partners mcglynn et al 2015 meanwhile numerous intercellular linkages made up of pili like structures and outer membrane multi heme cytochromes were found between the symbiotic growth of thermophilic anme 1 archaea and hotseep 1 bacteria supporting the direct electron transfer from anme to srb to complete the sulfate dependent aom wegener et al 2015 the ability of extracellular electron transfer of anme archaea was further confirmed by using artificial electron acceptors i e aqds instead of sulfate in which high rates of aom could still be sustained scheller et al 2016 2 2 2 nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation after decades of sulfate dependent aom research microorganisms coupling aom to denitrification were first discovered in freshwater ecosystems in the netherlands it was initially hypothesized that the process was conducted in a similar manner with sulfate dependent aom with anme archaea conducting reverse methanogenesis associated with denitrifying bacterial partners raghoebarsing et al 2006 however the process was subsequently shown to be performed by the bacteria in the absence of archaea ettwig et al 2008 ettwig et al 2009 finally it was proven that n damo bacteria identified as candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera belonging to the nc10 phylum converted nitrite to nitrogen gas and oxidized methane simultaneously without the partnership of archaea ettwig et al 2010 the genome of n damo bacteria has genes encoding the complete pathway of aerobic methane oxidation but no genes related to anaerobic methane oxidation methane monooxygenase which catalyzes methane oxidation in oxic conditions was proven to mediate aom in n damo bacteria for nitrite reduction to nitrogen gas known genes for nitrogen production noszdfy were not found in the genome while the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to nitrogen and oxygen was confirmed by isotopic experiment in parallel a single anme 2d population performing nitrate driven aom was successfully enriched in australia haroon et al 2013 metagenomic analyses combined with isotopic labelling experiments suggested that an anme 2d archaeon named candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens was capable of independent aom using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor reaction ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o a complete reverse methanogenesis pathway including all mcr genes was identified in the genome of this archaea suggesting that initial methane activation is catalyzed by mcr enzyme regarding the reduction of nitrate to nitrite genes encoding nitrate reductase nargh which was suggested to be transferred laterally from a bacterial donor were highly expressed in the genome of n damo archaea however genes related to subsequent steps in denitrification such as nitrite reduction and nitrogen production were not identified therefore n damo archaea are only capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite in order to achieve complete nitrogen removal a partnership between n damo archaea and n damo bacteria or n damo archaea and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria is needed the nitrite produced by n damo archaea can be further reduced to nitrogen gas by n damo bacteria or anammox bacteria however it should be noticed that since both n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria utilize nitrite as the electron acceptor they are generally predicted as competitors in the environment the abundances of anammox and n damo bacteria in costal mangrove sediments have been suggested to have a directly opposite correlation pattern with the environmental parameters such as ph temperature ammonium and nitrite concentrations chen and gu 2017 anammox and n damo bacteria also showed a spatial and niche segregation in riverbed sediments and wetland soils in order to avoid the potential competition for nitrite shen et al 2019 shen et al 2015 nevertheless in wwtps and laboratory scale bioreactors where nitrite is not a limiting factor for anammox and n damo bacteria they generally coexist and both contribute to nitrogen removal liu et al 2019b meng et al 2021 xu et al 2017 2 2 3 metal dependent anaerobic methane oxidation the first geological evidence for metal reduction i e manganese birnessite and iron ferrihydrite coupled to methane oxidation was found in marine methane seep sediments beal et al 2009 afterwards in situ evidence and laboratory incubations quantitively confirmed the significance of iron dependent aom egger et al 2015 sivan et al 2011 further freshwater enrichment identified an archaeon dominating the community it belonged to the order methanosarcinales and was related to candidatus m nitroreducens ettwig et al 2016 genomes of this lineage encoded genes for aom and multi heme cytochromes capable of extracellular electron transfer implying that the archaea could couple aom to iron oxide reduction independently long term incubations successfully enriched several novel members of methanoperedenaceae namely candidatus methanoperedens ferrireducens candidatus methanoperedens manganicus and candidatus methanoperedens manganireducens which dominated the microbial community fed with methane and fe iii oxide ferrihydrite or mn iv oxides birnessite cai et al 2018b leu et al 2020a isotopic experiments detailed metagenomics and metatranscriptomics collectively suggested that they oxidized methane anaerobically through a reverse methanogenesis pathway like anme in sulfate dependent aom and transferred electrons directly to extracellular insoluble electron acceptors for their reductions via multi heme c type cytochromes with no help of bacterial partners fig 2 2 2 4 other forms of anaerobic methane oxidation in addition to the primary electron acceptors discussed above a large variety of oxidized substances have been demonstrated to mediate aom including selenate chromate antimonate biochar and organics fu et al 2019 lai et al 2018b lu et al 2016 luo et al 2018b luo et al 2019 valenzuela et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 after incubation with these electron acceptors the community was usually dominated by general methanotrophic or methanogenic archaea e g methanoperedenaceae and methanosarcina implying that either these archaea could conduct aom providing electrons for the co existing bacteria or they have metabolic versatility to reduce the oxidized substances mentioned above for example acquiring relevant genes through lateral gene transfer leu et al 2020b this may suggest that methane oxidizing consortia could couple aom to the reduction of a wider range of organic or inorganic matter than previously expected as long as the reactions generate free energy 3 using methane as an electron donor to remove oxidized contaminants compared to traditional organic carbon sources e g acetate and ethanol methane is a relatively cheap electron donor that also is available in situ in wwtps meulepas et al 2010 any residual methane also is readily to avoid secondary pollution in the treated effluent cai et al 2018a recent findings have demonstrated that aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane can couple to the reduction of diverse oxidized contaminants in microaerophilic conditions aerobic methanotrophs can first oxidize methane into formaldehyde using mmo and mdh then synthesize organic matter such as acetate succinate lactate and citrate via the fermentation pathway gilman et al 2017 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 these intermediates further fuel coexisting heterotrophs that reduce diverse oxidized contaminants including nitrate costa et al 2000 in anoxic conditions anaerobic methanotrophs also can oxidize methane to co2 or short chain fatty acids via the reverse methanogenesis pathway then transfer electrons or these intermediates for the subsequent oxide reduction cai et al 2019 chen et al 2019 such as nitrate and chromate haroon et al 2013 lu et al 2016 these versatile couplings suggest that methane oxidation can be efficiently applied not only in natural environments but also in wwtps for removing a wide range of oxidized contaminants though a range of pollutants can be reduced by methane oxidation in nature including nitrate nitrite deutzmann et al 2014 iron manganese beal et al 2009 and arsenate shi et al 2020a this review focuses on the removal of oxidized contaminants in wwtps using methane as the electron donor as follows 3 1 nitrogen removal driven by methane nitrogen removal is one of the most critical functions of a wwtp because of its potential risk causing the eutrophication of natural water bodies mccarty 2018 conventional biological nitrogen removal via nitrification and denitrification have downsides guo et al 2013 for instance the high costs for aeration organic carbon consumption and sludge disposal thus alternative technologies using novel microbial processes will be welcome when they overcome the downsides using methane to replace conventional organic donors e g acetate and methanol is promising to reduce the overall costs for wastewater treatment because of the lower cost of ch4 and its in situ availability from anaerobic digestion in wwtps cogert et al 2019 methane driven nitrogen removal can be achieved through two routes illustrated in fig 3 namely aerobic methane oxidation coupled with denitrification ame d and the nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo 3 1 1 applications of aerobic methane oxidation coupling with denitrification two mechanisms are proposed for ame d the first pathway involves collaboration between aerobic methanotrophs and heterotrophic denitrifiers in which the former converts methane into biodegradable organic metabolites e g acetate methanol citrate and formate while the latter drives denitrification by using these carbon sources fig 3a this form of microbial cooperation is presumed to be the major pathway in many ame d systems chen et al 2020 costa et al 2000 liu et al 2014 waki et al 2005 werner and kayser 1991 in which nitrogen removal rates as high as 0 7 kg n m3 d were achieved the second pathway is based on the discovery of denitrification genes in some aerobic methanotrophs e g methylomonas denitrificans fjg1 methylacidiphilum fumariolium solv methylacidiphilum infernorum v4 khadem et al 2012 kits et al 2015 stein and klotz 2011 they can potentially perform nitrogen removal independently fig 3b however no aerobic methanotroph is yet known to have the complete set of genes for denitrification in fact n2o rather than n2 is usually observed as the terminal product for partial denitrification conducted by aerobic methanotrophs khadem et al 2012 kits et al 2015 stein and klotz 2011 as evidenced by the high n2o emission from landfill cover and rice paddy soils containing diverse aerobic methanotrophs lee et al 2009 mandernack et al 2000 up to date nitrogen removal based on ame d process is restricted to laboratory research among all the approach how to control the methane conversion to organic metabolites rather than co2 is essential for the success of ame d oxygen limiting condition seems to be favorable for such conversion chen et al 2019 chen et al 2018 costa et al 2000 liu et al 2014 thalasso et al 1997 waki et al 2005 werner and kayser 1991 but a clearly defined strategy to control this process is absent if aeration is more than the required amount methane will be oxidized to co2 straightway leading to unsatisfactory denitrification if aeration is less than the required amount insufficient organic metabolites will be produced which will result in similarly poor denitrification thus it is necessary to match the production of organic metabolites to the required amount for denitrification to avoid poor denitrification or residual organics in the effluent a well controlled oxygen supply platform is important for the ame d process in recent studies bubble free oxygen supply from hollow fibers has been widely used as an effective method to increase the oxygen transfer efficiency and to reduce the stripping of other dissolved gases bunse et al 2020 gong et al 2007 this seems to perfectly match the requirement of ame d process further studies are needed to investigate the feasibility of achieving ame d process by using hollow fibers to precisely regulate the oxygen supply 3 1 2 applications of nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation due to the unique metabolic properties n damo provides a feasible means to use ch4 as the electron donor to drive nitrite and nitrate removals directly compared to the ame d the n damo process has several advantages such as no aeration consumption and less sludge production more importantly methane is directly used to remove nitrogen in anaerobic condition which makes the operation of n damo process much easier than ame d process the potential application and significance of n damo process in wwtps have been depicted previously cogert et al 2019 liu et al 2019a van kessel et al 2018 wang et al 2017 however no larger scale trial than laboratory demonstration has been performed yet which warrants more future studies at laboratory scale several studies have applied n damo processes to remove nitrogen from various wastewater streams which is usually achieved in collaboration with anammox fig 3c liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020c luo et al 2018a lim et al 2021 the anammox process is known to reduce the requirement for external carbon source lessen the aeration demand and sludge production kartal et al 2010 however the stability of partial nitritation is still a challenge for domestic sewage due to the hard to control growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob pérez et al 2014 and a varying nitrite to ammonium ratio strous et al 1998 the problems could be addressed by the cooperative nature of anammox and n damo microorganisms specifically n damo bacteria could remove any extra nitrite if the nitrite to ammonium ratio in wastewater is higher than the 1 32 g nh4 n no2 n ratio needed by anammox while the n damo archaea could polish effluent quality by removing any nitrate generated by anammox bacteria or from the unstable partial nitritation recently a novel technology coupling anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea was proven effective in removing nitrogen from synthetic high and low strength wastewaters liu et al 2019b liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020d xie et al 2018a as well as from actual mainstream and sidestream wastewater lim et al 2021 these results support the versatility and applicability of using an n damo process to remove nitrogen in practice due to the microbial cooperation and over capacity developed in this new technology stable nitrogen removal was maintained despite dynamic nitrogen composition xie et al 2018a or temperature as low as 10 c liu et al 2020b notably although the overall mass balance was conducted in most of these studies to show the contribution of each functional group isotope experiment with labelled nitrogen is expected to generate more in depth understanding of the cooperation between anammox and n damo microorganisms the applications of n damo have been mainly achieved in a few bioreactor configurations including the membrane biofilm reactor mbfr lim et al 2021 liu et al 2020b xie et al 2018a membrane bioreactor mbr allegue et al 2018 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb fan et al 2019 liu et al 2021 and biotrickling filters btf fan et al 2020 lopez et al 2017 however the type of biomass aggregation was completely different in these reactors biofilms in mbfr and btf suspended flocs in mbr and granules in uasb despite the differences a universal feature for these three configurations was the ability to sustain biomass with significantly prolonged solids retention time srt which is necessary for the slow growing anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea how to deliver methane effectively is another question requiring in depth consideration in the reactor design while the methane in mbr is provided via a conventional bubble diffuser hollow fiber membranes were used in mbfr and uasb systems fan et al 2019 liu et al 2020a hollow fibers allow methane to transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase without the formation of bubbles leading to significantly reduced methane dissipation 3 2 removal of other oxidized contaminants by using methane as electron donor 3 2 1 properties fate risks and regulation of typical oxidized contaminants in addition to nitrogen pollutants nitrate and nitrite perchlorate selenate chromate antimonate bromate and vanadate are also oxidized contaminants in water due to natural sources and anthropogenic activities their features are summarized in table 2 because of their existence in the earth s crust some metal loid s can be released from rocks and minerals thus polluting groundwater and surface water for example agricultural drainage could contain abundant se oxyanions derived from high se soils and damage the ecological health zhang and frankenberger 2003 manufacturing is another important source since these substances are widely used in industrial production although concentrations of these contaminants are usually lower than 1 mg l they can still induce acute toxicity to human beings including enzyme disruption skin erosion and even death table 2 their concentrations are strictly limited in drinking water which demands effective removal technologies compared to the oxidized species typically found in contaminated waters the reduced forms always have lower solubility toxicity and mobility since the reduced forms readily precipitate adsorb or volatilize table 2 in some cases the reduced forms are valuable such as antimony trioxide and elemental selenium with respect to the biological reduction the enzymes responsible for the oxides reduction generally belong to the molybdenum dependent dimethyl sulfoxide reductase dmsor family e g the respiratory and periplasmic nitrate reductases nar nap perchlorate reductase pcr selenate reductase ser and antimonate reductase sbr shown in fig 4 a shi et al 2019b notably some of these reductases are versatile and can mediate different reduction of various electron acceptors for example nitrate reductase is capable of performing perchlorate and selenate reductions suggesting the feasibility to reduce multiple oxidized contaminants simultaneously the active microorganisms responsible for the removal of oxidized contaminants are distributed in several phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria deferribacteres chrysiogenete firmicutes and crenarchaeota notably some genera show the versatility in reducing various oxidized contaminants mentioned above which is illustrated in fig 4b for example the genus shewanella has been demonstrated to reduce a series of oxides including nitrate selenate chromate and vanadate guha et al 2001 kenward et al 2006 myers et al 2004 yoon et al 2015 this may attribute to either multiple reductases harbored or one enzyme capable of utilizing diverse substrates overall the metabolic flexibility of close phylotypes further support the potential application of using methane as the electron donor to co remove complex pollutions in practice 3 2 2 removal of single oxidized contaminant 3 2 2 1 reduction of oxidized contaminants to nontoxic products in general the reduction of oxidized contaminants produces nontoxic products or generates reduced products precipitate easily this is illustrated in fig 5 complete perchlorate reduction to innocuous chloride ion was successfully achieved by using methane as the sole electron donor in mbfrs luo et al 2015 wu et al 2019 xie et al 2018b the reduction process was mediated by methane oxidizing and perchlorate reducing consortia of which the community structure mainly depended on the oxygen level in anoxic conditions biological dismutation of chlorite generated o2 for aerobic methanotrophs dominating the community and oxidizing methane luo et al 2015 wu et al 2019 xie et al 2018b in oxygen limiting conditions methanogens e g methanosarcina seemed to play an important role in converting methane into volatile fatty acids that were then utilized by dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria lv et al 2019 wu et al 2019 successful achievements of methane oxidation coupled to perchlorate reduction under various oxygen regimes shed light on the promising application to different types of perchlorate laden wastewaters for pollution removal similarly bromate could also be reduced along with methane oxidation at different oxygen levels lai et al 2018c luo et al 2017 methane was first oxidized into volatile fatty acids by methanosarcina in oxygen limiting conditions lai et al 2018c luo et al 2017 these intermediate organic matters were subsequently utilized for the bromate reduction to nontoxic bromide ion 3 2 2 2 reduction of oxidized contaminants to easily precipitated products microbial reduction of chromate selenate antimonate and vanadate can be applied to recover valuable materials as their reduction products easily precipitate chromite antimonite and vanadite precipitate as hydr oxides and elemental selenium is insoluble in methane based mbfrs a synergy of methanotrophs and other bacteria e g heterotrophic denitrifiers efficiently reduced the oxyanions to corresponding precipitated products therefore removing the water contaminations lai et al 2018a lai et al 2018b lai et al 2016a lai et al 2016b long et al 2017 lu et al 2016 luo et al 2018b luo et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 methanotrophs played a crucial role when inoculated with n damo consortia candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus methylomirabilis appeared to perform either aom coupled to the reduction of selenate and chromate independently lu et al 2016 luo et al 2018b luo et al 2019 or transfer short chain fatty acids to coexisting unknown oxide reducers synergistically cai et al 2019 chen et al 2019 alternatively when oxygen became available type i and ii methanotrophic bacteria were likely responsible for methane oxidation and provided organic intermediates for the reduction of chromate selenate and vanadate lai et al 2018a lai et al 2016a lai et al 2016b long et al 2017 in addition community analyses implied a role of methanogens e g methanosarcina in reducing various oxyanions including chromate selenate vanadate antimonate and iron oxide bar or et al 2017 dong et al 2019 lai et al 2018b shi et al 2020c wang et al 2019 though the physiological mechanism involved in these processes is still unclear the evident removal and precipitation of soluble oxides indicates the feasibility and applicability of using methane to remediate water environments polluted by different oxidized contaminants the precipitates often accumulated within the biofilm matrix which might have bad or good effects on one hand the tightly bound particles could restrict substrate diffusion from outer liquid to inner biofilm thus decreasing reduction rate of oxidized compounds such effect has been demonstrated where the nanoscale products intensively attached on cell surface and impeded the further transfer and utilization of substrates shi et al 2019a on the other hand these precipitates provide an opportunity to recover and recycle the valuable materials illustrated by multiple characterization techniques microbial induced precipitates are generally at nanoscale these materials are usually consistent with synthesized commercial products and have excellent properties needed by industrial manufacturing such as biogenic antimony oxide and elemental selenium and tellurium lai et al 2018b lai et al 2016a shi et al 2019a importantly the reduction products always precipitated outside cells fig 5 which means that they can be recovered as part of wasted biomass without the requirement of additional process to release the products from inside the cells lu et al 2016 luo et al 2018b luo et al 2019 harvesting inorganic solids from the microbial biomass could be further accomplished by a number of methods including ultrasonication wet heat sterilization and liquid liquid phases extraction fesharaki et al 2010 oremland et al 2004 shakibaie et al 2010 3 2 3 impacts of co occurring contaminants on simultaneous removal 3 2 3 1 impacts of nitrate on simultaneous contaminant removal the co occurrence of diverse pollutants increase risks for human and ecosystem health barber et al 2013 and simultaneous removal of multiple contaminants is advantageous nitrate is a good example of co occurring oxidized contaminants e g along with selenate in mining impacted wastewater tan et al 2016 and with perchlorate in groundwater ziv el and rittmann 2009 the presence of nitrate may pose stimulatory or inhibitory effects on reduction of other oxidized contaminants as shown in fig 6 the effect of nitrate depends on the other co existing electron acceptors and the electron donor supply rate as a preferential electron acceptor of high redox potential nitrate could always be reduced in prior to other oxidized contaminants co existing nitrate could have dual effect i for oxyanions that require the same enzymes such as perchlorate bromate and selenate the co occurrence of nitrate could inhibit their reduction via competing for electron donors or active enzyme sites although the presence of more biomass could enhance removals once nitrate is consumed lai et al 2016a lai et al 2018c lv et al 2020 ii for oxyanions that require different microorganisms for instance for chromate nitrate could irreversibly inhibit their reduction because of excluding the key microorganisms from the microbial community zhong et al 2017 3 2 3 2 impacts of sulfate on simultaneous contaminant removal although sulfate is usually not considered as a contaminant its existence will affect removal performance of other oxidized contaminants lv et al 2018 shi et al 2020b for oxyanions that require molybdenum mo dependent enzymes such as perchlorate and selenate sulfate could inhibit their reductions through competition for molybdate this negative effect could be alleviated by the pre treatment to remove sulfate supplementing molybdenum or suppressing sulfate reduction shi et al 2020b for oxyanions with no enzyme competition like chromate sulfate may affect their reductions by forcing the other reducers out of the microbial community for example sulfate applied at 6 7 mg s l dramatically decreased the relative abundance of chromate reducing meiothermus lv et al 2018 as a consequence chromate removal decreased from 90 to 45 with the addition of sulfate however these negative effects induced by sulfate were not fatal as selenate and chromate still could be reduced to some extent shi et al 2020b besides when the sulfate was removed the chromate reducing bacteria and chromate removal efficiency recovered lv et al 2018 3 3 how to break barriers to apply methane to remove various contaminants although methane can replace traditional organic donors for driving reduction of oxidized contaminants several barriers should be overcome firstly the transfer efficiency of gaseous methane must be high given that methane has a low solubility of 25 mg l at 25 c and is a potent greenhouse gas the mbfr addresses this barrier perfectly because it delivers methane from the lumen directly to the biofilm attached on the membrane surface using the mbfr the utilization efficiency of methane was at least 90 cai et al 2018a the second barrier for practical application at wwtps is utilizing ch4 from biogas which has around 35 ch4 and 65 co2 as well as trace amount of h2s rasi et al 2011 on the one hand a significant flux of co2 may cause acidification liu et al 2020d which is inhibitory jin et al 2013 on the other hand the ch4 transfer rate will be slowed by its dilution with the other gases alkali dosing and intermittent n2 flushing can alleviate the induced acidification caused by input of co2 liu et al 2020d in addition reduction processes like denitrification can consume protons thus counteracting the co2 derived acidification although no study has verified the feasibility of using in situ biogas to reduce oxidized contaminants the biogas generated from wwtps indeed has been successfully used to treat ammonium laden reject water by the assimilation of methanotrophs kim et al 2020 this achievement suggests that methanotrophs are very likely able to tolerate potential adverse impacts by using biogas moreover it also is a challenge to enrich microbial consortia for methane oxidation and oxidized contaminant reduction especially for anaerobic methanotrophs which have a long doubling time of more than 10 days girguis et al 2005 nauhaus et al 2007 in order to speed up the enrichment of these slow growing microorganisms previous studies have employed novel reactor configurations and optimizing operational conditions taking n damo microorganisms as an example the cultivation and enrichment period has dramatically decreased in the last decade from more than years initially raghoebarsing et al 2006 to a few months allegue et al 2018 liu et al 2021 accordingly nitrogen removal has been remarkably elevated to practically useful rates in mbfrs cai et al 2015 and the versatile applications of n damo process in real wastewater treatment also has been demonstrated lim et al 2021 thus it seems likely capable microbial consortia can be enriched to remove other oxidized contaminants e g perchlorate and selenate via methane oxidation 4 opportunities and unsolved questions although methane oxidation has been investigated intensively in recent years many issues in terms of both biological mechanisms and practical applications are still elusive moreover the rapid development of emerging tools e g meta omics approaches well challenges the canonical theory and substantially improve our understanding of microbial methane oxidation by incorporating the up to date findings the present review renovates the fundamentals and highlights the urgent perspectives in the field of methane based bioreduction processes solving these questions will not only deepen our comprehension of these processes but also guide us to better use methane for bioremediation of various contaminants we close with some unsolved questions that we can begin answering today 1 it is still unclear which anaerobic methane oxidizing members mediate bioreduction processes for perchlorate bromate selenate chromate antimonate and vanadate 2 while some interactions between co existing oxyanions present in relatively high concentrations e g nitrate and sulfate and lower concentration oxidized contaminants e g perchlorate bromate selenate and chromate have been reported lv et al 2020 shi et al 2020b studies are required to reveal the positive and negative interactions as well as strategies to mitigate negative effects to achieve simultaneous removals 3 biological methane oxidation coupled to oxyanion reduction can generate potentially valuable products e g se0 and sb2o3 precipitated in biofilms means to separate the valuable products are unexplored 4 to date all the studies using methane oxidation to remove contaminants were conducted in lab scale systems future studies need to overcome scale up obstacles that might preclude high

17059,being an energetic fuel methane is able to support microbial growth and drive the reduction of various electron acceptors these acceptors include a broad range of oxidized contaminants e g nitrate nitrite perchlorate bromate selenate chromate antimonate and vanadate that are ubiquitously detected in water environments and pose threats to human and ecological health using methane as electron donor to biologically reduce these contaminants into nontoxic forms is a promising solution to remediate polluted water considering that methane is a widely available and inexpensive electron donor the understanding of methane based biological reduction processes and the responsible microorganisms has grown in the past decade this review summarizes the fundamentals of metabolic pathways and microorganisms mediating microbial methane oxidation experimental demonstrations of methane as an electron donor to remove oxidized contaminants are summarized compared and evaluated finally the review identifies opportunities and unsolved questions that deserve future explorations for broadening understanding of methane oxidation and promoting its practical applications keywords aerobic methane oxidation anaerobic methane oxidation nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo oxidized contaminants membrane biofilm reactor mbfr 1 introduction methane ch4 exists widely in natural and engineered ecosystems including paddy soils and wetland sediments in nature ruff et al 2016 vaksmaa et al 2016 and anaerobic digestors in wastewater treatment plants wwtps maaz et al 2019 young et al 2013 methane is a potent greenhouse gas having a global warming potential 28 times that of co2 ipcc 2019 for example ch4 emissions can be a larger contributor than co2 and n2o emissions in some wwtps daelman et al 2012 conversely ch4 is an excellent source of energy for heating and generating electrical power due to its high enthalpy of combustion i e 55 7 kj g schmidt rohr 2015 methane as a carbon source and electron donor also can support microbial respiratory metabolisms that bring about the reduction of diverse electron acceptors in addition to oxygen o2 a series of oxyanions can be respired by bacteria that oxidize ch4 consisting of nitrate no3 nitrite no2 perchlorate clo4 bromate bro3 selenate seo4 2 chromate cro4 2 antimonate sb oh 6 and vanadate h2vo4 the thermodynamics of potential energy yielding reactions for ch4 and the oxyanions are summarized in table 1 these oxyanions are also water contaminants and have been widely detected in various water environments schwarzenbach et al 2010 tan et al 2016 the majority of these oxyanions can cause acute or chronic toxicity to human beings and they have negative effects on ecological health coates and achenbach 2004 costa and klein 2006 nancharaiah and lens 2015 oremland and stolz 2003 sundar and chakravarty 2010 for example excess uptake of selenate would lead to skin discoloration nervous disorders and even death boyd 2011 generally the solubility toxicity and mobility of the oxyanions decline remarkably when being reduced because the reduced products are susceptible to the precipitation adsorption or volatilization thus biological reduction of oxyanions is one of promising solutions to detoxify them from both municipal and industrial contaminated wastewater compared to other organic electron donors that could be used to reduce the oxyanions ch4 has several advantages e g widely available and relatively less expensive meulepas et al 2010 however two major barriers may have limited the use of ch4 as a microbiological electron donor first ch4 is a gas with a low solubility in water which will restrict microbial reaction activities second it is difficult to enrich microorganisms that can utilize methane as the electron donor to reduce various contaminants in particular in anaerobic conditions based on recent progress in environmental microbiology and environmental biotechnology recent findings have not only advanced our understandings of methane cycling microorganisms and their metabolic pathways but also provided technology opportunities for applying methane based processes this review summarizes the currently known microorganisms and corresponding metabolic pathways for the biological ch4 oxidation processes which are well studied moreover the technologies for applying methane to remove pollutants are compared and evaluated based on recent experimental demonstrations especially for the reactions of which mechanisms lack solid evidences finally we present opportunities and challenges for using methane to remove oxidized contaminants 2 metabolic pathways and microorganisms mediating biological methane oxidation 2 1 aerobic methane oxidation 2 1 1 aerobic methanotrophs aerobic oxidation of methane is carried out by aerobic methanotrophs a subset of methylotrophs so far all microorganisms performing aerobic methane oxidation belong to the bacteria domain according to cell morphology ultrastructure phylogeny and carbon assimilation pathway aerobic methanotrophs are classified into three groups type i γ proteobacteria type ii α proteobacteria and type iii verrucomicrobia knief 2015 strong et al 2015 in terms of cell morphology and ultrastructure bundles of intra cytoplasmic membranes are arranged as vesicular discs in type i methanotrophs while type ii generally has intra cytoplasmic membranes aligned to the periphery of cells murrell 2010 carbon assimilation is also different among types i ii and iii type i methanotrophs use the ribulose monophosphate pathway as their primary route to assimilate carbon into cellular materials type ii utilize the serine pathway and type iii employ the calvin bensen bashsham pathway meraz et al 2020 murrell 2010 in terms of the environmental distribution of aerobic methanotrophs they appear to be ubiquitous in environments where methane and oxygen can be detected in freshwaters and sediments type i methanotrophs including methylomonas methylobacter methylosarcina methylococcus and methylosoma were predominant it was estimated that in lake washington sediments type i methanotrophs are 10 to 100 fold more abundant than type ii costello et al 2002 however methylocystis which belongs to the type ii methanotroph was ubiquitously distributed in forest and upland soil environments baani and liesack 2008 in addition methanotrophs were also found in extreme environments ranging from 0 70 c and ph 1 5 12 e g hot spring and volcanic mud trotsenko and khmelenina 2002 the widespread distribution of aerobic methanotrophs suggests that they play a significant role in mitigating methane emissions for example approximately 20 of the methane produced in rice fields is oxidized in situ by aerobic methanotrophs therefore preventing large amounts of methane reaching the atmosphere conrad 2009 2 1 2 enzymes and pathways involved in aerobic methane oxidation during the obligately aerobic methane oxidation methanotrophic bacteria respire o2 as their electron acceptor a summary of the mechanisms involved in aerobic methane oxidation is illustrated in fig 1 aerobic methanotrophs possess a key methane monooxygenase mmo that inserts one oxygen atom from o2 into a c h bond of methane to form methanol ch3oh and h2o as the initial step of methane oxidation methane monooxygenase has two distinct forms particulate and soluble the particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo encoded by most methanotrophs is a membrane bound enzyme that requires copper at the active site balasubramanian et al 2010 ross et al 2019 it contains three polypeptides a 45 kda α subunit pmob a 26 kda β subunit pmoa and a 23 kda γ subunit pmoc that together assemble into an αβγ 3 homotrimer lieberman and rosenzweig 2005 the pmob subunit is composed of periplasmic and transmembrane regions while the pmoa and pmoc subunits contain primarily transmembrane helices the soluble methane monooxygenase smmo is found in fewer methanotrophs and uses iron for its catalytic activity rosenzweig et al 1993 it includes three components a 251 kda hydroxylase mmoh a 38 kda reductase mmor and a 16 kda regulatory protein mmob that together support optimal activity the hydroxylase mmoh in the form of αβγ 2 polypeptide arrangement with mmox mmoy and mmoz subunits provides the carboxylate bridged di iron center for methane oxidation the auxiliary reductase mmor and regulator mmob are responsible for transferring electrons from nadh to mmoh and adjusting substrate access to the active site respectively dewitt et al 1995 lee et al 2013 lund et al 1985 pulver et al 1997 generally the smmo has lower affinity for methane and oxygen with k m values of 3 μm for methane and 16 8 μm for oxygen compared to the pmmo which has k m 1 2 μm for methane and k m 0 1 μm for oxygen trotsenko and murrell 2008 the subsequent oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is catalyzed by a periplasmic methanol dehydrogenase mdh fig 1 the mxaf type mdh is a classic heterotetramer α2β2 that includes two 67 kda α subunits and two 8 5 kda β subunits which are encoded by genes mxafi anthony and williams 2003 it contains the cofactors pyrroloquinoline quinone pqq and calcium and it also requires cytochrome c as electron acceptor blake et al 1994 another mdh is an xoxf type one found in verrucomicrobia khadem et al 2012 it is a homodimer α2 lacking the small subunit and requires lanthanides instead of calcium for the activity pol et al 2014 compared to mxaf mdh the xoxf type catalyzes a four electron oxidation of methanol directly into formate khadem et al 2012 in the absence of xoxf type methanol dehydrogenase the oxidation of formaldehyde to formate comprises multiple steps mainly through the tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt pathway fig 1 briefly a homotrimeric formaldehyde activating enzyme fae first condenses formaldehyde and h4mpt forming n5 n10 methylene h4mpt vorholt et al 2000 then nad p dependent methylene h4mpt dehydrogenase mtd oxidizes the intermediate to n5 n10 methenyl h4mpt hagemeier et al 2000 followed by the conversion into n10 formyl h4mpt with the assistance of methenyl h4mpt cyclohydrolase mch vorholt 2002 finally the formyltransferase complex fhcabcd catalyzes the transformation of n10 formyl h4mpt to formate completing the whole h4mpt mediated pathway chistoserdova et al 1998 one exceptional enzyme for oxidizing formaldehyde to formate by a linear pathway was isolated from the methylococcus capsulatus bath zahn et al 2001 this membrane associated and dye linked formaldehyde dehydrogenase has a homotetrameric structure that consists of 49 5 kda subunits and requires the cytochrome b 559 569 complex as the electron acceptor the final step of aerobic methane oxidation i e formate oxidation to co2 is generally catalyzed by nad dependent formate dehydrogenase fdh fig 1 yoch et al 1990 this enzyme contains two polypeptides of 53 8 kda and 102 6 kda which form an apparently heterotetrameric α2β2 arrangement different fdhs may require tungsten or molybdenum as their catalytic cofactor chistoserdova et al 2004 laukel et al 2003 2 2 anaerobic methane oxidation due to the high activation energy required to break the c h bond in methane 439 kj mol thauer and shima 2008 methane was long believed to be stable in strictly anoxic conditions anaerobic oxidation of methane aom was first observed on ecosystem level without knowing what microorganisms were involved barnes and goldberg 1976 panganiban et al 1979 about 20 years later microorganisms involved in aom coupled to sulfate reduction were gradually characterized by the combination of new analytical methods and the discovery of enriched communities boetius et al 2000 hinrichs et al 1999 since then our understandings of aom processes and relevant microorganisms have been frequently renewed and are now still evolving all known microorganisms responsible for aom to date are anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme affiliated to the phylum euryarchaeota with one exception a bacterial group belonging to the nc10 phylum according to 16s rrna gene phylogeny anme are generally clustered in three distinct groups anme 1 anme 2 and anme 3 knittel and boetius 2009 different subgroups are also formed for anme 1 a b and anme 2 a b c d knittel et al 2005 orphan et al 2001 in most cases anme need to form syntrophic consortia with bacterial partners such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb for example anme 1 and anme 2 were usually detected in psychrophilic and mesophilic environments associated with srb belonging to the desulfosarcina desulfococcus dss branch of the deltaproteobacteria knittel et al 2003 knittel et al 2005 michaelis et al 2002 while anme 3 was mostly observed in consortia with srb of the desulfobulbus branch at cold temperatures niemann et al 2006 although most anme perform aom with bacterial partners one exception is anme 2d a representative of anme 2d candidatus methanoperedens has been proven to independently carry out aom coupled to the reduction of nitrate haroon et al 2013 iron cai et al 2018b ettwig et al 2016 and manganese leu et al 2020a moreover another bacterium temporarily named candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera m oxyfera and affiliated to the nc10 phylum was shown independently coupling aom to nitrite reduction ettwig et al 2010 collectively sulfate nitrate nitrite and metal ions fe iii and mn iv have been reported to be involved in aom all of them are reviewed in the following sections 2 2 1 sulfate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation sulfate was the first confirmed electron acceptor to drive aom microbial consortium of anme anme 1 2 3 and srb coupled methane oxidation to the reduction of sulfate to sulfide knittel and boetius 2009 fig 2 shows that methane is initially activated by methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr along with hetero disulphide com s s cob forming methyl coenzyme m com s ch3 and coenzyme b h s cob including the first step most reactions during sulfate dependent aom are identical to methanogenesis but in the reverse direction thus this pathway is designated as reverse methanogenesis hallam et al 2004 kruger et al 2003 sulfate dependent aom requires interspecies electron transfer between anme and srb fig 2 methyl sulfide generated by the reaction of ch4 and hs was proposed to act as the intermediate transferring electrons from anme to srb while srb could couple the oxidation of methyl sulfide to sulfate reduction and replenish hs for anme moran et al 2008 in addition zero valent sulfur s0 produced by anme 2 cells was suggested to link aom and sulfate reduction milucka et al 2012 in this case s0 reacts with sulfide to form soluble polysulfides disulfide s2 which were then disproportionated to sulfate and sulfide by the associated δ proteobacteria supplementing sulfate for the anme in addition to electron transfer mediated by the intermediates direct interspecies electron transfer also occurred during the syntrophy fig 2 the genomes of anme 2 possess genes encoding multi heme cytochromes which are known for extracellular electron transfer in microorganisms such as geobacter and shewanella suggesting their roles in transferring electrons extracellularly to bacterial partners mcglynn et al 2015 meanwhile numerous intercellular linkages made up of pili like structures and outer membrane multi heme cytochromes were found between the symbiotic growth of thermophilic anme 1 archaea and hotseep 1 bacteria supporting the direct electron transfer from anme to srb to complete the sulfate dependent aom wegener et al 2015 the ability of extracellular electron transfer of anme archaea was further confirmed by using artificial electron acceptors i e aqds instead of sulfate in which high rates of aom could still be sustained scheller et al 2016 2 2 2 nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation after decades of sulfate dependent aom research microorganisms coupling aom to denitrification were first discovered in freshwater ecosystems in the netherlands it was initially hypothesized that the process was conducted in a similar manner with sulfate dependent aom with anme archaea conducting reverse methanogenesis associated with denitrifying bacterial partners raghoebarsing et al 2006 however the process was subsequently shown to be performed by the bacteria in the absence of archaea ettwig et al 2008 ettwig et al 2009 finally it was proven that n damo bacteria identified as candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera belonging to the nc10 phylum converted nitrite to nitrogen gas and oxidized methane simultaneously without the partnership of archaea ettwig et al 2010 the genome of n damo bacteria has genes encoding the complete pathway of aerobic methane oxidation but no genes related to anaerobic methane oxidation methane monooxygenase which catalyzes methane oxidation in oxic conditions was proven to mediate aom in n damo bacteria for nitrite reduction to nitrogen gas known genes for nitrogen production noszdfy were not found in the genome while the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to nitrogen and oxygen was confirmed by isotopic experiment in parallel a single anme 2d population performing nitrate driven aom was successfully enriched in australia haroon et al 2013 metagenomic analyses combined with isotopic labelling experiments suggested that an anme 2d archaeon named candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens was capable of independent aom using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor reaction ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o a complete reverse methanogenesis pathway including all mcr genes was identified in the genome of this archaea suggesting that initial methane activation is catalyzed by mcr enzyme regarding the reduction of nitrate to nitrite genes encoding nitrate reductase nargh which was suggested to be transferred laterally from a bacterial donor were highly expressed in the genome of n damo archaea however genes related to subsequent steps in denitrification such as nitrite reduction and nitrogen production were not identified therefore n damo archaea are only capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite in order to achieve complete nitrogen removal a partnership between n damo archaea and n damo bacteria or n damo archaea and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria is needed the nitrite produced by n damo archaea can be further reduced to nitrogen gas by n damo bacteria or anammox bacteria however it should be noticed that since both n damo bacteria and anammox bacteria utilize nitrite as the electron acceptor they are generally predicted as competitors in the environment the abundances of anammox and n damo bacteria in costal mangrove sediments have been suggested to have a directly opposite correlation pattern with the environmental parameters such as ph temperature ammonium and nitrite concentrations chen and gu 2017 anammox and n damo bacteria also showed a spatial and niche segregation in riverbed sediments and wetland soils in order to avoid the potential competition for nitrite shen et al 2019 shen et al 2015 nevertheless in wwtps and laboratory scale bioreactors where nitrite is not a limiting factor for anammox and n damo bacteria they generally coexist and both contribute to nitrogen removal liu et al 2019b meng et al 2021 xu et al 2017 2 2 3 metal dependent anaerobic methane oxidation the first geological evidence for metal reduction i e manganese birnessite and iron ferrihydrite coupled to methane oxidation was found in marine methane seep sediments beal et al 2009 afterwards in situ evidence and laboratory incubations quantitively confirmed the significance of iron dependent aom egger et al 2015 sivan et al 2011 further freshwater enrichment identified an archaeon dominating the community it belonged to the order methanosarcinales and was related to candidatus m nitroreducens ettwig et al 2016 genomes of this lineage encoded genes for aom and multi heme cytochromes capable of extracellular electron transfer implying that the archaea could couple aom to iron oxide reduction independently long term incubations successfully enriched several novel members of methanoperedenaceae namely candidatus methanoperedens ferrireducens candidatus methanoperedens manganicus and candidatus methanoperedens manganireducens which dominated the microbial community fed with methane and fe iii oxide ferrihydrite or mn iv oxides birnessite cai et al 2018b leu et al 2020a isotopic experiments detailed metagenomics and metatranscriptomics collectively suggested that they oxidized methane anaerobically through a reverse methanogenesis pathway like anme in sulfate dependent aom and transferred electrons directly to extracellular insoluble electron acceptors for their reductions via multi heme c type cytochromes with no help of bacterial partners fig 2 2 2 4 other forms of anaerobic methane oxidation in addition to the primary electron acceptors discussed above a large variety of oxidized substances have been demonstrated to mediate aom including selenate chromate antimonate biochar and organics fu et al 2019 lai et al 2018b lu et al 2016 luo et al 2018b luo et al 2019 valenzuela et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 after incubation with these electron acceptors the community was usually dominated by general methanotrophic or methanogenic archaea e g methanoperedenaceae and methanosarcina implying that either these archaea could conduct aom providing electrons for the co existing bacteria or they have metabolic versatility to reduce the oxidized substances mentioned above for example acquiring relevant genes through lateral gene transfer leu et al 2020b this may suggest that methane oxidizing consortia could couple aom to the reduction of a wider range of organic or inorganic matter than previously expected as long as the reactions generate free energy 3 using methane as an electron donor to remove oxidized contaminants compared to traditional organic carbon sources e g acetate and ethanol methane is a relatively cheap electron donor that also is available in situ in wwtps meulepas et al 2010 any residual methane also is readily to avoid secondary pollution in the treated effluent cai et al 2018a recent findings have demonstrated that aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane can couple to the reduction of diverse oxidized contaminants in microaerophilic conditions aerobic methanotrophs can first oxidize methane into formaldehyde using mmo and mdh then synthesize organic matter such as acetate succinate lactate and citrate via the fermentation pathway gilman et al 2017 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 these intermediates further fuel coexisting heterotrophs that reduce diverse oxidized contaminants including nitrate costa et al 2000 in anoxic conditions anaerobic methanotrophs also can oxidize methane to co2 or short chain fatty acids via the reverse methanogenesis pathway then transfer electrons or these intermediates for the subsequent oxide reduction cai et al 2019 chen et al 2019 such as nitrate and chromate haroon et al 2013 lu et al 2016 these versatile couplings suggest that methane oxidation can be efficiently applied not only in natural environments but also in wwtps for removing a wide range of oxidized contaminants though a range of pollutants can be reduced by methane oxidation in nature including nitrate nitrite deutzmann et al 2014 iron manganese beal et al 2009 and arsenate shi et al 2020a this review focuses on the removal of oxidized contaminants in wwtps using methane as the electron donor as follows 3 1 nitrogen removal driven by methane nitrogen removal is one of the most critical functions of a wwtp because of its potential risk causing the eutrophication of natural water bodies mccarty 2018 conventional biological nitrogen removal via nitrification and denitrification have downsides guo et al 2013 for instance the high costs for aeration organic carbon consumption and sludge disposal thus alternative technologies using novel microbial processes will be welcome when they overcome the downsides using methane to replace conventional organic donors e g acetate and methanol is promising to reduce the overall costs for wastewater treatment because of the lower cost of ch4 and its in situ availability from anaerobic digestion in wwtps cogert et al 2019 methane driven nitrogen removal can be achieved through two routes illustrated in fig 3 namely aerobic methane oxidation coupled with denitrification ame d and the nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo 3 1 1 applications of aerobic methane oxidation coupling with denitrification two mechanisms are proposed for ame d the first pathway involves collaboration between aerobic methanotrophs and heterotrophic denitrifiers in which the former converts methane into biodegradable organic metabolites e g acetate methanol citrate and formate while the latter drives denitrification by using these carbon sources fig 3a this form of microbial cooperation is presumed to be the major pathway in many ame d systems chen et al 2020 costa et al 2000 liu et al 2014 waki et al 2005 werner and kayser 1991 in which nitrogen removal rates as high as 0 7 kg n m3 d were achieved the second pathway is based on the discovery of denitrification genes in some aerobic methanotrophs e g methylomonas denitrificans fjg1 methylacidiphilum fumariolium solv methylacidiphilum infernorum v4 khadem et al 2012 kits et al 2015 stein and klotz 2011 they can potentially perform nitrogen removal independently fig 3b however no aerobic methanotroph is yet known to have the complete set of genes for denitrification in fact n2o rather than n2 is usually observed as the terminal product for partial denitrification conducted by aerobic methanotrophs khadem et al 2012 kits et al 2015 stein and klotz 2011 as evidenced by the high n2o emission from landfill cover and rice paddy soils containing diverse aerobic methanotrophs lee et al 2009 mandernack et al 2000 up to date nitrogen removal based on ame d process is restricted to laboratory research among all the approach how to control the methane conversion to organic metabolites rather than co2 is essential for the success of ame d oxygen limiting condition seems to be favorable for such conversion chen et al 2019 chen et al 2018 costa et al 2000 liu et al 2014 thalasso et al 1997 waki et al 2005 werner and kayser 1991 but a clearly defined strategy to control this process is absent if aeration is more than the required amount methane will be oxidized to co2 straightway leading to unsatisfactory denitrification if aeration is less than the required amount insufficient organic metabolites will be produced which will result in similarly poor denitrification thus it is necessary to match the production of organic metabolites to the required amount for denitrification to avoid poor denitrification or residual organics in the effluent a well controlled oxygen supply platform is important for the ame d process in recent studies bubble free oxygen supply from hollow fibers has been widely used as an effective method to increase the oxygen transfer efficiency and to reduce the stripping of other dissolved gases bunse et al 2020 gong et al 2007 this seems to perfectly match the requirement of ame d process further studies are needed to investigate the feasibility of achieving ame d process by using hollow fibers to precisely regulate the oxygen supply 3 1 2 applications of nitrate nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation due to the unique metabolic properties n damo provides a feasible means to use ch4 as the electron donor to drive nitrite and nitrate removals directly compared to the ame d the n damo process has several advantages such as no aeration consumption and less sludge production more importantly methane is directly used to remove nitrogen in anaerobic condition which makes the operation of n damo process much easier than ame d process the potential application and significance of n damo process in wwtps have been depicted previously cogert et al 2019 liu et al 2019a van kessel et al 2018 wang et al 2017 however no larger scale trial than laboratory demonstration has been performed yet which warrants more future studies at laboratory scale several studies have applied n damo processes to remove nitrogen from various wastewater streams which is usually achieved in collaboration with anammox fig 3c liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020c luo et al 2018a lim et al 2021 the anammox process is known to reduce the requirement for external carbon source lessen the aeration demand and sludge production kartal et al 2010 however the stability of partial nitritation is still a challenge for domestic sewage due to the hard to control growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob pérez et al 2014 and a varying nitrite to ammonium ratio strous et al 1998 the problems could be addressed by the cooperative nature of anammox and n damo microorganisms specifically n damo bacteria could remove any extra nitrite if the nitrite to ammonium ratio in wastewater is higher than the 1 32 g nh4 n no2 n ratio needed by anammox while the n damo archaea could polish effluent quality by removing any nitrate generated by anammox bacteria or from the unstable partial nitritation recently a novel technology coupling anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea was proven effective in removing nitrogen from synthetic high and low strength wastewaters liu et al 2019b liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020d xie et al 2018a as well as from actual mainstream and sidestream wastewater lim et al 2021 these results support the versatility and applicability of using an n damo process to remove nitrogen in practice due to the microbial cooperation and over capacity developed in this new technology stable nitrogen removal was maintained despite dynamic nitrogen composition xie et al 2018a or temperature as low as 10 c liu et al 2020b notably although the overall mass balance was conducted in most of these studies to show the contribution of each functional group isotope experiment with labelled nitrogen is expected to generate more in depth understanding of the cooperation between anammox and n damo microorganisms the applications of n damo have been mainly achieved in a few bioreactor configurations including the membrane biofilm reactor mbfr lim et al 2021 liu et al 2020b xie et al 2018a membrane bioreactor mbr allegue et al 2018 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb fan et al 2019 liu et al 2021 and biotrickling filters btf fan et al 2020 lopez et al 2017 however the type of biomass aggregation was completely different in these reactors biofilms in mbfr and btf suspended flocs in mbr and granules in uasb despite the differences a universal feature for these three configurations was the ability to sustain biomass with significantly prolonged solids retention time srt which is necessary for the slow growing anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea how to deliver methane effectively is another question requiring in depth consideration in the reactor design while the methane in mbr is provided via a conventional bubble diffuser hollow fiber membranes were used in mbfr and uasb systems fan et al 2019 liu et al 2020a hollow fibers allow methane to transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase without the formation of bubbles leading to significantly reduced methane dissipation 3 2 removal of other oxidized contaminants by using methane as electron donor 3 2 1 properties fate risks and regulation of typical oxidized contaminants in addition to nitrogen pollutants nitrate and nitrite perchlorate selenate chromate antimonate bromate and vanadate are also oxidized contaminants in water due to natural sources and anthropogenic activities their features are summarized in table 2 because of their existence in the earth s crust some metal loid s can be released from rocks and minerals thus polluting groundwater and surface water for example agricultural drainage could contain abundant se oxyanions derived from high se soils and damage the ecological health zhang and frankenberger 2003 manufacturing is another important source since these substances are widely used in industrial production although concentrations of these contaminants are usually lower than 1 mg l they can still induce acute toxicity to human beings including enzyme disruption skin erosion and even death table 2 their concentrations are strictly limited in drinking water which demands effective removal technologies compared to the oxidized species typically found in contaminated waters the reduced forms always have lower solubility toxicity and mobility since the reduced forms readily precipitate adsorb or volatilize table 2 in some cases the reduced forms are valuable such as antimony trioxide and elemental selenium with respect to the biological reduction the enzymes responsible for the oxides reduction generally belong to the molybdenum dependent dimethyl sulfoxide reductase dmsor family e g the respiratory and periplasmic nitrate reductases nar nap perchlorate reductase pcr selenate reductase ser and antimonate reductase sbr shown in fig 4 a shi et al 2019b notably some of these reductases are versatile and can mediate different reduction of various electron acceptors for example nitrate reductase is capable of performing perchlorate and selenate reductions suggesting the feasibility to reduce multiple oxidized contaminants simultaneously the active microorganisms responsible for the removal of oxidized contaminants are distributed in several phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria deferribacteres chrysiogenete firmicutes and crenarchaeota notably some genera show the versatility in reducing various oxidized contaminants mentioned above which is illustrated in fig 4b for example the genus shewanella has been demonstrated to reduce a series of oxides including nitrate selenate chromate and vanadate guha et al 2001 kenward et al 2006 myers et al 2004 yoon et al 2015 this may attribute to either multiple reductases harbored or one enzyme capable of utilizing diverse substrates overall the metabolic flexibility of close phylotypes further support the potential application of using methane as the electron donor to co remove complex pollutions in practice 3 2 2 removal of single oxidized contaminant 3 2 2 1 reduction of oxidized contaminants to nontoxic products in general the reduction of oxidized contaminants produces nontoxic products or generates reduced products precipitate easily this is illustrated in fig 5 complete perchlorate reduction to innocuous chloride ion was successfully achieved by using methane as the sole electron donor in mbfrs luo et al 2015 wu et al 2019 xie et al 2018b the reduction process was mediated by methane oxidizing and perchlorate reducing consortia of which the community structure mainly depended on the oxygen level in anoxic conditions biological dismutation of chlorite generated o2 for aerobic methanotrophs dominating the community and oxidizing methane luo et al 2015 wu et al 2019 xie et al 2018b in oxygen limiting conditions methanogens e g methanosarcina seemed to play an important role in converting methane into volatile fatty acids that were then utilized by dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria lv et al 2019 wu et al 2019 successful achievements of methane oxidation coupled to perchlorate reduction under various oxygen regimes shed light on the promising application to different types of perchlorate laden wastewaters for pollution removal similarly bromate could also be reduced along with methane oxidation at different oxygen levels lai et al 2018c luo et al 2017 methane was first oxidized into volatile fatty acids by methanosarcina in oxygen limiting conditions lai et al 2018c luo et al 2017 these intermediate organic matters were subsequently utilized for the bromate reduction to nontoxic bromide ion 3 2 2 2 reduction of oxidized contaminants to easily precipitated products microbial reduction of chromate selenate antimonate and vanadate can be applied to recover valuable materials as their reduction products easily precipitate chromite antimonite and vanadite precipitate as hydr oxides and elemental selenium is insoluble in methane based mbfrs a synergy of methanotrophs and other bacteria e g heterotrophic denitrifiers efficiently reduced the oxyanions to corresponding precipitated products therefore removing the water contaminations lai et al 2018a lai et al 2018b lai et al 2016a lai et al 2016b long et al 2017 lu et al 2016 luo et al 2018b luo et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 methanotrophs played a crucial role when inoculated with n damo consortia candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus methylomirabilis appeared to perform either aom coupled to the reduction of selenate and chromate independently lu et al 2016 luo et al 2018b luo et al 2019 or transfer short chain fatty acids to coexisting unknown oxide reducers synergistically cai et al 2019 chen et al 2019 alternatively when oxygen became available type i and ii methanotrophic bacteria were likely responsible for methane oxidation and provided organic intermediates for the reduction of chromate selenate and vanadate lai et al 2018a lai et al 2016a lai et al 2016b long et al 2017 in addition community analyses implied a role of methanogens e g methanosarcina in reducing various oxyanions including chromate selenate vanadate antimonate and iron oxide bar or et al 2017 dong et al 2019 lai et al 2018b shi et al 2020c wang et al 2019 though the physiological mechanism involved in these processes is still unclear the evident removal and precipitation of soluble oxides indicates the feasibility and applicability of using methane to remediate water environments polluted by different oxidized contaminants the precipitates often accumulated within the biofilm matrix which might have bad or good effects on one hand the tightly bound particles could restrict substrate diffusion from outer liquid to inner biofilm thus decreasing reduction rate of oxidized compounds such effect has been demonstrated where the nanoscale products intensively attached on cell surface and impeded the further transfer and utilization of substrates shi et al 2019a on the other hand these precipitates provide an opportunity to recover and recycle the valuable materials illustrated by multiple characterization techniques microbial induced precipitates are generally at nanoscale these materials are usually consistent with synthesized commercial products and have excellent properties needed by industrial manufacturing such as biogenic antimony oxide and elemental selenium and tellurium lai et al 2018b lai et al 2016a shi et al 2019a importantly the reduction products always precipitated outside cells fig 5 which means that they can be recovered as part of wasted biomass without the requirement of additional process to release the products from inside the cells lu et al 2016 luo et al 2018b luo et al 2019 harvesting inorganic solids from the microbial biomass could be further accomplished by a number of methods including ultrasonication wet heat sterilization and liquid liquid phases extraction fesharaki et al 2010 oremland et al 2004 shakibaie et al 2010 3 2 3 impacts of co occurring contaminants on simultaneous removal 3 2 3 1 impacts of nitrate on simultaneous contaminant removal the co occurrence of diverse pollutants increase risks for human and ecosystem health barber et al 2013 and simultaneous removal of multiple contaminants is advantageous nitrate is a good example of co occurring oxidized contaminants e g along with selenate in mining impacted wastewater tan et al 2016 and with perchlorate in groundwater ziv el and rittmann 2009 the presence of nitrate may pose stimulatory or inhibitory effects on reduction of other oxidized contaminants as shown in fig 6 the effect of nitrate depends on the other co existing electron acceptors and the electron donor supply rate as a preferential electron acceptor of high redox potential nitrate could always be reduced in prior to other oxidized contaminants co existing nitrate could have dual effect i for oxyanions that require the same enzymes such as perchlorate bromate and selenate the co occurrence of nitrate could inhibit their reduction via competing for electron donors or active enzyme sites although the presence of more biomass could enhance removals once nitrate is consumed lai et al 2016a lai et al 2018c lv et al 2020 ii for oxyanions that require different microorganisms for instance for chromate nitrate could irreversibly inhibit their reduction because of excluding the key microorganisms from the microbial community zhong et al 2017 3 2 3 2 impacts of sulfate on simultaneous contaminant removal although sulfate is usually not considered as a contaminant its existence will affect removal performance of other oxidized contaminants lv et al 2018 shi et al 2020b for oxyanions that require molybdenum mo dependent enzymes such as perchlorate and selenate sulfate could inhibit their reductions through competition for molybdate this negative effect could be alleviated by the pre treatment to remove sulfate supplementing molybdenum or suppressing sulfate reduction shi et al 2020b for oxyanions with no enzyme competition like chromate sulfate may affect their reductions by forcing the other reducers out of the microbial community for example sulfate applied at 6 7 mg s l dramatically decreased the relative abundance of chromate reducing meiothermus lv et al 2018 as a consequence chromate removal decreased from 90 to 45 with the addition of sulfate however these negative effects induced by sulfate were not fatal as selenate and chromate still could be reduced to some extent shi et al 2020b besides when the sulfate was removed the chromate reducing bacteria and chromate removal efficiency recovered lv et al 2018 3 3 how to break barriers to apply methane to remove various contaminants although methane can replace traditional organic donors for driving reduction of oxidized contaminants several barriers should be overcome firstly the transfer efficiency of gaseous methane must be high given that methane has a low solubility of 25 mg l at 25 c and is a potent greenhouse gas the mbfr addresses this barrier perfectly because it delivers methane from the lumen directly to the biofilm attached on the membrane surface using the mbfr the utilization efficiency of methane was at least 90 cai et al 2018a the second barrier for practical application at wwtps is utilizing ch4 from biogas which has around 35 ch4 and 65 co2 as well as trace amount of h2s rasi et al 2011 on the one hand a significant flux of co2 may cause acidification liu et al 2020d which is inhibitory jin et al 2013 on the other hand the ch4 transfer rate will be slowed by its dilution with the other gases alkali dosing and intermittent n2 flushing can alleviate the induced acidification caused by input of co2 liu et al 2020d in addition reduction processes like denitrification can consume protons thus counteracting the co2 derived acidification although no study has verified the feasibility of using in situ biogas to reduce oxidized contaminants the biogas generated from wwtps indeed has been successfully used to treat ammonium laden reject water by the assimilation of methanotrophs kim et al 2020 this achievement suggests that methanotrophs are very likely able to tolerate potential adverse impacts by using biogas moreover it also is a challenge to enrich microbial consortia for methane oxidation and oxidized contaminant reduction especially for anaerobic methanotrophs which have a long doubling time of more than 10 days girguis et al 2005 nauhaus et al 2007 in order to speed up the enrichment of these slow growing microorganisms previous studies have employed novel reactor configurations and optimizing operational conditions taking n damo microorganisms as an example the cultivation and enrichment period has dramatically decreased in the last decade from more than years initially raghoebarsing et al 2006 to a few months allegue et al 2018 liu et al 2021 accordingly nitrogen removal has been remarkably elevated to practically useful rates in mbfrs cai et al 2015 and the versatile applications of n damo process in real wastewater treatment also has been demonstrated lim et al 2021 thus it seems likely capable microbial consortia can be enriched to remove other oxidized contaminants e g perchlorate and selenate via methane oxidation 4 opportunities and unsolved questions although methane oxidation has been investigated intensively in recent years many issues in terms of both biological mechanisms and practical applications are still elusive moreover the rapid development of emerging tools e g meta omics approaches well challenges the canonical theory and substantially improve our understanding of microbial methane oxidation by incorporating the up to date findings the present review renovates the fundamentals and highlights the urgent perspectives in the field of methane based bioreduction processes solving these questions will not only deepen our comprehension of these processes but also guide us to better use methane for bioremediation of various contaminants we close with some unsolved questions that we can begin answering today 1 it is still unclear which anaerobic methane oxidizing members mediate bioreduction processes for perchlorate bromate selenate chromate antimonate and vanadate 2 while some interactions between co existing oxyanions present in relatively high concentrations e g nitrate and sulfate and lower concentration oxidized contaminants e g perchlorate bromate selenate and chromate have been reported lv et al 2020 shi et al 2020b studies are required to reveal the positive and negative interactions as well as strategies to mitigate negative effects to achieve simultaneous removals 3 biological methane oxidation coupled to oxyanion reduction can generate potentially valuable products e g se0 and sb2o3 precipitated in biofilms means to separate the valuable products are unexplored 4 to date all the studies using methane oxidation to remove contaminants were conducted in lab scale systems future studies need to overcome scale up obstacles that might preclude high
