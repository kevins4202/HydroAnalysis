20900,the determination of the appropriate operational profile of a ship through the adjustment of its sailing speed can potentially present a fruitful prospect in the effort towards the maximization of energy resources exploitation in commercial ships the dependency of fuel consumption on speed always in inseparable conjunction with the ever changing weather conditions prevailing over any specified route leads to the formulation of a from mathematical point of view not well defined problem when practical considerations regarding the capabilities of currently available weather forecast services are taken into account in the present work a method for the dynamic determination of optimal ship speed in a fixed route is proposed within this method the problem of deteriorating accuracy of weather predictions for relatively long time periods is addressed with the segmentation of the route s total time horizon in smaller time periods in order for solvable and meaningful optimization problems to be formulated the interdependency between the individual sub problems is established and examined with the definition of appropriate method parameters which are representative of the most important time scales of the engineering problem at hand the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with the application on an actual container ship route keywords ship speed optimization dynamic optimization time horizon segmentation weather conditions fuel consumption 1 introduction maritime transport has always been a major part of international commercial transportation as it constitutes a highly cost effective option of transferring large volumes of cargo between continents however in recent years depressed markets increasing fuel prices low fares and new regulations regarding pollutants and greenhouse gases emissions from ships have emphasized the need for optimizing the energy efficiency of ships especially in the light of minimizing fuel consumption important research work in order to address this problem is ongoing in the field of hydrodynamics and specifically on the optimization of hull shape design diez et al 2018 with the goal of minimizing propulsion resistance and thus fuel consumption furthermore a large part of the research work nowadays is concerned with the design of propulsion machines with higher efficiency and consequently lower consumption however several alternative and interesting approaches to the problem also exist one of them which has been gaining increasingly more attention concerns optimizing the cruising speed of the ship during voyage by taking into account the prevailing weather conditions historically the concept of optimizing the operational profile of a ship while taking into consideration the weather conditions initially appears in studies related to the broader topic of searching for the optimal route the ship must follow in its early form weather routing szlapczynska and smierzchalski 2008 takashima et al 2009 vlachos 2004 mainly tackles the problem of finding the shortest route between two ports while taking into account the weather conditions only in the light of the simultaneous avoidance of areas of adverse weather the concept of ship speed optimization i e the voluntary change of ship speed as a function of weather conditions during the voyage in order to minimize consumption in the context of routing or weather routing appears in the literature mainly in the last decade a very comprehensive description of the aspects behind the idea of ship speed optimization is given in psaraftis and kontovas 2014 and the most important parameters of the problem are presented the problem of concurrently optimizing the speed for specific parts of a route in order to minimize fuel consumption is posed in shao et al 2011 mathematically the problem is stated as a dynamic programming problem and is solved using a suitable method three dimensional forward dynamic programming method lin et al 2013 formulate and solve a similar problem in which the simultaneous minimization of arrival time and fuel consumption is requested the problem is formulated as a multistage problem and a specially designed three dimensional modified isochrone method is used to solve it another case where this problem is formulated as a multi stage problem can be found in the study of zaccone et al 2018 weather is modeled through appropriate weather forecast maps and fuel consumption minimization is set as the objective function while the problem is solved via dynamic programming methods an interesting work in the same context can be found in lee et al 2018b where the problem is solved using genetic algorithms an important aspect of this last study is that the modeling of the ship and the weather conditions is done at a somewhat more detailed level of course ship speed optimization problems can also be found in studies beyond the general category of weather routing in wang and meng 2012 the simultaneous optimization of the speed of multiple container vessels of a regular line network is studied in order to minimize the total operational cost the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem wang and hu 2015 in their study examine the optimization of a ship s speed for minimizing carbon emissions while different tax scenarios are considered in their study kim et al 2016 aim to the minimization of fuel consumption while considering variable arrival times at ports the problem is posed as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and a special tree search algorithm is developed to solve it a similar case of minimizing fuel consumption under the uncertainty regime of arrival and stay times in ports use of stochastic variables is considered in aydin et al 2017 where the problem is posed as a dynamic programming problem all aforementioned publications present some very interesting approaches of the more general problem of ship speed optimization but albeit the consideration of the continuously changing weather conditions from route to route is not explicitly taken into account research on the problem of speed optimization taking into account the weather conditions and defining the problem by excluding options of re routing the ship s voyage can be found in relatively recent publications norlund and gribkovsakaia 2017 formulate a ship speed optimization problem in order to simultaneously minimize fuel consumption and emissions on supply vessels the effect of weather conditions on the ship speed is modeled through its effect in cruising time while generic models for calculating resistance propulsion and therefore consumption are used the subject of uncertainty of weather conditions and its effect on the determination of optimal speed is also studied in wang et al 2018 dynamic weather conditions are considered and the problem is formulated in the context of dynamic optimization for the solution of the problem a model predictive control method is adopted and detailed non linear models from the literature are used to model the ship performance an appropriate ship performance indicator is selected as the minimization criterion in lee et al 2018a historical weather data for a given route are utilized and processed through data mining methods in order to construct a model for correlating weather conditions and consumption then the problem of speed optimization is posed for simultaneous minimization of consumption and maximization of the sla service level agreement and is solved with an appropriate particle swarm optimization algorithm in the work of li et al 2018 appropriate models are developed for correlating the weather conditions to the ship speed reduction and speed optimization is performed in order to minimize consumption on a given route while simultaneously maximizing profit the use of big data analytics methods over a given route weather data in order to construct appropriate models for describing the energy efficiency of a ship is presented in yan et al 2018 then a suitable particle swarm optimization algorithm is used in order to find the optimal speed profile that minimizes consumption on a given trip the majority of these relatively recent publications demonstrates the importance of using real time weather data combined with accurate models for the ship fuel consumption in order to predict the optimal ship speed operational profile in addition the optimization problem is properly grounded as a nonlinear programming problem and the benefits of speed optimization in reducing fuel consumption and emissions are demonstrated however the issue of uncertainty introduced in the prediction forecast of future weather conditions especially for long trips is not discussed in the current work the ship speed optimization problem for fuel consumption minimization is mathematically formulated as a dynamic optimization problem while the weather profile is input to the problem in the form of consecutive weather forecasts throughout a predefined route under this scope a special method that attempts to tackle with the inherent uncertainty in the weather conditions forecasts is developed and applied in the next two sections the description and mathematical formulation of the problem as a dynamic optimization problem are given in section 4 the specially developed method for tackling the uncertainty of the weather forecasts is presented in sections 5 and 6 the system modeling and general solution procedure are discussed finally the method is applied on a real case scenario and the results are presented and discussed in section 7 2 description of the dynamic optimization problem the engineering problem of ship speed optimization addressed in the present study can be stated by posing the following question what is the optimal propulsion power profile or equivalently what is the optimal speed profile that a ship must follow along a specified route and under variable weather conditions in order for the fuel consumption to be minimized while satisfying certain constraints an important additional consideration regarding any attempt to specify the optimal speed over a specified commercial ship route should in any case be the requirement that the ship must reach to the destination ports in predetermined and quite tight times of arrival the practical applicability of any ship speed optimization method to be developed should be evaluated in conjunction with the ability of the last to ensure that these time limitations are satisfied having these in mind in order for the speed optimization problem to be mathematically well posed the following are required i the route that the ship will follow when traveling between two ports e g from port a to port b must be predetermined and known ii the estimated time of departure etd from port a and the estimated time of arrival eta to port b must be predetermined and known iii all ship characteristics e g ship dimensions and characteristic coefficients characteristics of ship engine s shaft and propeller characteristics etc that are required in order to develop the appropriate fuel consumption models must be known iv the weather conditions along the route must be known a priori and used as inputs in the optimization procedure since in the current work the assumption is made that the weather can be predicted with sufficient accuracy at least for a very short time horizon the problem described above is an inherently dynamic optimization problem since the weather conditions that the ship encounters during her voyage are in general functions of time thus time dependency is unavoidably inserted in all variables of the problem such as speed ship resistance and required propulsive power from the engine s of course it must be clarified that time dependency alone is not sufficient to characterize an optimization problem as dynamic the important characteristic that discriminates the specific problem at hand as a dynamic one is the issue of interdependency between time intervals the fact that the route is specified and that the ship must conclude the trip in a pre specified time horizon introduces such interdependency as it dictates that the optimal speed in each and every interval depends on the weather conditions of both the current interval and of every other interval it is true that no matter how accurately the models utilized can calculate the ship resistance or no matter how efficiently the optimization method solves the problem the reliability of the final optimal solution is dependent on the accuracy of the weather prediction ideally if the weather is known with absolute accuracy during the whole time horizon of the trip the underlying dynamic optimization problem can be solved with utmost precision deriving the ultimately optimal solution however due to the fact that the time period during which the weather forecast can be considered accurate up to an acceptable for engineering purposes degree is several times shorter than the travel duration of a typical commercial trip any attempt to solve the full time horizon problem will unavoidably yield questionable results for this reason a specialized method with the formulation of successive interdependent dynamic optimization problems the combined solutions of which approximate the solution of the full time horizon problem has been developed and applied the concept behind this time segmentation is the development of a formal way for determining the optimal ship navigation speed in each instance of time by solving each time an optimization problem of limited time horizon during which the important parameters related to the weather conditions can be considered as accurate so the formulation is mathematically well posed the details of this method are presented in section 4 the mathematical formulation of the general full time horizon dynamic optimization problem is given in the next section 3 mathematical statement of the full time horizon dynamic optimization problem the optimization problem at hand can be generally classified as a dynamic optimization problem bryson 1999 bryson and ho 1969 kirk 1998 and is mathematically stated as a minimization problem using a differential algebraic equation dae formulation allgor and barton 1997 biegler 2010 biegler and grossman 2004 the ship travels between ports a and b and one control variable is optimized the speed of the ship v the final time or time of arrival t f is known a priori and the goal of optimization is the minimization of the fuel consumption m f the objective function can be mathematically stated using a boltza form by the following equation 1 min v m f t 0 t f b f w b v d t where m f fuel consumption t 0 initial time t f final travel time or travel duration b f specific fuel oil consumption sfoc of the engine w b brake power of the engine the specific fuel oil consumption sfoc is in general amongst other things a function of brake power or equivalently of the engine load factor 2 b f b f w b or b f b f f l while the engine load factor f l is defined as follows 3 f l w b m c r with mcr the maximum continuous rating of the engine more details regarding the main diesel engine modeling are given in section 5 since the ship will be sailing through sea water with a certain speed it will experience resistance which is in general a sum of several resistance components and dependent on several factors in this text the total resistance is denoted as r t and will be in general a function of the ship speed the weather conditions and the hydrodynamic characteristics and dimensions of the ship 4 r t r t p v w s where p vector that denotes time independent characteristics of the ship and the hull w s weather state weather conditions considering the weather state conditions it is generally stated by the following equation 5 w s u w i n d ψ w i n d h s θ w a v e s where u w i n d wind speed ψ w i n d wind direction h s significant wave height defined as the mean wave height trough to crest of the highest third of the waves θ w a v e s wave direction these four variables which essentially represent the weather prediction are given as functions of time along the trip 6 u w i n d u w i n d t ψ w i n d ψ w i n d t h s h s t θ w a v e s θ w a v e s t the corresponding effective power or towing power w e necessary to move the ship through the water i e to tow the ship hull at the speed v in absence of propulsive power is given as 7 w e r t v w s p v while the resulting required engine brake power is related to the ship resistance and speed using the equation 8 w b w e η p r o p v r t v w s p η p r o p v p q where η p r o p total propulsive efficiency q vector that denotes time independent propeller and shaft characteristics the models applied in order to calculate ship resistance and propulsion propulsive efficiency as well as the performance of the diesel engine s are presented in section 5 furthermore the distance travelled d the time elapsed and the ship speed are inter connected by the equation 9 d t t 0 t v d t in order to conclude the mathematical statement of the problem the necessary variable boundaries as well as the initial points and end points if they exist of the differential variables must be included the ship speed must lie the interval 10 v min v v max where v min and v max are the lower and upper bounds of the speed furthermore it is important to ensure that the engine will operate inside the load limits specified by the manufacturer 11 f l min f l f l max also for the two differential variables distance travelled and fuel consumption the initial points are known 12 d 0 0 m f 0 0 while an endpoint constraint must be defined for the distance travelled as follows 13 d t f t 0 t f v d t d α β with d α β is the total distance between ports a and b which ensures that the ship has reached port β in the predefined time of arrival finally there may be need of additional constraints and variable bounds but they are not included here for brevity in the present section it is seen that the variation of the optimal ship speed over a route can be mathematically uniquely determined in a strict manner but this would be possible in practice only if the underlying weather conditions were defined with high accuracy over the whole time period spanning from the beginning of the navigation t 0 to the final time t f as this is not possible in the present study a segmentation of the full time horizon is attempted for tackling the problem of the unavailability of valid weather predictions over the whole time span of the navigation 4 formulation of successive optimization problems by segmentation of the time horizon of the trip the weather forecasts have nowadays attained sufficient prediction accuracy and resolution of predicted values for most of the quantities of interest for the purposes of the present work however the accuracy and the validity of the predictions naturally tend to degenerate as the prediction spans to longer time periods in general the predictions are considered to be accurate enough for a rather short time horizon or trust region i e about two days this poses a difficulty in the determination of the optimum speed profile in a trip between two ports that lasts for several days as is the case in the majority of the merchant ships routes because the weather conditions must be predetermined in order for the dynamic optimization problem to be solved in other words the full time horizon dynamic optimization problem cannot be practically solved with satisfying accuracy in the beginning of the route since the more long term a weather prediction is the less accurate it will be to overcome this problem a specialized ad hoc procedure has been developed fig 1 the key idea behind the procedure lies in the approximation of the initial full time horizon dynamic optimization problem by the solutions of several successive dynamic optimization problems each spanning over a limited duration time horizon and equal to the trust region of the weather prediction the description of this procedure is given in the present section the ship departs from port a at time t t 0 and needs to arrive at port b according to the schedule at time t t f two time discretization steps are used i dt v which is the duration of the intervals that during each of them the ship sails with constant ship speed speed which is to be determined by the solution of the optimization problem ii dt w which is the time resolution of the weather forecasts it is noted that between the forecasts the values of the predicted weather conditions are assumed to be varying linearly with time two parameters n a and n b are required for establishing the interrelation between the individual successive optimization problems to be solved both quantities are tunable parameters of the solution procedure the first parameter denoted as n a is defined as the number of dt v intervals that are used for determining the time horizon for which the weather data provided are considered to be accurate up to an acceptable degree weather trust region for this time horizon an individual dynamic speed optimization sub problem can be solved with satisfying accuracy for example with weather data assumed as accurate for the next 48 h and dt v equal to 6 h n a is calculated as equal to 8 and the time horizon of each individual optimization problem will be n a d t v 48 hours once such an individual speed optimization problem is solved the optimal solution found for the ship speed is not to be applied for the whole n a d t v time horizon but instead is applied for n b d t v intervals where n b is the second parameter used for the interrelation of the successive optimization problems the n b parameter is to be lower than n a for example if n b 4 in the previous example where n a 8 an optimization problem is solved for a 48 h horizon but the optimal speed profile found is applied only in the first n b d t v 24 hours at the end of the n b d t v period the next dynamic optimization sub problem of time horizon n a d t v is defined with its initial time having been shifted by n b d t v hours and with the weather prediction within the accuracy trust region having also been updated and extended by n b d t v hours the same pattern of formulating and solving successive optimization sub problems is applied until the depletion of the time horizon of the full problem t t f and consequently the arrival of the ship at port β the number j max of individual successive optimization problems to be solved is calculated as 14 j m a x c e i l t f t 0 n b d t v n a n b 1 where t 0 time of departure from port a t f required time of arrival at port b ceil function representing rounding to the closer upper integer value for each individual optimization problem j the target distance d f j that has to be reached measuring from the initial port a is calculated as 15 d f j d 0 j d f d 0 j t f t 0 j n a d t v d 0 j v s h i p m e a n j n a d t v where d f total distance between ports a and b d 0 j distance already travelled at the beginning of optimization problem j t 0 j initial time at the beginning of optimization problem j in eq 15 the fraction term 16 v s h i p m e a n j d f d 0 j t f t 0 j is merely the mean speed that would be required for covering the total distance remaining to reach to the final destination at the period from t 0 i to eta t t f by defining a target total distance travelled to have been covered at the end of each of the successive optimization problems in the manner described it is ensured that in the overall procedure with the succession of individual sub problems the ship will reach the destination port at the predetermined total time what is obtained by the solution of the sub problem is in effect the deviation over v ship mean j at each instance of time which is collectively compensated by deviations of the opposite sign and appropriate magnitude in other instances lying within the n a dt v time horizon of each sub problem being solved in order for the ship to have arrived at distance d f j while also aiming at the minimization of the fuel consumption as the time passes with the ship coming closer to the final destination and successive optimization problems are being solved the value of v ship mean j is gradually being readjusted and so it is assured the ship arrives at the predetermined eta by applying this method the initially difficult to solve due to uncertainty in the long term prediction of the weather conditions dynamic optimization problem for the total trip horizon is broken apart and approximated by a series of smaller successive interdependent dynamic optimization problems that are easily solvable thus the series of optimal solutions of the successive dynamic sub problems will attempt to approximate the ideal optimal solution of the initial full time horizon dynamic optimization problem details regarding the overall solution procedure and the treatment of the successive dynamic sub problems are given in section 6 in the following section system modeling is discussed 5 system modeling the total resistance of a ship is composed of a number of different components politis 2018 politis and skamnelis 2007 in the present work given the dynamic character of the problem due to the time varying weather conditions the resistance components can be grouped in two main categories the calm water resistance r c a l m and the added resistance r a d d e d 17 r t r c a l m r a d d e d the calm water resistance term holtrop 1984 holtrop and mennen 1982 politis 2018 is generally dependent on the speed of the ship the trim of the ship as well as the characteristics and dimensions of the ship and the hull 18 r c a l m r c a l m v t p where t trim of the ship p vector that denotes time independent characteristics of the ship and the hull the calm water resistance term can be further decomposed to a sum of several terms holtrop and mennen 1982 politis 2018 19 r t r f 1 k 1 r a r w r a p p r b r t r r a a r a w where r f frictional resistance 1 k 1 form factor of the hull r

additional pressure resistance of bulbous bow near the water surface r t r additional pressure resistance of immersed transom stern r a a additional resistance due to the effects of wind added wind resistance r a w additional resistance due to the effects of waves added wave resistance considering the added resistance ittc 2012 politis 2018 it can be broken up to two main terms the added wind resistance r a a and the added wave resistance r a w 20 r a d d e d r a a r a w both those two terms are of great importance in the present study since they essentially model the effect of the time varying weather conditions wind and waves on the total resistance of the ship and consequently in the required propulsive power from the engine s in contrast with the calm water resistance terms which are generally dependent on the ship speed trim and hull characteristics those two terms are additionally dependent on the weather conditions transforming the optimization problem to a dynamic one 21 r a d d e d r a d d e d v t w s p for the calculation of all the terms of the calm water resistance models presented in the literature holtrop 1984 holtrop and mennen 1982 ittc 2012 are utilized the calculation of the added wave resistance term is based on the calculation of mean resistance increase in regular waves induced by wave reflection ittc 1987 2012 tsujimoto et al 2008 and the calculation of the mean resistance increase in regular waves induced by ship motion ittc 2012 maruo 1957 1960 finally the calculation of the added wind resistance is based on a method fujiwara et al 2005 developed by regression upon multiple data sets from model tests in wind tunnels after the calculation of the total resistance its correlation with the required power from the engine in order for the ship to achieve speed v is given by eq 8 the total propulsion efficiency η p r o p is a term generally dependent on ship speed politis 2018 politis and skamnelis 2007 trim and characteristics geometry propeller characteristics shaft efficiencies etc 22 η p r o p η p r o p v t p q the calculation of the propulsive efficiency is performed based on a model from the literature holtrop 1984 holtrop and mennen 1982 ittc 2012 which uses as inputs the ship speed and characteristics geometry hull form as well as other details considering the gear transmission shaft and propeller i e gearing bearings stern tube propeller and open water efficiencies further information regarding the models utilized for the calculation of total ship resistance and propulsion power can be found in tzortzis 2018 as seen in the preceding for the development of the method the weather conditions considered are mainly the wind and sea waves in terms of their magnitudes and directions relative to the ship motion the application of the proposed method in actual practice would require the additional consideration of the effects of certain other external weather conditions such as currents rain fog etc and other ship specific dynamic behavior quantities e g ship motions as well as the effect of additional operational constraints e g constrained ship speed and squat effect on canal and waterways on the total propulsion resistance however the purpose of the present study is not the exhaustive treatise of the several terms affecting the propulsion power and fuel consumption requirements any additional resistance term can be included in more advanced studies without affecting the key concept of the time horizon segmentation designed to tackle the dynamic optimization problem in the current work for the modeling of the diesel engine s de the specific fuel oil consumption sfoc model is constructed based on regression upon data provided from the manufacturer and or the operator of

optimization problem to a nlp problem step c i is presented in section 6 1 next in section 6 2 the metaheuristic optimization algorithm which was used for the solution of the resulting nlp problems step c ii is discussed 6 1 treatment of the dynamic optimization sub problems the available solution approaches for dynamic optimization problems biegler 2010 logsdon and biegler 1989 tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 can be divided in indirect and direct fig 2 indirect approach includes classical analytical methods such as calculus of variations cov pontryagin et al 1962 and dynamic programming dp bellman 2003 which may face serious issues when tackling with optimization problems that include inequality constraints and or many variables curse of dimensionality direct approach constitutes of more modern techniques where the optimization problem is solved by applying a certain level of discretization so that the original dynamic problem is transformed to a static nlp problem which can be solved efficiently with evolutionary and or gradient based optimization algorithms depending on the level of discretization applied they are distinguished between sequential and simultaneous logsdon and biegler 1989 1992 in the sequential methods such as the one used in this work discretization is carried out only in the space of control variables i e independent optimization variables while the values of the state variables i e dependent variables are derived from the integration in each iteration of the system of differential algebraic equations dae that describe the problem biegler 2010 chachuat 2009 edgar and himmelblau 1998 feehery et al 1997 feehery and barton 1998 logsdon and biegler 1989 furthermore in each iteration the values of the objective function and the values of the constraints and possibly the values of the required gradients in the case of gradient based optimization are evaluated these methods are also known as feasible approach methods since the underlying differential equations are solved once per each iteration the control variables can be discretized fig 3 using several schemas chachuat 2009 feehery and barton 1998 feehery et al 1997 depending on the requirements of the problem in general sequential methods can be applied easily with little programming effort and have been proven to be very effective considering accuracy and required computational time feehery and barton 1998 feehery et al 1997 logsdon and biegler 1989 1992 more specifically in the current study for the solution of the successive do sub problems a hybrid sequential method control vector parameterization has been developed and applied where the time horizon is divided in equally spaced intervals for the control variable e g ship speed a piecewise constant representation fig 3 is used step dt v for the weather conditions a parameter of the problem a piecewise linear with continuity discretization scheme fig 3 is applied step dt w which essentially models when the weather conditions are changing something dictated by the weather prediction provider forecast resolution and it may be a rather small time period e g every 1 h the speed discretization interval dt v is used for defining the time period during which the ship speed is kept at a constant value and in practice is defined by the time intervals at the end of which the captain of the ship will re adjust the sailing speed due to the practical limitations imposed by the ship operational requirements and safety the dt v step may be chosen to be much larger than the dt w interval the mathematical statement of the resulting discrete optimization sub problems after application of the sequential method is given next each sub problem j can be stated as follows 26 minimise v v i j m f j i 1 n a t 0

c ii of the overall solution procedure a specialized metaheuristic optimization algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 has been applied details are given in the next section 6 2 particle swarm optimization algorithm the resulting nlp sub problems are solved with the use of an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization pso eberhart et al 1996 parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 for n time intervals each one having duration equal to dt v the independent optimization variables are the ship speed on each interval v k with their number being equal to n 1 since the ship speed in the last interval will be a dependent variable due to the requirement of predetermined total travel time k 1 n 1 a candidate solution contained in particle p among a population of p max particles is represented by the vector x ˆ 32 x ˆ p v 1 p v 2 p v n 1 p p 1 p m a x prior to the application of the optimization algorithm the boundary values for each of the independent optimization variables must be set the lower bound b l vk for each optimization variable v k is set to the constant value of 3 m s approximately 6 knots the upper bound b u vk for k 1 n 1 is set equal to the ship speed for which the prime mover will attain a load factor equal to 1 in any moment during the dt v time interval and is calculated according to the weather predictions provided this was required for not allowing the optimal solution search procedure to move in regions which cannot be applied in practice due to overloading of the prime mover and to facilitate the convergence of the optimization algorithm the initialization of the population is another important factor for the successful application of the optimization algorithm instead of allowing an entirely randomly generated population the mean speed v ship mean is used which is merely defined as the total distance divided by the total time each independent variable v k p for p 1 p max is initialized as 33 v k p v s h i p m e a n b u v k v s h i p m e a n r a n d 0 5 0 5 v s h i p m e a n b u v k b l v k r a n d b u v k b l v k v s h i p m e a n b u v k k 1 n 1 p 1 p m a x with rand being a function representing a uniform random distribution from 0 to 1 in the case where v ship mean b u vk the initial values for variable v k p among the population of p max particles are distributed uniformly around the v ship mean otherwise a typical randomization between the lower and upper bounds is used it was found that this intervention had a very beneficial effect on the convergence of the optimization algorithm and the repeatability of its results according the typical particle swarm optimization algorithm after the initialization the positions of the particles are updated as follows 34 x ˆ p m 1 x ˆ p m u ˆ m 1 u ˆ m 1 θ u ˆ m α

inertia tuning parameter is not constant during the succession of the m iterations but is adjusted from a high value θ 1 towards a lower value θ 2 among the m iterations as 35 θ θ 1 θ 2 m m a x m m m a x θ 2 with m max being the maximum permitted number of iterations the tuning of the algorithms parameters was executed with several trial and error procedures in order for the final solutions obtained to present a virtually absolute repeatability and fast convergence their values are presented in table 1 the maximum number of iterations is not practically reached as the procedure stops when an improvement on the global best objective function is not larger than a very low limit for more than 10 iterations due to the probabilistic nature of the algorithm the convergence is achieved at a different time of iterations on each execution and the value of m max 200 is set to a relatively large value for safety in the development of the pso optimization algorithm one intervention was carried out in order to improve its performance the standard pso algorithm dictates that in each iteration the particles should be attracted towards the global best found g instead of this in the initial iterations the particles at iteration m 1 are attracted towards the g m which is the best candidate solution found among the population at iteration m instead towards g the value of g m is in general suboptimal compared to g but it was observed that this practice largely improves the performance of the optimization algorithm due to the fact that helps the population to retain its divergence which is needed especially in the initial iterations of the algorithm execution in order for avoiding convergence to local optima the appropriate handling of the values of independent variables in cases that they exceed the permissible bounds after the application of the positions update step was found to be another important aspect of the successful application of the optimization algorithm in the case that an independent variable is temporarily given a value exceeding the limits posed by either the lower or upper bound this unacceptable value is overridden and is replaced by another value derived from a stochastic distribution the codomain of which is adapted in each iteration in a manner that the final outcome remains in the permissible range 7 case study for the case study an actual trip of an existing 6900 teu containership was considered the ship departed from port a port of ensenada baja california and arrived to port b negishi bay japan in the span of 295 h 12 3 days the total sailing distance between the two ports was da b 5136 5 nautical miles 9512 9 km the ship has one propeller and one main engine two stroke diesel engine for the modeling of the system the procedures presented in section 5 were applied all necessary information was taken from the ga general arrangement of the ship furthermore data from multiple sea trials as well as real time stored data from onboard sensors were used related data include power mass flow and sfoc measurements of the main engine as well as ambient conditions pressure and temperature also ship itineraries and measurements of ship drafts trim propeller power latitude and longitude of the ship speed over ground speed through water ship course apparent wind speed and direction in 5 10 min intervals some of the most essential characteristics of the container ship are given in table 2 it is clarified that since no actual measured data were available for the wave height and direction the following steps were taken the wave height was correlated with the wind speed utilizing the beaufort scale while the wave direction was set roughly equal to the wind direction thus in order to describe the weather state two parameters were required as inputs the wind speed and direction in fig 4 and fig 5 characteristic curves of the required brake power vs ship speed are given in relation to actual measured data for two different sets of conditions of draft trim wind speed and direction it is observed that the resulting resistance propulsion model for calculating the required propulsion power from the main engine presents satisfying accuracy for the requirements of the current work the main engine a two stroke diesel engine was modeled using data from the manufacturer as well as data from sea trials and shop tests the resulting model and related polynomial coefficients are given in appendix a table a1 some basic characteristics of the main engine can be found in table 3 while a plot of the resulting sfoc calculation vs load percentage for specific ambient conditions can be found in fig 6 in fig 7 the actual measured weather conditions wind speed and direction encountered by the ship during her trip are given additional weather data measured from sensors onboard the ship during the route and input in the models include the air pressure and temperature and the sea temperature however their variations during the trip and consequently their effects are minor thus their profiles are not included here for brevity fig 8 depicts the actual ship speed profile that was followed by the ship during the specific trip in conjunction with the wind speed encountered in order for the effectiveness of the methodology developed to be assessed it is applied at the case of the specific ship and the specified trip characteristics and weather conditions using the wind speed and direction readings from the ship and due to lack of actual successive weather forecast data from the actual trip we suppose that within the trust region of the weather forecast a parameter in the method the predictions of the forecast coincide with the ship measurements of course such an assumption may not always be completely accurate however it is adequate under the scope of testing the effectiveness of the method in successfully approximating the theoretical optimal solution of the full time horizon some of the most important parameters of the problem are summarized in table 4 by setting the parameter dt w equal to 3 h we are assuming that the time discretization of the weather forecast is equal to 3 h equivalently by setting dt v 6 h we accept that the ship will effectively readjust its speed every 6 h effectively any combination of dt v and dt w can be used as input even the case of dt v dt w which states that the ship speed changes concurrently with the weather profile first the optimization problem is solved for the total 295 h horizon as if the exact weather profile is known a priori with accuracy for its solution the same procedure presented in section 6 as for each successive optimization problem is applied but having omitted the total horizon segmentation step step a of course this solution is only theoretical but it will serve as a baseline for the assessment of the method next the problem is solved for several combinations of n a and n b by manipulating n a we essentially change the trust region of the weather prediction in other words given we are at time t we admit that the weather forecast will from then on accurately predict the weather conditions fig 8 that the ship will encounter for the next n a d t v hours correspondingly by manipulating n b we change the solution application region or in other words we change the frequency of when the next weather prediction will be received in order to formulate and solve the next sub problem in table 5 the list of parameter combinations along with their corresponding weather forecast trust and solution application regions is given the total fuel consumption resulting from the solution of each parameter combination is given in table 6 along with the calculated gain in comparison with the actual trip in fig 9 the optimal ship speed profiles derived from several selected parameter combinations along with the actual ship speed are presented the results indicate that for a fixed value of the parameter n a the best value for parameter n b is 1 that is as small as possible this result is logical and expected with a low value of n b the individual optimization sub problems succeed each other with the smallest possible step in this way the weather forecast data input in each of them is updated frequently and manage to efficiently predict the actual weather conditions thus the individual successive problem solutions are able to better approximate the optimal theoretical solution of the full time horizon problem furthermore another important observation is that for greater values of the parameter n a the optimal solutions derived from the method are getting better and better and closer to the optimal theoretical solution of the full time horizon problem again this result is logical since by increasing the parameter n a we essentially increase the trust region of the weather this means that for each successive sub problem the weather data input is considered to be accurate for a longer horizon considering the computational times a trade off is observed for a fixed n b i e n b 1 as n a becomes greater less successive sub problems have to be solved however these sub problems become more and more complicated and harder to converge thus requiring more computations parameter combination 4 when compared with combination 1 nearly doubles the accuracy of the approximation but takes twice as much in terms of computational time to converge the same can be observed when comparing combinations 7 and 4 on the other hand for a fixed n a by increasing n b the number of successive sub problems and thus computational times are decreased but approximation accuracy is sacrificed of course by observing the results of table 6 one could argue that even in the worst case scenarios parameter combinations 1 3 the difference of total consumption of the approximate optimal solution from the optimal theoretical solution of the full time horizon problem is less than 0 2 these quite low differences are positive indications for the practical applicability of the method since the cases presented in parameter combinations 1 3 are essentially expected to be closer to what the application of this method in in real life scenarios would resemble as the weather forecast trust region is expected to be very short finally the most important observation is that with the application of the speed optimization method presented the ship speed profile can be optimized according to the upcoming weather data provided and result to improvements of the overall fuel consumption in the order of 1 86 2 0 the gain in fuel consumption could potentially be considered small but it is certainly not negligible it is worth pursuing this optimization and more so if we take into consideration that the gain is achieved with a nearly zero investment also it has to be noted that the expected improvements will be highly dependent on the form of weather profile and the duration of the trip longer trips and more aggressive weather profiles steep and rapidly changing will lead to increase of the gains achieved in any case another beneficial aspect of the application of the method is that the optimal speed can be determined in a formal mathematical manner without relying upon the subjective estimations of the navigation crew next in order to investigate the effect of the ship speed readjustment interval parameter dt v on the optimal solution of the problem three additional cases for dt v 3 12 and 24 h are formulated and solved in all three cases the n a parameter is adjusted so that the weather trust region n a d t v is equal to 48 h while the n b parameter is set to 1 details and optimization results are given in table 7 the optimal ship speed profiles are given in fig 10 it is observed that setting the speed discretization equal to the weather conditions discretization 3 h does not greatly affect the optimal solution although it slightly improves it as expected the same can be said in the case of increasing the dt v to 12 h only a slight deterioration of the optimal total consumption value is observed the deterioration is more apparent in the case of dt v 24 h however it is very interesting that even in the case of using 24 h intervals for the ship speed i e change speed every two days and a weather forecast trust region of 48 h the proposed optimal speed profile still produces significant gains when compared with the initial actual consumption summarizing the sensitivity analysis performed in the current section reveals that the best performance in terms of accurately finding the optimal ship speed profile that minimizes fuel consumption is achieved by setting parameter n a as large as possible parameter n b as small as possible and parameter dt v how often the ship readjusts the speed equal to dt w the weather forecast interval however the differences in the way the method performs when different values are selected for these parameters are not significantly large as the overall optimal solution is satisfactorily approached in most of the cases presented except perhaps in the case where the dt v interval becomes much larger than 12 h in any case the aforementioned parameters are to be considered as tunable parameters in order to enhance the practicality and range of applicability of the method thus the final choices for their values are to be made upon each application at hand and while having taken under consideration all the details and practical constraints of the problem as well as the operator preferences for example the navigation crew may consider that a change of sailing speed every time the weather changes dt v dt w is not practically realizable in a route and thus set the dt v parameter to be higher also the weather prediction time step parameter dt w which was set equal to 3 h for the presentation of the method in the current work can be set to arbitrarily smaller values as long as smaller time resolutions of weather data are supported by the weather provider the method can effectively incorporate any given weather forecast interval length furthermore the weather forecast trusted region which was assumed to be 48 h in the present example may actually be much higher or much lower and this will affect the selection of the value of parameter n a while the parameter n b can be determined according to the navigation plan rescheduling frequency as determined by the crew in a final comment it is noted that the current method is proposed under the assumption that the weather prediction data are satisfactorily accurate in the short term prediction region denoted as trust region in the text however further developments can be carried out on the method based in stochastic and robust optimization formulations of the problem for incorporating the effects of the probabilistic nature of the weather data in the final optimal solution 8 closure in the present work a method for the determination of the optimal operational ship speed is proposed aiming at the minimization of the overall total fuel consumption over specified routes this method can be thought of as being included in the more general context of weather based ship operational profile optimization from a mathematical point of view the problem at hand is posed as a dynamic optimization problem the distinctive characteristic of the method is that the full time horizon is segmented in smaller time regions and a limited time horizon sub problem is solved for each this temporal segmentation and solution of successive sub problems was employed for addressing the problem of the deteriorating accuracy of weather forecasts for longer prediction periods the interdependence between the individual sub problems is controlled by two parameters of important practical significance which are representative of a the frequency that a ship may readjust its sailing speed and b the time resolution of weather forecasts the method is applied for the case of an actual container ship route and the effect of control parameters is assessed it is demonstrated that fuel consumption savings of the order of 2 in comparison with usual current practice may be achieved credit authorship contribution statement george tzortzis conceptualization methodology supervision

20900,the determination of the appropriate operational profile of a ship through the adjustment of its sailing speed can potentially present a fruitful prospect in the effort towards the maximization of energy resources exploitation in commercial ships the dependency of fuel consumption on speed always in inseparable conjunction with the ever changing weather conditions prevailing over any specified route leads to the formulation of a from mathematical point of view not well defined problem when practical considerations regarding the capabilities of currently available weather forecast services are taken into account in the present work a method for the dynamic determination of optimal ship speed in a fixed route is proposed within this method the problem of deteriorating accuracy of weather predictions for relatively long time periods is addressed with the segmentation of the route s total time horizon in smaller time periods in order for solvable and meaningful optimization problems to be formulated the interdependency between the individual sub problems is established and examined with the definition of appropriate method parameters which are representative of the most important time scales of the engineering problem at hand the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with the application on an actual container ship route keywords ship speed optimization dynamic optimization time horizon segmentation weather conditions fuel consumption 1 introduction maritime transport has always been a major part of international commercial transportation as it constitutes a highly cost effective option of transferring large volumes of cargo between continents however in recent years depressed markets increasing fuel prices low fares and new regulations regarding pollutants and greenhouse gases emissions from ships have emphasized the need for optimizing the energy efficiency of ships especially in the light of minimizing fuel consumption important research work in order to address this problem is ongoing in the field of hydrodynamics and specifically on the optimization of hull shape design diez et al 2018 with the goal of minimizing propulsion resistance and thus fuel consumption furthermore a large part of the research work nowadays is concerned with the design of propulsion machines with higher efficiency and consequently lower consumption however several alternative and interesting approaches to the problem also exist one of them which has been gaining increasingly more attention concerns optimizing the cruising speed of the ship during voyage by taking into account the prevailing weather conditions historically the concept of optimizing the operational profile of a ship while taking into consideration the weather conditions initially appears in studies related to the broader topic of searching for the optimal route the ship must follow in its early form weather routing szlapczynska and smierzchalski 2008 takashima et al 2009 vlachos 2004 mainly tackles the problem of finding the shortest route between two ports while taking into account the weather conditions only in the light of the simultaneous avoidance of areas of adverse weather the concept of ship speed optimization i e the voluntary change of ship speed as a function of weather conditions during the voyage in order to minimize consumption in the context of routing or weather routing appears in the literature mainly in the last decade a very comprehensive description of the aspects behind the idea of ship speed optimization is given in psaraftis and kontovas 2014 and the most important parameters of the problem are presented the problem of concurrently optimizing the speed for specific parts of a route in order to minimize fuel consumption is posed in shao et al 2011 mathematically the problem is stated as a dynamic programming problem and is solved using a suitable method three dimensional forward dynamic programming method lin et al 2013 formulate and solve a similar problem in which the simultaneous minimization of arrival time and fuel consumption is requested the problem is formulated as a multistage problem and a specially designed three dimensional modified isochrone method is used to solve it another case where this problem is formulated as a multi stage problem can be found in the study of zaccone et al 2018 weather is modeled through appropriate weather forecast maps and fuel consumption minimization is set as the objective function while the problem is solved via dynamic programming methods an interesting work in the same context can be found in lee et al 2018b where the problem is solved using genetic algorithms an important aspect of this last study is that the modeling of the ship and the weather conditions is done at a somewhat more detailed level of course ship speed optimization problems can also be found in studies beyond the general category of weather routing in wang and meng 2012 the simultaneous optimization of the speed of multiple container vessels of a regular line network is studied in order to minimize the total operational cost the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem wang and hu 2015 in their study examine the optimization of a ship s speed for minimizing carbon emissions while different tax scenarios are considered in their study kim et al 2016 aim to the minimization of fuel consumption while considering variable arrival times at ports the problem is posed as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and a special tree search algorithm is developed to solve it a similar case of minimizing fuel consumption under the uncertainty regime of arrival and stay times in ports use of stochastic variables is considered in aydin et al 2017 where the problem is posed as a dynamic programming problem all aforementioned publications present some very interesting approaches of the more general problem of ship speed optimization but albeit the consideration of the continuously changing weather conditions from route to route is not explicitly taken into account research on the problem of speed optimization taking into account the weather conditions and defining the problem by excluding options of re routing the ship s voyage can be found in relatively recent publications norlund and gribkovsakaia 2017 formulate a ship speed optimization problem in order to simultaneously minimize fuel consumption and emissions on supply vessels the effect of weather conditions on the ship speed is modeled through its effect in cruising time while generic models for calculating resistance propulsion and therefore consumption are used the subject of uncertainty of weather conditions and its effect on the determination of optimal speed is also studied in wang et al 2018 dynamic weather conditions are considered and the problem is formulated in the context of dynamic optimization for the solution of the problem a model predictive control method is adopted and detailed non linear models from the literature are used to model the ship performance an appropriate ship performance indicator is selected as the minimization criterion in lee et al 2018a historical weather data for a given route are utilized and processed through data mining methods in order to construct a model for correlating weather conditions and consumption then the problem of speed optimization is posed for simultaneous minimization of consumption and maximization of the sla service level agreement and is solved with an appropriate particle swarm optimization algorithm in the work of li et al 2018 appropriate models are developed for correlating the weather conditions to the ship speed reduction and speed optimization is performed in order to minimize consumption on a given route while simultaneously maximizing profit the use of big data analytics methods over a given route weather data in order to construct appropriate models for describing the energy efficiency of a ship is presented in yan et al 2018 then a suitable particle swarm optimization algorithm is used in order to find the optimal speed profile that minimizes consumption on a given trip the majority of these relatively recent publications demonstrates the importance of using real time weather data combined with accurate models for the ship fuel consumption in order to predict the optimal ship speed operational profile in addition the optimization problem is properly grounded as a nonlinear programming problem and the benefits of speed optimization in reducing fuel consumption and emissions are demonstrated however the issue of uncertainty introduced in the prediction forecast of future weather conditions especially for long trips is not discussed in the current work the ship speed optimization problem for fuel consumption minimization is mathematically formulated as a dynamic optimization problem while the weather profile is input to the problem in the form of consecutive weather forecasts throughout a predefined route under this scope a special method that attempts to tackle with the inherent uncertainty in the weather conditions forecasts is developed and applied in the next two sections the description and mathematical formulation of the problem as a dynamic optimization problem are given in section 4 the specially developed method for tackling the uncertainty of the weather forecasts is presented in sections 5 and 6 the system modeling and general solution procedure are discussed finally the method is applied on a real case scenario and the results are presented and discussed in section 7 2 description of the dynamic optimization problem the engineering problem of ship speed optimization addressed in the present study can be stated by posing the following question what is the optimal propulsion power profile or equivalently what is the optimal speed profile that a ship must follow along a specified route and under variable weather conditions in order for the fuel consumption to be minimized while satisfying certain constraints an important additional consideration regarding any attempt to specify the optimal speed over a specified commercial ship route should in any case be the requirement that the ship must reach to the destination ports in predetermined and quite tight times of arrival the practical applicability of any ship speed optimization method to be developed should be evaluated in conjunction with the ability of the last to ensure that these time limitations are satisfied having these in mind in order for the speed optimization problem to be mathematically well posed the following are required i the route that the ship will follow when traveling between two ports e g from port a to port b must be predetermined and known ii the estimated time of departure etd from port a and the estimated time of arrival eta to port b must be predetermined and known iii all ship characteristics e g ship dimensions and characteristic coefficients characteristics of ship engine s shaft and propeller characteristics etc that are required in order to develop the appropriate fuel consumption models must be known iv the weather conditions along the route must be known a priori and used as inputs in the optimization procedure since in the current work the assumption is made that the weather can be predicted with sufficient accuracy at least for a very short time horizon the problem described above is an inherently dynamic optimization problem since the weather conditions that the ship encounters during her voyage are in general functions of time thus time dependency is unavoidably inserted in all variables of the problem such as speed ship resistance and required propulsive power from the engine s of course it must be clarified that time dependency alone is not sufficient to characterize an optimization problem as dynamic the important characteristic that discriminates the specific problem at hand as a dynamic one is the issue of interdependency between time intervals the fact that the route is specified and that the ship must conclude the trip in a pre specified time horizon introduces such interdependency as it dictates that the optimal speed in each and every interval depends on the weather conditions of both the current interval and of every other interval it is true that no matter how accurately the models utilized can calculate the ship resistance or no matter how efficiently the optimization method solves the problem the reliability of the final optimal solution is dependent on the accuracy of the weather prediction ideally if the weather is known with absolute accuracy during the whole time horizon of the trip the underlying dynamic optimization problem can be solved with utmost precision deriving the ultimately optimal solution however due to the fact that the time period during which the weather forecast can be considered accurate up to an acceptable for engineering purposes degree is several times shorter than the travel duration of a typical commercial trip any attempt to solve the full time horizon problem will unavoidably yield questionable results for this reason a specialized method with the formulation of successive interdependent dynamic optimization problems the combined solutions of which approximate the solution of the full time horizon problem has been developed and applied the concept behind this time segmentation is the development of a formal way for determining the optimal ship navigation speed in each instance of time by solving each time an optimization problem of limited time horizon during which the important parameters related to the weather conditions can be considered as accurate so the formulation is mathematically well posed the details of this method are presented in section 4 the mathematical formulation of the general full time horizon dynamic optimization problem is given in the next section 3 mathematical statement of the full time horizon dynamic optimization problem the optimization problem at hand can be generally classified as a dynamic optimization problem bryson 1999 bryson and ho 1969 kirk 1998 and is mathematically stated as a minimization problem using a differential algebraic equation dae formulation allgor and barton 1997 biegler 2010 biegler and grossman 2004 the ship travels between ports a and b and one control variable is optimized the speed of the ship v the final time or time of arrival t f is known a priori and the goal of optimization is the minimization of the fuel consumption m f the objective function can be mathematically stated using a boltza form by the following equation 1 min v m f t 0 t f b f w b v d t where m f fuel consumption t 0 initial time t f final travel time or travel duration b f specific fuel oil consumption sfoc of the engine w b brake power of the engine the specific fuel oil consumption sfoc is in general amongst other things a function of brake power or equivalently of the engine load factor 2 b f b f w b or b f b f f l while the engine load factor f l is defined as follows 3 f l w b m c r with mcr the maximum continuous rating of the engine more details regarding the main diesel engine modeling are given in section 5 since the ship will be sailing through sea water with a certain speed it will experience resistance which is in general a sum of several resistance components and dependent on several factors in this text the total resistance is denoted as r t and will be in general a function of the ship speed the weather conditions and the hydrodynamic characteristics and dimensions of the ship 4 r t r t p v w s where p vector that denotes time independent characteristics of the ship and the hull w s weather state weather conditions considering the weather state conditions it is generally stated by the following equation 5 w s u w i n d ψ w i n d h s θ w a v e s where u w i n d wind speed ψ w i n d wind direction h s significant wave height defined as the mean wave height trough to crest of the highest third of the waves θ w a v e s wave direction these four variables which essentially represent the weather prediction are given as functions of time along the trip 6 u w i n d u w

speed v in absence of propulsive power is given as 7 w e r t v w s p v while the resulting required engine brake power is related to the ship resistance and speed using the equation 8 w b w e η p r o p v r t v w s p η p r o p v p q where η p r o p total propulsive efficiency q vector that denotes time independent propeller and shaft characteristics the models applied in order to calculate ship resistance and propulsion propulsive efficiency as well as the performance of the diesel engine s are presented in section 5 furthermore the distance travelled d the time elapsed and the ship speed are inter connected by the equation 9 d t t 0 t v d t in order to conclude the mathematical statement of the problem the necessary variable boundaries as well as the initial points and end points if they exist of the differential variables must be included the ship speed must lie the interval 10 v min v v max where v min and v max are the lower and upper bounds of the speed furthermore it is important to ensure that the engine will operate inside the load limits specified by the manufacturer 11 f l min f l f l max also for the two differential variables distance travelled and fuel consumption the initial points are known 12 d 0 0 m f 0 0 while an endpoint constraint must be defined for the distance travelled as follows 13 d t f t 0 t f v d t d α β with d α β is the total distance between ports a and b which ensures that the ship has reached port β in the predefined time of arrival finally there may be need of additional constraints and variable bounds but they are not included here for brevity in the present section it is seen that the variation of the optimal ship speed over a route can be mathematically uniquely determined in a strict manner but this would be possible in practice only if the underlying weather conditions were defined with high accuracy over the whole time period spanning from the beginning of the navigation t 0 to the final time t f as this is not possible in the present study a segmentation of the full time horizon is attempted for tackling the problem of the unavailability of valid weather predictions over the whole time span of the navigation 4 formulation of successive optimization problems by segmentation of the time horizon of the trip the weather forecasts have nowadays attained sufficient prediction accuracy and resolution of predicted values for most of the quantities of interest for the purposes of the present work however the accuracy and the validity of the predictions naturally tend to degenerate as the prediction spans to longer time periods in general the predictions are considered to be accurate enough for a rather short time horizon or trust region i e about two days this poses a difficulty in the determination of the optimum speed profile in a trip between two ports that lasts for several days as is the case in the majority of the merchant ships routes because the weather conditions must be predetermined in order for the dynamic optimization problem to be solved in other words the full time horizon dynamic optimization problem cannot be practically solved with satisfying accuracy in the beginning of the route since the more long term a weather prediction is the less accurate it will be to overcome this problem a specialized ad hoc procedure has been developed fig 1 the key idea behind the procedure lies in the approximation of the initial full time horizon dynamic optimization problem by the solutions of several successive dynamic optimization problems each spanning over a limited duration time horizon and equal to the trust region of the weather prediction the description of this procedure is given in the present section the ship departs from port a at time t t 0 and needs to arrive at port b according to the schedule at time t t f two time discretization steps are used i dt v which is the duration of the intervals that during each of them the ship sails with constant ship speed speed which is to be determined by the solution of the optimization problem ii dt w which is the time resolution of the weather forecasts it is noted that between the forecasts the values of the predicted weather conditions are assumed to be varying linearly with time two parameters n a and n b are required for establishing the interrelation between the individual successive optimization problems to be solved both quantities are tunable parameters of the solution procedure the first parameter denoted as n a is defined as the number of dt v intervals that are used for determining the time horizon for which the weather data provided are considered to be accurate up to an acceptable degree weather trust region for this time horizon an individual dynamic speed optimization sub problem can be solved with satisfying accuracy for example with weather data assumed as accurate for the next 48 h and dt v equal to 6 h n a is calculated as equal to 8 and the time horizon of each individual optimization problem will be n a d t v 48 hours once such an individual speed optimization problem is solved the optimal solution found for the ship speed is not to be applied for the whole n a d t v time horizon but instead is applied for n b d t v intervals where n b is the second parameter used for the interrelation of the successive optimization problems the n b parameter is to be lower than n a for example if n b 4 in the previous example where n a 8 an optimization problem is solved for a 48 h horizon but the optimal speed profile found is applied only in the first n b d t v 24 hours at the end of the n b d t v period the next dynamic optimization sub problem of time horizon n a d t v is defined with its initial time having been shifted by n b d t v hours and with the weather prediction within the accuracy trust region having also been updated and extended by n b d t v hours the same pattern of formulating and solving successive optimization sub problems is applied until the depletion of the time horizon of the full problem t t f and consequently the arrival of the ship at port β the number j max of individual successive optimization problems to be solved is calculated as 14 j m a x c e i l t f t 0 n b d t v n a n b 1 where t 0 time of departure from port a t f required time of arrival at port b ceil function representing rounding to the closer upper integer value for each individual optimization problem j the target distance d f j that has to be reached measuring from the initial port a is calculated as 15 d f j d 0 j d f d 0 j t f t 0 j n a d t v d 0 j v s h i p m e a n j n a d t v where d f total distance between ports a and b d 0 j distance already travelled at the beginning of optimization problem j t 0 j initial time at the beginning of optimization problem j in eq 15 the fraction term 16 v s h i p m e a n j d f d 0 j t f t 0 j is merely the mean speed that would be required for covering the total distance remaining to reach to the final destination at the period from t 0 i to eta t t f by defining a target total distance travelled to have been covered at the end of each of the successive optimization problems in the manner described it is ensured that in the overall procedure with the succession of individual sub problems the ship will reach the destination port at the predetermined total time what is obtained by the solution of the sub problem is in effect the deviation over v ship mean j at each instance of time which is collectively compensated by deviations of the opposite sign and appropriate magnitude in other instances lying within the n a dt v time horizon of each sub problem being solved in order for the ship to have arrived at distance d f j while also aiming at the minimization of the fuel consumption as the time passes with the ship coming closer to the final destination and successive optimization problems are being solved the value of v ship mean j is gradually being readjusted and so it is assured the ship arrives at the predetermined eta by applying this method the initially difficult to solve due to uncertainty in the long term prediction of the weather conditions dynamic optimization problem for the total trip horizon is broken apart and approximated by a series of smaller successive interdependent dynamic optimization problems that are easily solvable thus the series of optimal solutions of the successive dynamic sub problems will attempt to approximate the ideal optimal solution of the initial full time horizon dynamic optimization problem details regarding the overall solution procedure and the treatment of the successive dynamic sub problems are given in section 6 in the following section system modeling is discussed 5 system modeling the total resistance of a ship is composed of a number of different components politis 2018 politis and skamnelis 2007 in the present work given the dynamic character of the problem due to the time varying weather conditions the resistance components can be grouped in two main categories the calm water resistance r c a l m and the added resistance r a d d e d 17 r t r c a l m r a d d e d the calm water resistance term holtrop 1984 holtrop and mennen 1982 politis 2018 is generally dependent on the speed of the ship the trim of the ship as well as the characteristics and dimensions of the ship and the hull 18 r c a l m r c a l m v t p where t trim of the ship p vector that denotes time independent characteristics of the ship and the hull the calm water resistance term can be further decomposed to a sum of several terms holtrop and mennen 1982 politis 2018 19 r t r f 1 k 1 r a r w r a p p r b r t r r a a r a w where r f frictional resistance 1 k 1 form factor of the hull r

resistance r a a and the added wave resistance r a w 20 r a d d e d r a a r a w both those two terms are of great importance in the present study since they essentially model the effect of the time varying weather conditions wind and waves on the total resistance of the ship and consequently in the required propulsive power from the engine s in contrast with the calm water resistance terms which are generally dependent on the ship speed trim and hull characteristics those two terms are additionally dependent on the weather conditions transforming the optimization problem to a dynamic one 21 r

calculation of the mean resistance increase in regular waves induced by ship motion ittc 2012 maruo 1957 1960 finally the calculation of the added wind resistance is based on a method fujiwara et al 2005 developed by regression upon multiple data sets from model tests in wind tunnels after the calculation of the total resistance its correlation with the required power from the engine in order for the ship to achieve speed v is given by eq 8 the total propulsion efficiency η p r o p is a term generally dependent on ship speed politis 2018 politis and skamnelis 2007 trim and characteristics

holtrop and mennen 1982 ittc 2012 which uses as inputs the ship speed and characteristics geometry hull form as well as other details considering the gear transmission shaft and propeller i e gearing bearings stern tube propeller and open water efficiencies further information regarding the models utilized for the calculation of total ship resistance and propulsion power can be found in tzortzis 2018 as seen in the preceding for the development of the method the weather conditions considered are mainly the wind and sea waves in terms of their magnitudes and directions relative to the ship motion the application of the proposed method in actual practice would require the additional consideration of the effects of certain other external weather conditions such as currents rain fog etc and other ship specific dynamic behavior quantities e g ship motions as well as the effect of additional operational constraints e g constrained ship speed and squat effect on canal and waterways on the total propulsion resistance however the purpose of the present study is not the exhaustive treatise of the several terms affecting the propulsion power and fuel consumption requirements any additional resistance term can be included in more advanced studies without affecting the key concept of the time horizon segmentation designed to tackle the dynamic optimization problem in the

optimization problem to a nlp problem step c i is presented in section 6 1 next in section 6 2 the metaheuristic optimization algorithm which was used for the solution of the resulting nlp problems step c ii is discussed 6 1 treatment of the dynamic optimization sub problems the available solution approaches for dynamic optimization problems biegler 2010 logsdon and biegler 1989 tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 can be divided in indirect and direct fig 2 indirect approach includes classical analytical methods such as calculus of variations cov pontryagin et al 1962 and dynamic programming dp bellman 2003 which may face serious issues when tackling with optimization problems that include inequality constraints and or many variables curse of dimensionality direct approach constitutes of more modern techniques where the optimization problem is solved by applying a certain level of discretization so that the original dynamic problem is transformed to a static nlp problem which can be solved efficiently with evolutionary and or gradient based optimization algorithms depending on the level of discretization applied they are distinguished between sequential and simultaneous logsdon and biegler 1989 1992 in the sequential methods such as the one used in this work discretization is carried out only in the space of control variables i e independent optimization variables while the values of the state variables i e dependent variables are derived from the integration in each iteration of the system of differential algebraic equations dae that describe the problem biegler 2010 chachuat 2009 edgar and himmelblau 1998 feehery et al 1997 feehery and barton 1998 logsdon and biegler 1989 furthermore in each iteration the values of the objective function and the values of the constraints and possibly the values of the required gradients in the case of gradient based optimization are evaluated these methods are also known as feasible approach methods since the underlying differential equations are solved once per each iteration the control variables can be discretized fig 3 using several schemas chachuat 2009 feehery and barton 1998 feehery et al 1997 depending on the requirements of the problem in general sequential methods can be applied easily with little programming effort and have been proven to be very effective considering accuracy and required computational time feehery and barton 1998 feehery et al 1997 logsdon and biegler 1989 1992 more specifically in the current study for the solution of the successive do sub problems a hybrid sequential method control vector parameterization has been developed and applied where the time horizon is divided in equally spaced intervals for the control variable e g ship speed a piecewise constant representation fig 3 is used step dt v for the weather conditions a parameter of the problem a piecewise linear with continuity discretization scheme fig 3 is applied step dt w which essentially models when the weather conditions are changing something dictated by the weather prediction provider forecast resolution and it may be a rather small time period e g every 1 h the speed discretization interval dt v is used for defining the time period during which the ship speed is kept at a constant value and in practice is defined by the time intervals at the end of which the captain of the ship will re adjust the sailing speed due to the practical limitations imposed by the ship operational requirements and safety the dt v step may be chosen to be much larger than the dt w interval the mathematical statement of the resulting discrete optimization sub problems after application of the sequential method is given next each sub problem j can be stated as follows 26 minimise v v i j m f j i 1 n a t 0

f l i j f l i j max of course additional necessary constraints and bounds exist and are included in the system modeling but they are not written here for brevity for the solution of this problem step c ii of the overall solution procedure a specialized metaheuristic optimization algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 has been applied details are given in the next section 6 2 particle swarm optimization algorithm the resulting nlp sub problems are solved with the use of an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization pso eberhart et al 1996 parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 for n time intervals each one having duration equal to dt v the independent optimization variables are the ship speed on each interval v k with their number being equal to n 1 since the ship speed in the last interval will be a dependent variable due to the requirement of predetermined total travel time k 1 n 1 a candidate solution contained in particle p among a population of p max particles is represented by the vector x ˆ 32 x ˆ p v 1 p v 2 p v n 1 p p 1 p m a x prior to the application of the optimization algorithm the boundary values for each of the independent optimization variables must be set the lower bound b l vk for each optimization variable v k is set to the constant value of 3 m s approximately 6 knots the upper bound b u vk for k 1 n 1 is set equal to the ship speed for which the prime mover will attain a load factor equal to 1 in any moment during the dt v time interval and is calculated according to the weather predictions provided this was required for not allowing the optimal solution search procedure to move in regions which cannot be applied in practice due to overloading of the prime mover and to facilitate the convergence of the optimization algorithm the initialization of the population is another important factor for the successful application of the optimization algorithm instead of allowing an entirely randomly generated population the mean speed v ship mean is used which is merely defined as the total distance divided by the total time each independent variable v k p for p 1 p max is initialized as 33 v k p v s h i p m e a n b u v k v s h i p m e a n r a n d 0 5 0 5 v s h i p m e a n b u v k b l v k r a n d b u v k b l v k v s h i p m e a n b u v k k 1 n 1 p 1 p m a x with rand being a function representing a uniform random distribution from 0 to 1 in the case where v ship mean b u vk the initial values for variable v k p among the population of p max particles are distributed uniformly around the v ship mean otherwise a typical randomization between the lower and upper bounds is used it was found that this intervention had a very beneficial effect on the convergence of the optimization algorithm and the repeatability of its results according the typical particle swarm optimization algorithm after the initialization the positions of the particles are updated as follows 34 x ˆ p m 1 x ˆ p m u ˆ m 1 u ˆ m 1 θ u ˆ m α r ˆ g x ˆ p m β r ˆ x ˆ p x ˆ p m where x ˆ p m vector containing the values of the independent variables of particle p position at iteration m u ˆ p m vector containing the updates of the independent variables of particle p velocity at iteration m g vector containing the globally best solution found among the population up to iteration m x ˆ p vector containing the best solution found for particle p iteration m r ˆ vector of random values between 0 and 1 updated for each iteration m hadamard product representation θ α β tuning parameters of the pso algorithm the parameter referred to as the inertia tuning parameter is not constant during the succession of the m iterations but is adjusted from a high value θ 1 towards a lower value θ 2 among the m iterations as 35 θ θ 1 θ 2 m m a x m m m a x θ 2 with m max being the maximum permitted number of iterations the tuning of the algorithms parameters was executed with several trial and error procedures in order for the final solutions obtained to present a virtually absolute repeatability and fast convergence their values are presented in table 1 the maximum number of iterations is not practically reached as the procedure stops when an improvement on the global best objective function is not larger than a very low limit for more than 10 iterations due to the probabilistic nature of the algorithm the convergence is achieved at a different time of iterations on each execution and the value of m max 200 is set to a relatively large value for safety in the development of the pso optimization algorithm one intervention was carried out in order to improve its performance the standard pso algorithm dictates that in each iteration the particles should be attracted towards the global best found g instead of this in the initial iterations the particles at iteration m 1 are attracted towards the g m which is the best candidate solution found among the population at iteration m instead towards g the value of g m is in general suboptimal compared to g but it was observed that this practice largely improves the performance of the optimization algorithm due to the fact that helps the population to retain its divergence which is needed especially in the initial iterations of the algorithm execution in order for avoiding convergence to local optima the appropriate handling of the values of independent variables in cases that they exceed the permissible bounds after the application of the positions update step was found to be another important aspect of the successful application of the optimization algorithm in the case that an independent variable is temporarily given a value exceeding the limits posed by either the lower or upper bound this unacceptable value is overridden and is replaced by another value derived from a stochastic distribution the codomain of which is adapted in each iteration in a manner that the final outcome remains in the permissible range 7 case study for the case study an actual trip of an existing 6900 teu containership was considered the ship departed from port a port of ensenada baja california and arrived to port b negishi bay japan in the span of 295 h 12 3 days the total sailing distance between the two ports was da b 5136 5 nautical miles 9512 9 km the ship has one propeller and one main engine two stroke diesel engine for the modeling of the system the procedures presented in section 5 were applied all necessary information was taken from the ga general arrangement of the ship furthermore data from multiple sea trials as well as real time stored data from onboard sensors were used related data include power mass flow and sfoc measurements of the main engine as well as ambient conditions pressure and temperature also ship itineraries and measurements of ship drafts trim propeller power latitude and longitude of the ship speed over ground speed through water ship course apparent wind speed and direction in 5 10 min intervals some of the most essential characteristics of the container ship are given in table 2 it is clarified that since no actual measured data were available for the wave height and direction the following steps were taken the wave height was correlated with the wind speed utilizing the beaufort scale while the wave direction was set roughly equal to the wind direction thus in order to describe the weather state two parameters were required as inputs the wind speed and direction in fig 4 and fig 5 characteristic curves of the required brake power vs ship speed are given in relation to actual measured data for two different sets of conditions of draft trim wind speed and direction it is observed that the resulting resistance propulsion model for calculating the required propulsion power from the main engine presents satisfying accuracy for the requirements of the current work the main engine a two stroke diesel engine was modeled using data from the manufacturer as well as data from sea trials and shop tests the resulting model and related polynomial coefficients are given in appendix a table a1 some basic characteristics of the main engine can be found in table 3 while a plot of the resulting sfoc calculation vs load percentage for specific ambient conditions can be found in fig 6 in fig 7 the actual measured weather conditions wind speed and direction encountered by the ship during her trip are given additional weather data measured from sensors onboard the ship during the route and input in the models include the air pressure and temperature and the sea temperature however their variations during the trip and consequently their effects are minor thus their profiles are not included here for brevity fig 8 depicts the actual ship speed profile that was followed by the ship during the specific trip in conjunction with the wind speed encountered in order for the effectiveness of the methodology developed to be assessed it is applied at the case of the specific ship and the specified trip characteristics and weather conditions using the wind speed and direction readings from the ship and due to lack of actual successive weather forecast data from the actual trip we suppose that within the trust region of the weather forecast a parameter in the method the predictions of the forecast coincide with the ship measurements of course such an assumption may not always be completely accurate however it is adequate under the scope of testing the effectiveness of the method in successfully approximating the theoretical optimal solution of the full time horizon some of the most important parameters of the problem are summarized in table 4 by setting the parameter dt w equal to 3 h we are assuming that the time discretization of the weather forecast is equal to 3 h equivalently by setting dt v 6 h we accept that the ship will effectively readjust its speed every 6 h effectively any combination of dt v and dt w can be used as input even the case of dt v dt w which states that the ship speed changes concurrently with the weather profile first the optimization problem is solved for the total 295 h horizon as if the exact weather profile is known a priori with accuracy for its solution the same procedure presented in section 6 as for each successive optimization problem is applied but having omitted the total horizon segmentation step step a of course this solution is only theoretical but it will serve as a baseline for the assessment of the method next the problem is solved for several combinations of n a and n b by manipulating n a we essentially change the trust region of the weather prediction in other words given we are at time t we admit that the weather forecast will from then on accurately predict the weather conditions fig 8 that the ship will encounter for the next n a d t v hours correspondingly by manipulating n b we change the solution application region or in other words we change the frequency of when the next weather prediction will be received in order to formulate and solve the next sub problem in table 5 the list of parameter combinations along with their corresponding weather forecast trust and solution application regions is given the total fuel consumption resulting from the solution of each parameter combination is given in table 6 along with the calculated gain in comparison with the actual trip in fig 9 the optimal ship speed profiles derived from several selected parameter combinations along with the actual ship speed are presented the results indicate that for a fixed value of the parameter n a the best value for parameter n b is 1 that is as small as possible this result is logical and expected with a low value of n b the individual optimization sub problems succeed each other with the smallest possible step in this way the weather forecast data input in each of them is updated frequently and manage to efficiently predict the actual weather conditions thus the individual successive problem solutions are able to better approximate the optimal theoretical solution of the full time horizon problem furthermore another important observation is that for greater values of the parameter n a the optimal solutions derived from the method are getting better and better and closer to the optimal theoretical solution of the full time horizon problem again this result is logical since by increasing the parameter n a we essentially increase the trust region of the weather this means that for each successive sub problem the weather data input is considered to be accurate for a longer horizon considering the computational times a trade off is observed for a fixed n b i e n b 1 as n a becomes greater less successive sub problems have to be solved however these sub problems become more and more complicated and harder to converge thus requiring more computations parameter combination 4 when compared with combination 1 nearly doubles the accuracy of the approximation but takes twice as much in terms of computational time to converge the same can be observed when comparing combinations 7 and 4 on the other hand for a fixed n a by increasing n b the number of successive sub problems and thus computational times are decreased but approximation accuracy is sacrificed of course by observing the results of table 6 one could argue that even in the worst case scenarios parameter combinations 1 3 the difference of total consumption of the approximate optimal solution from the optimal theoretical solution of the full time horizon problem is less than 0 2 these quite low differences are positive indications for the practical applicability of the method since the cases presented in parameter combinations 1 3 are essentially expected to be closer to what the application of this method in in real life scenarios would resemble as the weather forecast trust region is expected to be very short finally the most important observation is that with the application of the speed optimization method presented the ship speed profile can be optimized according to the upcoming weather data provided and result to improvements of the overall fuel consumption in the order of 1 86 2 0 the gain in fuel consumption could potentially be considered small but it is certainly not negligible it is worth pursuing this optimization and more so if we take into consideration that the gain is achieved with a nearly zero investment also it has to be noted that the expected improvements will be highly dependent on the form of weather profile and the duration of the trip longer trips and more aggressive weather profiles steep and rapidly changing will lead to increase of the gains achieved in any case another beneficial aspect of the application of the method is that the optimal speed can be determined in a formal mathematical manner without relying upon the subjective estimations of the navigation crew next in order to investigate the effect of the ship speed readjustment interval parameter dt v on the optimal solution of the problem three additional cases for dt v 3 12 and 24 h are formulated and solved in all three cases the n a parameter is adjusted so that the weather trust region n a d t v is equal to 48 h while the n b parameter is set to 1 details and optimization results are given in table 7 the optimal ship speed profiles are given in fig 10 it is observed that setting the speed discretization equal to the weather conditions discretization 3 h does not greatly affect the optimal solution although it slightly improves it as expected the same can be said in the case of increasing the dt v to 12 h only a slight deterioration of the optimal total consumption value is observed the deterioration is more apparent in the case of dt v 24 h however it is very interesting that even in the case of using 24 h intervals for the ship speed i e change speed every two days and a weather forecast trust region of 48 h the proposed optimal speed profile still produces significant gains when compared with the initial actual consumption summarizing the sensitivity analysis performed in the current section reveals that the best performance in terms of accurately finding the optimal ship speed profile that minimizes fuel consumption is achieved by setting parameter n a as large as possible parameter n b as small as possible and parameter dt v how often the ship readjusts the speed equal to dt w the weather forecast interval however the differences in the way the method performs when different values are selected for these parameters are not significantly large as the overall optimal solution is satisfactorily approached in most of the cases presented except perhaps in the case where the dt v interval becomes much larger than 12 h in any case the aforementioned parameters are to be considered as tunable parameters in order to enhance the practicality and range of applicability of the method thus the final choices for their values are to be made upon each application at hand and while having taken under consideration all the details and practical constraints of the problem as well as the operator preferences for example the navigation crew may consider that a change of sailing speed every time the weather changes dt v dt w is not practically realizable in a route and thus set the dt v parameter to be higher also the weather prediction time step parameter dt w which was set equal to 3 h for the presentation of the method in the current work can be set to arbitrarily smaller values as long as smaller time resolutions of weather data are supported by the weather provider the method can effectively incorporate any given weather forecast interval length furthermore the weather forecast trusted region which was assumed to be 48 h in the present example may actually be much higher or much lower and this will affect the selection of the value of parameter n a while the parameter n b can be determined according to the navigation plan rescheduling frequency as determined by the crew in a final comment it is noted that the current method is proposed under the assumption that the weather prediction data are satisfactorily accurate in the short term prediction region denoted as trust region in the text however further developments can be carried out on the method based in stochastic and robust optimization formulations of the problem for incorporating the effects of the probabilistic nature of the weather data in the final optimal solution 8 closure in the present work a method for the determination of the optimal operational ship speed is proposed aiming at the minimization of the overall total fuel consumption over specified routes this method can be thought of as being included in the more general context of weather based ship operational profile optimization from a mathematical point of view the problem at hand is posed as a dynamic optimization problem the distinctive characteristic of the method is that the full time horizon is segmented in smaller time regions and a limited time horizon sub problem is solved for each this temporal segmentation and solution of successive sub problems was employed for addressing the problem of the deteriorating accuracy of weather forecasts for longer prediction periods the interdependence between the individual sub problems is controlled by two parameters of important practical significance which are representative of a the frequency that a ship may readjust its sailing speed and b the time resolution of weather forecasts the method is applied for the case of an actual container ship route and the effect of control parameters is assessed it is demonstrated that fuel consumption savings of the order of 2 in comparison with usual current practice may be achieved credit authorship contribution statement george tzortzis conceptualization methodology supervision

20901,computational fluid dynamics cfd is used to numerically simulate the viscous air water flow around a thin rigid floating plate subjected to surface waves with the aim to improve the understanding of dissipative mechanisms in drifting and non drifting conditions cfd model is validated by comparing the obtained results against previously published data of nelli et al 2017 it is shown that the energy of the waves is dissipated by the water flow over both upper and lower surfaces of the plate the dissipation increases as a function of steepness of incoming waves on the upper surface of the non drifting plate overwash contributes to dissipation of the energy of steep waves while this effect is slightly smaller when the plate is moving freely simple equations are used for estimating the overwash height and energy fluxes which are found to be in fair agreement with the present cfd simulations the energy dissipation due to the shear stresses under the surface of the plate is seen to be higher when the body is drifting in the longitudinal direction equations for the energy dissipation under the plate are also formulated and are observed to follow the results of

motions to the floating object depending on the rheological nature of the body squire 2007 waves can also cause the body to drift eltahan and eltahan 1983 the floating body on the other hand may affect the physical nature of the wave field in different ways by changing the propagating wave energy reflecting the waves or dissipating its energy meylan 2002 or by changing group velocity speed of the energy propagation e g collins 2016 note that this mechanism is inactive for rigid floating bodies considered in this paper it has been observed that the fluid motion around the floating body becomes more complicated when the draft and the freeboard are very small when the draft is shallow the front and rear edges of the body tend to exit the water and then slam on its surface as they re enter the water bennetts et al 2015 causing the generation of irregular waves in both front and rear fields when the freeboard of the object is shallow steep waves propagate on the upper surface of the plate causing a phenomenon called overwash overwash has been seen to cause an extra energy attenuation which becomes larger by the increase in the wave steepness dolatshah et al 2018 the first option to model the wave thin plate interaction is to use analytical methods where the fluid is assumed to be ideal i e nil viscosity fluid under such an assumption dynamic response of the body to the waves and its effects on the wave field which provide wave transmission and reflection can be found through the solution of radiation and diffraction problems yu et al 2019 different mathematical methods such as the expansion of eigenfunctions can be used to solve the fluid field around the body such methodologies have been found to have a greater ability to simulate the problem for gentle waves and bodies with non shallow draft mathematical models have the potential to be used in the case of flexible bodies meylan 2002 blyth et al 2011 a discussion on challenges with propagation of elastic waves into floating body is presented in korobkin et al 2011 considering ideal flow leads to a conserved based solution for the problem i e viscosity is neglected and the effects of shear stresses vanish in this condition the ideal flow assumption has been found to over predict the height of transmitted waves when steep waves encounter the floating body the overwash flow and corresponding dissipated energy also cannot be modeled using the ideal flow assumption skene et al 2015 when a floater is very thin and waves are highly sloped overwash and energy dissipation are more likely to occur also flow regime is expected to be turbulent in this condition viscous flow needs to be considered the solution of which cannot be achieved through analytical approaches and ideal flow assumption the viscouse flow can empower us to model the air water interaction vortex formation wave breaking and the extreme motions of the floating object subjected to waves which lacks in the analytical models also turbulent behaviour of the flow can be modeled using a viscous flow assumption navier stokes ns equations govern the fluid motion in this case simulation of the velocity field around viscous flow needs numerical techniques computational fluid dynamics cfd is used to discretize equations and the computational domain is divided into a finite number of cells stern et al 2015 when the cfd codes are used for numerical simulation of any problem it is very straightforward to sample data such as velocity field which helps us to understand the physics of the phenomenon in more detail cfd models have been used for simulation of marine hydrodynamic problems since the early 1960s good accuracy of the cfd codes in the modeling sea loads izadi et al 2018 the dynamic of offshore structures and ships esfandiari et al 2019 khojasteh and kamali 2018 and free surface flows teuber et al 2019 khojasteh et al 2020 has been reported by different authors recently researchers have taken advantage of cfd codes to numerically model the wave plate interaction bai et al 2017 used cfd codes to model the dynamic responses of different floating bodies similar to ice floes huang et al 2018 2019 huang and thomas 2019 provided simulations for the wave motion in thin flexible ice the main previous cfd based simulations centering on wave plate interaction have highlighted validating and verifying while these aforementioned aspects are of high importance there is a pressing need to understand the role of the dissipative mechanisms which in the long term can allow us to formulate energy dissipation it can be used as a forecasting tool for wave modeling or as a hydrodynamic tool for design of the floating objects simply stated at the current time it is desirable to take steps to increase the body of knowledge about the wave plate interaction by taking the advantage of cfd simulations in the present paper the interaction between a thin rigid floating plate with water waves is numerically investigated in order to understand the role of different mechanisms in energy dissipation the fluid field is assumed to be two phase and viscous allowing us to compute the energy dissipation which is more likely to occur for steep waves a numerical set up for the problem is presented to solve the motion of the floating body exposed to surface waves simulations are performed for the case of drifting and non drifting plates using openfoam and are validated by comparing the obtained results against recent experimental research performed at the university of melbourne results of the drifting and non drifting plates are compared against each other to explore how the mooring may affect energy dissipation also by using the cfd data and by simplifying the physics of the problem parameterisations are developed to compute different physical properties of the problem the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the problem description and numerical model section 3 includes validation of the numerical set up section 4 contains the main results of the paper and discussions section 5 summarizes the current work and presents the concluding remarks 2 numerical model 2 1 problem definition in the present research a thin rigid plate is assumed to float on the water surface the plate is 1 m long and 0 01 m thick and is subjected to the monochromatic waves with wavelengths comparable to the length of plate the plate has a density of 0 596 ρ w note that the density considered for the plate equals that of pvc 1 1 polyvinyl chloride which has been used in the experiments utilized for the validation study in the present paper see nelli et al 2017 it is interesting to note that floating fixed breakwaters may be constructed with pvc also the density of the plate is very close to that of wood which can be around 0 6 ρ w to 0 9 ρ w the considered density for the plate thus can have engineering applications e g breakwaters and wooden barges pontoons also the dimensions of plate are set to be similar to that of experiments but the results presented in the rest of research are all non dimensional that allows us to interpret data regardless of its physical dimensions an overview of problem studied in the present research is sketched in fig 1 the problem embraces two different motions including solid and fluid motions the solid motion includes the rigid body response of the body as it is subjected to the waves the fluid motion deals with the movement of fluid around the floating body as it can also rigidly move the boundary value problem that governs the fluid motion depends on the assumptions made for the fluid which are presented in sub section 2 2 overall as the plate is subjected to gravity waves it transmits a proportion of the energy of the water waves and reflects another proportion as seen in fig 1 some physical assumptions are made for the problem that can help us to establish the boundary conditions are explained here note that the domain boundary and boundary conditions are presented in sub section 2 4 waves are assumed not to be reflected from far fields both in front and rear field i e the transmitted wave will never be reflected and its energy is faded away in far field seabed is assumed to be impermeable in addition the water depth is assumed to be constant wave induced motions occur and the plate undergoes heave pitch and longitudinal motions including drift and surge fluid is assumed not to slip on the body of the floating plate and the plate is assumed to be impermeable the interface between water and air the free surface is assumed to be governed by strongly non linear condition it means that waves can be broken and the energy can be dissipated again note that the fluid problem is solved by designing a computational domain and setting boundary condition which are presented in sub section 2 4 to formulate the rigid body motion three different coordinate systems are defined the first coordinate system is an earth fixed frame denoted by o x e z e which rests on the calm water as shown in fig 1 the second one is a hydrodynamic frame shown by o x h z h this coordinate system is located on the calm water line but moves with the floating plate if waves cause it to drift this frame is fixed in the vertical direction and cannot have any heave and pitch motions the last defined coordinate system is a body fixed frame shown by g x b z b which is attached to the plate resting on its centre of gravity note that the problem is considered to be two dimensional hence no lateral coordinate is taken into account and no sway and yaw motion is modeled heave and pitch motions of the plate are defined as the relative movement of the body frame with respect to the hydrodynamic frame drift motion of the floating plate refers to the longitudinal movement of the hydrodynamic frame with respect to the earth frame the equations governing the motions of the plate are given by 1a m x f x 1b m z f z m g 1c i θ m θ where m and i respectively refer to the mass of plate and its inertia f x and f z are fluid forces acting on the plate in horizontal and vertical directions i e f f x i f z k m θ is the pitching moment acting on the plate note that all forces are generated by the fluid flow and can contain added mass damping and restoring mechanisms the derivation of the governing equation on rigid body motion of the plate is described in appendix a water waves are assumed to interact with the floating body the incoming wave obeys the linear water wave theory and is given by 2 η x e t a i n cos k x e ω t ε where η is the free surface elevation a i n is the amplitude of the wave ω is the wave frequency ω 2 π t t is the wave period k is the wavenumber k 2 π λ λ is the wavelength and ε is the phase shift of the incoming wave it is assumed that waves propagate in the deep water conditions the deep water dispersion equation relates frequency and wavenumber as follows 3 ω 2 g k 2 2 fluid equations in the present paper as explained in section 1 it is presumed that the fluid flow is two phase including air and water which provides us with the opportunity to consider the wave air interaction and non linear free surface boundary condition both phases of the fluid flow are supposed to be viscous and the relation between velocity gradient and shear stresses is governed by the newtonian fluid law such an assumption as mentioned earlier allows us to model vortex formation and shear stresses therefore the energy dissipation that might occur due to overwash or shear stresses can be modeled as explained in the literature such mechanisms might emerge when a floater is very light and thin which triggers energy dissipation in the case of steep waves note that when waves are gently sloped and the floating body is thick an ideal flow assumption has reliable accuracy and can be used for modeling the fluid motion around the thin floating body in summary the viscous assumption made for the fluid motion makes the present paper different from the analytical based one by empowering us in computation of shear stresses and energy dissipation simply stated the analytical models that solve the potential velocity field around the body do not model any energy dissipation which is important to be considered for the case of thin floating bodies fluid in the whole domain is assumed to be incompressible as the speed of the sound in both air and water is far higher than the speed of the fluid flow the velocity field is denoted by u u x x t i u z x t k where the first and second terms respectively refer to the horizontal and vertical components of velocity vector at any point the fluid flow obeys the continuity and navier stokes equations 4 u 0 5 t ρ e u ρ e u u p μ e 2 u ρ e g in eqs 4 and 5 ρ e and μ e respectively denote the effective density and viscosity of the mixture of the water and air g g k is the gravity acceleration vector two phase flow is modeled using the volume of fluid vof approach which employs a volume fraction shown by φ to identify the amount of water at any point φ is computed by 6 φ v w v 1 v a v where subscripts a and w respectively refer to air and water here v is the volume of any finite volume effective viscosity and density of the mixed fluid are respectively computed by 7 ρ e x t ρ w φ x t ρ a 1 φ x t 8 μ e x t μ w φ x t μ a 1 φ x t the volume fraction obeys a conservation law given by 9 t φ φ u u r φ 1 φ 0 in the above equation u r is the compression velocity of the free surface using pressure p and stresses σ acting on the plate fluid force and moment vectors are found as 10 f s p n σ n d s 11 m s p n r σ n r d s where s refers to the surface of the plate n and r respectively stand for unit normal and position vectors to model the problem it is required to numerically solve the dynamic motions of the plate 1a 1c ns equations 4 and 5 and equation 9 along with the boundary conditions which are presented later sub section 2 4 solution of these equations helps us to study the energy dissipation by the upper and lower surfaces of the plate the mentioned equations indeed represent a strongly coupled rigid body dynamic and fluid motion problem the unknowns are the motions of the plate x z θ velocity field u pressure filed p and volume fraction φ the coupled rigid body and fluid motion problem cannot be solved analytically as the set of ns and volume fraction equations are strongly nonlinear and are coupled with the motion equations at the same time the main difficulty is that the ns equations are fully nonlinear and in addition the free surface flow is captured through volume fraction method and eulerian approach thus the governing equations cannot be solved using analytical methods note that only available solutions for ns equations are related to very simple problems like flow between two walls with no slip condition technical information regarding ns equations and the need to use numerical methods can be found in chapter 5 of graebel 2007 the main difference of the present cfd model with the previous potential based models is the governing equations ns when ns equations are solved to model the free surface unlike the potential based models the free surface is not considered to be an upper boundary and it is captured by using the volume fraction value therefore governing equations are solved in a enclosed numerical domain bounded with an upper boundary an air patch and a seabed and the whole domain is filled with a mixture of air and water in addition unlike the potential based models ns equations does not secure the conservation of wave energy and wave energy can be damped by different mechanisms this occurs as the viscousity term that links the shear stresses to velocity gradients leads to energy damping within the problem to numerically solve the problem it is required to use numerical methods to solve the problem over time a numerical domain as stated is designed which helps us to numerically reproduce the problem by setting boundary conditions for velocity pressure and volume fraction which are unknown variables the method for simulation of the problem is described in sub section 2 4 but there are some other parameters like water surface elevation and the amount of dissipated energy that can be computed by using velocity vector pressure field and volume fraction the method for computation of these parameters is explained sub section 2 3 2 3 mathematical formulations for computing different parameters as mentioned earlier the unknowns including velocity field pressure field volume fraction and dynamic responses of the plate are computed through solving the coupled ns equations conservation of volume fraction and dynamic response of the plate but there are some other parameters like water surface elevation at any point or energy flux that are of interest which should be calculated over the time these parameters are computed by using the velocity field pressure and volume fraction at every single time step the method for computation of them is explained in this sub section 2 3 1 free surface the free surface elevation at any longitudinal position of the numerical domain is computed as 12 η x e t d φ d z e where d is the water depth of the numerical tank the free surface elevation in the front field gives the superposition of incoming wave and reflected wave on the other hand the height of free surface at the rear filed provides the transmitted wave amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected waves are computed using a zero crossing method which is very common to be used for analysis of water waves in oceanography thompson and emery 2014 the averages value of the amplitudes of the free surface elevation at front and rear fields are set to be the amplitude of the waves the overwash height is calculated by 13 η o w x e t z p φ d z e where z p is the vertical position of the upper surface of the plate and is computed using the rigid body dynamic laws time average value of overwash height is defined as the average value of the η o w l 2 t as 14 h o w x e t 1 25 t 5 30 t η o w l 2 t d t time average is computed over twenty five cycles the first five cycles are neglected as a ramp function lasting for four periods is considered and in addition simulations are last to consider 25 cycles to satisfy recommendations of the ittc 2 3 2 dynamic responses dynamic of the body is solved over the physical time using the instant values of the forces and moments acting on the surface of the body z and θ vary over time and are assumed to show linear behavior i e energy of the motion is focused on one harmonic being equal to the encounter frequency the responses are plotted over the time domain then the amplitude of each period of heave and pitch motions of the plate are computed using a zero crossing method in the case the plate is set to be free in longitudinal direction waves cause the plate to drift the instant velocity of the hydrodynamic frame with respect to the earth frame is found the average value of this speed is set to be the drift speed of the plate 2 3 3 energy fluxes the energy flux passing through any fixed vertical surface locating at x e of the domain is computed by 15 e x e t d φ ρ w g z e p 0 5 u 2 u n s d z e here n s refers to the normal vector of the surface the energy flux at any vertical columns above or under the plate is computed by 16 e x e t z p φ ρ w g z e p 0 5 u 2 u n s u s n s d z e and 17 e x e t d z p φ ρ w g z e p 0 5 u 2 u n s u s n s d z e where u s is the velocity vector of the surface it is important to note that the vertical surface may move with body depending on the physics of the problem the rate of energy dissipation by overwash is defined as 18 e o w t e l 2 t note that it is assumed that the total amount of energy that propagates above the plate is dissipated this assumption cannot be true for the case that plate gets fully submerged as it might transmits the waves in the way a submerged breakwater plate does for the case of the present problem however since the body is partially washed by the water and the front edge of the plate comes out of water and re enters it this assumption may not lead to large errors the energy dissipation under the plate which is caused by the oscillatory boundary and the friction is computed by 19 e d w e l 2 t e l 2 t where e l 2 t is the energy flux under the front edge and e l 2 t is the energy flux under the rear edge of the plate the difference between the mean value of these two boundaries show how the energy is attenuated under the plate the final values for overwash and downwash energy dissipation are computed by computing their time average values over the time as 20 e o w 1 25 5 t 30 t e o w t d t and e d w 1 25 5 t 30 t e d w t d t the rate of energy attenuation caused near the front edge of the plate where vortex generation might be caused is compute by 21 e s t 1 25 t 25 t 5 t 30 t e l 2 λ t e l 2 t d t the above relation represents the amount of the energy that is dissipated in the front field of the plate energy flux is computed at two different points the first point is located just near the front edge and the other is located at a point that is one wavelength far from the front edge the front field is expected to partially damps the energy of reflected as vortex generation might occur when the plate gets submerged technical information regarding vortex generation in upstream and downstream of a submerged plate can be found in poupardin et al 2012 the difference between average values of the energy fluxes at these two different points give the energy attenuation in the front field the nonlinear interaction between water waves and shear stresses caused by the front boundary of moving boundary of the plate can also in this energy dissipation mechanism the work rate power of the drift motion done by the plate can also be computed by 22 e w 1 25 5 t 25 t f x u d d t but the work rate is neglected in the present study and it is assumed that its contribution in energy attenuation is so low technical information regarding the energy extraction by the motion of a floating rigid body can be found in wang et al 2020 energy fluxes should satisfy the energy conservation in the a control volume by assuming a control volume bounded by two surfaces one in the front and one in the rear filed it is written that 23 d t e c v e f s e r s e o w e d w e s 0 in eq 23 d t e c v refers to the rate of the energy in the control volume e f s and e r s respectively denote the energy fluxes passing through the front and rear surfaces which are given by 24 e f s e i n e r 25 e r s e t energy in the whole domain is expected to have a zero rate during each period thus d t e c v 0 terms in equation 23 can be normalized by using e i n this equation therefore is re written as 26 1 e r e i n e t e i n e o w e i n e d w e i n e s e i n 0 using the linear wave theory e r and e t are formulated as 27 e r e i n 0 25 ω k 1 ρ w g a r 2 0 25 ω k 1 ρ w g a i n 2 r 2 28 e r e i n 0 25 ω k 1 ρ w g a t 2 0 25 ω k 1 ρ w g a i n 2 t 2 equation 26 is re written as 29 1 r 2 t 2 d 0 where d is the normalized energy dissipation and is given by 30 d e o w e i n e d w e i n e d e i n note that the values that are determined for the overwash dawnwah and energy dissipation in the front field provides the specific use of the viscous flow assumption made in this paper which helps us to reach our aim understanding of energy dissipation mechanisms this cannot be found through modeling of the irrotational flow which makes the present model different from a potential based one a pictograph of the considered control volume the plate and surfaces is demonstrated in fig 2 2 4 computational method as explained earlier ns equations govern the fluid problem and cannot be solved analytically numerical techniques can be used to solve the problem numerically to numerically solve the problem a computational domain is defined in which waves are generated and the body is exposed to them governing equations are solved in this domain the domain is set to have a length of 31l and the front edge of the floating plate is settled at a distance of 4l from the left end of the domain note that l is the length of the plate the dimensions of the domain satisfy the recommendations of international towing tank committee ittc see ittc 2017 but note that it is attempted to have a longer downstream length to ensure that wave reflection does not affect the simulations as the wave absorption in openfoam is based on the shallow water wave theory this numerical tank sketched in upper panel of fig 3 represents the domain of problem in which governing equations are solved this numerical tank is bounded by one patch in left and one patch in right the depth of the tank is set to be constant in the whole domain in addition there is an upper patch covering the whole length of the tank all the mentioned surfaces patches are the boundaries of the problem domain the conditions that are set on the boundaries are chosen in a way that they match with physical assumptions made in sub section 2 1 boundary conditions are set as bellow an inlet boundary is defined at the left end of the domain where the waves are numerically generated see details of this bc in higuera et al 2013 a far field outlet boundary condition is set at the right end of the domain where the train of transmitted waves are damped note that zero gradient condition for the volume fraction and pressure is prescribed at the outlet this boundary satisfies the far field boundary condition described in sub section 2 1 no slip boundary condition is set at the floor of the numerical domain also neumann boundary condition is set for φ and p at bottom of the domain conditions set for the bottom agree with the physics of impermeable seabed described in sub section 2 1 the surface of the plate is set to behave as a moving wall and no slip condition is prescribed for fluid motion zero gradient pressure and volume fraction conditions are set at walls of the plate these conditions provide an impermeable moving oscillating boundary condition that matches with the assumption made for the walls of floating plate an open atmosphere boundary condition is established at the upper edge of the domain where air can leave or enter the domain depending on the local pressure a summary of the boundary conditions set for the surfaces patches of the domain are presented in table 1 deep wave condition is used for the domain i e λ d 0 5 note that d is the water depth an overset region with dimensions of 3 l 50 h is generated and the plate is located at the center of this sub domain this region moves with the body 2 4 1 numerical technique numerical simulation of the fluid field is performed using the finite volume method fvm and openfoam library an open source object oriented package for cfd simulation of the fluid flow a helpful overview of this code can be found in jasak 2008 the pimple algorithm which is a combination of piso pressure implicit with splitting of operator and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations schemes is used for simulating the ns equations over the time domain the transient terms are numerically discretized by means of crank nicolson method the courant number is set to be lower than 0 5 during the simulation to avoid divergence of simulations the first order upwind fou scheme is used to discretize the convection equations diffusion terms of the ns equations are interpreted using a second order central scheme the interpolations in the numerical domain are set to be performed using a linear scheme the interpolation performed within the overset regime is performed using inversedistance library the solver used for numerical simulation is the overinterdymfoam which solves the dynamic motion of a body in two phase flow condition the tolerance values in computation of the displacement and pressure are respectively set to be 10 6 and 10 8 note that fluid flow is set to be laminar in the present research i e no turbulent simulation is performed in reality turbulent regimes are more likely to occur but by using a laminar simulation in the present study and considering turbulent regimes in future studies we can understand the role of different mechanisms in energy dissipation in a stepwise approach understanding the role of different mechanisms in energy dissipation cannot be achieved in physical testing or field observations therefore a laminar flow regime is prescribed for the fluid field around the floating body in future studies it would be necessary to use turbulent simulation to understand the role of turbulent stresses in energy dissipation turbulence might be stronger in some other cases and should be considered in the models for the case of very long bodies floating objects with large pitch responses and multi bodies such as an array of floating bodies turbulence gets stronger turbulence can significantly contribute in energy dissipation and needs to be considered these studies are part of future aims therefore while turbulent is not considered at the current stage it will be implemented in next steps where longer and elastic bodies will be studied finally note that a comparison between laminar and turbulent simulations is presented in appendix c which shows the differences between these two models the differences are not very significant the governing equations on the motions are solved using a fifth order cash karb embedded runge kutta method note that the water is initially set to be at rest and then waves are generated but a ramp function is used for the generation of waves and the ramp time is set to be 4 t simulations are run up to 30 t this helps us to analyze the simulations for 25 cycles this amount of time is in consistent with recommendations of ittc for testing of water waves interacting with ships vessels note that the present problem is similar to seakeeping of ships in zero speed conditions and can be modeled based on ittc recommendations at every single time step the velocity vector the pressure field and the volume fraction are computed in the numerical domain and the pressure field along with shear stresses are used to calculate the force and then the dynamic response of the plate 2 4 2 mesh generation the numerical domain is descritiezed into finite volumes in order to solve the fluid flow using the fvm framework the cells are generated using a library known as blockmesh a structured methodology is used for mesh generation all cells are prescribed to be hexagonal and to have a cubic shape such a descritization leads to orthogonal cells that decrease the numerical errors and accelerate numerical simulations the methodology used for mesh generation has been used as the geometry of the domain is simple the size of the cells is set to be finer around the free surface where larger variation in speed pressure and volume fraction might occur during every time step coarser cells are generated in the far field domain note that finer cells are also produced in the overset region it is noted that while a dynamic problem is being solved cells do not deform instead cells located in the overset region move with the body demirdzic and peric 1998 also note that no jump condition occurs near the boundaries of the domain four different grids are generated and a mesh convergence study is carried out a schematic of the mesh is shown in lower panel of fig 3 the size of the cells in the vicinity of the plate for different grids are set to be 0 005 l 0 005 l coarse grid 0 004 l 0 004 l medium grid 0 0025 l 0 0025 l fine grid and 0 0015 l 0 0015 l finest grid the mesh study shows that results converge for the cell size of 0 0025 l 0 0025 l mesh study is performed by generating waves with the highest steepness k a i n 0 15 for three different wavelengths ranging from 1 l to 1 56 l the results obtained from mesh study are shown in fig 4 transmitted wave waves in the rear field of the plate heave response and pitch response converge for the mesh size of 0 0025 l 0 0025 l coarser mesh may result in over prediction of the transmitted wave and dynamic responses therefore the fine mesh is used for performing the numerical experiment in the current research 3 validation the numerical set up is validated by comparing the computed data against the results of a recent experimental work performed in the university of melbourne nelli et al 2017 a rectangular plate with a length of 1m and a thickness of 0 01m spanning the width of the flume was tested in the experiments regular waves were generated at one end of the flume and they were absorbed on a beach at the other end of the flume the plate tested in the flume had a density of 0 596 ρ w which matches with the density of the plate modeled in the present research details of the experiments can be found in nelli et al 2017 the set up of the experiments is analogous with the 2d problem studied in the present research the aforementioned experiments were carried out for three different wavelengths of 1 l 1 29 l and 1 56 l waves with different steepness values which cover the full range of wave steepness values at sea i e ranging from 0 06 to 0 15 were generated free surface elevation in the front and rear fields of the plate are numerically computed and compared against experimental data the method for computation of the free surface elevation has been explained above fig 5 shows the numerically computed and the experimentally measured free surface elevation in the front and rear fields of the non drifting plate also the results corresponding to linear potential theory are shown details of this theory are presented in appendix d the free surface elevation at the front field is resulted by the superposition of the incoming and the reflected waves all results are nondimensional referring to the steepness of the recorded wave in the front and rear fields results show that the free surface elevation of the front field is larger than the reference line solid black line for all cases as expected experimental and numerical data of wave steepness of the front field agree with each other the free surface elevation at the rear field is smaller than the reference line showing that the energy of the wave is attenuated the data diverges from the reference line as the steepness of the incoming wave grows this fact implies that by the increase in the steepness of the incoming wave a larger proportion of the energy of waves may be attenuated this fact is in contrast with linear potential theory shown by dashed red line experimental data fit with numerical data showing that the presented numerical set up has proper accuracy in the modeling of the interaction of a non drifting plate with monochromatic waves this means that viscousity empowers us to compute the energy dissipation occurring for the case of steep waves which is not captured by models established based on potential theory note that an irregular wave pattern might emerge in the rear field which is likely to be caused by the slamming of rear edge of the plate the spectral analyses of the rear field can be found in bennetts et al 2015 and nelli et al 2017 which show that energy of other harmonics is highly smaller compared to that of the dominant harmonic but this phenomenon is not of interest in the present research and irregularity of the transmitted wave train is not analyzed here fig 6 displays the free surface elevation in the front and rear fields as well as the drift speed of the free floating plate exposed to monochromatic waves the first two rows of this figure show the wave height in the front and rear field of the plate experimental and cfd data are presented in addition the results of linear wave theory are also plotted in these two rows the last row shows numerically computed drift speed of the plate also the values of stokes drift are plotted to show the differences between drift speed and stokes drift furthermore the results of another set of experiments performed by huang and law 2013 are presented to evaluate whether the results of this research match with previous experiments or not compared with the non drifting plate the free surface elevation in the front field of the drifting plate is slightly smaller i e less energy of waves is reflected when the body is freely moving experimental data and numerical data of the front field are in proper agreement linear wave theory over predicts the data at the smallest wavelength the steepness of the transmitted wave is predicted with proper accuracy experimental and numerical data slightly diverges from the linear potential theory when the waves are steep their values are close to each other in most of the cases the drift speed of the plate increases by the increase in the wave steepness of the incoming wave this speed however converges by the increase in the wave steepness experimental data and numerical data agree with each other in most of the cases the stokes drift dashed red curve is also presented in this figure the difference between the stokes drift relative speed of the plate and the drifting speed decreases by the increase in wave amplitude it is very important to note that the behaviour observed for u d c p vs k a i n agrees with previous experimental observations of huang and law 2013 which is also presented in fig 6 there are some differences at the longest waves note that huang and law 2013 tested a plate with density of 0 7 ρ w which is slightly denser compared to the one considered in the present research in addition they generated waves with wavelengths of 1 05l 1 26l and 1 56l which are slightly different from the ones generated in the present study the amount of dissipated energy is compared with the experiments of nelli et al 2017 they measured the total amount of energy dissipated for each forcing condition fig 7 shows the computed energy dissipation and the reported values by nelli et al 2017 the amount of energy dissipation is seen to increase by the increase in the wave steepness for the case of a non drifting plate when the plate is freely moving wave steepness is seen to be less influential at the highest wavelength cfd data is observed to follow the experiments for the case of the non drifting plate for the case of the drifting plate cfd is less accurate the larger errors are seen to occur in the case of the lowest wavelength when waves are gently sloped and are 1l long cfd highly under predicts the energy dissipation of the drifting plate the turbulent behaviour of the fluid which is excluded in the present research is likely to be the origin of errors also cfd is seen to under predict the energy dissipation corresponding to the non drifting plate exposed to longest waves again there might be some turbulent behaviour and extra energy damping that the present laminar model is missing it 4 results 4 1 overwash overwash flow was seen to occur for most of the cases with steepness higher than 0 08 the water can travel on the upper surface of the plate from both edges i e overwash occurs both at the front and rear edges of the plate snapshots of the overwash waves propagating on the upper surface of a thin non drifting plate are sampled and illustrated in fig 8 results presented in this figure correspond to the cfd simulations of the interaction between a non drifting plate and monochromatic wave with a wavelength of 1 26 l and steepness of 0 15 snapshots with a time step of t 4 are displayed at the very early stage bores are generated at the front edge of the plate and then wash the upper surface of it a blue arrow points to the bore running on the upper surface at the next stage the bore advances on the plate at this stage flow separation may occur at the bore front which leads to dissipation of energy at the third stage the crest of the incoming wave locates under the center of the plate and thus the water surface is not above the front edge of the plate in this condition water flow is separated from the plate surface a yellow arrow points to the flow separating from the plate air can then flow under the plate and an air cavity emerges such a phenomenon is likely to be caused by the lightness and shallow draft of the floating body which can lead to high pressure reduction when the front edge of the plate moves upward flow separation is more likely to occur for waves with higher steepness as the front edge of the plate can have larger vertical motions while the generated bore advances on the upper surface of the plate bores can also propagate on the upper surface of the plate from the rear edge at the third stage a red arrow points to the generated bore at the rear edge of the plate ultimately the plate is pitched down at the final stage in such a condition bore collision occurs somewhere between the rear edge of the plate and its center the front edge of the plate then moves downward and the described loop occurs again finally note that similar and also interesting numerical observations have been presented in tran duc et al 2020 where authors have reported that water washes the front edge of the plate and overwash that emerges in the rear edge is much weaker compared to the one emerging in the front edge samples of the time histories of overwash height at the front edge of the non drifting and drifting plates exposed to regular waves are shown in fig 9 time histories of the overwash height show nonlinear behavior which is similar to that of waves propagating in shallow water condition a sharp crest occurs at the time water washes the front edge of the plate then its value highly decreases and converges to zero it should be noted that similar behavior has been observed by skene et al 2015 presented results in this figure correspond to forcing condition with wavelength of 1 29l and wave steepness of 0 15 the overwash height is computed for both drifting and non drifting plates at the front edge of the plate the time history of the overwash height is computed and then its time average is calculated as explained earlier the results are shown in fig 10 for the case of both drifting and non drifting plates overwash height is found to increase by the increase in the wave steepness which agrees with the physics of the problem as the waves become larger the water surface is likely to locate at a higher position with respect to the plate overwash heights of both cases are seen to be very close when steepness is very small but by the increase in the wave steepness their values diverge from each other overwash height is seen to increase linearly by the increase in the wave steepness this is in consistence with observations of skene et al 2015 as the waves become longer steepness of overwash slightly decreases using the computed data and the observed behavior for the overwash height it is attempted to provide a function for prediction of the overwash height the parameter 31 s o w a i n h f b which refers to the potential height of the overwash is defined as obvious this parameter refers to the difference between freeboard and crest of the incoming wave the value of h o w s o w for all cases is found it is expected that h o w s o w vs λ l obeys an asymptotic behaviour at very long waves the overwash height converges to zero i e h o w s o w 0 as λ l in this condition waves are much longer than the length of the plate and body follows the wave motion so it is expected that no overwash flow occurs at the very short waves the value of h o w s o w is expected to be equal to 0 5 when waves are very short heave and pitch motion of a floating object converge to zero which means that h o w s o w is insensitive to the motion of the plate in such a situation h o w is half of s o w using the aforementioned limits h o w s o w can be formulated as 32 h o w s o w 0 5 1 tanh a λ l the value of a is computed using the curve fitting and is found to be 0 17 and 0 26 for the non drifting and drifting plates respectively the presented values are only limited to the present research for the case of floaing bodies with different designs or lower freeboard there might be a different behaviour which is needed to be studied later fig 11 displays the values of h o w s o w for both drifting and non drifting plates the cfd data is shown by symbol and the values given by curve fitting are denoted with curves at each wave length the mean value of h o w s o w is computed the error bars show the standard deviation of the data as seen in fig 11 the curves provide an asymptotic behavior for the overwash height the marked area refers to the boundary of simulations performed using the cfd model in which the curves and scattered data match to sum the proposed equation is seen to be reliable the values of overwash height that can be computed using equation 32 are also plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that the results given by the equation fairly match with cfd data 4 2 dynamic responses dynamic responses of the plate including heave and pitch motions are found in this section amplitudes of motions are set to be the responses as explained earlier dynamic responses of heave and pitch are shown in fig 12 the heave response is normalized using the wave amplitude a 3 a i n and the pitch response is normalized using wave steepness a 5 k a i n note that as mentioned earlier no sway and yaw motion is allowed heave response of the plate increases by the increase in the wave period and converges to 1 0 i e when waves becomes longer the plate tends to follow the wave motion which agrees with the physics of the problem for all forcing conditions the drifting plate has a smaller heave response note that when waves cause the plate to drift the following sea condition occurs which results in slightly smaller encounter frequency the difference between the heave response of the drifting case and non drifting cases become smaller by the increase in the wave steepness this behavior is consistent with what was observed for the relative speed of the plate in lower panels of fig 6 results show that an increase in wave height results in a reduction of the heave amplitude the possible reason for such a behavior is the increase in overwash height as was seen in fig 10 higher overwash can lead to smaller wave exciting forces as a proportion of the energy of waves is dissipated the pitch response of the plate increases by the increase in the wave period which fits with reality when the wavelengths become longer than the body the floating body follows the wave slope at the largest wave period gentle wave induces pitch responses ranging between 0 9 and 1 0 for both drifting and non drifting cases showing that the plate is following the wave motion at this wave condition wave induced pitch responses of the drifting plate are smaller compared to the pitch response of the non drifting plate results show that an increase in the wave steepness results in smaller pitch responses these effects are more significant for the case of the non drifting plate at the smallest wave period 4 3 energy analysis energy analysis is performed to explore the contribution of different factors on the wave energy attenuation sample of energy dissipation and time history of energy fluxes are shown in appendix d overwash energy and downwash energy of the plate are computed numerically as explained earlier all data are normalized using the energy flux of incoming wave the results are presented in fig 13 the overwash contribution in attenuation of wave energy becomes larger by the increase in wave steepness as expected as the wave period increases non dimensional overwash energy flux becomes smaller for the case of a drifting plate the energy attenuation caused by the overwash is smaller in comparison with the non drifting case it was previously seen that a drifting condition can partially decrease the overwash height which may lead to a lower level of overwash energy from a practical point of view the presented results show that when a floating body is very thin like a thin energy converter vlfs or a long ice floe energy can be highly dissipated above the plate it can reach up to 10 percent of the energy flux of the incoming wave such a phenomenon is reported to occur frequently in miz where analytical methods are observed to over predict wave energy transmission of steep waves by ice floes the downwash flow contribution in energy dissipation which is caused by shear stresses and the oscillating boundary is seen to increase as a function of wave steepness at the smallest wave heights energy attenuation under the non drifting plate is very small i e close to nil for the case of a drifting plate a larger portion of the energy is attenuated under the plate note that when a plate is drifting larger shear stresses can be caused under the plate this is likely to be caused by the frictional stresses under the body simply stated the friction force is larger results show that by the increase in the wave period less energy is attenuated under the plate which agrees with previous observations in fig 6 it was found that the difference between the stokes drift and drift speed decreases which results in smaller frictional force an increase in the wavelength is seen to decrease the energy dissipation occurring under both drifting and non drifting plates the downwash results show that in the actual ocean energy can be significantly dissipated under a floating body when waves are steep this mechanism becomes very important in case of slender floating bodies or segment covers such as oil or broken ice where waves can travel over a long distance under the body a very useful discussion on the roll of energy dissipation under different floating bodies ranging from ice floes to grease ice is presented in parra et al 2020 readers who are interest are referred to this paper it has been attempted to provide a non sophisticated equation for prediction of the overwash energy dissipation the energy flux of overwash is formulated as 33 e o w u o w 0 h o w 0 5 ρ w u o w 2 d z 0 h o w ρ w g z d z the above equation gives the mean value of overwash energy over a period similar equation has been used by herman et al 2019 and the proposed equation is inspired from that research the energy flux of overwash can be normalized using the energy flux of the incoming wave as 34 e o w e i n 4 k ω g 0 5 h o w 5 2 a i n 2 note that the above equation was formulated by setting u o w g h o w this means the velocity of the overwash is hypothesized to be equal to that horizontal velocity corresponding to dam break with a vertical level of h o w and is constant in vertical direction which is similar to physics of shallow water waves the equation proposed for computing the overwash height can be used for estimation of h o w the values given by this equation are substituted in equation 32 and then plotted in fig 13 data given by the proposed equation are seen to be close the cfd data properly overall the proposed equations for estimation of overwash energy and height are reliable enough to be used for the case of both free floating and moored bodies this equation can be therefore applied to analytical methods in order to compute the energy dissipation that might occur during mutual interaction of the body with water waves it is only required to find the overwash height which can be estimated using the difference between water height and the upper deck of a floating body also note that the overwash height might be smaller for the case of flexible bodies as body tends to follow the wave motion numerical evidences have been provided in huang et al 2020 and tran duc et al 2020 the downwash energy dissipation is also formulated as 35 e d w 0 5 ρ w c d u o r 3 0 5 ρ w c d 2 π a i n t 3 where u o r 2 π a i n t is the orbital velocity of the wave and c d is the drag coefficient of the plate the surface of the plate is set to be unite square as the problem is 2d and length of the plate equals 1 0 m more technical information about this equation can be found in hermans et al 2019 and voermans et al 2019 the above equation can be re written as 36 e d w e i n c d ω 2 k a i n g where c d 2 c d is the a new coefficient that emerges the values of the downwash energy dissipation are also computed using equation 36 and plotted in fig 14 the value of c d of non drifting and drifting plates are found using the cfd data being equal to 0 082 and 0 112 respectively c d of non drifting plate is very close to the drag coefficient of streamline body such as an airfoil of hydrofoil note that c d of a submerged foil body equals to 0 04 for the case of drifting body the coefficient is slightly larger it is also very important to note that these drag coefficients have seen to be accurate enough for the current geometry and density for the other floating bodies and other densities another value is recommended to be found also the value of coefficient might be a function of the wave velocity which is a function of wave steepness and wave frequency itself as the reynolds number increases it can be seen the given equation provides a linear behavior for the downwash energy which is close to that of numerical simulations the numerical data is seen to be marginally larger than the values found using the proposed equation at the smallest wavelength this equation can be also be implemented in analytical methods if both equations 35 and 36 are used the average amount of dissipated energy can be computed then the energy of waves by including energy dissipation can be obtained and more accurate transmitted and reflected wave fields can be re computed the energy attention in front of the leading edge of the plate is presented in fig 14 this mechanism is likely to be caused by the shear stress due to the interaction between water waves motions of the front edge of the plate slamming and also the fluid motion toward the upstream as the plate is drifted the normalized energy flux in the front field of the plate is seen to decrease with the increases in steepness value by the increase in wave steepness larger volume of water moves above the plate and thus the submergence of the plate increases this might weaken the vortex power in the front field of the plate in addition the physics of this damping mechanism can be viewed from another point the radiated waves from the plate are expected to be linked to the motions of the plate which was observed to decrease by the increase in steepness value the radiated wave which is expected to be turbulent due to low thickness of the body and slamming occurrence can interact with the reflected wave and thus it can damp the energy of the radiated waves therefore the increase in the wave steepness can decrease the energy dissipation occurring in the front field for the case of the drifted body in addition the drift motion can cause an extra perturbation in the wake of the body which is a highly turbulent flow this wave is similar to the wake of the two dimensional moving floating objects therefore for the case of the drifted plate the energy dissipation in the front field can be slightly higher at the smallest wavelength note that this wavelength causes the largest drift speed for the plate moreover the energy dissipation in the front field is converged to 2 of the energy of incoming wave as the steepness value increases when steepness is very small more dissipation occurs in addition the smallest wave period leads to relatively larger energy dissipation for the case of smallest steepness value wave frequency is larger thus shear stresses caused by plate motion and wave wave interaction are likely to damp waves the energy dissipation emerging in the front field of the plate is applicable in studying modeling of mobile bodies in the ocean such as broken ice floes which freely move under the force of waves and wind stresses to sum the wave energy dissipation caused by a thin floating plate is a very complicated physical problem and it is not very easy to find the main contributors i e it is not very straightforward to compute the amount of dissipated energy components separately many different factors including the shape of the body its drift speed freeboard and draft can affect the problem but the energy that is dissipated above the body and the amount of energy that is dissipated due to shear stresses under the body are expected to increase by the increase in the wave steepness the overwash energy dissipation can be represented by a dam break theory but it can be true for the case that the body does not get fully submerged the downwash energy dissipation highly depends on the form of the body but can be increased by the increase in wave orbital velocity near the front edge of the plate energy can again get dissipated but the mechanism is still not clear however the energy dissipated in the front field is much smaller compared to the overwash and downwash for the case of steep waves this confirms that the dissipation of the energy of steep waves that is caused by a floating plate is dominantly occurring above and under the plate 5 conclusions in this paper computational fluid dynamics is used to numerically model the laminar viscouse flow field around a thin rigid floating plate subjected to surface waves the aim was to understand the wave energy attenuation caused by different mechanisms cfd which provides us with the opportunity to sample data was embarked to do this task for us simulations were performed for two different situations first the plate was free to drift and then it was restrained in the longitudinal direction in order to explore how the drifting motion can influence the wave attenuation pattern after performing a mesh convergence study the numerical set up was validated by comparing the cfd data including the wave fields in the front and rear fields with previous experimental data of nelli et al 2017 good agreement between the cfd results and experimental data was observed it was shown that the cfd code can model overwash flow at both front and rear edges of the plate bores were shown to emerge at the front edge of the plate as it becomes submerged overwash height was shown to increase as a function of steepness of the incoming wave it was demonstrated that drift motion can lead to a decrease in the overwash height an increase in the wavelength resulted in a decrease of the overwash height an equation was proposed for estimation of the overwash height results of which were observed to be in fair agreement with cfd data the dynamic response of the plate in the vertical plane was also found to depend on wave steepness through the increase in the wave height motions were seen to decrease the plate with drift motion was seen to have smaller heave and pitch responses as expected energy attenuation analysis showed that both overwash and downwash can noticeably dissipate the energy of waves i e they can dissipate up to 20 percent of the energy of incoming wave the former can be partially larger in the case of plates fixed in a longitudinal direction the latter when waves cause the body to drift the overwash energy was seen to increase with the increase in wave steepness the energy dissipation triggered by the overwash was formulated by comparing the results of the formulated equation against performed cfd simulations the proposed formula is seen to provide reliable accuracy it was shown that the downwash energy linearly increases with steepness using the orbital velocity of the wave the downwash energy was also formulated and the values obtained from the equation agree with performed cfd simulations in the front field of the plate the energy was seen to be damped as well the mechanism that leads to dissipation of the energy in that zone is not very clear but the radiated waves from the body and wave wave interaction are the possible drivers of the energy dissipation in the front field the increase in the wave steepness was seen to highly decrease energy dissipation in the font field which confirms that we can only consider energy dissipation occurring above and under the plate overall while analytical methods have been found to provide a reliable prediction of the fluid motion around the floating bodies their application might be limited to the gentle waves as they cannot capture energy dissipation occurring above or under the floating body exposed to large waves cfd models can be used for simulation of the problem in this case cfd simulations performed using laminar flow assumption can provide a relatively reliable amount of energy dissipation but in order to provide a more accurate prediction of the fluid motion turbulent simulation should be performed in future in future studies it is recommended that modeling fluid flow around a thin floater exposed to water waves to be carried out by different turbulence models specifically this problems becomes more important for the case of long bodies such as elastic ice cover and multi body system such as an array of ice floes the effects of a thin plate on a full wave spectrum and irregular waves still needs to be studied as it is expected that nonlinear interaction between water waves become more important when greater number of harmonics are involved also the effects of the deformations on the overwash flow and dispersion have not been analyzed in the present research as rigid body simulations were conducted study of such a problem is a possible future study that can provide more understanding of the wave interaction with floating bodies credit authorship contribution statement sasan tavakoli

rigid body motion equations equations of motion for a rigid body are established by using the newton law centre of gravity is assumed to be the centre of motions motions are first formulized for all six motions linear acceleration of the centre of the mass of the rigid body can be written as a 1 f m x where x x y z denotes the acceleration vector of the centre of the mass which is relative to the

can be written as w 0 0 m g the three motion equations can be formulated as a 16 m x f x a 17 m z f z m g a 18 i θ m θ appendix b comparison between turbulent and laminar simulations a comparison between turbulent and laminar simulations is presented in this appendix as stated earlier turbulent may be strong in real physics as overwash occurs and waves are steep but all simulations are performed using a laminar model in the present paper therefore a comparison between laminar and turbulent simulations can show us how acceptable the laminar simulation is turbulent simulation is performed using openfoam and reynolds averaged equations known as rans are solved the k omega shear stress turbulence model is used to compute the extra viscousity caused by the turbulent of the flow the related equations are not presented here they can be found in many related cfd books or papers see e g in develoder et al 2018 simulation is only performed for the wave period of 0 9 s corresponding to the wavelength of 1 29l the steepest wave is generated and the motions of the plate as well as fluid motion are computed over the time simulations are run for 30 wave cycles time histories of the water surface elevation computed by laminar and turbulent models are shown in figure b 1 as apparent both models are following each other resulting in very similar water surface elevation in the rear field at some cycles the turbulent model might lead to higher or smaller crest which is expected to occur flow is turbulent and thus there is less consistency between the cycles also for the case of the turbulent simulations the frequency of waves is seen to get slightly smaller than that of the laminar simulations this shows that there might be a nonlinear phenomenon developed during the wave interaction with the plate affecting the wave frequency corresponding to the turbulent simulation fig b 1 comparison between the turbulent dashed black and laminar solid red simulations in computation of the transmitted water waves the data corresponds to the wavelength of 1 29l and steepness value of 0 15 fig b 1 time history of the overwash at the front edge of the plate is presented in figure b 2 the data computed by both turbulent and laminar simulations is presented in figure b 2 the data computed by both models show some similarities the overwash wave computed by the turbulent model is seen to reach a smaller peak as the time grows but the peak computed by laminar simulation is seen to slightly increases the differences between the peaks of the two models might reach up to 15 percent this shows that for the case of a turbulent model there might be some energy damping in the vicinity of the front edge of the plate leading to smaller overwash height fig b 2 comparison between the turbulent dashed black and laminar solid red simulations in computation of the overwash height the data corresponds to the wavelength of 1 29l and steepness value of 0 15 fig b 2 energy fluxes of the flow under the two edges of the plate computed by laminar and turbulent models are displayed in figure b 3 the results are seen to be very close to each other the turbulent simulations however is seen to slightly diverge from that of the laminar simulations as the time grows the turbulent simulation is seen to have slightly smaller amplitude under the front edge it can be around 5 percent of the data computed by laminar simulation this again shows that a small proportion of the energy is likely to be damped behind the front edge of the plate fig b 3 comparison between the turbulent dashed black and laminar solid red simulations in computation of the energy flux under the front left and rear right edges of the plate the data corresponds to the wavelength of 1 29l and steepness value of 0 15 fig b 3 time history of heave and pitch motions of the plate subjected to waves is presented in figure b 4 as seen the response computed by both models follow each other for the case of heave motion turbulent model might predict slightly smaller response for the case of pitch motion no significant difference is observed the turbulent model is likely to lead to a slightly smaller exciting heave force but it can not have any effect on pitching moment fig b 4 comparison between the turbulent dashed black and laminar solid red simulations in computation of the heave and pitch motions of the plate the data corresponds to the wavelength of 1 29l and steepness value of 0 15 fig b 4 to numerically replicate the problem with laminar model simulation of every sampled time step 0 05 s needs around 2 min and half of run on 32 cores but to simulate similar amount of physical time the turbulent model needs longer computational time as turbulent equations are solved simultaneously turbulent model needs nearly 4 min to advance 0 05 s which is nearly 1 6 times larger compared to that of laminar model in addition the data corresponding to every sampled time step needs 240 mb of storage but when it comes to turbulent model around 420 mb is required due to the low differences between the results of the turbulent and laminar models which vary between 5 and 10 percent in most of situations and the limitations with storage and having faster runs laminar model which has also found to have proper accuracy in computation of wave fields and energy dissipation is used in the present paper appendix c linear potential theory an elastic body is assumed to float on the water surface in a two dimensional spatial domain as demonstrated in figure c 1 the floating body is exposed to the train of incoming waves fluid around the domain is assumed to be single phase and perfect i e no shear stresses occur and the viscosity of fluid is zero therefore the fluid motion can be represented using the potential field φ x z t horizontal and vertical velocity are given by c 1 u x x z t x φ c 2 u z x z t z φ by assuming that wave steepness is small linear theory governs the whole fluid domain therefore potential field around the body can be written as c 3 φ x z t re ϕ x z exp i ω t vertical deformations in the body also follow the linear theory and deformations in the body can be written as c 4 z x z t re z x z exp i ω t a laplace equation governs the fluid motion as c 5 2 ϕ 0 on x and d z 0 free surface obeys a linear kinematic condition given by c 6 z ϕ ω 2 g 1 ϕ on x l 2 and l 2 x and z 0 an impermeable condition is satisfied on the seabed as c 7 z ϕ 0 on x and z d a linear elastic theory represents the governing equation on the vertical deformations in the floating plate as c 8 1 ω 2 g 1 z y h 3 ρ w g 1 υ 2 on l 2 x l 2 and d z 0 in equation c 8 y is the young modules h is the plate thickness and υ is the poisson s ratio a fluid structure condition is prescribed for the interface between fluid and solid as c 9 z ϕ ω 2 g 1 z on l 2 x l 2 and z d the following problem can be solved analytically by using eigenfunction matching the solution gives the free surface elevation of transmitted and reflected water waves as c 10 η t t a i n cos k x ω t ε t and c 11 η r r a i n cos k x ω t ε r where c 12 t a t a i n c 13 r a r a i n for a pvc plate with density of 0 596 ρ w young modules of 500 mpa and thickness of 0 01l energy transmission coefficient t 2 is found to be 0 74 0 87 and 0 94 for wavelengths of 1l 1 29l and 1 56l respectively note that this model is not developed by the authors and no code is established in the present research the transmission coefficients are extracted from the work of nelli et al 2017 fig c 1 schematic showing the wave thin body interaction with consideration of the ideal flow fig c 1 appendix d samples of energy fluxes sample of energy fluxes are shown to in this appendix to provide understanding of the energy damping the wave energy fluxes are recorded and sampled the results presented in the this appendix corresponds to the simulations run for the drifting plate subjected to the regular waves with wave period of 0 9 s and steepness value of 0 15 the wavelength corresponds to this wavelength is 1 29l figure d 1 shows a sample of the overwash energy flux overwash energy is seen to behave similarly to shallow water wave the energy reaches a maximum value and then it converges to zero it is zero over half of the period and then it rises and reaches a peak value the average value is shown by a dashed blue line fig d 1 time history of overwash energy flux correspond to the water waves with period of 0 9 s and steepness value of 0 15 the dashed blue line shows the average value which is defined as the overwash energy dissipation used in the present research fig d 1 figure d 2 shows a sample of the energy flux under two boundaries of the plate the difference between energy fluxes of these two boundaries over a period can help us to compute the downwash energy dissipation the red solid curve refers to the time history of energy flux under the front edge of the plate the energy flux under the front edge of the plate is seen to be highly nonlinear its crest is seen to be long and its trough is sharper compared to the crest two phenomenon can lead to such a behaviour one is the overwash flow that is excluded from the wave energy flux and corresponds to the crest moreover as observed earlier an air cavity might emerge under the rigid body as the plate edge of the plate moves upward these nonlinear phenomenon can cause smaller energy flux in the crest region the dashed blue curve shows the energy flux under the rear edge of the plate the energy flux as seen is reduced this reduction has occurred for both crest and trough but the aforementioned reduction is higher for the case of trough the reduction is likely to be caused by the shear stresses resulted from viscosity which lacks in the linear potential models and also pressure reduction the difference between average values of energy fluxes gives the energy attenuation occurring under the plate over the time period considered in the present research this amount is nearly 0 08e in fig d 2 time history of energy flux under the front edge downwash energy flux correspond to the water waves with period of 0 9 s and steepness value of 0 15 the solid red and dashed blue curves repetitively show the energy flux under the front and rear edges of the plate the data corresponds to the water waves with period of 0 9 s and steepness of 0 15 fig d 2 time histories of the energy fluxes at two point in front field of the plate are shown in figure d 3 one of the curves refers to the point juts behind the front edge and the other one refers to the point located at x λ from the edge the energy flux at the point closer to the front edge the blue curve is seen to be lower this point represents the amount of energy flux just near the plate at the other point the average value energy flux is seen to be higher this means that an amount of energy of reflected wave propagating toward the inlet is damped the difference between the average values of the energy fluxes at these two points give the energy dissipation occurring in the front field this energy dissipation is likely to be caused by the motion of the plate slamming and the interaction between incoming and reflected waves as mentioned in the manuscript fig d 3 time history of energy flux at two points in the front field the solid red curve shows the energy flux just near the front edge and the dashed blue curve shows the energy flux at another point being one wavelength further from the

understanding of dissipative mechanisms in drifting and non drifting conditions cfd model is validated by comparing the obtained results against previously published data of nelli et al 2017 it is shown that the energy of the waves is dissipated by the water flow over both upper and lower surfaces of the plate the dissipation increases as a function of steepness of incoming waves on the upper surface of the non drifting plate overwash contributes to dissipation of the energy of steep waves while this effect is slightly smaller when the plate is moving freely simple equations are used for estimating the overwash height and energy fluxes which are found to be in fair agreement with the present cfd simulations the energy dissipation due to the shear stresses under the surface of the plate is seen to be higher when the body is drifting in the longitudinal direction equations for the energy dissipation under the plate are also formulated and are observed to follow the results of

rad 1 introduction the interaction between water waves and thin floating objects bodies with shallow freeboard and draft is an interesting topic which can have applications in different fields of science and engineering linked to the ocean studying this problem can provide fundamental information for wave forecasting that can be applied to coastal seas along with marginal ice zones miz liu et al 2020 and also can be very useful in the hydrodynamic design of very large floating bodies vlfs lamas pardo et al 2015 floating breakwaters wave energy converters floating bridges etc this problem however is complicated embracing different physical phenomena such as energy attenuating which may be caused by scattering and non scattering mechanisms ardhuin et al 2016 wave induced motions squire 1984a drift hermans 1999 deformations in the case of elastic meylan 2019 or visco elastic bodies zhao and shen 2015 overwash skene et al 2015 and slamming huarte et al 2011 the wave thin plate interaction refers to the reciprocal action of water waves and a floating object with the shallow draft and freeboard the floating object is subjected to the waves waves may cause dynamic or flexural motions to the floating object depending on the rheological nature of the body squire 2007 waves can also cause the body to drift eltahan and eltahan 1983 the floating body on the other hand may affect the physical nature of the wave field in different ways by changing the propagating wave energy reflecting the waves or dissipating its energy meylan 2002 or by changing group velocity speed of the energy propagation e g collins 2016 note that this mechanism is inactive for rigid floating bodies considered in this paper it has been observed that the fluid motion around the floating body becomes more complicated when the draft and the freeboard are very small when the draft is shallow the front and rear edges of the body tend to exit the water and then slam on its surface as they re enter the water bennetts et al 2015 causing the generation of irregular waves in both front and rear fields when the freeboard of the object is shallow steep waves propagate on the upper surface of the plate causing a phenomenon called overwash overwash has been seen to cause an extra energy attenuation which becomes larger by the increase in the wave steepness dolatshah et al 2018 the first option to model the wave thin plate interaction is to use analytical methods where the fluid is assumed to be ideal i e nil viscosity fluid under such an assumption dynamic response of the body to the waves and its effects on the wave field which provide wave transmission and reflection can be found through the solution of radiation and diffraction problems yu et al 2019 different mathematical methods such as the expansion of eigenfunctions can be used to solve the fluid field around the body such methodologies have been found to have a greater ability to simulate the problem for gentle waves and bodies with non shallow draft mathematical models have the potential to be used in the case of flexible bodies meylan 2002 blyth et al 2011 a discussion on challenges with propagation of elastic waves into floating body is presented in korobkin et al 2011 considering ideal flow leads to a conserved based solution for the problem i e viscosity is neglected and the effects of shear stresses vanish in this condition the ideal flow assumption has been found to over predict the height of transmitted waves when steep waves encounter the floating body the overwash flow and corresponding dissipated energy also cannot be modeled using the ideal flow assumption skene et al 2015 when a floater is very thin and waves are highly sloped overwash and energy dissipation are more likely to occur also flow regime is expected to be turbulent in this condition viscous flow needs to be considered the solution of which cannot be achieved through analytical approaches and ideal flow assumption the viscouse flow can empower us to model the air water interaction vortex formation wave breaking and the extreme motions of the floating object subjected to waves which lacks in the analytical models also turbulent behaviour of the flow can be modeled using a viscous flow assumption navier stokes ns equations govern the fluid motion in this case simulation of the velocity field around viscous flow needs numerical techniques computational fluid dynamics cfd is used to discretize equations and the computational domain is divided into a finite number of cells stern et al 2015 when the cfd codes are used for numerical simulation of any problem it is very straightforward to sample data such as velocity field which helps us to understand the physics of the phenomenon in more detail cfd models have been used for simulation of marine hydrodynamic problems since the early 1960s good accuracy of the cfd codes in the modeling sea loads izadi et al 2018 the dynamic of offshore structures and ships esfandiari et al 2019 khojasteh and kamali 2018 and free surface flows teuber et al 2019 khojasteh et al 2020 has been reported by different authors recently researchers have taken advantage of cfd codes to numerically model the wave plate interaction bai et al 2017 used cfd codes to model the dynamic responses of different floating bodies similar to ice floes huang et al 2018 2019 huang and thomas 2019 provided simulations for the wave motion in thin flexible ice the main previous cfd based simulations centering on wave plate interaction have highlighted validating and verifying while these aforementioned aspects are of high importance there is a pressing need to understand the role of the dissipative mechanisms which in the long term can allow us to formulate energy dissipation it can be used as a forecasting tool for wave modeling or as a hydrodynamic tool for design of the floating objects simply stated at the current time it is desirable to take steps to increase the body of knowledge about the wave plate interaction by taking the advantage of cfd simulations in the present paper the interaction between a thin rigid floating plate with water waves is numerically investigated in order to understand the role of different mechanisms in energy dissipation the fluid field is assumed to be two phase and viscous allowing us to compute the energy dissipation which is more likely to occur for steep waves a numerical set up for the problem is presented to solve the motion of the floating body exposed to surface waves simulations are performed for the case of drifting and non drifting plates using openfoam and are validated by comparing the obtained results against recent experimental research performed at the university of melbourne results of the drifting and non drifting plates are compared against each other to explore how the mooring may affect energy dissipation also by using the cfd data and by simplifying the physics of the problem parameterisations are developed to compute different physical properties of the problem the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the problem description and numerical model section 3 includes validation of the numerical set up section 4 contains the main results of the paper and discussions section 5 summarizes the current work and presents the concluding remarks 2 numerical model 2 1 problem definition in the present research a thin rigid plate is assumed to float on the water surface the plate is 1 m long and 0 01 m thick and is subjected to the monochromatic waves with wavelengths comparable to the length of plate the plate has a density of 0 596 ρ w note that the density considered for the plate equals that of pvc 1 1 polyvinyl chloride which has been used in the experiments utilized for the validation study in the present paper see nelli et al 2017 it is interesting to note that floating fixed breakwaters may be constructed with pvc also the density of the plate is very close to that of wood which can be around 0 6 ρ w to 0 9 ρ w the considered density for the plate thus can have engineering applications e g breakwaters and wooden barges pontoons also the dimensions of plate are set to be similar to that of experiments but the results presented in the rest of research are all non dimensional that allows us to interpret data regardless of its physical dimensions an overview of problem studied in the present research is sketched in fig 1 the problem embraces two different motions including solid and fluid motions the solid motion includes the rigid body response of the body as it is subjected to the waves the fluid motion deals with the movement of fluid around the floating body as it can also rigidly move the boundary value problem that governs the fluid motion depends on the assumptions made for the fluid which are presented in sub section 2 2 overall as the plate is subjected to gravity waves it transmits a proportion of the energy of the water waves and reflects another proportion as seen in fig 1 some physical assumptions are made for the problem that can help us to establish the boundary conditions are explained here note that the domain boundary and boundary conditions are presented in sub section 2 4 waves are assumed not to be reflected from far fields both in front and rear field i e the transmitted wave will never be reflected and its energy is faded away in far field seabed is assumed to be impermeable in addition the water depth is assumed to be constant wave induced motions occur and the plate undergoes heave pitch and longitudinal motions including drift and surge fluid is assumed not to slip on the body of the floating plate and the plate is assumed to be impermeable the interface between water and air the free surface is assumed to be governed by strongly non linear condition it means that waves can be broken and the energy can be dissipated again note that the fluid problem is solved by designing a computational domain and setting boundary condition which are presented in sub section 2 4 to formulate the rigid body motion three different coordinate systems are defined the first coordinate system is an earth fixed frame denoted by o x e z e which rests on the calm water as shown in fig 1 the second one is a hydrodynamic frame shown by o x h z h this coordinate system is located on the calm water line but moves with the floating plate if waves cause it to drift this frame is fixed in the vertical direction and cannot have any heave and pitch motions the last defined coordinate system is a body fixed frame shown by g x b z b which is attached to the plate resting on its centre of gravity note that the problem is considered to be two dimensional hence no lateral coordinate is taken into account and no sway and yaw motion is modeled heave and pitch motions of the plate are defined as the relative movement of the body frame with respect to the hydrodynamic frame drift motion of the floating plate refers to the longitudinal movement of the hydrodynamic frame with respect to the earth frame the equations governing the motions of the plate are given by 1a m x f x 1b m z f z m g 1c i θ m θ where m and i respectively refer to the mass of plate and its inertia f x and f z are fluid forces acting on the plate in horizontal and vertical directions i e f f x i f z k m θ is the pitching moment acting on the plate note that all forces are generated by the fluid flow and can contain added mass damping and restoring mechanisms the derivation of the governing equation on rigid body motion of the plate is described in appendix a water waves are assumed to interact with the floating body the incoming wave obeys the linear water wave theory and is given by 2 η x e t a i n cos k x e ω t ε where η is the free surface elevation a i n is the amplitude of the wave ω is the wave frequency ω 2 π t t is the wave period k is the wavenumber k 2 π λ λ is the wavelength and ε is the phase shift of the incoming wave it is assumed that waves propagate in the deep water conditions the deep water dispersion equation relates frequency and wavenumber as follows 3 ω 2 g k 2 2 fluid equations in the present paper as explained in section 1 it is presumed that the fluid flow is two phase including air and water which provides us with the opportunity to consider the wave air interaction and non linear free surface boundary condition both phases of the fluid flow are supposed to be viscous and the relation between velocity gradient and shear stresses is governed by the newtonian fluid law such an assumption as mentioned earlier allows us to model vortex formation and shear stresses therefore the energy dissipation that might occur due to overwash or shear stresses can be modeled as explained in the literature such mechanisms might emerge when a floater is very light and thin which triggers energy dissipation in the case of steep waves note that when waves are gently sloped and the floating body is thick an ideal flow assumption has reliable accuracy and can be used for modeling the fluid motion around the thin floating body in summary the viscous assumption made for the fluid motion makes the present paper different from the analytical based one by empowering us in computation of shear stresses and energy dissipation simply stated the analytical models that solve the potential velocity field around the body do not model any energy dissipation which is important to be considered for the case of thin floating bodies fluid in the whole domain is assumed to be incompressible as the speed of the sound in both air and water is far higher than the speed of the fluid flow the velocity field is denoted by u u x x t i u z x t k where the first and second terms respectively refer to the horizontal and vertical components of velocity vector at any point the fluid flow obeys the continuity and navier stokes equations 4 u 0 5 t ρ e u ρ e u u p μ e 2 u ρ e g in eqs 4 and 5 ρ e and μ e respectively denote the effective density and viscosity of the mixture of the water and air g g k is the gravity acceleration vector two phase flow is modeled using the volume of fluid vof approach which employs a volume fraction shown by φ to identify the amount of water at any point φ is computed by 6 φ v w v 1 v a v where subscripts a and w respectively refer to air and water here v is the volume of any finite volume effective viscosity and density of the mixed fluid are respectively computed by 7 ρ e x t ρ w φ x t ρ a 1 φ x t 8 μ e x t μ w φ x t μ a 1 φ x t the volume fraction obeys a conservation law given by 9 t φ φ u u r φ 1 φ 0 in the above equation u r is the compression velocity of the free surface using pressure p and stresses σ acting on the plate fluid force and moment vectors are found as 10 f s p n σ n d s 11 m s p n r σ n r d s where s refers to the surface of the plate n and r respectively stand for unit normal and position vectors to model the problem it is required to numerically solve the dynamic motions of the plate 1a 1c ns equations 4 and 5 and equation 9 along with the boundary conditions which are presented later sub section 2 4 solution of these equations helps us to study the energy dissipation by the upper and lower surfaces of the plate the mentioned equations indeed represent a strongly coupled rigid body dynamic and fluid motion problem the unknowns are the motions of the plate x z θ velocity field u pressure filed p and volume fraction φ the coupled rigid body and fluid motion problem cannot be solved analytically as the set of ns and volume fraction equations are strongly nonlinear and are coupled with the motion equations at the same time the main difficulty is that the ns equations are fully nonlinear and in addition the free surface flow is captured through volume fraction method and eulerian approach thus the governing equations cannot be solved using analytical methods note that only available solutions for ns equations are related to very simple problems like flow between two walls with no slip condition technical information regarding ns equations and the need to use numerical methods can be found in chapter 5 of graebel 2007 the main difference of the present cfd model with the previous potential based models is the governing equations ns when ns equations are solved to model the free surface unlike the potential based models the free surface is not considered to be an upper boundary and it is captured by using the volume fraction value therefore governing equations are solved in a enclosed numerical domain bounded with an upper boundary an air patch and a seabed and the whole domain is filled with a mixture of air and water in addition unlike the potential based models ns equations does not secure the conservation of wave energy and wave energy can be damped by different mechanisms this occurs as the viscousity term that links the shear stresses to velocity gradients leads to energy damping within the problem to numerically solve the problem it is required to use numerical methods to solve the problem over time a numerical domain as stated is designed which helps us to numerically reproduce the problem by setting boundary conditions for velocity pressure and volume fraction which are unknown variables the method for simulation of the problem is described in sub section 2 4 but there are some other parameters like water surface elevation and the amount of dissipated energy that can be computed by using velocity vector pressure field and volume fraction the method for computation of these parameters is explained sub section 2 3 2 3 mathematical formulations for computing different parameters as mentioned earlier the unknowns including velocity field pressure field volume fraction and dynamic responses of the plate are computed through solving the coupled ns equations conservation of volume fraction and dynamic response of the plate but there are some other parameters like water surface elevation at any point or energy flux that are of interest which should be calculated over the time these parameters are computed by using the velocity field pressure and volume fraction at every single time step the method for computation of them is explained in this sub section 2 3 1 free surface the free surface elevation at any longitudinal position of the numerical domain is computed as 12 η x e t d φ d z e where d is the water depth of the numerical tank the free surface elevation in the front field gives the superposition of incoming wave and reflected wave on the other hand the height of free surface at the rear filed provides the transmitted wave amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected waves are computed using a zero crossing method which is very common to be used for analysis of water waves in oceanography thompson and emery 2014 the averages value of the amplitudes of the free surface elevation at front and rear fields are set to be the amplitude of the waves the overwash height is calculated by 13 η o w x e t z p φ d z e where z p is the vertical position of the upper surface of the plate and is computed using the rigid body dynamic laws time average value of overwash height is defined as the average value of the η o w l 2 t as 14 h o w x e t 1 25 t 5 30 t η o w l 2 t d t time average is computed over twenty five cycles the first five cycles are neglected as a ramp function lasting for four periods is considered and in addition simulations are last to consider 25 cycles to satisfy recommendations of the ittc 2 3 2 dynamic responses dynamic of the body is solved over the physical time using the instant values of the forces and moments acting on the surface of the body z and θ vary over time and are assumed to show linear behavior i e energy of the motion is focused on one harmonic being equal to the encounter frequency the responses are plotted over the time domain then the amplitude of each period of heave and pitch motions of the plate are computed using a zero crossing method in the case the plate is set to be free in longitudinal direction waves cause the plate to drift the instant velocity of the hydrodynamic frame with respect to the earth frame is found the average value of this speed is set to be the drift speed of the plate 2 3 3 energy fluxes the energy flux passing through any fixed vertical surface locating at x e of the domain is computed by 15 e x e t d φ ρ w g z e p 0 5 u 2 u n s d z e here n s refers to the normal vector of the surface the energy flux at any vertical columns above or under the plate is computed by 16 e x e t z p φ ρ w g z e p 0 5 u 2 u n s u s n s d z e and 17 e x e t d z p φ ρ w g z e p 0 5 u 2 u n s u s n s d z e where u s is the velocity vector of the surface it is important to note that the vertical surface may move with body depending on the physics of the problem the rate of energy dissipation by overwash is defined as 18 e o w t e l 2 t note that it is assumed that the total amount of energy that propagates above the plate is dissipated this assumption cannot be true for the case that plate gets fully submerged as it might transmits the waves in the way a submerged breakwater plate does for the case of the present problem however since the body is partially washed by the water and the front edge of the plate comes out of water and re enters it this assumption may not lead to large errors the energy dissipation under the plate which is caused by the oscillatory boundary and the friction is computed by 19 e d w e l 2 t e l 2 t where e l 2 t is the energy flux under the front edge and e l 2 t is the energy flux under the rear edge of the plate the difference between the mean value of these two boundaries show how the energy is attenuated under the plate the final values for overwash and downwash energy dissipation are computed by computing their time average values over the time as 20 e o w 1 25 5 t 30 t e o w t d t and e d w 1 25 5 t 30 t e d w t d t the rate of energy attenuation caused near the front edge of the plate where vortex generation might be caused is compute by 21 e s t 1 25 t 25 t 5 t 30 t e l 2 λ t e l 2 t d t the above relation represents the amount of the energy that is dissipated in the front field of the plate energy flux is computed at two different points the first point is located just near the front edge and the other is located at a point that is one wavelength far from the front edge the front field is expected to partially damps the energy of reflected as vortex generation might occur when the plate gets submerged technical information regarding vortex generation in upstream and downstream of a submerged plate can be found in poupardin et al 2012 the difference between average values of the energy fluxes at these two different points give the energy attenuation in the front field the nonlinear interaction between water waves and shear stresses caused by the front boundary of moving boundary of the plate can also in this energy dissipation mechanism the work rate power of the drift motion done by the plate can also be computed by 22 e w 1 25 5 t 25 t f x u d d t but the work rate is neglected in the present study and it is assumed that its contribution in energy attenuation is so low technical information regarding the energy extraction by the motion of a floating rigid body can be found in wang et al 2020 energy fluxes should satisfy the energy conservation in the a control volume by assuming a control volume bounded by two surfaces one in the front and one in the rear filed it is written that 23 d t e c v e f s e r s e o w e d w e s 0 in eq 23 d t e c v refers to the rate of the energy in the control volume e f s and e r s respectively denote the energy fluxes passing through the front and rear surfaces which are given by 24 e f s e i n e r 25 e r s e t energy in the whole domain is expected to have a zero rate during each period thus d t e c v 0 terms in equation 23 can be normalized by using e i n this equation therefore is re written as 26 1 e r e i n e t e i n e o w e i n e d w e i n e s e i n 0 using the linear wave theory e r and e t are formulated as 27 e r e i n 0 25 ω k 1 ρ w g a r 2 0 25 ω k 1 ρ w g a i n 2 r 2 28 e r e i n 0 25 ω k 1 ρ w g a t 2 0 25 ω k 1 ρ w g a i n 2 t 2 equation 26 is re written as 29 1 r 2 t 2 d 0 where d is the normalized energy dissipation and is given by 30 d e o w e i n e d w e i n e d e i n note that the values that are determined for the overwash dawnwah and energy dissipation in the front field provides the specific use of the viscous flow assumption made in this paper which helps us to reach our aim understanding of energy dissipation mechanisms this cannot be found through modeling of the irrotational flow which makes the present model different from a potential based one a pictograph of the considered control volume the plate and surfaces is demonstrated in fig 2 2 4 computational method as explained earlier ns equations govern the fluid problem and cannot be solved analytically numerical techniques can be used to solve the problem numerically to numerically solve the problem a computational domain is defined in which waves are generated and the body is exposed to them governing equations are solved in this domain the domain is set to have a length of 31l and the front edge of the floating plate is settled at a distance of 4l from the left end of the domain note that l is the length of the plate the dimensions of the domain satisfy the recommendations of international towing tank committee ittc see ittc 2017 but note that it is attempted to have a longer downstream length to ensure that wave reflection does not affect the simulations as the wave absorption in openfoam is based on the shallow water wave theory this numerical tank sketched in upper panel of fig 3 represents the domain of problem in which governing equations are solved this numerical tank is bounded by one patch in left and one patch in right the depth of the tank is set to be constant in the whole domain in addition there is an upper patch covering the whole length of the tank all the mentioned surfaces patches are the boundaries of the problem domain the conditions that are set on the boundaries are chosen in a way that they match with physical assumptions made in sub section 2 1 boundary conditions are set as bellow an inlet boundary is defined at the left end of the domain where the waves are numerically generated see details of this bc in higuera et al 2013 a far field outlet boundary condition is set at the right end of the domain where the train of transmitted waves are damped note that zero gradient condition for the volume fraction and pressure is prescribed at the outlet this boundary satisfies the far field boundary condition described in sub section 2 1 no slip boundary condition is set at the floor of the numerical domain also neumann boundary condition is set for φ and p at bottom of the domain conditions set for the bottom agree with the physics of impermeable seabed described in sub section 2 1 the surface of the plate is set to behave as a moving wall and no slip condition is prescribed for fluid motion zero gradient pressure and volume fraction conditions are set at walls of the plate these conditions provide an impermeable moving oscillating boundary condition that matches with the assumption made for the walls of floating plate an open atmosphere boundary condition is established at the upper edge of the domain where air can leave or enter the domain depending on the local pressure a summary of the boundary conditions set for the surfaces patches of the domain are presented in table 1 deep wave condition is used for the domain i e λ d 0 5 note that d is the water depth an overset region with dimensions of 3 l 50 h is generated and the plate is located at the center of this sub domain this region moves with the body 2 4 1 numerical technique numerical simulation of the fluid field is performed using the finite volume method fvm and openfoam library an open source object oriented package for cfd simulation of the fluid flow a helpful overview of this code can be found in jasak 2008 the pimple algorithm which is a combination of piso pressure implicit with splitting of operator and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations schemes is used for simulating the ns equations over the time domain the transient terms are numerically discretized by means of crank nicolson method the courant number is set to be lower than 0 5 during the simulation to avoid divergence of simulations the first order upwind fou scheme is used to discretize the convection equations diffusion terms of the ns equations are interpreted using a second order central scheme the interpolations in the numerical domain are set to be performed using a linear scheme the interpolation performed within the overset regime is performed using inversedistance library the solver used for numerical simulation is the overinterdymfoam which solves the dynamic motion of a body in two phase flow condition the tolerance values in computation of the displacement and pressure are respectively set to be 10 6 and 10 8 note that fluid flow is set to be laminar in the present research i e no turbulent simulation is performed in reality turbulent regimes are more likely to occur but by using a laminar simulation in the present study and considering turbulent regimes in future studies we can understand the role of different mechanisms in energy dissipation in a stepwise approach understanding the role of different mechanisms in energy dissipation cannot be achieved in physical testing or field observations therefore a laminar flow regime is prescribed for the fluid field around the floating body in future studies it would be necessary to use turbulent simulation to understand the role of turbulent stresses in energy dissipation turbulence might be stronger in some other cases and should be considered in the models for the case of very long bodies floating objects with large pitch responses and multi bodies such as an array of floating bodies turbulence gets stronger turbulence can significantly contribute in energy dissipation and needs to be considered these studies are part of future aims therefore while turbulent is not considered at the current stage it will be implemented in next steps where longer and elastic bodies will be studied finally note that a comparison between laminar and turbulent simulations is presented in appendix c which shows the differences between these two models the differences are not very significant the governing equations on the motions are solved using a fifth order cash karb embedded runge kutta method note that the water is initially set to be at rest and then waves are generated but a ramp function is used for the generation of waves and the ramp time is set to be 4 t simulations are run up to 30 t this helps us to analyze the simulations for 25 cycles this amount of time is in consistent with recommendations of ittc for testing of water waves interacting with ships vessels note that the present problem is similar to seakeeping of ships in zero speed conditions and can be modeled based on ittc recommendations at every single time step the velocity vector the pressure field and the volume fraction are computed in the numerical domain and the pressure field along with shear stresses are used to calculate the force and then the dynamic response of the plate 2 4 2 mesh generation the numerical domain is descritiezed into finite volumes in order to solve the fluid flow using the fvm framework the cells are generated using a library known as blockmesh a structured methodology is used for mesh generation all cells are prescribed to be hexagonal and to have a cubic shape such a descritization leads to orthogonal cells that decrease the numerical errors and accelerate numerical simulations the methodology used for mesh generation has been used as the geometry of the domain is simple the size of the cells is set to be finer around the free surface where larger variation in speed pressure and volume fraction might occur during every time step coarser cells are generated in the far field domain note that finer cells are also produced in the overset region it is noted that while a dynamic problem is being solved cells do not deform instead cells located in the overset region move with the body demirdzic and peric 1998 also note that no jump condition occurs near the boundaries of the domain four different grids are generated and a mesh convergence study is carried out a schematic of the mesh is shown in lower panel of fig 3 the size of the cells in the vicinity of the plate for different grids are set to be 0 005 l 0 005 l coarse grid 0 004 l 0 004 l medium grid 0 0025 l 0 0025 l fine grid and 0 0015 l 0 0015 l finest grid the mesh study shows that results converge for the cell size of 0 0025 l 0 0025 l mesh study is performed by generating waves with the highest steepness k a i n 0 15 for three different wavelengths ranging from 1 l to 1 56 l the results obtained from mesh study are shown in fig 4 transmitted wave waves in the rear field of the plate heave response and pitch response converge for the mesh size of 0 0025 l 0 0025 l coarser mesh may result in over prediction of the transmitted wave and dynamic responses therefore the fine mesh is used for performing the numerical experiment in the current research 3 validation the numerical set up is validated by comparing the computed data against the results of a recent experimental work performed in the university of melbourne nelli et al 2017 a rectangular plate with a length of 1m and a thickness of 0 01m spanning the width of the flume was tested in the experiments regular waves were generated at one end of the flume and they were absorbed on a beach at the other end of the flume the plate tested in the flume had a density of 0 596 ρ w which matches with the density of the plate modeled in the present research details of the experiments can be found in nelli et al 2017 the set up of the experiments is analogous with the 2d problem studied in the present research the aforementioned experiments were carried out for three different wavelengths of 1 l 1 29 l and 1 56 l waves with different steepness values which cover the full range of wave steepness values at sea i e ranging from 0 06 to 0 15 were generated free surface elevation in the front and rear fields of the plate are numerically computed and compared against experimental data the method for computation of the free surface elevation has been explained above fig 5 shows the numerically computed and the experimentally measured free surface elevation in the front and rear fields of the non drifting plate also the results corresponding to linear potential theory are shown details of this theory are presented in appendix d the free surface elevation at the front field is resulted by the superposition of the incoming and the reflected waves all results are nondimensional referring to the steepness of the recorded wave in the front and rear fields results show that the free surface elevation of the front field is larger than the reference line solid black line for all cases as expected experimental and numerical data of wave steepness of the front field agree with each other the free surface elevation at the rear field is smaller than the reference line showing that the energy of the wave is attenuated the data diverges from the reference line as the steepness of the incoming wave grows this fact implies that by the increase in the steepness of the incoming wave a larger proportion of the energy of waves may be attenuated this fact is in contrast with linear potential theory shown by dashed red line experimental data fit with numerical data showing that the presented numerical set up has proper accuracy in the modeling of the interaction of a non drifting plate with monochromatic waves this means that viscousity empowers us to compute the energy dissipation occurring for the case of steep waves which is not captured by models established based on potential theory note that an irregular wave pattern might emerge in the rear field which is likely to be caused by the slamming of rear edge of the plate the spectral analyses of the rear field can be found in bennetts et al 2015 and nelli et al 2017 which show that energy of other harmonics is highly smaller compared to that of the dominant harmonic but this phenomenon is not of interest in the present research and irregularity of the transmitted wave train is not analyzed here fig 6 displays the free surface elevation in the front and rear fields as well as the drift speed of the free floating plate exposed to monochromatic waves the first two rows of this figure show the wave height in the front and rear field of the plate experimental and cfd data are presented in addition the results of linear wave theory are also plotted in these two rows the last row shows numerically computed drift speed of the plate also the values of stokes drift are plotted to show the differences between drift speed and stokes drift furthermore the results of another set of experiments performed by huang and law 2013 are presented to evaluate whether the results of this research match with previous experiments or not compared with the non drifting plate the free surface elevation in the front field of the drifting plate is slightly smaller i e less energy of waves is reflected when the body is freely moving experimental data and numerical data of the front field are in proper agreement linear wave theory over predicts the data at the smallest wavelength the steepness of the transmitted wave is predicted with proper accuracy experimental and numerical data slightly diverges from the linear potential theory when the waves are steep their values are close to each other in most of the cases the drift speed of the plate increases by the increase in the wave steepness of the incoming wave this speed however converges by the increase in the wave steepness experimental data and numerical data agree with each other in most of the cases the stokes drift dashed red curve is also presented in this figure the difference between the stokes drift relative speed of the plate and the drifting speed decreases by the increase in wave amplitude it is very important to note that the behaviour observed for u d c p vs k a i n agrees with previous experimental observations of huang and law 2013 which is also presented in fig 6 there are some differences at the longest waves note that huang and law 2013 tested a plate with density of 0 7 ρ w which is slightly denser compared to the one considered in the present research in addition they generated waves with wavelengths of 1 05l 1 26l and 1 56l which are slightly different from the ones generated in the present study the amount of dissipated energy is compared with the experiments of nelli et al 2017 they measured the total amount of energy dissipated for each forcing condition fig 7 shows the computed energy dissipation and the reported values by nelli et al 2017 the amount of energy dissipation is seen to increase by the increase in the wave steepness for the case of a non drifting plate when the plate is freely moving wave steepness is seen to be less influential at the highest wavelength cfd data is observed to follow the experiments for the case of the non drifting plate for the case of the drifting plate cfd is less accurate the larger errors are seen to occur in the case of the lowest wavelength when waves are gently sloped and are 1l long cfd highly under predicts the energy dissipation of the drifting plate the turbulent behaviour of the fluid which is excluded in the present research is likely to be the origin of errors also cfd is seen to under predict the energy dissipation corresponding to the non drifting plate exposed to longest waves again there might be some turbulent behaviour and extra energy damping that the present laminar model is missing it 4 results 4 1 overwash overwash flow was seen to occur for most of the cases with steepness higher than 0 08 the water can travel on the upper surface of the plate from both edges i e overwash occurs both at the front and rear edges of the plate snapshots of the overwash waves propagating on the upper surface of a thin non drifting plate are sampled and illustrated in fig 8 results presented in this figure correspond to the cfd simulations of the interaction between a non drifting plate and monochromatic wave with a wavelength of 1 26 l and steepness of 0 15 snapshots with a time step of t 4 are displayed at the very early stage bores are generated at the front edge of the plate and then wash the upper surface of it a blue arrow points to the bore running on the upper surface at the next stage the bore advances on the plate at this stage flow separation may occur at the bore front which leads to dissipation of energy at the third stage the crest of the incoming wave locates under the center of the plate and thus the water surface is not above the front edge of the plate in this condition water flow is separated from the plate surface a yellow arrow points to the flow separating from the plate air can then flow under the plate and an air cavity emerges such a phenomenon is likely to be caused by the lightness and shallow draft of the floating body which can lead to high pressure reduction when the front edge of the plate moves upward flow separation is more likely to occur for waves with higher steepness as the front edge of the plate can have larger vertical motions while the generated bore advances on the upper surface of the plate bores can also propagate on the upper surface of the plate from the rear edge at the third stage a red arrow points to the generated bore at the rear edge of the plate ultimately the plate is pitched down at the final stage in such a condition bore collision occurs somewhere between the rear edge of the plate and its center the front edge of the plate then moves downward and the described loop occurs again finally note that similar and also interesting numerical observations have been presented in tran duc et al 2020 where authors have reported that water washes the front edge of the plate and overwash that emerges in the rear edge is much weaker compared to the one emerging in the front edge samples of the time histories of overwash height at the front edge of the non drifting and drifting plates exposed to regular waves are shown in fig 9 time histories of the overwash height show nonlinear behavior which is similar to that of waves propagating in shallow water condition a sharp crest occurs at the time water washes the front edge of the plate then its value highly decreases and converges to zero it should be noted that similar behavior has been observed by skene et al 2015 presented results in this figure correspond to forcing condition with wavelength of 1 29l and wave steepness of 0 15 the overwash height is computed for both drifting and non drifting plates at the front edge of the plate the time history of the overwash height is computed and then its time average is calculated as explained earlier the results are shown in fig 10 for the case of both drifting and non drifting plates overwash height is found to increase by the increase in the wave steepness which agrees with the physics of the problem as the waves become larger the water surface is likely to locate at a higher position with respect to the plate overwash heights of both cases are seen to be very close when steepness is very small but by the increase in the wave steepness their values diverge from each other overwash height is seen to increase linearly by the increase in the wave steepness this is in consistence with observations of skene et al 2015 as the waves become longer steepness of overwash slightly decreases using the computed data and the observed behavior for the overwash height it is attempted to provide a function for prediction of the overwash height the parameter 31 s o w a i n h f b which refers to the potential height of the overwash is defined as obvious this parameter refers to the difference between freeboard and crest of the incoming wave the value of h o w s o w for all cases is found it is expected that h o w s o w vs λ l obeys an asymptotic behaviour at very long waves the overwash height converges to zero i e h o w s o w 0 as λ l in this condition waves are much longer than the length of the plate and body follows the wave motion so it is expected that no overwash flow occurs at the very short waves the value of h o w s o w is expected to be equal to 0 5 when waves are very short heave and pitch motion of a floating object converge to zero which means that h o w s o w is insensitive to the motion of the plate in such a situation h o w is half of s o w using the aforementioned limits h o w s o w can be formulated as 32 h o w s o w 0 5 1 tanh a λ l the value of a is computed using the curve fitting and is found to be 0 17 and 0 26 for the non drifting and drifting plates respectively the presented values are only limited to the present research for the case of floaing bodies with different designs or lower freeboard there might be a different behaviour which is needed to be studied later fig 11 displays the values of h o w s o w for both drifting and non drifting plates the cfd data is shown by symbol and the values given by curve fitting are denoted with curves at each wave length the mean value of h o w s o w is computed the error bars show the standard deviation of the data as seen in fig 11 the curves provide an asymptotic behavior for the overwash height the marked area refers to the boundary of simulations performed using the cfd model in which the curves and scattered data match to sum the proposed equation is seen to be reliable the values of overwash height that can be computed using equation 32 are also plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that the results given by the equation fairly match with cfd data 4 2 dynamic responses dynamic responses of the plate including heave and pitch motions are found in this section amplitudes of motions are set to be the responses as explained earlier dynamic responses of heave and pitch are shown in fig 12 the heave response is normalized using the wave amplitude a 3 a i n and the pitch response is normalized using wave steepness a 5 k a i n note that as mentioned earlier no sway and yaw motion is allowed heave response of the plate increases by the increase in the wave period and converges to 1 0 i e when waves becomes longer the plate tends to follow the wave motion which agrees with the physics of the problem for all forcing conditions the drifting plate has a smaller heave response note that when waves cause the plate to drift the following sea condition occurs which results in slightly smaller encounter frequency the difference between the heave response of the drifting case and non drifting cases become smaller by the increase in the wave steepness this behavior is consistent with what was observed for the relative speed of the plate in lower panels of fig 6 results show that an increase in wave height results in a reduction of the heave amplitude the possible reason for such a behavior is the increase in overwash height as was seen in fig 10 higher overwash can lead to smaller wave exciting forces as a proportion of the energy of waves is dissipated the pitch response of the plate increases by the increase in the wave period which fits with reality when the wavelengths become longer than the body the floating body follows the wave slope at the largest wave period gentle wave induces pitch responses ranging between 0 9 and 1 0 for both drifting and non drifting cases showing that the plate is following the wave motion at this wave condition wave induced pitch responses of the drifting plate are smaller compared to the pitch response of the non drifting plate results show that an increase in the wave steepness results in smaller pitch responses these effects are more significant for the case of the non drifting plate at the smallest wave period 4 3 energy analysis energy analysis is performed to explore the contribution of different factors on the wave energy attenuation sample of energy dissipation and time history of energy fluxes are shown in appendix d overwash energy and downwash energy of the plate are computed numerically as explained earlier all data are normalized using the energy flux of incoming wave the results are presented in fig 13 the overwash contribution in attenuation of wave energy becomes larger by the increase in wave steepness as expected as the wave period increases non dimensional overwash energy flux becomes smaller for the case of a drifting plate the energy attenuation caused by the overwash is smaller in comparison with the non drifting case it was previously seen that a drifting condition can partially decrease the overwash height which may lead to a lower level of overwash energy from a practical point of view the presented results show that when a floating body is very thin like a thin energy converter vlfs or a long ice floe energy can be highly dissipated above the plate it can reach up to 10 percent of the energy flux of the incoming wave such a phenomenon is reported to occur frequently in miz where analytical methods are observed to over predict wave energy transmission of steep waves by ice floes the downwash flow contribution in energy dissipation which is caused by shear stresses and the oscillating boundary is seen to increase as a function of wave steepness at the smallest wave heights energy attenuation under the non drifting plate is very small i e close to nil for the case of a drifting plate a larger portion of the energy is attenuated under the plate note that when a plate is drifting larger shear stresses can be caused under the plate this is likely to be caused by the frictional stresses under the body simply stated the friction force is larger results show that by the increase in the wave period less energy is attenuated under the plate which agrees with previous observations in fig 6 it was found that the difference between the stokes drift and drift speed decreases which results in smaller frictional force an increase in the wavelength is seen to decrease the energy dissipation occurring under both drifting and non drifting plates the downwash results show that in the actual ocean energy can be significantly dissipated under a floating body when waves are steep this mechanism becomes very important in case of slender floating bodies or segment covers such as oil or broken ice where waves can travel over a long distance under the body a very useful discussion on the roll of energy dissipation under different floating bodies ranging from ice floes to grease ice is presented in parra et al 2020 readers who are interest are referred to this paper it has been attempted to provide a non sophisticated equation for prediction of the overwash energy dissipation the energy flux of overwash is formulated as 33 e o w u o w 0 h o w 0 5 ρ w u o w 2 d z 0 h o w ρ w g z d z the above equation gives the mean value of overwash energy over a period similar equation has been used by herman et al 2019 and the proposed equation is inspired from that research the energy flux of overwash can be normalized using the energy flux of the incoming wave as 34 e o w e i n 4 k ω g 0 5 h o w 5 2 a i n 2 note that the above equation was formulated by setting u o w g h o w this means the velocity of the overwash is hypothesized to be equal to that horizontal velocity corresponding to dam break with a vertical level of h o w and is constant in vertical direction which is similar to physics of shallow water waves the equation proposed for computing the overwash height can be used for estimation of h o w the values given by this equation are substituted in equation 32 and then plotted in fig 13 data given by the proposed equation are seen to be close the cfd data properly overall the proposed equations for estimation of overwash energy and height are reliable enough to be used for the case of both free floating and moored bodies this equation can be therefore applied to analytical methods in order to compute the energy dissipation that might occur during mutual interaction of the body with water waves it is only required to find the overwash height which can be estimated using the difference between water height and the upper deck of a floating body also note that the overwash height might be smaller for the case of flexible bodies as body tends to follow the wave motion numerical evidences have been provided in huang et al 2020 and tran duc et al 2020 the downwash energy dissipation is also formulated as 35 e d w 0 5 ρ w c d u o r 3 0 5 ρ w c d 2 π a i n t 3 where u o r 2 π a i n t is the orbital velocity of the wave and c d is the drag coefficient of the plate the surface of the plate is set to be unite square as the problem is 2d and length of the plate equals 1 0 m more technical information about this equation can be found in hermans et al 2019 and voermans et al 2019 the above equation can be re written as 36 e d w e i n c d ω 2 k a i n g where c d 2 c d is the a new coefficient that emerges the values of the downwash energy dissipation are also computed using equation 36 and plotted in fig 14 the value of c d of non drifting and drifting plates are found using the cfd data being equal to 0 082 and 0 112 respectively c d of non drifting plate is very close to the drag coefficient of streamline body such as an airfoil of hydrofoil note that c d of a submerged foil body equals to 0 04 for the case of drifting body the coefficient is slightly larger it is also very important to note that these drag coefficients have seen to be accurate enough for the current geometry and density for the other floating bodies and other densities another value is recommended to be found also the value of coefficient might be a function of the wave velocity which is a function of wave steepness and wave frequency itself as the reynolds number increases it can be seen the given equation provides a linear behavior for the downwash energy which is close to that of numerical simulations the numerical data is seen to be marginally larger than the values found using the proposed equation at the smallest wavelength this equation can be also be implemented in analytical methods if both equations 35 and 36 are used the average amount of dissipated energy can be computed then the energy of waves by including energy dissipation can be obtained and more accurate transmitted and reflected wave fields can be re computed the energy attention in front of the leading edge of the plate is presented in fig 14 this mechanism is likely to be caused by the shear stress due to the interaction between water waves motions of the front edge of the plate slamming and also the fluid motion toward the upstream as the plate is drifted the normalized energy flux in the front field of the plate is seen to decrease with the increases in steepness value by the increase in wave steepness larger volume of water moves above the plate and thus the submergence of the plate increases this might weaken the vortex power in the front field of the plate in addition the physics of this damping mechanism can be viewed from another point the radiated waves from the plate are expected to be linked to the motions of the plate which was observed to decrease by the increase in steepness value the radiated wave which is expected to be turbulent due to low thickness of the body and slamming occurrence can interact with the reflected wave and thus it can damp the energy of the radiated waves therefore the increase in the wave steepness can decrease the energy dissipation occurring in the front field for the case of the drifted body in addition the drift motion can cause an extra perturbation in the wake of the body which is a highly turbulent flow this wave is similar to the wake of the two dimensional moving floating objects therefore for the case of the drifted plate the energy dissipation in the front field can be slightly higher at the smallest wavelength note that this wavelength causes the largest drift speed for the plate moreover the energy dissipation in the front field is converged to 2 of the energy of incoming wave as the steepness value increases when steepness is very small more dissipation occurs in addition the smallest wave period leads to relatively larger energy dissipation for the case of smallest steepness value wave frequency is larger thus shear stresses caused by plate motion and wave wave interaction are likely to damp waves the energy dissipation emerging in the front field of the plate is applicable in studying modeling of mobile bodies in the ocean such as broken ice floes which freely move under the force of waves and wind stresses to sum the wave energy dissipation caused by a thin floating plate is a very complicated physical problem and it is not very easy to find the main contributors i e it is not very straightforward to compute the amount of dissipated energy components separately many different factors including the shape of the body its drift speed freeboard and draft can affect the problem but the energy that is dissipated above the body and the amount of energy that is dissipated due to shear stresses under the body are expected to increase by the increase in the wave steepness the overwash energy dissipation can be represented by a dam break theory but it can be true for the case that the body does not get fully submerged the downwash energy dissipation highly depends on the form of the body but can be increased by the increase in wave orbital velocity near the front edge of the plate energy can again get dissipated but the mechanism is still not clear however the energy dissipated in the front field is much smaller compared to the overwash and downwash for the case of steep waves this confirms that the dissipation of the energy of steep waves that is caused by a floating plate is dominantly occurring above and under the plate 5 conclusions in this paper computational fluid dynamics is used to numerically model the laminar viscouse flow field around a thin rigid floating plate subjected to surface waves the aim was to understand the wave energy attenuation caused by different mechanisms cfd which provides us with the opportunity to sample data was embarked to do this task for us simulations were performed for two different situations first the plate was free to drift and then it was restrained in the longitudinal direction in order to explore how the drifting motion can influence the wave attenuation pattern after performing a mesh convergence study the numerical set up was validated by comparing the cfd data including the wave fields in the front and rear fields with previous experimental data of nelli et al 2017 good agreement between the cfd results and experimental data was observed it was shown that the cfd code can model overwash flow at both front and rear edges of the plate bores were shown to emerge at the front edge of the plate as it becomes submerged overwash height was shown to increase as a function of steepness of the incoming wave it was demonstrated that drift motion can lead to a decrease in the overwash height an increase in the wavelength resulted in a decrease of the overwash height an equation was proposed for estimation of the overwash height results of which were observed to be in fair agreement with cfd data the dynamic response of the plate in the vertical plane was also found to depend on wave steepness through the increase in the wave height motions were seen to decrease the plate with drift motion was seen to have smaller heave and pitch responses as expected energy attenuation analysis showed that both overwash and downwash can noticeably dissipate the energy of waves i e they can dissipate up to 20 percent of the energy of incoming wave the former can be partially larger in the case of plates fixed in a longitudinal direction the latter when waves cause the body to drift the overwash energy was seen to increase with the increase in wave steepness the energy dissipation triggered by the overwash was formulated by comparing the results of the formulated equation against performed cfd simulations the proposed formula is seen to provide reliable accuracy it was shown that the downwash energy linearly increases with steepness using the orbital velocity of the wave the downwash energy was also formulated and the values obtained from the equation agree with performed cfd simulations in the front field of the plate the energy was seen to be damped as well the mechanism that leads to dissipation of the energy in that zone is not very clear but the radiated waves from the body and wave wave interaction are the possible drivers of the energy dissipation in the front field the increase in the wave steepness was seen to highly decrease energy dissipation in the font field which confirms that we can only consider energy dissipation occurring above and under the plate overall while analytical methods have been found to provide a reliable prediction of the fluid motion around the floating bodies their application might be limited to the gentle waves as they cannot capture energy dissipation occurring above or under the floating body exposed to large waves cfd models can be used for simulation of the problem in this case cfd simulations performed using laminar flow assumption can provide a relatively reliable amount of energy dissipation but in order to provide a more accurate prediction of the fluid motion turbulent simulation should be performed in future in future studies it is recommended that modeling fluid flow around a thin floater exposed to water waves to be carried out by different turbulence models specifically this problems becomes more important for the case of long bodies such as elastic ice cover and multi body system such as an array of ice floes the effects of a thin plate on a full wave spectrum and irregular waves still needs to be studied as it is expected that nonlinear interaction between water waves become more important when greater number of harmonics are involved also the effects of the deformations on the overwash flow and dispersion have not been analyzed in the present research as rigid body simulations were conducted study of such a problem is a possible future study that can provide more understanding of the wave interaction with floating bodies credit authorship contribution statement sasan tavakoli

rigid body motion equations equations of motion for a rigid body are established by using the newton law centre of gravity is assumed to be the centre of motions motions are first formulized for all six motions linear acceleration of the centre of the mass of the rigid body can be written as a 1 f m x where x x y z denotes the acceleration vector of the centre of the mass which is relative to the

between turbulent and laminar simulations is presented in this appendix as stated earlier turbulent may be strong in real physics as overwash occurs and waves are steep but all simulations are performed using a laminar model in the present paper therefore a comparison between laminar and turbulent simulations can show us how acceptable the laminar simulation is turbulent simulation is performed using openfoam and reynolds averaged equations known as rans are solved the k omega shear stress turbulence model is used to compute the extra viscousity caused by the turbulent of the flow the related equations are not presented here they can be found in many related cfd books or papers see e g in develoder et al 2018 simulation is only performed for the wave period of 0 9 s corresponding to the wavelength of 1 29l the steepest wave is generated and the motions of the plate as well as fluid motion are computed over the time simulations are run for 30 wave cycles time histories of the water surface elevation computed by laminar and turbulent models are shown in figure b 1 as apparent both models are following each other resulting in very similar water surface elevation in the rear field at some cycles the turbulent model might lead to higher or smaller crest which is expected to occur flow is turbulent and thus there is less consistency between the cycles also for the case of the turbulent simulations the frequency of waves is seen to get slightly smaller than that of the laminar simulations this shows that there might be a nonlinear phenomenon developed during the wave interaction with the plate affecting the wave frequency corresponding to the turbulent simulation fig b 1 comparison between the turbulent dashed black and laminar solid red simulations in computation of the transmitted water waves the data corresponds to the wavelength of 1 29l and steepness value of 0 15 fig b 1 time history of the overwash at the front edge of the plate is presented in figure b 2 the data computed by both turbulent and laminar simulations is presented in figure b 2 the data computed by both models show some similarities the overwash wave computed by the turbulent model is seen to reach a smaller peak as the time grows but the peak computed by laminar simulation is seen to slightly increases the differences between the peaks of the two models might reach up to 15 percent this shows that for the case of a turbulent model there might be some energy damping in the vicinity of the front edge of the plate leading to smaller overwash height fig b 2 comparison between the turbulent dashed black and laminar solid red simulations in computation of the overwash height the data corresponds to the wavelength of 1 29l and steepness value of 0 15 fig b 2 energy fluxes of the flow under the two edges of the plate computed by laminar and turbulent models are displayed in figure b 3 the results are seen to be very close to each other the turbulent simulations however is seen to slightly diverge from that of the laminar simulations as the time grows the turbulent simulation is seen to have slightly smaller amplitude under the front edge it can be around 5 percent of the data computed by laminar simulation this again shows that a small proportion of the energy is likely to be damped behind the front edge of the plate fig b 3 comparison between the turbulent dashed black and laminar solid red simulations in computation of the energy flux under the front left and rear right edges of the plate the data corresponds to the wavelength of 1 29l and steepness value of 0 15 fig b 3 time history of heave and pitch motions of the plate subjected to waves is presented in figure b 4 as seen the response computed by both models follow each other for the case of heave motion turbulent model might predict slightly smaller response for the case of pitch motion no significant difference is observed the turbulent model is likely to lead to a slightly smaller exciting heave force but it can not have any effect on pitching moment fig b 4 comparison between the turbulent dashed black and laminar solid red simulations in computation of the heave and pitch motions of the plate the data corresponds to the wavelength of 1 29l and steepness value of 0 15 fig b 4 to numerically replicate the problem with laminar model simulation of every sampled time step 0 05 s needs around 2 min and half of run on 32 cores but to simulate similar amount of physical time the turbulent model needs longer computational time as turbulent equations are solved simultaneously turbulent model needs nearly 4 min to advance 0 05 s which is nearly 1 6 times larger compared to that of laminar model in addition the data corresponding to every sampled time step needs 240 mb of storage but when it comes to turbulent model around 420 mb is required due to the low differences between the results of the turbulent and laminar models which vary between 5 and 10 percent in most of situations and the limitations with storage and having faster runs laminar model which has also found to have proper accuracy in computation of wave fields and energy dissipation is used in the present paper appendix c linear potential theory an elastic body is assumed to float on the water surface in a two dimensional spatial domain as demonstrated in figure c 1 the floating body is exposed to the train of incoming waves fluid around the domain is assumed to be single phase and perfect i e no shear stresses occur and the viscosity of fluid is zero therefore the fluid motion can be represented using the potential field φ x z t horizontal and vertical velocity are given by c 1 u x x z t x φ c 2 u z x z t z φ by assuming that wave steepness is small linear theory governs the whole fluid domain therefore potential field around the body can be written as c 3 φ x z t re ϕ x z exp i ω t vertical deformations in the body also follow the linear theory and deformations in the body can be written as c 4 z x z t re z x z exp i ω t a laplace equation governs the fluid motion as c 5 2 ϕ 0 on x and d z 0 free surface obeys a linear kinematic condition given by c 6 z ϕ ω 2 g 1 ϕ on x l 2 and l 2 x and z 0 an impermeable condition is satisfied on the seabed as c 7 z ϕ 0 on x and z d a linear elastic theory represents the governing equation on the vertical deformations in the floating plate as c 8 1 ω 2 g 1 z y h 3 ρ w g 1 υ 2 on l 2 x l 2 and d z 0 in equation c 8 y is the young modules h is the plate thickness and υ is the poisson s ratio a fluid structure condition is prescribed for the interface between fluid and solid as c 9 z ϕ ω 2 g 1 z on l 2 x l 2 and z d the following problem can be solved analytically by using eigenfunction matching the solution gives the free surface elevation of transmitted and reflected water waves as c 10 η t t a i n cos k x ω t ε t and c 11 η r r a i n cos k x ω t ε r where c 12 t a t

of 1l 1 29l and 1 56l respectively note that this model is not developed by the authors and no code is established in the present research the transmission coefficients are extracted from the work of nelli et al 2017 fig c 1 schematic showing the wave thin body interaction with consideration of the ideal flow fig c 1 appendix d samples of energy fluxes sample of energy fluxes are shown to in this appendix to provide understanding of the energy damping the wave energy fluxes are recorded and sampled the results presented in the this appendix corresponds to the simulations run for the drifting plate subjected to the regular waves with wave period of 0 9 s and steepness value of 0 15 the wavelength corresponds to this wavelength is 1 29l figure d 1 shows a sample of the overwash energy flux overwash energy is seen to behave similarly to shallow water wave the energy reaches a maximum value and then it converges to zero it is zero over half of the period and then it rises and reaches a peak value the average value is shown by a dashed blue line fig d 1 time history of overwash energy flux correspond to the water waves with period of 0 9 s and steepness value of 0 15 the dashed blue line shows the average value which is defined as the overwash energy dissipation used in the present research fig d 1 figure d 2 shows a sample of the energy flux under two boundaries of the plate the difference between energy fluxes of these two boundaries over a period can help us to compute the downwash energy dissipation the red solid curve refers to the time history of energy flux under the front edge of the plate the energy flux under the front edge of the plate is seen to be highly nonlinear its crest is seen to be long and its trough is sharper compared to the crest two phenomenon can lead to such a behaviour one is the overwash flow that is excluded from the wave energy flux and corresponds to the crest moreover as observed earlier an air cavity might emerge under the rigid body as the plate edge of the plate moves upward these nonlinear phenomenon can cause smaller energy flux in the crest region the dashed blue curve shows the energy flux under the rear edge of the plate the energy flux as seen is reduced this reduction has occurred for both crest and trough but the aforementioned reduction is higher for the case of trough the reduction is likely to be caused by the shear stresses resulted from viscosity which lacks in the linear potential models and also pressure reduction the difference between average values of energy fluxes gives the energy attenuation occurring under the plate over the time period considered in the present research this amount is nearly 0 08e in fig d 2 time history of energy flux under the front edge downwash energy flux correspond to the water waves with period of 0 9 s and steepness value of 0 15 the solid red and dashed blue curves repetitively show the energy flux under the front and rear edges of the plate the data corresponds to the water waves with period of 0 9 s and steepness of 0 15 fig d 2 time histories of the energy fluxes at two point in front field of the plate are shown in figure d 3 one of the curves refers to the point juts behind the front edge and the other one refers to the point located at x λ from the edge the energy flux at the point closer to the front edge the blue curve is seen to be lower this point represents the amount of energy flux just near the plate at the other point the average value energy flux is seen to be higher this means that an amount of energy of reflected wave propagating toward the inlet is damped the difference between the average values of the energy fluxes at these two points give the energy dissipation occurring in the front field this energy dissipation is likely to be caused by the motion of the plate slamming and the interaction between incoming and reflected waves as mentioned in the manuscript fig d 3 time history of energy flux at two points in the front field the solid red curve shows the energy flux just near the front edge and the dashed blue curve shows the energy flux at another point being one wavelength further from the front edge fig d 3

circular cylinder l v liquid vapor o initial s saturation w solid surface 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a widespread phenomenon which can be seen in air or water flow over engineering structures such as bridges structures around offshore marine risers and cables related to this the effect of solid body motion on variations of flow field and solid body forces has been studied extensively huang et al 2019 zou et al 2019 taheri et al 2020 cavitation is a bubble generation phenomenon occurring in a liquid when its pressure is reduced below the saturation pressure the cavitating flow is a very important issue related to the performance of moving objects in ocean engineering applications such as underwater projectiles marine propellers and hydraulic machineries when the cavitated bubbles collapse in a higher pressure they produce an intense pressure wave to cause hydrodynamic erosion on the other hand cavitated bubbles which cover whole surface of a submerged object can reduce a friction drag gugulothu 2020 despite extensive studies of cavitation few numerical methods have been presented for cavitating flows around a moving body in this work a numerical approach for an oscillating cylinder in cavitating flows is developed by combining a homogeneous mixture cavitation model with an immersed boundary method cavitation models are mostly developed under the homogeneous mixture condition where the liquid velocity and pressure are the same with the vapor velocity and pressure the homogeneous cavitation models which employ the governing equations of mixture mass and momentum can be subdivided into two models that depend on barotropic relations and vapor transport equations respectively to calculate the mass or volume fraction of cavitation vapor in the barotropic or thermodynamic equilibrium models decaix and goncalvès 2013 koukouvinis et al 2017a using the equation of state eos that relates density and pressure the eos for the two phase mixture is estimated from an interpolation between the sound speed for each phase the vapor fraction is directly determined from the mixture density or the corresponding pressure the barotropic models are easy to implement without solving an additional differential equation for vapor fraction transport however assuming that the phase change or cavitation occurs in an arbitrary pressure range around the saturation pressure rather than at the saturation pressure thus the models are not easily applicable to lower speed cavitating flows with a small range of pressure variations giannadakis et al 2008 in the vapor fraction transport models sun et al 2020 movahedian et al 2019 ahn et al 2018 niedzwiedzka et al 2016 the vapor fraction is derived from the radius and number density of bubbles the vapor generation rate is approximated from the rayleigh plesset equation the models have empirical constants and various functional forms of pressure difference relative to the saturation pressure as reviewed in ref niedzwiedzka et al 2016 as a coupled approach for analysis of cavitation seo et al 2008 used a vapor mass fraction transport equation whose vapor generation term is implicitly evaluated by imposing a thermodynamic constraint the vapor mass fraction was assumed to be larger than the minimum mass fraction corresponding to the saturation pressure for a given mixture density this model can be applied without any empirical constants or any functional form of pressure difference most of cavitation models have been used with body fitted or unstructured grid methods when extended to flows around moving solids they require a large computational cost to regenerate meshes fitted to the solid boundaries as an efficient method to treat moving solids without regeneration of meshes immersed boundary ib methods have been developed in extensive studies peskin 1972 first proposed an ib method for computing the flow around moving heart valves by adding a force source to the conservation equation of momentum to impose the specified velocity conditions on a solid boundary immersed in a fluid a simplified ib formulation was developed by fadlun et al 2000 directly implementing the specified velocity on the solid boundary the ib methods have a numerical problem that when applied to moving solids a spurious pressure oscillation occurs near the solid boundaries passing fixed mesh points efforts have been made to reduce the numerical oscillation by employing an approach adding source and sink terms for mass conservation kim et al 2001 lee et al 2011 a cut cell discretization approach for the conservation equations örley et al 2015 a consistent direct discretization approach sato et al 2016 and several other approaches as reviewed in ref kim and choi 2019a despite extensive studies of cavitating flows few numerical studies have been reported for cavitating flows around moving solids recently örley et al 2015 computed cavitating flows around a rotating cross and through a control valve by combining a cut cell based ib method and a barotropic cavitation model their cavitation model is not general in that the interpolated speed of sound is inversely proportional to the mixture density koukouvinis et al 2017b similarly applied a combined ib and barotropic cavitation method to simulate bubble cavitation and high velocity jet formation caused by the snapping claw of a pistol shrimp in their barotropic model cavitation is assumed to occur in a pressure range of 4500 p a around the saturated vapor pressure of 2340 p a in the present work an efficient numerical approach is presented for computation of cavitating flows around a moving solid by combining the cavitation model of seo et al 2008 which includes a vapor fraction transport equation whose vapor generation term is implicitly evaluated from a thermodynamic constraint the cavitation model is combined with a pressure correction formulation jemison et al 2014 lee and son 2017 for effectively alleviating the limitations of the time interval in compressible two phase flows and an ib method to apply the specified velocity conditions to a moving solid surface the present formulation is tested for cavitating flows around a stationary cylinder and non cavitating flows around an oscillating cylinder computations are further performed for cavitating flows around an oscillating cylinder the combined effects of cylinder oscillation and cavitation on the pressure drag and lift coefficients is quantified 2 numerical analysis we consider a circular cylinder immersed in liquid water at 25 o c the numerical method is developed under a homogeneous mixture condition that the liquid velocity and pressure are the same with the vapor velocity and pressure the two phase flows are assumed to be laminar and compressible 2 1 governing equations defining y as the vapor mass fraction the conservation equations are expressed as 1 ρ t u ρ 0 2 ρ y t u ρ y k 3 ρ u t

is set to be greater than y m i n which is obtained from eq 8 with p p s as 15 y m i n 1 ρ 1 ρ l s 1 ρ v s 1 ρ l s when y is smaller than y m i n which means that the local pressure is lower than p s as indicated by point a of fig 1 bubble cavitation is assumed to occur and y is set to be y m i n as indicated by point b of fig 1 so that the local pressure converges to p s this procedure is simply implemented as 16 y n 1 max y y m i n eq 3 is decomposed into two parts 17 ρ n 1 u ρ u n δ t u ρ u n p μ u s n 18 ρ n 1 u n 1 u δ t p n 1 p where 19 s μ u t 2 3 μ u here p is iteratively evaluated

the same way as in the momentum equation using eqs 22 and 23 with φ ρ 2 3 implementation of an immersed boundary ib method the fluid and immersed solid regions are described by a signed distance level set ls function ψ from the immersed solid boundary the fluid and solid regions are distinguished by ψ 0 and ψ 0 respectively to discretize the mass and momentum equations near the immersed solid boundary we use an ib method similar to the consistent direct discretization method presented in ref sato et al 2016 in which the mass and momentum equations are discretized at all nodes in the fluid region ψ 0 including even near the immersed solid boundary the flux terms of conservation equations near the solid boundary are interpolated or extrapolated from the densities and velocities at the adjacent fluid nodes and the solid boundary the discretized momentum eq 21 and the discretized mass eq 25 are implemented according to the placement of the solid boundary between the neighboring nodes as depicted in fig 2 the discretized conservation equations are applied to all velocity nodes with ψ i 1 2 0 while the no slip velocity conditions u u w to all solid nodes with ψ i 1 2 0 in the case

2340 p a 3 1 validation and grid resolution test the present numerical method is first tested through the bleich and sandler problem bleich and sandler 1970 which is a well known benchmark problem for one dimensional cavitation the problem consists of a semi infinite fluid column supporting an immersed rigid body of weight w per unit area as depicted in fig 3 a and an exponentially decaying pressure wave impinging on the body surface at t 0 the rarefaction wave reflected from the body surface causes cavitation in the analysis of bleich and sandler they assumed that the pressure in a cavitated region is uniform as p s and the pressure density relation is linear this approach is similar to the cut off cavitation model liu et al 2004 daramizadeh and ansari 2015 which is expressed as p p s ρ ρ l s a l 2 for ρ ρ l s p p s for ρ ρ l s using the following initial conditions at t 0 p p s p m e y l p a ρ l s g y w g ρ ρ l s p p s a l 2 v p m e y l ρ a l and the boundary condition at

changes in body motion and cavitated region the present numerical method is applied to this problem using δ t 0 5 h a l and 700 mesh points distributed over a computational domain 30 m y 0 1 m the initial fluid solid interface is located at y 0 uniform fine meshes of h 0 01 m are used in 4 m y 0 1 m whereas non uniform coarse meshes in the other region for this test case we choose a small nonzero vapor mass fraction of y o 10 12 to initiate cavitation and modify the bulk modulus π l in eq 11 so that a l 1423 m s at p 101 k p a fig 3b and c shows the temporal variations of body motion and cavitated region the computed results from the cut off cavitation model shows good agreement with the theoretical predictions bleich and sandler 1970 but the numerical results from the present cavitation model with γ v 1 as marked by model 2a differ from the theoretical predictions during the contraction of the cavitated region this is caused by the difference in the vapor side sound speed a v the theoretical and cut off models assume a v 0 whereas the present model uses a v γ v p ρ v when a v is reduced by using γ v 0 1 the numerical results from the present model as marked by model 2b compare well with the theoretical predictions the present computations for non cavitating or cavitating flows over a stationary and oscillating cylinders are performed in a large computational domain of 75 d x 100 d and 50 d y 50 d to avoid the effect of the domain size as depicted in fig 4 the cylinder is located at x c y c 0 0 and uniform fine meshes of size h are used in a domain of d x 2 d and d y d near the cylinder whereas non uniform coarse meshes for the outer domain the symbol θ represents an angle on the cylinder surface measured from its front stagnation point we use the inflow condition of u u and the pressure condition of p p on the boundaries of x 75 d and x 100 d respectively while using the symmetry condition on the top and bottom boundaries all computations are initialized with u u v 0 and p p cavitating flows are simulated by varying the ambient pressure p or the cavitation number σ in the present work the atmospheric pressure is corresponding to σ 7 8 a small nonzero vapor volume fraction of α o 0 01 is used to initiate cavitation gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 which corresponds the initial vapor mass fraction of y o 7 49 10 6 at p 1 b a r the present approach is tested for a stationary cylinder immersed in liquid water at r e 200 referring to the previous studies gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 braza et al 1986 qu et al 2013 kim and choi 2019b ding et al 2007 harichandan and roy 2012 for unsteady vortex shedding vortices are generated on the cylinder surface and detach alternatively from its upper and lower surfaces the oscillating flow around the cylinder results in fluctuations in the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l the time averaged c d a v the maximum c l m a x and s t are listed in table 1 the present results match well with the previous works using a polar coordinate system braza et al 1986 qu et al 2013 kim and choi 2019b a mesh free finite difference method ding et al 2007 and an unstructured triangular mesh system harichandan and roy 2012 the results of ref braza et al 1986 are slightly different from other results because their mesh size used was larger computations are extended to cavitating flows at σ 1 0 and σ 0 7 as the liquid pressure decreases to p s cavitation occurs around the lateral surface of the cylinder the cavitated bubble detaches from the cylinder surface and flows with shedding vortices as the velocity divergence or dilatation effect due to cavitation elongates and weakens the shedding vortices gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 the computed shedding frequencies are reduced to s t 0 177 and s t 0 145 for σ 1 0 and σ 0 7 respectively which are comparable to the corresponding predictions of s t 0 160 and s t 0 153 reported by gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 fig 5 plots the time averaged c p on the cylinder for the case without cavitation at σ 7 8 as θ increases and the flow accelerates c p decreases and becomes minimum near θ 80 o thereafter as the flow decelerates with θ c p increases and varies slowly in a wake region near θ 180 o when cavitation occurs as the cavitation number decreases to σ 1 0 and σ 0 7 the minimum of c p is close to σ which is caused by the fact that the pressure in a cavitated vapor region does not drop below p s therefore the local result of c p σ 0 indicates the occurrence of cavitation the prediction of c p variation depending on σ shows good agreement with the previous work gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 the present numerical formulation is also tested for an oscillating cylinder at r e 0 the cylinder center and its velocity are prescribed as x c a sin 2 π f c t and u c u c m a x cos 2 π f c t respectively where u c m a x 2 π f c a we choose the keulegan carpenter number of k c 5 and the reynolds number of r e c m a x 100 where k c u c m a x d f c and r e c m a x ρ l u c m a x d μ l referring to the previous works lee et al 2011 dütsch et al 1998 for this test case the pressure condition of p 1 b a r is applied to all the boundaries fig 6 a d shows periodic patterns of vorticity contours and c p fields for t 13 t c where t c is the period of oscillation defined as t c 1 f c boundary layers and counter rotating vortices are observed to develop alternatively with the oscillating cylinder the computed flow patterns and the associated pressure fields compare well with the previous works lee et al 2011 dütsch et al 1998 the effect of h on the instantaneous drag coefficient c d is depicted in fig 6e the results have non physical oscillations for h 0 04 d but the oscillations decrease with reducing the mesh size as similarly observed in ref lee et al 2011 using ib methods the converged result compares well with the previous work dütsch et al 1998 using a body fitted structured grid in a moving reference system as seen in fig 6f a grid resolution test is conducted for a cavitating flow around an oscillating cylinder at r e 200 and σ 2 0 we choose an oscillation amplitude of a 0 1 d and a frequency of f c 2 f n where f n is the vortex shedding frequency calculated from s t 0 194 three different mesh sizes of h 0 005 d 0 01 d and 0 02 d are selected with δ t 0 3 h u the computations are carried out until the flow around the cylinder reaches a periodic state the results are plotted in fig 7 where the lift coefficient c l is close to maximum the computed instantaneous c p field vapor volume fraction c d and c l of the cylinder are seen to have slight differences for h 0 01 d and 0 02 d however the results are nearly identical for h 0 005 d and 0 01 d and spurious pressure oscillations in c d and c l of the cylinder is not observed for h 0 01 d therefore we use the mesh size of h 0 01 d for efficient computations without losing numerical accuracy 3 2 non cavitating flow at r e 200 and f c 2 f n we consider an oscillating cylinder at r e 200 a 0 1 d and f c 2 f n where f n is calculated from s t 0 194 this condition is known as the lock in condition huang et al 2019 hurlbut et al 1982 al mdallal et al 2007 that the cylinder oscillation is synchronized with the natural vortex shedding and thus c d and c l increase significantly in the case without cavitation the ambient pressure is chosen as p 1 b a r which corresponds to σ 7 8 figs 8 and 9 show the vorticity contour and c p field and the associated c p c d and c l on the cylinder during two cycles of cylinder oscillation a pair of vortices are observed to develop asymmetrically on the cylinder surface detach alternatively from the upper and lower surfaces and fluctuate downstream the vortex shedding behavior for the oscillating cylinder is similar to the stationary cylinder case but the pressure field is quite different depending on whether the cylinder is in motion at t 0 when the cylinder moves to x c 0 from x c a and its velocity toward the free stream is u c 2 π f c a at its maximum during the cylinder oscillation period the local c p on the cylinder surface has a minimum value of c p 2 9 near θ 80 o and c p 2 3 near θ 280 o the local c p on the upper cylinder surface 0 θ 180 o is slightly lower than on the lower surface 180 θ 360 o as seen in fig 9a when the cylinder moves up to x c a with maximum deceleration of 2 π f c 2 a toward the free stream fig 8b the pressure decreases near θ 0 o and increases near θ 180 o as a result c d has a minimum value as depicted in fig 9b when the cylinder return to x c 0 with u c 2 π f c a at t 0 5 t c fig 8c and moves up to x c a with maximum acceleration of 2 π f c 2 a toward the free stream at t 0 75 t c fig 8d the pressure increases near θ 0 o and decreases near θ 180 o and c p is higher on the upper cylinder surface this results in c d at its maximum and c l at its minimum when the cylinder moves to x c a during the following cycle of t c t 2 t c the vortex shedding process is repeated alternatively on the opposite of the upper and lower surfaces the time averaged c d a v and the maximum c l m a x evaluated from fig 9b are 1 56 and 1 15 respectively which compare well with the numerical results of 1 58 and 1 16 reported in ref al mdallal et al 2007 3 3 effect of cavitation at r e 200 and f c 2 f n computations are carried out to analyze the influence of cavitation on the velocity and pressure fields around an oscillating cylinder the cavitation number σ is varied while keeping f c 2 f n and the other parameters as in the previous section it is noted that cavitation does not occur around a stationary cylinder for r e 200 and σ 2 0 thus the natural frequency of f n does not change for σ 2 0 figs 10 12 show the vorticity contours c p fields and vapor volume fraction fields at σ 2 5 σ 2 0 and σ 1 0 respectively cavitation is most likely to occur when the cylinder moves to x c 0 from x c a and the pressure is below p s a t or c p σ for σ 2 5 when the local pressure decreases to p s a small volume of cavitation appears on the upper surface near θ 80 o in the cavitated region where c p remains at the value of σ the flow around the cylinder surface does not accelerate as σ decreases to 2 0 more bubbles are produced on the lower surface near θ 280 o as well as the upper surface near θ 80 o and fluctuate with shedding vortices as seen in fig 11 when σ is further reduced to 1 0 a significant volume of bubble cavitation occurs on both the lateral surfaces of the cylinder the cavitated bubbles detach from the cylinder surface and fluctuate with shedding vortices the vorticity contours become more dilated and longer in the cavitated vapor region as σ decreases the associated resultant c d and c l and the time averaged c p on the cylinder are plotted in fig 13 at t 0 when the cylinder moves to x c 0 from x c a the local c p on the cylinder surface without cavitation has a minimum value and cavitation occurs near θ 80 o for σ 2 5 as σ decreases the cavitated region becomes wider and the pressure recovery on the cylinder surface of θ 90 o becomes slow this lowers the pressure near θ 180 o with a decrease in σ therefore the instantaneous c d at t 0 increases as the cavitation number decreases to σ 2 0 fig 13a at t 0 25 t c when the cylinder moves up to x c a with deceleration c p decreases near θ 0 o and increases near θ 70 o for σ 2 0 and θ 110 o for σ 2 0 for σ 2 5 as the pressure on the upper cylinder surface increases the cavitated bubble is compressed for a lower cavitation number of σ 2 0 the cavitated bubble on the upper surface is compressed similarly but more cavitation occurs on the lower surface and thus the entire cylinder surface is surrounded by a negative c p field fig 11b as the cylinder returns to x c 0 the pressure on the upper surface θ 130 o further increases whereas the pressure on the lower surface does not change much as a result the bubble on the upper surface is greatly compressed and collapse resulting in a shock wave the shock wave occurs frequently and causes sharp peaks on the c d and c l curves as depicted in fig 13a and b when the cylinder moves up to x c a with acceleration toward the free stream at t 0 75 t c c p becomes higher on the upper surface and the c p near θ 0 o increases significantly as a result c l is reduced and c d becomes maximum at t 0 75 t c when σ is reduced to 1 and 0 7 and cavitation occurs over the entire cylinder surface except near its front side the pressure remains at p s a t and the oscillating amplitudes of c d and c l decrease significantly fig 14 a focuses on the evolution of c p field at σ 2 0 associated with the bubble collapse near the oscillating cylinder at t 0 26 t c the cavitated bubble on the upper cylinder surface is compressed toward θ 80 o the bubble collapse at t 0 35 t c causes a very high pressure field near the upper surface of 80 o θ 100 o and the resulting shock wave propagates as seen at t 0 39 t c this kind of shock which does not occur in the regime of σ 3 0 without cavitation is observed in the regime of 1 2 σ 3 0 where bubbles are generated and collapsed near the oscillating cylinder however the shock wave does not occur in the regime of σ 1 2 where the cavitated bubbles remain attached to the cylinder as depicted in fig 14b the time averaged c p on the cylinder surface are presented in fig 13c for different cavitation numbers as σ decreases to 2 0 from 7 8 which corresponds to the case without cavitation the local c p does not decrease much due to cavitation near θ 80 o which causes a slower pressure recovery on the rear surface θ 120 o and then decreases c p this results in a significant increase in the time averaged drag coefficient c d a v while the local c p near the leading edge θ 0 of the cylinder is not affected by cavitation compared to c d a v 1 58 at σ 7 8 c d a v increases by 20 at σ 2 0 for σ 1 the lateral surface of the cylinder is covered by the cavitated bubble and c p stays close to σ the time averaged c d a v is reduced to 1 40 and 1 18 at σ 1 0 and σ 0 7 respectively 3 4 effects of cylinder frequency and cavitation at r e 200 fig 15 shows the effects of frequency ratio f c f n and cavitation number σ on the root mean square rms drag coefficient fluctuation c d c d a v r m s the time averaged drag coefficient c d a v and the rms lift coefficient c l r m s of an oscillating cylinder where c r m s c 2 d t t c as the oscillating velocity amplitude u c m a x of the cylinder increases with f c the drag coefficient fluctuation c d c d a v r m s increases the influence of cavitation is observed to be pronounced for f c 1 5 f n the curves for c d a v and c l r m s have peaks near the lock in condition of f c 2 f n the peak values increase as cavitation occurs and σ decreases to 2 0 from 7 8 and then decrease as described in the previous section the combined effects of f c f n and σ on c d a v and c l r m s are summarized in fig 16 compared to the stationary case of f c 0 the cylinder oscillation has little influence in the regime of f c 1 5 f n and has a large influence in the regime of f c 1 5 f n and 1 3 σ 2 6 as f c approaches to 2 f n c d a v and c l r m s increase significantly over a wide range of cavitation numbers and have maximum values near σ 2 0 when the cavitation number becomes less than 2 0 the lock in condition effect on the drag and lift coefficients weakens in the regime of f c 2 f n and σ 2 0 c d a v and c l r m s become smaller as the frequency ratio is higher and σ is lower 3 5 effects of reynolds number and cavitation at f c 2 f n fig 17 represents the effects of r e and σ on the instantaneous cavitating flow fields at t 0 for σ 2 0 as r e increases the wake region formed near the cylinder becomes narrower and the pressure drops more near the upper wake region for r e 100 cavitation occurs on the upper cylinder surface near 80 o θ 110 o as r e increases to 300 the upper cavitation region is extended to 80 o θ 155 o and cavitation is also observed on the lower surface of the cylinder for σ 1 0 the entire cylinder surface except near its front surface is covered by cavitated bubbles for r e 100 and 300 as r e increases the cavitation and dilatation effects on the shedding vortices become more significant the effect of r e on the resultant force coefficients c d and c l is plotted in fig 18 for σ 2 0 as r e increases c d and c l fluctuate more and the time averaged c d a v and rms c l r m s are larger however for σ 1 0 the effect of r e on c d and c l is reversed fig 19 presents the combined effect of cylinder oscillation cavitation and reynolds number on the time averaged c d a v and the rms c l r m s for r e 100 cavitation occurs with σ 1 3 in the stationary cylinder case and σ 2 0 in the oscillating cylinder case this means that the lock in condition of cylinder oscillation helps cavitation occur in the stationary cylinder case cavitation increases c d a v by 10 6 at σ 1 0 whereas in the oscillating cylinder case cavitation increases c d a v by 13 4 and c l r m s by 41 at σ 1 5 as σ decreases below 1 0 and a significant volume of cavitation occurs c d a v and c l r m s are rapidly reduced for both the stationary and oscillating cylinder cases the cylinder oscillation in the case without cavitation increases c d a v by 12 9 and c l r m s by 132 with cavitation at σ 1 5 the cylinder oscillation increases c d a v by 28 and c l r m s by 227 this indicates that the cylinder oscillation effect on the drag and lift coefficients is magnified under weak cavitation conditions however the oscillation effect is rapidly reduced when σ decreases below 1 0 as r e increases to 200 and 300 the maximum cavitation number for cavitation increases and the combined effect of cylinder oscillation and cavitation on c d a v becomes more significant the cylinder oscillation in the case without cavitation increases c d a v by 20 and 22 for r e 200 and r e 300 respectively the cylinder oscillation with cavitation increases c d a v by 43 and c l r m s by 136 at r e 200 and σ 2 0 and c d a v by 44 and c l r m s by 90 at r e 300 and σ 2 3 however the effect of cylinder oscillation is rapidly reduced as σ decreases below 1 3 4 conclusions computations were performed for cavitating flows around an oscillating circular cylinder an efficient numerical method was developed by combining a cavitation model for vapor transport under a thermodynamic constraint a semi implicit pressure correction method for compressible two phase flows and an immersed boundary method for moving solids the numerical method was tested for cavitating flows around a stationary cylinder and non cavitating flows around an oscillating cylinder whose results are reported in the literature the present approach was applied for cavitating flows around an oscillating cylinder under the lock in condition with the natural vortex shedding the cavitation which keeps the liquid pressure from falling below the saturated vapor pressure increases or decreases the time averaged drag and rms lift coefficients depending on the cavitation number when the cavitation number is above a certain value the cavitation in the oscillating cylinder case significantly increases the drag and lift coefficients whereas the cavitation in the stationary cylinder case slightly increases the drag coefficient as the cavitation number decreases and a significant volume of cavitation occurs the coefficients are rapidly reduced for both the stationary and oscillating cylinder cases the cylinder oscillation significantly increases the drag and lift coefficients when cavitation does not occur and weakly occurs however the effect of cylinder oscillation decreases for low cavitation numbers the computations with various frequency ratios and cavitation numbers demonstrated that the lock in condition maximizes the time averaged drag and rms lift coefficients over a wide range of cavitation numbers based on the computations for reynolds numbers between 100 and 300 cavitation occurs more easily as the reynolds number increases as the reynolds number increases from 100 to 200 and 300 the combined effect of cylinder oscillation and cavitation on the time averaged drag coefficient becomes more significant credit authorship contribution statement seongjin hong

circular cylinder l v liquid vapor o initial s saturation w solid surface 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a widespread phenomenon which can be seen in air or water flow over engineering structures such as bridges structures around offshore marine risers and cables related to this the effect of solid body motion on variations of flow field and solid body forces has been studied extensively huang et al 2019 zou et al 2019 taheri et al 2020 cavitation is a bubble generation phenomenon occurring in a liquid when its pressure is reduced below the saturation pressure the cavitating flow is a very important issue related to the performance of moving objects in ocean engineering applications such as underwater projectiles marine propellers and hydraulic machineries when the cavitated bubbles collapse in a higher pressure they produce an intense pressure wave to cause hydrodynamic erosion on the other hand cavitated bubbles which cover whole surface of a submerged object can reduce a friction drag gugulothu 2020 despite extensive studies of cavitation few numerical methods have been presented for cavitating flows around a moving body in this work a numerical approach for an oscillating cylinder in cavitating flows is developed by combining a homogeneous mixture cavitation model with an immersed boundary method cavitation models are mostly developed under the homogeneous mixture condition where the liquid velocity and pressure are the same with the vapor velocity and pressure the homogeneous cavitation models which employ the governing equations of mixture mass and momentum can be subdivided into two models that depend on barotropic relations and vapor transport equations respectively to calculate the mass or volume fraction of cavitation vapor in the barotropic or thermodynamic equilibrium models decaix and goncalvès 2013 koukouvinis et al 2017a using the equation of state eos that relates density and pressure the eos for the two phase mixture is estimated from an interpolation between the sound speed for each phase the vapor fraction is directly determined from the mixture density or the corresponding pressure the barotropic models are easy to implement without solving an additional differential equation for vapor fraction transport however assuming that the phase change or cavitation occurs in an arbitrary pressure range around the saturation pressure rather than at the saturation pressure thus the models are not easily applicable to lower speed cavitating flows with a small range of pressure variations giannadakis et al 2008 in the vapor fraction transport models sun et al 2020 movahedian et al 2019 ahn et al 2018 niedzwiedzka et al 2016 the vapor fraction is derived from the radius and number density of bubbles the vapor generation rate is approximated from the rayleigh plesset equation the models have empirical constants and various functional forms of pressure difference relative to the saturation pressure as reviewed in ref niedzwiedzka et al 2016 as a coupled approach for analysis of cavitation seo et al 2008 used a vapor mass fraction transport equation whose vapor generation term is implicitly evaluated by imposing a thermodynamic constraint the vapor mass fraction was assumed to be larger than the minimum mass fraction corresponding to the saturation pressure for a given mixture density this model can be applied without any empirical constants or any functional form of pressure difference most of cavitation models have been used with body fitted or unstructured grid methods when extended to flows around moving solids they require a large computational cost to regenerate meshes fitted to the solid boundaries as an efficient method to treat moving solids without regeneration of meshes immersed boundary ib methods have been developed in extensive studies peskin 1972 first proposed an ib method for computing the flow around moving heart valves by adding a force source to the conservation equation of momentum to impose the specified velocity conditions on a solid boundary immersed in a fluid a simplified ib formulation was developed by fadlun et al 2000 directly implementing the specified velocity on the solid boundary the ib methods have a numerical problem that when applied to moving solids a spurious pressure oscillation occurs near the solid boundaries passing fixed mesh points efforts have been made to reduce the numerical oscillation by employing an approach adding source and sink terms for mass conservation kim et al 2001 lee et al 2011 a cut cell discretization approach for the conservation equations örley et al 2015 a consistent direct discretization approach sato et al 2016 and several other approaches as reviewed in ref kim and choi 2019a despite extensive studies of cavitating flows few numerical studies have been reported for cavitating flows around moving solids recently örley et al 2015 computed cavitating flows around a rotating cross and through a control valve by combining a cut cell based ib method and a barotropic cavitation model their cavitation model is not general in that the interpolated speed of sound is inversely proportional to the mixture density koukouvinis et al 2017b similarly applied a combined ib and barotropic cavitation method to simulate bubble cavitation and high velocity jet formation caused by the snapping claw of a pistol shrimp in their barotropic model cavitation is assumed to occur in a pressure range of 4500 p a around the saturated vapor pressure of 2340 p a in the present work an efficient numerical approach is presented for computation of cavitating flows around a moving solid by combining the cavitation model of seo et al 2008 which includes a vapor fraction transport equation whose vapor generation term is implicitly evaluated from a thermodynamic constraint the cavitation model is combined with a pressure correction formulation jemison et al 2014 lee and son 2017 for effectively alleviating the limitations of the time interval in compressible two phase flows and an ib method to apply the specified velocity conditions to a moving solid surface the present formulation is tested for cavitating flows around a stationary cylinder and non cavitating flows around an oscillating cylinder computations are further performed for cavitating flows around an oscillating cylinder the combined effects of cylinder oscillation and cavitation on the pressure drag and lift coefficients is quantified 2 numerical analysis we consider a circular cylinder immersed in liquid water at 25 o c the numerical method is developed under a homogeneous mixture condition that the liquid velocity and pressure are the same with the vapor velocity and pressure the two phase flows are assumed to be laminar and compressible 2 1 governing equations defining y as the vapor mass fraction the conservation equations are expressed as 1 ρ t u ρ 0 2 ρ y t u ρ y k 3 ρ u t

procedure requires a strict time step for a stable solution in the present approach we employ a semi implicit pressure correction method jemison et al 2014 lee and son 2017 where the velocity solved from eq 3 along with p p ρ y are corrected by the following equation 9 u ρ d d t 1 ρ α ρ v a v 2 1 α ρ l a l 2 d p d t 1 ρ v 1 ρ l ρ d y d t where d d t t u eq 9 is derived by manipulating eq 1 with

is set to be greater than y m i n which is obtained from eq 8 with p p s as 15 y m i n 1 ρ 1 ρ l s 1 ρ v s 1 ρ l s when y is smaller than y m i n which means that the local pressure is lower than p s as indicated by point a of fig 1 bubble cavitation is assumed to occur and y is set to be y m i n as indicated by point b of fig 1 so that the local pressure converges to p s this procedure is simply implemented as 16 y n 1 max y y m i n eq 3 is decomposed into two parts 17 ρ n 1 u ρ u n δ t u ρ u n p μ u s n 18 ρ n 1 u n 1 u δ t p n 1 p where 19 s μ u t 2 3 μ u here p is iteratively evaluated

the same way as in the momentum equation using eqs 22 and 23 with φ ρ 2 3 implementation of an immersed boundary ib method the fluid and immersed solid regions are described by a signed distance level set ls function ψ from the immersed solid boundary the fluid and solid regions are distinguished by ψ 0 and ψ 0 respectively to discretize the mass and momentum equations near the immersed solid boundary we use an ib method similar to the consistent direct discretization method presented in ref sato et al 2016 in which the mass and momentum equations are discretized at all nodes in the fluid region ψ 0 including even near the immersed solid boundary the flux terms of conservation equations near the solid boundary are interpolated or extrapolated from the densities and velocities at the adjacent fluid nodes and the solid boundary the discretized momentum eq 21 and the discretized mass eq 25 are implemented according to the placement of the solid boundary between the neighboring nodes as depicted in fig 2 the discretized conservation equations are applied to all velocity nodes with ψ i 1 2 0 while the no slip velocity conditions u u w to all solid nodes with ψ i 1 2 0 in the case

2340 p a 3 1 validation and grid resolution test the present numerical method is first tested through the bleich and sandler problem bleich and sandler 1970 which is a well known benchmark problem for one dimensional cavitation the problem consists of a semi infinite fluid column supporting an immersed rigid body of weight w per unit area as depicted in fig 3 a and an exponentially decaying pressure wave impinging on the body surface at t 0 the rarefaction wave reflected from the body surface causes cavitation in the analysis of bleich and sandler they assumed that the pressure in a cavitated region is uniform as p s and the pressure density relation is linear this approach is similar to the cut off cavitation model liu et al 2004 daramizadeh and ansari 2015 which is expressed as p p s ρ ρ l s a l 2 for ρ ρ l s p p s for ρ ρ l s using the following initial conditions at t 0 p p s p m e y l p a ρ l s g y w g ρ ρ l s p p s a l 2 v p m e y l ρ a l and the boundary condition at

initial fluid solid interface is located at y 0 uniform fine meshes of h 0 01 m are used in 4 m y 0 1 m whereas non uniform coarse meshes in the other region for this test case we choose a small nonzero vapor mass fraction of y o 10 12 to initiate cavitation and modify the bulk modulus π l in eq 11 so that a l 1423 m s at p 101 k p a fig 3b and c shows the temporal variations of body motion and cavitated region the computed results from the cut off cavitation model shows good agreement with the theoretical predictions bleich and sandler 1970 but the numerical results from the present cavitation model with γ v 1 as marked by model 2a differ from the theoretical predictions during the contraction of the cavitated region this is caused by the difference in the vapor side sound speed a v the theoretical and cut off models assume a v 0 whereas the present model uses a v γ v p ρ v when a v is reduced by using γ v 0 1 the numerical results from the present model as marked by model 2b compare well with the theoretical predictions the present computations for non cavitating or cavitating flows over a stationary and oscillating cylinders are performed in a large computational domain of 75 d x 100 d and 50 d y 50 d to avoid the effect of the domain size as depicted in fig 4 the cylinder is located at x c y c 0 0 and uniform fine meshes of size h are used in a domain of d x 2 d and d y d near the cylinder whereas non uniform coarse meshes for the outer domain the symbol θ represents an angle on the cylinder surface measured from its front stagnation point we use the inflow condition of u u and the pressure condition of p p on the boundaries of x 75 d and x 100 d respectively while using the symmetry condition on the top and bottom boundaries all computations are initialized with u u v 0 and p p cavitating flows are simulated by varying the ambient pressure p or the cavitation number σ in the present work the atmospheric pressure is corresponding to σ 7 8 a small nonzero vapor volume fraction of α o 0 01 is used to initiate cavitation gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 which corresponds the initial vapor mass fraction of y o 7 49 10 6 at p 1 b a r the present approach is tested for a stationary cylinder immersed in liquid water at r e 200 referring to the previous studies gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 braza et al 1986 qu et al 2013 kim and choi 2019b ding et al 2007 harichandan and roy 2012 for unsteady vortex shedding vortices are generated on the cylinder surface and detach alternatively from its upper and lower surfaces the oscillating flow around the cylinder results in fluctuations in the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l the time averaged c d a v the maximum c l m a x and s t are listed in table 1 the present results match well with the previous works using a polar coordinate system braza et al 1986 qu et al 2013 kim and choi 2019b a mesh free finite difference method ding et al 2007 and an unstructured triangular mesh system harichandan and roy 2012 the results of ref braza et al 1986 are slightly different from other results because their mesh size used was larger computations are extended to cavitating flows at σ 1 0 and σ 0 7 as the liquid pressure decreases to p s cavitation occurs around the lateral surface of the cylinder the cavitated bubble detaches from the cylinder surface and flows with shedding vortices as the velocity divergence or dilatation effect due to cavitation elongates and weakens the shedding vortices gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 the computed shedding frequencies are reduced to s t 0 177 and s t 0 145 for σ 1 0 and σ 0 7 respectively which are comparable to the corresponding predictions of s t 0 160 and s t 0 153 reported by gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 fig 5 plots the time averaged c p on the cylinder for the case without cavitation at σ 7 8 as θ increases and the flow accelerates c p decreases and becomes minimum near θ 80 o thereafter as the flow decelerates with θ c p increases and varies slowly in a wake region near θ 180 o when cavitation occurs as the cavitation number decreases to σ 1 0 and σ 0 7 the minimum of c p is close to σ which is caused by the fact that the pressure in a cavitated vapor region does not drop below p s therefore the local result of c p σ 0 indicates the occurrence of cavitation the prediction of c p variation depending on σ shows good agreement with the previous work gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 the present numerical formulation is also tested for an oscillating cylinder at r e 0 the cylinder center and its velocity are prescribed as x c a sin 2 π f c t and u c u c m a x cos 2 π f c t respectively where u c m a x 2 π f c a we choose the keulegan carpenter number of k c 5 and the reynolds number of r e c m a x 100 where k c u c

fig 6 a d shows periodic patterns of vorticity contours and c p fields for t 13 t c where t c is the period of oscillation defined as t c 1 f c boundary layers and counter rotating vortices are observed to develop alternatively with the oscillating cylinder the computed flow patterns and the associated pressure fields compare well with the previous works lee et al 2011 dütsch et al 1998 the effect of h on the instantaneous drag coefficient c d is depicted in fig 6e the results have non physical oscillations for h 0 04 d but the oscillations decrease with reducing the mesh size as similarly observed in ref lee et al 2011 using ib methods the converged result compares well with the previous work dütsch et al 1998 using a body fitted structured grid in a moving reference system as seen in fig 6f a grid resolution test is conducted for a cavitating flow around an oscillating cylinder at r e 200 and σ 2 0 we choose an oscillation amplitude of a 0 1 d and a frequency of f c 2 f n where f n is the vortex shedding frequency calculated from s t 0 194 three different mesh sizes of h 0 005 d 0 01 d and 0 02 d are selected with δ t 0 3 h u the computations are carried out until the flow around the cylinder reaches a periodic state the results are plotted in fig 7 where the lift coefficient c l is close to maximum the computed instantaneous c p field vapor volume fraction c d and c l of the cylinder are seen to have slight differences for h 0 01 d and 0 02 d however the results are nearly identical for h 0 005 d and 0 01 d and spurious pressure oscillations in c d and c l of the cylinder is not observed for h 0 01 d therefore we use the mesh size of h 0 01 d for efficient computations without losing numerical accuracy 3 2 non cavitating flow at r e 200 and f c 2 f n we consider an oscillating cylinder at r e 200 a 0 1 d and f c 2 f n where f n is calculated from s t 0 194 this condition is known as the lock in condition huang et al 2019 hurlbut et al 1982 al mdallal et al 2007 that the cylinder oscillation is synchronized with the natural vortex shedding and thus c d and c l increase significantly in the case without cavitation the ambient pressure is chosen as p 1 b a r which corresponds to σ 7 8 figs 8 and 9 show the vorticity contour and c p field and the associated c p c d and c l on the cylinder during two cycles of cylinder oscillation a pair of vortices are observed to develop asymmetrically on the cylinder surface detach alternatively from the upper and lower surfaces and fluctuate downstream the vortex shedding behavior for the oscillating cylinder is similar to the stationary cylinder case but the pressure field is quite different depending on whether the cylinder is in motion at t 0 when the cylinder moves to x c 0 from x c a and its velocity toward the free stream is u c 2 π f c a at its maximum during the cylinder oscillation period the local c p on the cylinder surface has a minimum value of c p 2 9 near θ 80 o and c p 2 3 near θ 280 o the local c p on the upper cylinder surface 0 θ 180 o is slightly lower than on the lower surface 180 θ 360 o as seen in fig 9a when the cylinder moves up to x c a with maximum deceleration of 2 π f c 2 a toward the free stream fig 8b the pressure decreases near θ 0 o and increases near θ 180 o as a result c d has a minimum value as depicted in fig 9b when the cylinder return to x c 0 with u c 2 π f c a at t 0 5 t c fig 8c and moves up to x c a with maximum acceleration of 2 π f c 2 a toward the free stream at t 0 75 t c fig 8d the pressure increases near θ 0 o and decreases near θ 180 o and c p is higher on the upper cylinder surface this results in c d at its maximum and c l at its minimum when the cylinder moves to x c a during the following cycle of t c t 2 t c the vortex shedding process is repeated alternatively on the opposite of the upper and lower surfaces the time averaged c d a v and the maximum c l m a x evaluated from fig 9b are 1 56 and 1 15 respectively which compare well with the numerical results of 1 58 and 1 16 reported in ref al mdallal et al 2007 3 3 effect of cavitation at r e 200 and f c 2 f n computations are carried out to analyze the influence of cavitation on the velocity and pressure fields around an oscillating cylinder the cavitation number σ is varied while keeping f c 2 f n and the other parameters as in the previous section it is noted that cavitation does not occur around a stationary cylinder for r e 200 and σ 2 0 thus the natural frequency of f n does not change for σ 2 0 figs 10 12 show the vorticity contours c p fields and vapor volume fraction fields at σ 2 5 σ 2 0 and σ 1 0 respectively cavitation is most likely to occur when the cylinder moves to x c 0 from x c a and the pressure is below p s a t or c p σ for σ 2 5 when the local pressure decreases to p s a small volume of cavitation appears on the upper surface near θ 80 o in the cavitated region where c p remains at the value of σ the flow around the cylinder surface does not accelerate as σ decreases to 2 0 more bubbles are produced on the lower surface near θ 280 o as well as the upper surface near θ 80 o and fluctuate with shedding vortices as seen in fig 11 when σ is further reduced to 1 0 a significant volume of bubble cavitation occurs on both the lateral surfaces of the cylinder the cavitated bubbles detach from the cylinder surface and fluctuate with shedding vortices the vorticity contours become more dilated and longer in the cavitated vapor region as σ decreases the associated resultant c d and c l and the time averaged c p on the cylinder are plotted in fig 13 at t 0 when the cylinder moves to x c 0 from x c a the local c p on the cylinder surface without cavitation has a minimum value and cavitation occurs near θ 80 o for σ 2 5 as σ decreases the cavitated region becomes wider and the pressure recovery on the cylinder surface of θ 90 o becomes slow this lowers the pressure near θ 180 o with a decrease in σ therefore the instantaneous c d at t 0 increases as the cavitation number decreases to σ 2 0 fig 13a at t 0 25 t c when the cylinder moves up to x c a with deceleration c p decreases near θ 0 o and increases near θ 70 o for σ 2 0 and θ 110 o for σ 2 0 for σ 2 5 as the pressure on the upper cylinder surface increases the cavitated bubble is compressed for a lower cavitation number of σ 2 0 the cavitated bubble on the upper surface is compressed similarly but more cavitation occurs on the lower surface and thus the entire cylinder surface is surrounded by a negative c p field fig 11b as the cylinder returns to x c 0 the pressure on the upper surface θ 130 o further increases whereas the pressure on the lower surface does not change much as a result the bubble on the upper surface is greatly compressed and collapse resulting in a shock wave the shock wave occurs frequently and causes sharp peaks on the c d and c l curves as depicted in fig 13a and b when the cylinder moves up to x c a with acceleration toward the free stream at t 0 75 t c c p becomes higher on the upper surface and the c p near θ 0 o increases significantly as a result c l is reduced and c d becomes maximum at t 0 75 t c when σ is reduced to 1 and 0 7 and cavitation occurs over the entire cylinder surface except near its front side the pressure remains at p s a t and the oscillating amplitudes of c d and c l decrease significantly fig 14 a focuses on the evolution of c p field at σ 2 0 associated with the bubble collapse near the oscillating cylinder at t 0 26 t c the cavitated bubble on the upper cylinder surface is compressed toward θ 80 o the bubble collapse at t 0 35 t c causes a very high pressure field near the upper surface of 80 o θ 100 o and the resulting shock wave propagates as seen at t 0 39 t c this kind of shock which does not occur in the regime of σ 3 0 without cavitation is observed in the regime of 1 2 σ 3 0 where bubbles are generated and collapsed near the oscillating cylinder however the shock wave does not occur in the regime of σ 1 2 where the cavitated bubbles remain attached to the cylinder as depicted in fig 14b the time averaged c p on the cylinder surface are presented in fig 13c for different cavitation numbers as σ decreases to 2 0 from 7 8 which corresponds to the case without cavitation the local c p does not decrease much due to cavitation near θ 80 o which causes a slower pressure recovery on the rear surface θ 120 o and then decreases c p this results in a significant increase in the time averaged drag coefficient c d a v while the local c p near the leading edge θ 0 of the cylinder is not affected by cavitation compared to c d a v 1 58 at σ 7 8 c d a v increases by 20 at σ 2 0 for σ 1 the lateral surface of the cylinder is covered by the cavitated bubble and c p stays close to σ the time averaged c d a v is reduced to 1 40 and 1 18 at σ 1 0 and σ 0 7 respectively 3 4 effects of cylinder frequency and cavitation at r e 200 fig 15 shows the effects of frequency ratio f c f n and cavitation number σ on the root mean square rms drag coefficient fluctuation c d c d a v r m s the time averaged drag coefficient c d a v and the rms lift coefficient c l r m s of an oscillating cylinder where c r m s c 2 d t t c as the oscillating velocity amplitude u c m a x of the cylinder increases with f c the drag coefficient fluctuation c d c d a v r m s increases the influence of cavitation is observed to be pronounced for f c 1 5 f n the curves for c d a v and c l r m s have peaks near the lock in condition of f c 2 f n the peak values increase as cavitation occurs and σ decreases to 2 0 from 7 8 and then decrease as described in the previous section the combined effects of f c f n and σ on c d a v and c l r m s are summarized in fig 16 compared to the stationary case of f c 0 the cylinder oscillation has little influence in the regime of f c 1 5 f n and has a large influence in the regime of f c 1 5 f n and 1 3 σ 2 6 as f c approaches to 2 f n c d a v and c l r m s increase significantly over a wide range of cavitation numbers and have maximum values near σ 2 0 when the cavitation number becomes less than 2 0 the lock in condition effect on the drag and lift coefficients weakens in the regime of f c 2 f n and σ 2 0 c d a v and c l r m s become smaller as the frequency ratio is higher and σ is lower 3 5 effects of reynolds number and cavitation at f c 2 f n fig 17 represents the effects of r e and σ on the instantaneous cavitating flow fields at t 0 for σ 2 0 as r e increases the wake region formed near the cylinder becomes narrower and the pressure drops more near the upper wake region for r e 100 cavitation occurs on the upper cylinder surface near 80 o θ 110 o as r e increases to 300 the upper cavitation region is extended to 80 o θ 155 o and cavitation is also observed on the lower surface of the cylinder for σ 1 0 the entire cylinder surface except near its front surface is covered by cavitated bubbles for r e 100 and 300 as r e increases the cavitation and dilatation effects on the shedding vortices become more significant the effect of r e on the resultant force coefficients c d and c l is plotted in fig 18 for σ 2 0 as r e increases c d and c l fluctuate more and the time averaged c d a v and rms c l r m s are larger however for σ 1 0 the effect of r e on c d and c l is reversed fig 19 presents the combined effect of cylinder oscillation cavitation and reynolds number on the time averaged c d a v and the rms c l r m s for r e 100 cavitation occurs with σ 1 3 in the stationary cylinder case and σ 2 0 in the oscillating cylinder case this means that the lock in condition of cylinder oscillation helps cavitation occur in the stationary cylinder case cavitation increases c d a v by 10 6 at σ 1 0 whereas in the oscillating cylinder case cavitation increases c d a v by 13 4 and c l r m s by 41 at σ 1 5 as σ decreases below 1 0 and a significant volume of cavitation occurs c d a v and c l r m s are rapidly reduced for both the stationary and oscillating cylinder cases the cylinder oscillation in the case without cavitation increases c d a v by 12 9 and c l r m s by 132 with cavitation at σ 1 5 the cylinder oscillation increases c d a v by 28 and c l r m s by 227 this indicates that the cylinder oscillation effect on the drag and lift coefficients is magnified under weak cavitation conditions however the oscillation effect is rapidly reduced when σ decreases below 1 0 as r e increases to 200 and 300 the maximum cavitation number for cavitation increases and the combined effect of cylinder oscillation and cavitation on c d a v becomes more significant the cylinder oscillation in the case without cavitation increases c d a v by 20 and 22 for r e 200 and r e 300 respectively the cylinder oscillation with cavitation increases c d a v by 43 and c l r m s by 136 at r e 200 and σ 2 0 and c d a v by 44 and c l r m s by 90 at r e 300 and σ 2 3 however the effect of cylinder oscillation is rapidly reduced as σ decreases below 1 3 4 conclusions computations were performed for cavitating flows around an oscillating circular cylinder an efficient numerical method was developed by combining a cavitation model for vapor transport under a thermodynamic constraint a semi implicit pressure correction method for compressible two phase flows and an immersed boundary method for moving solids the numerical method was tested for cavitating flows around a stationary cylinder and non cavitating flows around an oscillating cylinder whose results are reported in the literature the present approach was applied for cavitating flows around an oscillating cylinder under the lock in condition with the natural vortex shedding the cavitation which keeps the liquid pressure from falling below the saturated vapor pressure increases or decreases the time averaged drag and rms lift coefficients depending on the cavitation number when the cavitation number is above a certain value the cavitation in the oscillating cylinder case significantly increases the drag and lift coefficients whereas the cavitation in the stationary cylinder case slightly increases the drag coefficient as the cavitation number decreases and a significant volume of cavitation occurs the coefficients are rapidly reduced for both the stationary and oscillating cylinder cases the cylinder oscillation significantly increases the drag and lift coefficients when cavitation does not occur and weakly occurs however the effect of cylinder oscillation decreases for low cavitation numbers the computations with various frequency ratios and cavitation numbers demonstrated that the lock in condition maximizes the time averaged drag and rms lift coefficients over a wide range of cavitation numbers based on the computations for reynolds numbers between 100 and 300 cavitation occurs more easily as the reynolds number increases as the reynolds number increases from 100 to 200 and 300 the combined effect of cylinder oscillation and cavitation on the time averaged drag coefficient becomes more significant credit authorship contribution statement seongjin hong

20903,this paper presents numerical simulations for the runup of solitary like waves on a sloping beach and circular island the solitary like wave is constructed by introducing an elongation parameter to the wavenumber of the solitary wave all simulations are performed with a boussinesq model solving the fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive boussinesq equations the numerical model is validated by comparing the computed runup of solitary waves on sloping beach and circular island to the experimental runup data the propagation of the solitary like wave in a constant flume and the runup on a sloping plane beach and the circular island are simulated initial surface elevation of a solitary like wave is provided as the initial condition the waveform of a solitary like wave with different values of the elongation parameter shows that undular bores and a train of solitary waves could appear in offshore shallow regions runup of solitary like waves on the sloping beach and circular island shares the same decay trends but different powers abnormal rear runup only exceeds the front runup for some cases of given nonlinearity parameters and relative wavelength and the waterline diameter of a circular island the computed ratio of rear runup front runup is less than 1 3 keywords runup solitary like wave single sloping beach circular island boussinesq model 1 introduction tsunami in the past two decades has brought substantial damage and casualty to coastal communities investigations on tsunami waves or tsunami like waves are still popular among coastal engineerings such as runup inundation on coastal regions potential damages to submarine pipelines the runup inundation of tsunamis on a beach is an important subject to evaluate risk of tsunami waves to coastal regions due to moving waterline on a beach and breaking of waves it has been one of the most challenging problems in nonlinear water wave modeling in coastal and offshore engineering much work has been done theoretically numerically and experimentally by adopting solitary waves to investigate tsunamis such as witham 1974 synolakis 1987 li and raichlen 2001 briggs et al 1995 and keen and lynett 2019 et al especially synolakis 1987 briggs et al 1995 and keen and lynett 2019 they conducted a large number of experiments on wave runup on sloping beach or island s for tsunami waves propagating from the source area to coastal regions they always encounter reefs islands gentle continental shelf or coastal forests iimura and tanaka 2012 and maza et al 2015 studied the interaction of tsunami wave solitary wave with forests numerically in the framework of the boussinesq type equations and the rans equations respectively for wave interaction with an island experiments were conducted by briggs et al 1995 to study the runup of tsunami waves solitary waves around a circular island liu et al 1995 conducted numerical simulations to explain the reason why the wave runup on the rear side of the circular island is larger than that on the front side in the framework of the shallow water equations keen and lynett 2019 further conducted experiments to study the wave runup on two islands with different configurations experiments that uncover the wave runup of near field landslide tsunamis were implemented by di risio et al 2009a and di risio et al 2009b a steel ellipsoid slides downward into water from a circular island with its flank sloping 1 3 water disturbance triggered by the ellipsoid on the slope around the circular island were recorded due to the balance of the nonlinearity and dispersion the solitary wave was employed by the aforementioned literatures to conduct investigations however the solitary wave does not naturally be employed to model the important features of tsunami waves since the spatial length of a solitary wave is rather short when being compared with a tsunami wave this conclusion was made in madsen et al 2008 chan and liu 2012 affirmed this conclusion with the measured tsunami signals obtained by sea bottom pressure gauges during the 2011 tohoku tsunami event the tsunami signal can be fitted by three s e c h 2 functions while the s e c h 2 function is similar to a solitary wave thus a wave with s e c h 2 profile is a solitary like wave in this paper even though the solitary wave is no more proper to be employed to investigate the significances of tsunami waves plenty of investigations are still used the solitary wave but with a new name tsunami like wave for example hsiao and lin 2010 investigated the over topping of the tsunami like solitary waves on an impermeable seawall in the framework of rans reynolds averaged navier stokes modeling iimura and tanaka 2012 and maza et al 2015 invested the mitigation effect of coastal plants to tsunami waves but solitary waves in reality there are investigations on non solitary tsunami waves to the author s knowledge chan and liu 2012 is the first to study non solitary tsunami waves they investigated the runup of a combination of three solitary like waves combined waveform hereafter on a plane beach williams and fuhrman 2016 investigated the boundary layers of solitary like waves leading depression n shape tsunami waves and the combined waveform qu et al 2017 investigated the impact of both the solitary wave and the combined waveform on submerged cylinders the generation of a solitary like tsunami wave or the combined waveform in a numerical flume is easy however the generation of non solitary but solitary like tsunami waves in an experimental wave flume is difficult as stated in goseberg et al 2013 the wavemaker s stroke limits capability of a wave flume to make solitary like tsunami waves for example the required stroke is 8 9 m if a series of linear waves whose period and height are 90 s and 0 1 m respectively in the large wave flume groβer wellenkanal gwk although the combined waveform waves as well as solitary like waves and real tsunami waves were generated by schimmels et al 2016 this can only be a reality in very large flume instead of a conventional flume with its length no more than 100 m new wave generation methods need to be developed wüthrich et al 2018 generated tsunami like waves in a wave basin with a vertical water reservoir the wave was generated by releasing the water in the reservoir into the basin similarly wang et al 2018 generated undular tsunami waves in a wave basin by pumping water from a lateral reservoir into the basin and a surge was generated the stroke wavemaker generates short waves such as solitary waves they preciously super composed a double solitary wave on a surge to make a undular bore calculated by li et al 2018 although tsunami like waves were successfully generated by a wave maker or and a reservoir it is still difficult to directly study the runup of waves on an island due to the limitation of the lateral width or the length of the wave basin moreover the runup of single crest solitary like waves on the sloping beach needs further investigation the solitary like wave is an idealized wave type the combination of more than two solitary like wave is complicated although the combined waveform were recorded during the 2011 tohoku tsunami there is a solitary like wave whose wave amplitude is much larger than the rest two in this study we numerically investigate the runup of single crest solitary like waves on a sloping beach and a circular island the boussinesq type numerical model funwave tvd is employed this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the single crest solitary like wave and the numerical model are introduced first then the runup of solitary waves on sloping beaches is calculated and compared with the experimental data at last the runup solitary waves on a circular island is calculated and compared with the experimental data in section 3 the propagation of solitary like waves with different elongation parameters are calculated and compared mutually then the runup of solitary like waves on a sloping beach and the circular island is discussed separately runup formulas of solitary like wave are provided and calibrated with available experiment runup data the occasions that the rear runup exceeds the front one are delineated the last section 4 reaches the conclusions of this paper 2 numerical model and validation 2 1 description of the single wave and numerical model for a potential extreme tsunami scenario in the south china sea as shown in li et al 2018 when tsunami waves propagate to the vicinity of dongsha island the tsunami waves resemble a single crest see fig 1 a the spatial profile of the tsunami waves is wider than that of the solitary wave if they share an identical wave amplitude by introducing an elongation parameter γ to the solitary solution 1 η x d ε s e c h 2 k x x 1 where η x is the spatial shape of a solitary like wave d is the water depth ε h d is the nonlinearity factor or wave amplitude normalized by water depth k γ 0 75 h d 3 is the wavenumber γ is the elongation parameter x 1 is the horizontal position of the crest peak equation 1 reduces to the solution of the solitary wave if γ 1 0 as γ decreases the length of the solitary like wave gets longer we also compare the frequency components of the tsunami wave as well as the components of the solitary wave and solitary like wave the wave amplitude of them are identical although in a the wavefront of the tsunami wave and solitary like wave differs in the spatial domain this difference is only interpreted by the first order and second order magnitude components in the frequency domain also the significant width of the wavenumber for the tsunami wave and the solitary like wave is narrower than that of the solitary wave the open source fully nonlinear boussinesq wave model with tvd total variation diminishing solver funwave tvd is used to compute the propagation and runup of solitary like waves on a sloping beach and a circular island the governing equations of this solver in the cartesian coordinate stems from wei et al 1995 and then from chen 2006 the dispersion accuracy of governing equations reaches the second order o μ 2 where μ k d is the dispersion perturbation parameter k and d are the wavenumber and water depth respectively no assumption between the nonlinearity and dispersion was made all nonlinear terms within o μ 2 were kept so the governing equations are fully nonlinear but weakly dispersive in shi et al 2012 the governing equations were re organized to be hyperbolic so as to implement riemann solver variables such as velocity components and water surface elevation were positioned at the cell center the muscl tvd scheme was used to reconstruct the variables at the cell interface from the variables at the cell center the third order strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme was used to implement temporal advancement with the courant friedrichs lewy cfl being 0 5 the straightforward wetting drying scheme is used to model a moving boundary the wetting drying threshold is 0 001 m uniformly for all simulations in this paper after careful runup validation initially the water surface elevation and velocity components are provided for simulations of solitary like waves the surface elevation at the tone of the slope or island is 0 02 h were h is the wave amplitude for numerical scenarios where incident solitary or solitary like wave breaks over sloping beach the eddy viscosity breaking algorithm kennedy et al 2000 is activated to dissipate kinetic energy the onset and cessation of wave breaking is critical and the empirical parameters c b r k 1 0 45 and c b r k 2 0 35 as suggested by choi et al 2018 2 2 validation of runup of solitary waves on sloping beaches experiments on the runup of single and multi solitary wave s have been conducted by xuan et al 2013 in the wave flume of the key laboratory of hydrodynamics ministry of education at shanghai jiao tong university the width and length of the flume are 0 80 m and 65 m respectively we use the experimental results to validate the numerical model in both experimental and numerical cases the sloping angle varies from 2 86 to 90 the relative amplitude of the incident solitary wave varies from 0 03 to 0 45 table 1 lists the detailed parameters of all validation cases for numerical simulations the grid size is uniform 0 03 m if the sloping angle is smaller than 45 otherwise the grid size is 0 01 m the change of grid resolution can account for the wave runup better for relatively steep sloping beaches water surface elevation is provided according to equation 1 of course with the elongation parameter γ 1 for an experimental scenario s l o p e 1 10 ε 0 342 the time series of the surface elevation and the theoretical data calculated by equation 1 with γ 1 are compared in fig 2 a and the propagation and runup snapshots are shown in fig 2 b the shape of the incident solitary waves is quite stable when propagating over the flat bottom due to the balancing of the effect of nonlinearity and the effect of dispersion the waveform becomes asymmetry at t g d 59 when the effect of nonlinearity exceeds that of dispersion and the wavefront is almost vertical at t g d 74 as the effect of nonlinearity accumulates the incident solitary wave splashed on the sloping beach after t g d 74 at t g d 80 s the wave runup is the largest the experimental runup for this case is 0 373 m and the numerical data is 0 380 m numerical runup exceeds the experimental data by only 1 02 more comparisons of the wave runup are shown in fig 3 noticed that the incident solitary wave breaks only for scenarios where the beach slope is 1 20 and the initial nonlinearity ε 0 272 0 371 the breaking type is plunging according to grilli et al 1997 for both breaking and nonbreaking incident soltiary waves the results of numerical runup agree well with the experimental ones the mean relative error of runups are about or smaller than 10 thus it can be conclude that the numerical model can be used to compute the runup of solitary waves on sloping beaches for both breaking and nonbreaking solitary waves 2 3 validation of runup of solitary waves on a circular island wave runup on the front side of an island is intuitively larger than that on the rear side while during the post field surveys of the 1992 flores island tsunami and the 1994 okushiri tsunami larger runup on the rear side of an island was observed briggs et al 1995 and liu et al 1995 carried out a series of experiments and simulations to study the runup of solitary waves on a circular island respectively the measured data are employed to validate the numerical results a wave basin was build by using the numerical model funwave tvd the size of the numerical wave basin is slightly longer than the experimental wave basin due to different wave making method as shown in fig 4 the island is placed at the 0 0 the slope of the island is 1 4 with its bottom diameter 7 2 m the length of the numerical basin extends from y 30 m to y 17 m the width extends from x 15 m to x 15 m the depth of water in the numerical wave basin is 0 32 m the incident solitary wave propagates along the y direction and is initialized with the crest of the wave positioned at y 20 m relative amplitudes of incident wave are 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 the spatial grid resolution is 0 03 m uniformly fig 5 shows the comparison of the numerical and the experimental time series of wave surface elevation at different gauge locations the sequence number of wave gauges is identical to that in liu et al 1995 the coordinate of each gauge is labeled in each subfigure the arrival time of the incident is shifted to agree with the measured data gauge 1 6 are on the front side of the island numerical data can capture the wave crest well the following wave trough is relatively poorly resolved for the rundown process is highly relevant to the vertical velocity component and the two dimensional wave model can not predict the vertical component gauge 7 12 are on the right side of the island the wave trough is poorly predicted due to the same reason gauge 13 18 are on the rear side of the island the height of the wave peak at gauge 13 is the largest because there is an abnormally large wave runup on the rear side of the island fig 6 shows the runup of solitary waves on the slope of the island runup of the solitary wave ε 0 05 is underestimated while for cases ε 0 10 and 0 20 the numerical runup is acceptable when being compared with the recorded data in general the comparisons of the gauge profiles as well as the runup are quite acceptable 3 propagation and runup of solitary like waves 3 1 propagation in a constant water depth flume difficulties are there experimentally for solitary like waves propagating a long distance while it is quite easy and straightforward to calculate numerically the propagation as shown in fig 7 four series of solitary like waves with the elongation parameters being unity non unity propagate in a wave flume with flat bottom the water depth of the flume is d 0 32 m and the length of the flume is 1000 d at the initial second the crest locates at 0 solitary like waves propagate rightward numerical simulations are conducted with the fully nonlinear and weakly boussinesq equations in the cartesian coordinate the mesh size is 0 03 m uniformly spatial waveforms are recorded every second as indicated by the integer above the crest it can be seen that the waveform of a solitary wave fig 7 c does not change while the waveforms of solitary like waves fig 7 a b d vary during propagation in detail the fat solitary like waves become asymmetry during propagation the wave front becomes steep while the wave back becomes flat gradually once the front of a solitary like wave steepens enough it firstly evolves into undular bores while for the slim solitary like wave due to its unnatural spatial gradient the initial solitary like wave collapses the amplitude of the leading crest is smaller than the initial amplitude undular tails follow the leading crest and the distance between the first two crests increases gradually for solitary like waves with non unity elongation parameters were the flume long enough the solitary like wave in it first evolves into undular bores and eventually into independent solitary waves 3 2 runup of solitary like waves islands and reefs scatter in the south china sea the geometric shape vary a lot for example the horizontal cross sections of dongsha island and huangyan island is a circle while the cross sections of xisha island and taiping island are ellipses the upper diameter circular islands are 20 50 km for the giant tsunami in the south china sea the spatial length of the tsunami wave is about 70 km which is about 1 4 times of the upper diameter of islands so for simulations in this section the length of the solitary like wave is nondimensionalized by the diameter of the water cross section the diameter of the water cross section is 4 64 m and is identical to the experimental island in liu et al 1995 table 2 lists the length of solitary like waves and the corresponding elongation parameters in terms of different wave height for runup simulations of the solitary like wave on the sloping beach the wavelength varies 1 10 times of the island diameter fig 8 a shows the sketch of the sloping beach for runup simulations of the solitary like wave on the circular the wavelength varies 1 7 times of the island diameter fig 8 b illustrates the sketch of the computational domain for all simulations in this section the surface elevation and velocity components of solitary like waves are provided as the initial conditions the solitary like wave is positioned before the toe of the slope or the island by half a wavelength as illustrated the numerical setup is identical to that in simulations of solitary waves except for the length of the computational domain which is determined by the wavelength 3 2 1 runup on a sloping plane beach the propagation and running up down of the solitary like wave ε 0 20 l d 1 0 are shown in fig 9 the water surface on the sloping beach reaches the first peak at t g d 15 5 the water quickly runs down and reaches the first minimum at t g d 24 4 again there is a second runup on the sloping beach the runup and rundown history of this case is shown by the dashed dot line in the top left figure of fig 10 clearly there is two runup peaks and a rundown peak for solitary like waves ε 0 05 and ε 0 10 the runup rundown profiles are similar with that of ε 0 20 however the second runup decreases with initial wave amplitude moreover as the wavelength increases the rundown and the second runup decreases quickly for solitary like waves l d 2 5 the rundown and the second runup disappear besides the first runup of solitary like waves also decreases as the wavelength increases which is also shown in fig 11 a if the wavelength of the incident is long enough its runup on the sloping beach is identical with two times of its initial wave amplitude the runup of solitary waves can be estimated by equation 2 and the runup of solitary like waves can be estimated by equation 3 after introducing the effect of the elongation parameter γ as shown in fig 11 c and d the wave runup decays with the elongation of wavelength the decay rate is γ 0 20 where the power 0 20 is fitted by the least square algorithm in the julia package curvefit the correlation coefficient is 0 920 2 r s

elongation parameter of solitary like wave 3 2 2 runup on a circular island as tsunami waves propagate towards the shore they may encounter an island runup of solitary waves on a circular island has been studied by briggs et al 1995 and liu et al 1995 abnormal large runup on the rear side of the island was observed we further study the single wave on an island with the same dimensions as that used in experiments the relative amplitudes of incident waves are ε 0 05 ε 0 10 ε 0 20 and ε 0 30 the width of the incident solitary like waves is longer than d but smaller than 7d where d is the diameter of waterline around the island runup of the solitary like waves on the front side of the island is shown in fig 12 it shares similar variation tendency with that on the plane beach and is proportional to γ 0 33 where the power 0 33 is also fitted by the least square algorithm in the julia package curvefit the correlation coefficient is 0 978 after introducing a constant the empiric formula as shown in equation 4 can be used to predict solitary like wave runup on the front side of the island 4 r r s 0 90 γ 0 33 where r here is the runup of a solitary like wave on the front side of the circular island as shown in table 3 the formula predicts wave runup of solitary waves is compared with the experimental data the relative errors of the estimated runup are within 15 and as the crest amplitude of solitary like wave increases the formula tends to overestimate the runup even though the averaged relative error is 4 147 it is still difficult to evaluate the empiric formula due to limited experimental runup of a solitary wave on island 3 2 3 abnormal large runup on the rear side as shown in fig 6 runups of solitary waves reach a local peak on both the front and rear side of the circular island comparisons of the runup on the front and rear side of the circular island are shown in fig 13 the trend that runup of solitary like waves on both the front side of the circular island usually decreases as the wavelength increases for scenarios ε 0 05 and ε 0 30 although the length of solitary like waves varies the runup on the front side is larger than that on the rear side for scenarios ε 0 10 if the wavelength is smaller than 4 times of the diameter of the island the runup on the rear side is larger than that on the front side if the wavelength is larger than 4 times of the diameter of the island runup on the rear side becomes smaller than that on the front side likewise the runup on the front side and the rear side in the scenarios ε 0 20 is a little bit different from that in the scenarios ε 0 10 if the wavelength is smaller than 3 times of the diameter of the island runup on the front side is larger than that on the rear side if the wavelength is larger than 3 times of the diameter of the island runup on the front side becomes larger than that on the rear side consider the fact that runup of tsunami wave on the front side of babi island is smaller than that on the rear side characteristics of the 1992 babi tsunami waves probably fall in the region ε 0 10 l d 1 4 or ε 0 20 l d 3 6 even though the rear runup is counter intuitively larger than the front runup the most abnormal rear runup is no more than 1 3 times of the front one ε 0 10 l d 2 5 the sheltering effect of the island against incident waves is still obvious 4 conclusions in this paper we numerically investigated the runup of the single crest solitary like waves on a sloping beach and circular island the single crest solitary like wave is employed as a simplification of real tsunami waves its mathematical expression is identical to that of the solitary wave but with an additional parameter to the wavenumber to change the spatial length runup of solitary waves on 1d sloping beaches and 2d circular island is calculated the numerical runup of solitary waves is compared with the available experimental runup and the numerical data agree well with the experimental data for the propagation of solitary like waves in a flume with constant water depth the form varies for the solitary like wave with its elongation parameter non unity an available waveform is an undular bore were the wave flume long enough the solitary like wave may eventually evolve into independent solitary waves to eliminate the form variation the surface elevation and velocity components of the solitary like wave are provided as the initial conditions the solitary like wave is right ahead of the toe of the slope or the island for runup of solitary like waves on a sloping beach the runup height decays as the wavelength increases the decay rate is γ 0 20 where γ is the elongation parameter while for runup of solitary like waves on a circular island the runup also decays with the increase of wavelength the decay rate is γ 0 33 by estimating the solitary wave runup with the empirical formula the average relative error is less than 5 for the abnormal runup of a solitary like wave on the rear side of the circular island this only happens at occasions ε 0 10 l d 1 4 or ε 0 20 l d 3 6 even though the rear runup may exceed that on the front side the maximum ratio of rear

20903,this paper presents numerical simulations for the runup of solitary like waves on a sloping beach and circular island the solitary like wave is constructed by introducing an elongation parameter to the wavenumber of the solitary wave all simulations are performed with a boussinesq model solving the fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive boussinesq equations the numerical model is validated by comparing the computed runup of solitary waves on sloping beach and circular island to the experimental runup data the propagation of the solitary like wave in a constant flume and the runup on a sloping plane beach and the circular island are simulated initial surface elevation of a solitary like wave is provided as the initial condition the waveform of a solitary like wave with different values of the elongation parameter shows that undular bores and a train of solitary waves could appear in offshore shallow regions runup of solitary like waves on the sloping beach and circular island shares the same decay trends but different powers abnormal rear runup only exceeds the front runup for some cases of given nonlinearity parameters and relative wavelength and the waterline diameter of a circular island the computed ratio of rear runup front runup is less than 1 3 keywords runup solitary like wave single sloping beach circular island boussinesq model 1 introduction tsunami in the past two decades has brought substantial damage and casualty to coastal communities investigations on tsunami waves or tsunami like waves are still popular among coastal engineerings such as runup inundation on coastal regions potential damages to submarine pipelines the runup inundation of tsunamis on a beach is an important subject to evaluate risk of tsunami waves to coastal regions due to moving waterline on a beach and breaking of waves it has been one of the most challenging problems in nonlinear water wave modeling in coastal and offshore engineering much work has been done theoretically numerically and experimentally by adopting solitary waves to investigate tsunamis such as witham 1974 synolakis 1987 li and raichlen 2001 briggs et al 1995 and keen and lynett 2019 et al especially synolakis 1987 briggs et al 1995 and keen and lynett 2019 they conducted a large number of experiments on wave runup on sloping beach or island s for tsunami waves propagating from the source area to coastal regions they always encounter reefs islands gentle continental shelf or coastal forests iimura and tanaka 2012 and maza et al 2015 studied the interaction of tsunami wave solitary wave with forests numerically in the framework of the boussinesq type equations and the rans equations respectively for wave interaction with an island experiments were conducted by briggs et al 1995 to study the runup of tsunami waves solitary waves around a circular island liu et al 1995 conducted numerical simulations to explain the reason why the wave runup on the rear side of the circular island is larger than that on the front side in the framework of the shallow water equations keen and lynett 2019 further conducted experiments to study the wave runup on two islands with different configurations experiments that uncover the wave runup of near field landslide tsunamis were implemented by di risio et al 2009a and di risio et al 2009b a steel ellipsoid slides downward into water from a circular island with its flank sloping 1 3 water disturbance triggered by the ellipsoid on the slope around the circular island were recorded due to the balance of the nonlinearity and dispersion the solitary wave was employed by the aforementioned literatures to conduct investigations however the solitary wave does not naturally be employed to model the important features of tsunami waves since the spatial length of a solitary wave is rather short when being compared with a tsunami wave this conclusion was made in madsen et al 2008 chan and liu 2012 affirmed this conclusion with the measured tsunami signals obtained by sea bottom pressure gauges during the 2011 tohoku tsunami event the tsunami signal can be fitted by three s e c h 2 functions while the s e c h 2 function is similar to a solitary wave thus a wave with s e c h 2 profile is a solitary like wave in this paper even though the solitary wave is no more proper to be employed to investigate the significances of tsunami waves plenty of investigations are still used the solitary wave but with a new name tsunami like wave for example hsiao and lin 2010 investigated the over topping of the tsunami like solitary waves on an impermeable seawall in the framework of rans reynolds averaged navier stokes modeling iimura and tanaka 2012 and maza et al 2015 invested the mitigation effect of coastal plants to tsunami waves but solitary waves in reality there are investigations on non solitary tsunami waves to the author s knowledge chan and liu 2012 is the first to study non solitary tsunami waves they investigated the runup of a combination of three solitary like waves combined waveform hereafter on a plane beach williams and fuhrman 2016 investigated the boundary layers of solitary like waves leading depression n shape tsunami waves and the combined waveform qu et al 2017 investigated the impact of both the solitary wave and the combined waveform on submerged cylinders the generation of a solitary like tsunami wave or the combined waveform in a numerical flume is easy however the generation of non solitary but solitary like tsunami waves in an experimental wave flume is difficult as stated in goseberg et al 2013 the wavemaker s stroke limits capability of a wave flume to make solitary like tsunami waves for example the required stroke is 8 9 m if a series of linear waves whose period and height are 90 s and 0 1 m respectively in the large wave flume groβer wellenkanal gwk although the combined waveform waves as well as solitary like waves and real tsunami waves were generated by schimmels et al 2016 this can only be a reality in very large flume instead of a conventional flume with its length no more than 100 m new wave generation methods need to be developed wüthrich et al 2018 generated tsunami like waves in a wave basin with a vertical water reservoir the wave was generated by releasing the water in the reservoir into the basin similarly wang et al 2018 generated undular tsunami waves in a wave basin by pumping water from a lateral reservoir into the basin and a surge was generated the stroke wavemaker generates short waves such as solitary waves they preciously super composed a double solitary wave on a surge to make a undular bore calculated by li et al 2018 although tsunami like waves were successfully generated by a wave maker or and a reservoir it is still difficult to directly study the runup of waves on an island due to the limitation of the lateral width or the length of the wave basin moreover the runup of single crest solitary like waves on the sloping beach needs further investigation the solitary like wave is an idealized wave type the combination of more than two solitary like wave is complicated although the combined waveform were recorded during the 2011 tohoku tsunami there is a solitary like wave whose wave amplitude is much larger than the rest two in this study we numerically investigate the runup of single crest solitary like waves on a sloping beach and a circular island the boussinesq type numerical model funwave tvd is employed this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the single crest solitary like wave and the numerical model are introduced first then the runup of solitary waves on sloping beaches is calculated and compared with the experimental data at last the runup solitary waves on a circular island is calculated and compared with the experimental data in section 3 the propagation of solitary like waves with different elongation parameters are calculated and compared mutually then the runup of solitary like waves on a sloping beach and the circular island is discussed separately runup formulas of solitary like wave are provided and calibrated with available experiment runup data the occasions that the rear runup exceeds the front one are delineated the last section 4 reaches the conclusions of this paper 2 numerical model and validation 2 1 description of the single wave and numerical model for a potential extreme tsunami scenario in the south china sea as shown in li et al 2018 when tsunami waves propagate to the vicinity of dongsha island the tsunami waves resemble a single crest see fig 1 a the spatial profile of the tsunami waves is wider than that of the solitary wave if they share an identical wave amplitude by introducing an elongation parameter γ to the solitary solution 1 η x d ε s e c h 2 k x x 1 where η x is the spatial shape of a solitary like wave d is the water depth ε h d is the nonlinearity factor or wave amplitude normalized by water depth k γ 0 75 h d 3 is the wavenumber γ is the elongation parameter x 1 is the horizontal position of the crest peak equation 1 reduces to the solution of the solitary wave if γ 1 0 as γ decreases the length of the solitary like wave gets longer we also compare the frequency components of the tsunami wave as well as the components of the solitary wave and solitary like wave the wave amplitude of them are identical although in a the wavefront of the tsunami wave and solitary like wave differs in the spatial domain this difference is only interpreted by the first order and second order magnitude components in the frequency domain also the significant width of the wavenumber for the tsunami wave and the solitary like wave is narrower than that of the solitary wave the open source fully nonlinear boussinesq wave model with tvd total variation diminishing solver funwave tvd is used to compute the propagation and runup of solitary like waves on a sloping beach and a circular island the governing equations of this solver in the cartesian coordinate stems from wei et al 1995 and then from chen 2006 the dispersion accuracy of governing equations reaches the second order o μ 2 where μ k d is the dispersion perturbation parameter k and d are the wavenumber and water depth respectively no assumption between the nonlinearity and dispersion was made all nonlinear terms within o μ 2 were kept so the governing equations are fully nonlinear but weakly dispersive in shi et al 2012 the governing equations were re organized to be hyperbolic so as to implement riemann solver variables such as velocity components and water surface elevation were positioned at the cell center the muscl tvd scheme was used to reconstruct the variables at the cell interface from the variables at the cell center the third order strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme was used to implement temporal advancement with the courant friedrichs lewy cfl being 0 5 the straightforward wetting drying scheme is used to model a moving boundary the wetting drying threshold is 0 001 m uniformly for all simulations in this paper after careful runup validation initially the water surface elevation and velocity components are provided for simulations of solitary like waves the surface elevation at the tone of the slope or island is 0 02 h were h is the wave amplitude for numerical scenarios where incident solitary or solitary like wave breaks over sloping beach the eddy viscosity breaking algorithm kennedy et al 2000 is activated to dissipate kinetic energy the onset and cessation of wave breaking is critical and the empirical parameters c b r k 1 0 45 and c b r k 2 0 35 as suggested by choi et al 2018 2 2 validation of runup of solitary waves on sloping beaches experiments on the runup of single and multi solitary wave s have been conducted by xuan et al 2013 in the wave flume of the key laboratory of hydrodynamics ministry of education at shanghai jiao tong university the width and length of the flume are 0 80 m and 65 m respectively we use the experimental results to validate the numerical model in both experimental and numerical cases the sloping angle varies from 2 86 to 90 the relative amplitude of the incident solitary wave varies from 0 03 to 0 45 table 1 lists the detailed parameters of all validation cases for numerical simulations the grid size is uniform 0 03 m if the sloping angle is smaller than 45 otherwise the grid size is 0 01 m the change of grid resolution can account for the wave runup better for relatively steep sloping beaches water surface elevation is provided according to equation 1 of course with the elongation parameter γ 1 for an experimental scenario s l o p e 1 10 ε 0 342 the time series of the surface elevation and the theoretical data calculated by equation 1 with γ 1 are compared in fig 2 a and the propagation and runup snapshots are shown in fig 2 b the shape of the incident solitary waves is quite stable when propagating over the flat bottom due to the balancing of the effect of nonlinearity and the effect of dispersion the waveform becomes asymmetry at t g d 59 when the effect of nonlinearity exceeds that of dispersion and the wavefront is almost vertical at t g d 74 as the effect of nonlinearity accumulates the incident solitary wave splashed on the sloping beach after t g d 74 at t g d 80 s the wave runup is the largest the experimental runup for this case is 0 373 m and the numerical data is 0 380 m numerical runup exceeds the experimental data by only 1 02 more comparisons of the wave runup are shown in fig 3 noticed that the incident solitary wave breaks only for scenarios where the beach slope is 1 20 and the initial nonlinearity ε 0 272 0 371 the breaking type is plunging according to grilli et al 1997 for both breaking and nonbreaking incident soltiary waves the results of numerical runup agree well with the experimental ones the mean relative error of runups are about or smaller than 10 thus it can be conclude that the numerical model can be used to compute the runup of solitary waves on sloping beaches for both breaking and nonbreaking solitary waves 2 3 validation of runup of solitary waves on a circular island wave runup on the front side of an island is intuitively larger than that on the rear side while during the post field surveys of the 1992 flores island tsunami and the 1994 okushiri tsunami larger runup on the rear side of an island was observed briggs et al 1995 and liu et al 1995 carried out a series of experiments and simulations to study the runup of solitary waves on a circular island respectively the measured data are employed to validate the numerical results a wave basin was build by using the numerical model funwave tvd the size of the numerical wave basin is slightly longer than the experimental wave basin due to different wave making method as shown in fig 4 the island is placed at the 0 0 the slope of the island is 1 4 with its bottom diameter 7 2 m the length of the numerical basin extends from y 30 m to y 17 m the width extends from x 15 m to x 15 m the depth of water in the numerical wave basin is 0 32 m the incident solitary wave propagates along the y direction and is initialized with the crest of the wave positioned at y 20 m relative amplitudes of incident wave are 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 the spatial grid resolution is 0 03 m uniformly fig 5 shows the comparison of the numerical and the experimental time series of wave surface elevation at different gauge locations the sequence number of wave gauges is identical to that in liu et al 1995 the coordinate of each gauge is labeled in each subfigure the arrival time of the incident is shifted to agree with the measured data gauge 1 6 are on the front side of the island numerical data can capture the wave crest well the following wave trough is relatively poorly resolved for the rundown process is highly relevant to the vertical velocity component and the two dimensional wave model can not predict the vertical component gauge 7 12 are on the right side of the island the wave trough is poorly predicted due to the same reason gauge 13 18 are on the rear side of the island the height of the wave peak at gauge 13 is the largest because there is an abnormally large wave runup on the rear side of the island fig 6 shows the runup of solitary waves on the slope of the island runup of the solitary wave ε 0 05 is underestimated while for cases ε 0 10 and 0 20 the numerical runup is acceptable when being compared with the recorded data in general the comparisons of the gauge profiles as well as the runup are quite acceptable 3 propagation and runup of solitary like waves 3 1 propagation in a constant water depth flume difficulties are there experimentally for solitary like waves propagating a long distance while it is quite easy and straightforward to calculate numerically the propagation as shown in fig 7 four series of solitary like waves with the elongation parameters being unity non unity propagate in a wave flume with flat bottom the water depth of the flume is d 0 32 m and the length of the flume is 1000 d at the initial second the crest locates at 0 solitary like waves propagate rightward numerical simulations are conducted with the fully nonlinear and weakly boussinesq equations in the cartesian coordinate the mesh size is 0 03 m uniformly spatial waveforms are recorded every second as indicated by the integer above the crest it can be seen that the waveform of a solitary wave fig 7 c does not change while the waveforms of solitary like waves fig 7 a b d vary during propagation in detail the fat solitary like waves become asymmetry during propagation the wave front becomes steep while the wave back becomes flat gradually once the front of a solitary like wave steepens enough it firstly evolves into undular bores while for the slim solitary like wave due to its unnatural spatial gradient the initial solitary like wave collapses the amplitude of the leading crest is smaller than the initial amplitude undular tails follow the leading crest and the distance between the first two crests increases gradually for solitary like waves with non unity elongation parameters were the flume long enough the solitary like wave in it first evolves into undular bores and eventually into independent solitary waves 3 2 runup of solitary like waves islands and reefs scatter in the south china sea the geometric shape vary a lot for example the horizontal cross sections of dongsha island and huangyan island is a circle while the cross sections of xisha island and taiping island are ellipses the upper diameter circular islands are 20 50 km for the giant tsunami in the south china sea the spatial length of the tsunami wave is about 70 km which is about 1 4 times of the upper diameter of islands so for simulations in this section the length of the solitary like wave is nondimensionalized by the diameter of the water cross section the diameter of the water cross section is 4 64 m and is identical to the experimental island in liu et al 1995 table 2 lists the length of solitary like waves and the corresponding elongation parameters in terms of different wave height for runup simulations of the solitary like wave on the sloping beach the wavelength varies 1 10 times of the island diameter fig 8 a shows the sketch of the sloping beach for runup simulations of the solitary like wave on the circular the wavelength varies 1 7 times of the island diameter fig 8 b illustrates the sketch of the computational domain for all simulations in this section the surface elevation and velocity components of solitary like waves are provided as the initial conditions the solitary like wave is positioned before the toe of the slope or the island by half a wavelength as illustrated the numerical setup is identical to that in simulations of solitary waves except for the length of the computational domain which is determined by the wavelength 3 2 1 runup on a sloping plane beach the propagation and running up down of the solitary like wave ε 0 20 l d 1 0 are shown in fig 9 the water surface on the sloping beach reaches the first peak at t g d 15 5 the water quickly runs down and reaches the first minimum at t g d 24 4 again there is a second runup on the sloping beach the runup and rundown history of this case is shown by the dashed dot line in the top left figure of fig 10 clearly there is two runup peaks and a rundown peak for solitary like waves ε 0 05 and ε 0 10 the runup rundown profiles are similar with that of ε 0 20 however the second runup decreases with initial wave amplitude moreover as the wavelength increases the rundown and the second runup decreases quickly for solitary like waves l d 2 5 the rundown and the second runup disappear besides the first runup of solitary like waves also decreases as the wavelength increases which is also shown in fig 11 a if the wavelength of the incident is long enough its runup on the sloping beach is identical with two times of its initial wave amplitude the runup of solitary waves can be estimated by equation 2 and the runup of solitary like waves can be estimated by equation 3 after introducing the effect of the elongation parameter γ as shown in fig 11 c and d the wave runup decays with the elongation of wavelength the decay rate is γ 0 20 where the power 0 20 is fitted by the least square algorithm in the julia package curvefit the correlation coefficient is 0 920 2 r s d 2 831 s 0 5 ε 5 4 3 r r s γ 0 20 where r s is the runup of solitary wave r is the runup of solitary like wave s is the slope of the sloping beach ε and γ are the dimensionless amplitude and elongation parameter of solitary like wave 3 2 2 runup on a circular island as tsunami waves propagate towards the shore they may encounter an island runup of solitary waves on a circular island has been studied by briggs et al 1995 and liu et al 1995 abnormal large runup on the rear side of the island was observed we further study the single wave on an island with the same dimensions as that used in experiments the relative amplitudes of incident waves are ε 0 05 ε 0 10 ε 0 20 and ε 0 30 the width of the incident solitary like waves is longer than d but smaller than 7d where d is the diameter of waterline around the island runup of the solitary like waves on the front side of the island is shown in fig 12 it shares similar variation tendency with that on the plane beach and is proportional to γ 0 33 where the power 0 33 is also fitted by the least square algorithm in the julia package curvefit the correlation coefficient is 0 978 after introducing a constant the empiric formula as shown in equation 4 can be used to predict solitary like wave runup on the front side of the island 4 r r s 0 90 γ 0 33 where r here is the runup of a solitary like wave on the front side of the circular island as shown in table 3 the formula predicts wave runup of solitary waves is compared with the experimental data the relative errors of the estimated runup are within 15 and as the crest amplitude of solitary like wave increases the formula tends to overestimate the runup even though the averaged relative error is 4 147 it is still difficult to evaluate the empiric formula due to limited experimental runup of a solitary wave on island 3 2 3 abnormal large runup on the rear side as shown in fig 6 runups of solitary waves reach a local peak on both the front and rear side of the circular island comparisons of the runup on the front and rear side of the circular island are shown in fig 13 the trend that runup of solitary like waves on both the front side of the circular island usually decreases as the wavelength increases for scenarios ε 0 05 and ε 0 30 although the length of solitary like waves varies the runup on the front side is larger than that on the rear side for scenarios ε 0 10 if the wavelength is smaller than 4 times of the diameter of the island the runup on the rear side is larger than that on the front side if the wavelength is larger than 4 times of the diameter of the island runup on the rear side becomes smaller than that on the front side likewise the runup on the front side and the rear side in the scenarios ε 0 20 is a little bit different from that in the scenarios ε 0 10 if the wavelength is smaller than 3 times of the diameter of the island runup on the front side is larger than that on the rear side if the wavelength is larger than 3 times of the diameter of the island runup on the front side becomes larger than that on the rear side consider the fact that runup of tsunami wave on the front side of babi island is smaller than that on the rear side characteristics of the 1992 babi tsunami waves probably fall in the region ε 0 10 l d 1 4 or ε 0 20 l d 3 6 even though the rear runup is counter intuitively larger than the front runup the most abnormal rear runup is no more than 1 3 times of the front one ε 0 10 l d 2 5 the sheltering effect of the island against incident waves is still obvious 4 conclusions in this paper we numerically investigated the runup of the single crest solitary like waves on a sloping beach and circular island the single crest solitary like wave is employed as a simplification of real tsunami waves its mathematical expression is identical to that of the solitary wave but with an additional parameter to the wavenumber to change the spatial length runup of solitary waves on 1d

20904,the sudden rise in oil price in 1970s led various countries around the world to turn to renewable energy resources for electric power generation instead of fossil fuel based power plants among different renewable power generations wind and solar power plants have reached maturity and have been able to make a significant contribution to electricity supply tidal power plants have grown less due to high cost of investment hence their share of electricity generation has been lower than that of wind and solar power plants the potential of tidal energy is high and it is expected that tidal energy can play a key role for electricity production in the future power system due to its accurate predictability two types of tidal power plants including barrage type and current type tidal power plants are developed for energy extracting from tides the current type tidal power plant generates electricity from the kinetic energy of tidal currents in a way similar to wind turbines while the barrage type tidal power plants are equipped with dam barrage and reservoir in order to generate electricity from the potential energy of water stored in the reservoir this paper proposes several methods for enhancing the generated power of barrage type tidal power plants which result in cost reduction of electricity generated by tidal power plants at first an optimum design procedure for calculating the optimum values of number of turbines number of gates sluice width turbine tip diameter and turbine hub diameter is established based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm aiming

of turbines number of gates gate width and turbine diameters are determined while only the number of turbines and turbine diameters are considered in the optimization approaches presented considering all influencing parameters in the optimal operation studies of the tidal barrages power plant including hourly number of turbines and number of sluices while only the hourly number of turbines is considered in the optimization procedures reported in the previous researches the objective function of the optimal operation studies of tidal barrage power plant is modified by considering the revenue from the sale of the electricity this is due to the variations in the electricity price over time a comparison among different operation modes of the barrage type tidal power plants including ebb generation flood generation and two way generation modes is performed from generated power point of the view proposing four methods in order to enhance the generated power of barrage type tidal power plants 1 introduction the sudden rise of oil prices in 1970s concerns about the depletion of fossil fuel resources environmental problems associated to the fossil fuels such as global warming climate change and greenhouse gas emission have led countries around the world to use alternative of renewable resources instead of fossil fuels among different renewable energy sources the low cost of generating electricity of wind and solar has made them competitive with other conventional energy resources hence large scale wind and photovoltaic farms are installed around the world despite the benefits of tidal power plants including high energy potential and accurate predictability the tidal power plants have not grown as much as wind and solar power plants because of their high investment cost two methods can be utilized for converting the tidal energy to the electricity the kinetic energy of tidal currents is utilized in the current type tidal power plants hence the electricity is generated using the tidal turbines in a way similar to wind turbine while the construction of dam barrage and reservoir is required in the barrage type tidal power plants the water can move between the sea and the reservoir through the gates placed in the barrage in the occurrence of a tide hence the electricity can be generated using the turbines installed in the gates several researches have been done aiming to justify the benefits of using tidal power plants for electric power generation in the power systems and study the effects of tidal units on the power system in ferreira and estefen 2009 bae et al 2010 aggidis and benzon 2013 aggidis and feather 2012 the barrage type tidal power plants located at the bacanga estuary at the lake sihwa dike across the mersey estuary and at the solway firth respectively are studied and the generated power of these plants are estimated using the hourly data of the water head however a comprehensive optimization to maximize the extracted power

et al 2019b is that the optimal design of the barrage type tidal power plants is not performed in terms of reliability indices or other aspects neill et al 2018 proposes the use of the energy storage system for minimizing the energy cost of the tidal lagoons and development of multiple lagoons for minimizing the variations in the power output arisen from the variations in the water head however optimization of size and number of turbines and gates of the barrage type tidal plant is not performed in neill et al 2018 the gradient based optimization approach is used in angeloudis et al 2018 in order to determine the optimal control strategy during multiple tidal cycles of the tidal power plants installed on the bristol channel and the severn estuary again the optimal planning of the barrage type tidal power plant is not performed in this paper the major types of tidal turbines used in the tidal power plants are investigated in wang and wang 2019 including the bulb tubular rim generator and cross flow unit in this paper start and stop times of each phase in the optimal generation scenario are calculated for optimizing the operation of the tidal barrages however the optimal values of the other characteristics of the plant such as turbines and gates are not determined in petley and aggidis 2016 the ebb mode equipped to the pump action at high tide is selected for optimizing the operation of the swansea bay tidal lagoon and the starting head number of turbines and turbine diameter are determined with the goal of obtaining the maximum annual energy output from the tidal lagoon the optimization procedure performed in this paper can be used to maximize the annual energy of the barrage type tidal power plants a suitable model based on the fuzzy analytic network process and the fuzzy goal programming is proposed in lee et al 2017 in order to solve the multi criteria decision making problem of selecting the dam sites of barrage type tidal power plants however the optimal sizing of the tidal barrages with determination of the number of turbines and sluices is not studied in lee et al 2017 three scenarios are considered in zhou et al 2014 for investigating the impacts of turbines and sluices number on the generated power of tidal barrages including 216 turbines and 166 sluices as the first scenario 382 turbines with no sluices as the second scenario and 764 turbines and no sluices as the third scenario however the optimal number of turbines and sluices which maximize the generated power of the barrage type tidal power plants can not be determined in this

electrical energy of tidal plant however a comprehensive optimization procedure for optimum determination of all affected plant parameters is not reported in fahmy 2010 and kontoleontos and weissenberger 2017 the hydrodynamic impacts of the barrage type tidal power plants located in the bristol channel and the severn estuary in the uk and in the bay of fundy are studied in angeloudis and falconer 2017 xia et al 2010 adcockthomas et al 2015 cousineau et al 2012 respectively several tidal barrages constructed and installed in different regions including bacanga estuary mersey estuary lake sihwa in the south korea solway firth swansea bay the bay of fundy red sea bristol channel and the severn estuary in the uk which are reported in literatures and different aspects related to their design generated power estimation and operation planning are studied however a comprehensive optimization procedure considering the effect of all influencing parameters simultaneously for

operation studies of the tidal barrages power plant including hourly number of turbines and number of sluices while only the hourly number of turbines is considered in the optimization procedures reported in the previous researches the objective function of the optimal operation studies of tidal barrage power plant is modified by considering the revenue from the sale of the electricity this is due to the variations in the electricity price over time for reaching these purposes the paper is organized as follows in the second section the structure and operation of barrage type tidal power

potential of tidal energy resources in the regions close to the coastal lines is estimated to be 1 tw and with the maturity of the tidal power plant technology it is expected that the tidal energy play a significant role in generating electricity in the future power system kempener and neumann 2014 there are four technologies for converting the energy of tides to the electricity including tidal barrages tidal lagoons tidal stream converters and dynamic tidal power plants magagna and uihlein 2015 tidal barrages are equipped with dam barrage and reservoir there are several gates in the barrage and the turbines are placed in the gates the water can move between the sea and the reservoir through the gates or sluices in the tidal occurrences thus the water stream can rotate the turbines and generate electricity the principle of electricity generation in the tidal lagoons are similar to the tidal barrages however in the tidal lagoons the reservoirs are independent enclosures in a highly tidal environment tidal stream converters or current type tidal power plants extract the kinetic energy of tides from the water flow in these power plants the kinetic energy of tidal currents is converted to the electricity using the tidal turbines in a way similar to wind turbines in the dynamic tidal power plants difference in water level created by an open dam structure constructed perpendicular to the coast is utilized for rotating bidirectional turbines and generates the electricity among these technologies barrage type tidal power plants with large capacity are constructed around the world the larance barrage type tidal power plant with 240 mw in france the sihwa power plant with 254 mw in south korea and the annapolis power plant with 20 mw in canada are examples of the large scale barrage type tidal power plants installed in the world the structure of a typical barrage type tidal power plant is presented in fig 1 as it can be seen in this figure a barrage that can be used as the road is constructed on the estuary and a reservoir is created on the other side of the barrage several gates or sluices are placed in the barrage and the turbines can be installed in the gates when the tidal is occurred the water can move between the sea and the reservoir through the gates the turbines are placed in the gates and the electricity can be generated three operating modes can be utilized for generating the electricity in the barrage type tidal power plants when the sea level is higher than reservoir level in the ebb generation mode and in the flood state the water flows from the sea to the reservoir through the turbine free gates and fills the reservoir when the reservoir level is higher than the sea level in the ebb state the gates equipped with the turbines are opened and the water is transferred from the reservoir to the sea through low head turbines and the electricity is generated in this stage the head of water passing through the turbines must be higher than a minimum value that the turbine can economically generates electricity when the sea level is higher than reservoir level in the flood generation mode the water can move from sea to the reservoir through the sluices equipped to the turbines thus the reservoir is filled and the electricity is generated when the reservoir level is higher than sea level in the ebb state the turbine free gates are opened and the water can move from the reservoir to the sea and the reservoir is drained in the double effect generation mode when the sea level is higher than reservoir level in the flood state the water can move from the sea to the reservoir through the gates equipped with the turbines and fills the reservoir and generates electricity simultaneously when the reservoir level is higher than sea level in the ebb state the water is transferred from the reservoir to the sea through the gates equipped with the turbines and the reservoir is drained and the electricity is generated simultaneously the hill chart proposed by aggidis and feather can be used for calculating the generated power of the hydro turbines over a variety of heads and rates of discharge in the barrage type tidal power plants aggidis and feather 2012 based on this approach the generated power of the turbine can be obtained by multiplying the equations of the flow head and efficiency in fig 2 the model of andritz hydro 3 blade low head bulb turbine unit is presented https www andritz com h the values on the hill chart are functions of the following equations which enable such scaling to take place and allow head flow and efficiency characteristics to be determined for calculating the output power 1 n 11 n d h 2 q 11 q d 2 h 3 n 2 60 f p where n 11 is the unit speed of the model n is

flow rate of the model and q is the flow rate of the turbine n 11 relation can be rewritten to give head 4 h n d n 11 2 then the resulted h relation can be used in conjunction with 2 for obtaining q equation 5 q q 11 d 2 h the generated power of the barrage type tidal power plant can be computed as 6 p η ρ g h q the kaplan turbines have high efficiency in different operating conditions including different water head water flow and turbine velocity hence this type of turbines is widely used in the barrage type tidal power plants the mentioned approach based on the hill chart can be effectively used for determining the generated power of the kaplan turbines over a variety of heads and rates of discharge the generated power of a low head turbine such as kaplan turbine is calculated as 7 based on the water head that is the difference between sea level and reservoir level in the ebb generation mode neto et al 2015 7 p η t η g ρ g h r h t d q t where η t η g are respectively the efficiencies

and q t is the water flow passing through the turbine in m3 s in this paper an empirical equation presented in castro rui 2008 is used for evaluating the efficiency of kaplan turbines this relation i

respectively the water flow rate through the turbine can be calculated using 9 husain et al 2008 9 q t π 4 d t i p 2 d h u b 2 υ f where d tip and d hub are the diameter of turbine tip and turbine hub respectively and they are considered to be 3 72 and 1 64m the relation of the water flow velocity through the turbine can be obtained as 10 neto et al 2015 10 υ f 2 g h r h t d in the flood state the water flow rate transferred from the sea to the reservoir through turbine free sluices can be calculated as neto et al 2015 11 q s h r w s 2 g h t d h r 1 h r h t d where w s is the total width of the sluices in the other operation mode of barrage type tidal power plant these equations can easily be modified for example in the flood generation mode in the flood state when the sea level is higher than reservoir level the electricity is generated hence in 7 h r h td is replaced by h td h r 3 the methods for generated power enhancement of barrage type tidal power plants in this paper four methods of enhancing the generated power of barrage type tidal power plants are investigated in order to reduce the price of electricity produced by these power plants including optimum design of power plant the optimum dispatch of turbines and gates during the operation of plant use of hydro pump and choose the best mode of operation in the first method an optimal design of the tidal barrages using of the pso algorithm is proposed that simultaneously considers all effective parameters i e number of turbines number of sluices turbine hub and tip diameters and sluice width in the optimization procedure in the second method the optimal values for influencing parameters for further increment in the generated power of the designed tidal barrage are determined using of the pso algorithm including hourly number of turbine and hourly number of sluice then the impact of the hydro pump and different generation modes of the tidal barrages on the produced energy of these renewable power plants are investigated it is deduced from the simulation results that the hydro pump can improve the generated power of the tidal barrages and the ebb generation mode is the best from power generation point of view among different generation modes of the tidal barrages thus the use of the hydro pump and the operation in the ebb generation mode are the third and fourth methods for improving the generated power of tidal barrages briefly this paper proposes the optimal design the optimal operation use of the hydro pump and operation in the ebb generation mode in order to optimally enhance the generated energy of the tidal barrages 3 1 the optimum design of power plant to design an optimum plant a barrage type tidal power plant is considered to be installed in the area with high tidal energy potential i e high tidal range the sea level or tidal height can be predicted accurately and they can be presented by a mathematical model the tide variation model is based on the harmonic decomposition of a time series of the local tides each harmonic component models a physical phenomenon of tides the series of the tide variation is as 12 neto et al 2015 12 h t d t h 0 k 1 n h k cos ω k t θ k where h td t is the tidal height versus time t ω k hk θ k are respectively the frequency in cycle per hour the height in meter and the phase in degree of the kth harmonic and h 0 is the dc component of tide levels in bathymetry study based on the predicted hourly height of tide levels the characteristics of the power plants can be calculated including the parameters of the structure and the energy conversion system the hourly generated power of the power plant during a year this study presents the total volume of the reservoir and the dependency between the volume of the reservoir and the reservoir level the plant constraints should be considered in the studies of determining the generated power of the barrage type tidal power plant e g the minimum and maximum level of reservoir and the turbine minimum head based on these constraints the turbine cannot produce power at heads below the minimum specified head and the level of the water in the reservoir cannot be less than a minimum value and more than the maximum value in this stage five parameters are considered as optimization variables for optimizing the generated energy of the plant during a year i e the number of turbines the number of gates the gates width turbine tip diameter and turbine hub diameter using of a suitable optimization method the parameters of the barrage type tidal power plant can be determined in this paper due to the proximity quality diverse response stability and adaptability of the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm this technique is selected for optimal calculation of annual generated energy of barrage type tidal power plant and determination of the design variables the pso algorithm is a population based stochastic optimization technique motivated by intelligent collective behaviour of some animals such as flocks of birds or schools of fish wang et al 2018 in pso particles can update their positions and velocities according to the environmental changes namely it meets the requirements of proximity and quality particles in the pso can keep their stable movement in the space while change their movement mode to adapt the change in the environment wang et al 2018 in the pso technique algorithm is initialized with a group of random particles solutions and then searches for optimal values by updating generations in each iteration the particles are updated by two best values including pbest and gbest the pbest is the best solution fitness that it has achieved so far the gbest or global best tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best values obtained so far by any particle in the population the updating of the velocity and position of the particles is performed based on 13 and 14 wang et al 2018 13 v i j k 1 v i j k c 1 r 1 p b e s t i j k x i j k c 2 r 2 g b e s t j k x i j k 14 x i j k 1 x i j k v i j k 1 where k is the number of iteration x ij k and v ij k are respectively the position and velocity of the particles c 1 and c 2 are the learning coefficients r 1 and r 2 are the random numbers in 0 1 interval the flowchart of the proposed technique based on the pso algorithm to determine the optimum parameters of the under construction barrage type tidal power plant is depicted in fig 3 3 2 the optimum operation of power plant in the previous subsection the optimum design of a barrage type tidal power plants installed in a certain region with the predicted hourly tidal height and specific bathymetry data including total volume of the reservoir and the dependency between the reservoir volume and the reservoir height is proposed using the pso algorithm the the design variables i e the optimum values of number of turbines number of gates diameters of turbine tip and hub and width of gates can be calculated after constructing the barrage type tidal power plant according to the optimum design in the operation studies of the plant the parameters including turbine tip diameter turbine hub diameter and the sluice width can suppose to be fixed however the number of turbines and the number of sluices can be changed based on the hourly tidal height for further increment in the generated power and consequently the generated energy of the plant thus in this paper during the operation of the plant the number of gates and turbines are changed between 0 to maximum number the value obtained for the optimum design and the optimum number at each hour is determined for maximizing the yearly generated energy the study time can be set one or more days in determination of the optimum numbers of the turbines and sluices of the barrage type tidal power plant however due to the variation in the electricity price over different times the objective function can be modified for considering the revenue of the plant from the sale of the electricity for this purpose the objective function is calculated by summing the hourly revenue of the plant which is determined by multiplying the hourly generated power of the plant in the hourly price of the electricity thus the hourly numbers of turbines and sluices are determined in such a way to maximize the objective function the flowchart of the proposed method for optimum determination of the numbers of turbines and sluices is presented in fig 4 3 3 the effect of hydro pump on the generated power of barrage type tidal power plant in the barrage type tidal power plant the generated power is dependent on the water head passing through the turbines i e the difference between sea level and reservoir level in the flood state when the sea level is higher than reservoir level the water can move from the sea to the reservoir and consequently the reservoir level is increased until the flood ends at this time using the hydro pumps the seawater can be pumped and the reservoir level can be increased in the pumping operation the difference between sea level and the reservoir level is low hence the hydro pumps consumes little power to pump the sea water to the reservoir in the ebb state when the reservoir level is adequately higher than the sea level the water is transferred from the turbine and the electricity is generated due to the higher head created by hydro pump the generated power of the barrage type tidal power plant equipped with the hydro pump is greater than the generated power of plants without hydro pump 3 4 the best operation mode of barrage type tidal power plant as it mentioned the barrage type tidal power plants can be operated in three modes including ebb generation flood generation and double effect generation modes due to the low volumetric capacity of the basin at the lower levels the ebb generation mode is more efficient than the flood generation mode it can be demonstrated from the simulation of barrage type tidal power plants or from the actual data collected in the operation of available power plants that the average level of the basin in the ebb generation mode is much higher than the other two modes in the double effect generation mode the basin level tends to stabilize at an operating region that the average reservoir value is close to the average value of sea level the energy yielding of double effect generation mode is lower than the ebb generation mode due to the low efficiency of this operating region arisen from the morphological properties of the basin in addition the turbines used in the barrage type tidal power plants operated in the double effect generation mode are more expensive and have more complex design than the ebb generation mode the environmental and urban consideration of the basin affect the choice of the operation mode of the barrage type tidal power plants neto et al 2017 among different operation modes the ebb generation mode is more suitable from this point of view in the ebb generation mode the value of the useful water volume of each tide cycle which is rebuilt is much higher than the flood generation mode hence in the ebb generation mode the quality of the water through its continuous rebuilding is more maintained it can be concluded that the ebb generation mode is the best choice for operation of barrage type tidal power plants because of the best energy yielding and less complex and cheaper turbine design in this paper the hydrodynamic impacts of the barrage type tidal power plants are not considered in the proposed optimization approach the hydrodynamic impacts of the tidal barrages and their effects of the produced energy of the barrage type tidal power plants have been fully investigated in angeloudis and falconer 2017 xia et al 2010 adcockthomas et al 2015 cousineau et al 2012 it is deduced from the numerical results performed in these articles that the receding flow direction of ebb generation mode results the turbine sections to be oriented however in the flood generation mode due to the development of large counter rotating vortices upstream the water jets are induced by the turbines with dissipating the momentum of the water jet the water head difference across the hydraulic structures decreases gradually hence the recirculation zones are expended at holding periods a large proportion of the impounded area is subsequently occupied by the vortices during ebb tides the velocity of the currents is weaker than the current velocity during flood tides and the upstream ebb currents cannot flush out sediments accumulated during the flood tide angeloudis and falconer 2017 thus the vortices and stagnant areas prevail downstream where the turbines are concentrated only in the middle third of the impoundment and flow is restricted from the adjacent gates placed in this stage the formation of recirculation zones can be harmful to the environment because the produced suspended sediments and pollutants are drawn to the vortices centroid by an imbalance between centrifugal force and bed friction thus the hydrodynamic impacts of tidal impoundments extend beyond the flow patterns close to the turbine and gate regions the sluices should be placed in such a manner that targets their wake through the recirculation centroid in order to reduce the hydrodynamic impacts of the tidal barrages for the purpose of dissipating the vortices the sluices can be opened at ebb tides as soon as the head difference stops the production of the turbines in the tidal barrages 4 numerical results in this section the effects of the proposed methods on the generated power of a barrage type tidal power plant are studied the studied barrage type tidal power plant is considered to be installed in the bacanga estuary and the tidal variation data of this region can be utilized for this study the main tide harmonic components are given in table 1 the variation in the tidal height of this region is shown in fig 5 using the harmonic components of the tides the dependency between the reservoir volume and the reservoir level can be determined based on the bathymetry studies of the reservoir this dependency for the studied barrage type tidal power plant is shown in fig 6 it is assumed that the reservoir level must remain between 2 5 and 4 5m because of the reservoir restrictions and the other uses from the water stored in the reservoir for example if the reservoir level falls below 2 5m the life of fish and other aquatic living in the reservoir may be endangered the minimum head required for turbines to generate electricity is considered to be 1m and the efficiency of the generator η g is assumed to be 90 the efficiency of the understudied kaplan turbine η t considering different flow rate is presented in fig 7 4 1 the optimum design of power plant the optimum design for this understudied barrage type power plant in the ebb generation mode is obtained using the proposed method the convergence of the pso algorithm is shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the pso algorithm has performed well in finding the optimum values of the design variables the optimum parameters including number of turbines number of sluices sluice width diameter of turbine hub and diameter of turbine tip are listed in table 2 the hourly tidal height reservoir level and generated power of the plant are calculated and presented in fig 9 for the optimum design of the studied barrage type tidal power plant part of the figure has been enlarged to make it more convenience to see the variations the yearly generated energy of the optimum designed plant would be 500 55 gwh in the following the optimal design of the studied tidal barrage is performed using the genetic algorithm ga and the results are given in table 2 as it can be seen in this table using the pso algorithm results in plant with better generating performance than using the ga algorithm the annual produced energy of the tidal barrage designed by the pso algorithm is 500 55 gwh which is more than the annual produced energy of the tidal barrage specified by the ga which is 498 02 gwh the hourly turbine efficiency during the studied year is determined using the method based on the hill chart eqns 1 6 and the proposed method eqns 7 11 for investigating the effectiveness of the proposed method in calculating the generated power of the tidal barrages the results are compared in fig 10 as it can be seen the amount of turbine efficiency obtained from both methods are in reasonable coincidence hence the proposed method has been able to estimate the turbine efficiency with acceptable accuracy in the following the results of sensitivity analyses are presented for this purpose at each stage 4 of 5 design parameters are considered to be fixed and the remaining parameter is changed and the effect of this parameter on the generated power of the plant is investigated the results of these studies are shown in figs 11 15 it is concluded that the pso algorithm can properly find the optimum values of the design parameters and the plant generated energy is reduced by changing the parameters from their optimal values 4 2 the optimal operation of power plant in this stage the optimum operation of the studied barrage type tidal power plant in the ebb generation mode is performed and the optimum numbers of turbines and gates at each hour is determined to reach this goal the analyses are executed during a day and the hourly numbers of gates and turbines are determined the results are given in table 3 the convergence of the algorithm is shown in fig 16 the generated energy of this day considering the fixed values of turbines and sluices i e 76 turbines and 40 sluices during the day would be 1 401 gwh however the generated energy is enhanced and would be 1 413 gwh based on the optimal dispatch of turbines and gates during the operation of plant in the studied day due to the variation in the electricity price as shown in fig 17 the revenue of the studied tidal barrage is considered as the objective function and the hourly number of turbines and number of sluices are determined using the proposed method the results are presented in fig 18 as it can be seen the hourly optimal numbers of turbines and sluices for maximizing the revenue from the sale of the electricity is different from the optimal hourly number of turbines and sluices for maximizing the produced energy of the plant thus if the tidal barrages are participated in the electricity market and the goal is to maximize the profit from the sale of power plant electricity the optimization of the revenue as the objective function should be used 4 3 the effect of hydro pump on the generated power of understudied barrage type tidal power plant in this subsection the effect of hydro pump on the generated power of studied barrage type tidal power plant is studied for this purpose a hydro pump with water flow rate of 10 m3 s and efficiency of 100 is considered and the generated power of the plant in the ebb generation mode is calculated in this study it is assumed that the hydro pump is operated in the maximum flood and pumps the seawater to the reservoir to increase the reservoir level the generated power of the power plant considering the hydro pump effect and the consumed power of the hydro pump are calculated and shown in figs 19 and 20 respectively the yearly generated energy of the studied power plant is calculated and it is concluded that the yearly produced energy is enhanced from 500 55 gwh to 513 82 gwh by hydro pump utilization 4 4 the best operation mode of barrage type tidal power plant in this subsection three operating modes of the barrage type tidal power plan including ebb generation flood generation and double effect generation modes are simulated for the studied barrage type tidal power plant the generated power of the studied plant in these three modes are calculated and consequently the yearly generated energy and the operating time of the plant under these three operation modes are determined and presented in table 4 it is deduced from the results that the ebb generation mode is the best operation mode of the barrage type tidal power plants also the yearly produced energy of the plant in the ebb generation mode is higher than the other operating modes 5 discussion in this section the results obtained by the proposed techniques are compared with the results of the previous papers in aggidis and benzon 2013 operational optimization of a barrage type tidal power plant installed on the mersey estuary is performed using the zero dimensional modelling approach in this paper the optimum starting heads over 30 tidal cycles for 700 mw barrage type tidal plant in ebb generation mode is determined besides the impact of the flood pumping on the annual energy generation of the plant is evaluated it is concluded from the results in aggidis and benzon 2013 that the annual generated energy of the plant is increased from 1274 gwh to 1519 gwh while it is deduced from the numerical results of the proposed method that the ebb generation mode can result in more energy generation by hydro pump utilization e g the annual produced energy of the plant is improved from 500 55 gwh to 513 82 gwh in aggidis and feather 2012 the impact of different parameters on the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plant installed on the solway firth is investigated including turbine diameter starting head number of turbines and generator limit in this paper ebb generation mode of the plant is selected and the sensitivity analysis is performed while in the proposed method five parameters including the number of turbines number of gates diameters of turbine tip and hub and width of gates are determined for considering the impact of different parameters on the generated energy of the plant by comparing the similar graphs reported in aggidis and benzon 2013 and aggidis and feather 2012 i e the generated energy versus the number of turbines and turbine diameters the same results are obtained however in the proposed method if the number of turbines exceeds an optimum value the width of the sluices is reduced and the generated power of the plant decreases this is due to the restriction of the total width of the plant barrage in neto et al 2015 an initial estimation of the optimal number of turbines to be installed in a specific location is performed for this purpose the annual produced energy of the barrage type tidal power plant is maximized using the genetic algorithm to determine the optimal number of the turbines then by obtaining an optimal dispatch of turbines over the generation process the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plant is significantly increased it is deduced from the results of the studied power plant installed on the bacanga estuary that the initial number of turbines can be estimated equal to 11 if the number of turbines is considered to be 11 fixed the annual generated energy of the plant would be 41 038 gwh however the annual generated energy of the plant can be enhanced to 44 092 gwh by optimal dispatching of the turbines during the studied year in the proposed method the optimal values of the number of turbines number of sluices diameters of turbine tip and hub and width of gates are determined using the pso algorithm thus better results can be obtained due to using more variables in the optimization procedure besides both the number of turbines and the number of gates at each hour of operation of the plant can be optimally determined which will lead to a more effective result in neto et al 2017 a barrage type tidal power plant is considered to be installed in the estuary of bcanga in brazil and the generated power of the plant is analysed considering the current conditions and constraints it is concluded from the paper that the flood generation mode is less efficient than ebb generation mode due to low volumetric capacity of the basin at the lower levels in this paper the reservoir level profiles are simulated in different generation modes and it is deduced from the results that in the case of the ebb generation mode the average level of the reservoir will be much higher than in the other cases the results of the proposed method show that the annual generated energy of the plant in the ebb generation mode is 500 55 gwh which is more than the annual produced energy of the other generation modes i e flood generation mode with 308 67 gwh and two way generation mode with 492 21 gwh the operation of the barrage type tidal power plant is optimized in angeloudis et al 2018 and the time duration and starting time of different operation modes are determined including pumping water at flood tide emptying holding water at low water preserving flood generation filling flood generation with sluicing filling sluicing filling pumping water at ebb tide filling holding water at high water preserving ebb generating emptying ebb generation with sluicing emptying and sluicing emptying based on the method presented in angeloudis et al 2018 an overall increase in the generated energy of 20 40 is achieved in the current paper among different operation modes of the barrage type tidal power plant it is deduced the ebb generation mode is the best from annual energy generation point of view in addition it has been yield from the numerical results that the hydro pump can improve the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plants in petley and aggidis 2016 a tidal lagoon is considered to be installed on swansea bay and the annual generated energy of the plant is estimated in this paper the annual energy generation of the plant are calculated considering number of turbines starting head and turbine diameter is determined and thus the optimal values of these parameters besides the impact of hydro pump on the annual energy generation is evaluated it is concluded from the numerical results that the annual generated energy of the plant in dual mode ebb mode optimized ebb mode and optimized ebb mode with pumping would be respectively 479 8 596 06 726 8 and 731 7 gwh while in the proposed method both optimal design and optimal operation studies are performed for maximizing the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plants also the effect of the hydro pump and the operation modes of the plant on the annual generated energy are analysed the optimal design approach proposed in this paper can be used in the generation expansion planning of the power system for optimal design of barrage type tidal power plant in the specific region besides the optimal dispatch of the turbines and sluices proposed in this paper can be used by the power system operators and the owners of the tidal power plants to perform optimal operation of the power system two approaches are proposed for optimal operation of the tidal barrages in the first approach the produced energy of the barrage type tidal power plants is considered to be maximum and in the second one the revenue of the tidal barrages of the sale of the electricity is considered to be maximum which is suitable for the electricity markets the differences between the optimizations made in this article and the previous articles can be summarised as follows in the planning stage all affected parameters including the numbers of turbines and sluices sluice width and turbine diameter are considered in this paper while in the previously published works only the number of turbines and turbine diameter are taken into account in the operation stage all affected parameters including the numbers of turbines and sluices are considered in the optimization procedure while in the previous works only the number of turbines is considered the objective function of the operation study is proposed to be the revenue of the tidal barrages from selling the electricity which is suitable for participation analysis of the barrage type tidal power plants in the electricity markets however in the past works only the produced energy of the plant is considered as the objective function a suitable optimization algorithm i e particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the objective function in this article while other optimization methods are utilized in the previously performed researches in this paper the optimization of a barrage type tidal power plant located in the bacanga estuary is performed considering the minimum and maximum water level in the reservoir and minimum head of the turbine required for power generation the hydrodynamic impacts and other limitations of the tidal barrages affect the estimated generated power of the barrage type tidal power plant such as the start and stop times of power generation of the turbines the change in the reservoir volume and reservoir level due to the sedimentation as the rated power of the barrage type tidal power plants increases the hydrodynamic effects increase hence the proposed approach cannot be used to evaluate these large scale tidal barrages thus new techniques must be introduced in the future works in order to investigate the hydrodynamic impacts of the large scale barrage type tidal power plants in the future works performing a comprehensive optimization process for maximum energy generation of the barrage type tidal power plants can be suggested considering other parameters not included in this article such as starting head of the turbine number and capacity of the hydro pumps also the future works can focus on the optimal dispatch of the hydro pumps for more increment in the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plants 6 conclusion tidal power plants have not been grown as much as wind and photovoltaic power plants due to the higher cost of tidal power plant in comparison to wind and photovoltaic power plants this paper proposes four methods to enhance the generated power and energy of these renewable units in order to reduce the electricity cost of the barrage type tidal power plants in the initial study step an optimum design procedure for the barrage type tidal power plant using the pso algorithm is presented for determining the optimum values for number of turbines number of sluices gate width diameter of turbine tip and diameter of turbine hub the harmonic components of the time series of the tidal height are used to model the variation of tides the historical data associated to the tidal height of bacanga estuary in brazil kaplan turbine data and the bathymetry data that presents the dependency of reservoir volume on the reservoir level are utilized as input data of a studied plant the optimal values of design parameters are determined using the pso algorithm aiming to maximize the annual energy generation of the plant after obtaining the barrage type tidal power plant specifications an optimization procedure is implemented for determining the optimal values of the number of turbines and gates in each hour of operation of the plant for further increment in the generated energy of the plant the study conducted in this article is more comprehensive compared to previous works done in the field of optimization of barrage type tidal power plants and more parameters has been considered in optimization procedure of achieving higher energy generation in the previous researches performed in aggidis and feather 2012 neto et al 2015 and petley and aggidis 2016 only the parameters of the number of turbines and their diameter have been included in the optimization process while in the proposed method in addition to these parameters the number of gates gate width and diameter of turbine tip and hub have also been selected as design variables the optimal dispatch of turbines are performed in neto et al 2015 and the hourly number of turbines of the barrage type tidal power plant in the operation phase is determined using the genetic algorithm while in the proposed method in addition to the number of turbines optimal dispatch of the sluices is performed and the optimal number of turbines and gates in each hour are determined using the pso algorithm for more increment in the generated energy of the plant due to the variation in the electricity price over times another optimization procedure is performed for maximizing the revenue of the tidal barrage and the hourly number of the turbines and sluices is determined in the following the impact of the hydro pumps on the generated power and energy of the barrage type tidal power plant is evaluated the hydro pump is used at the maximum flood state to increase the reservoir level and enhance the generated power of the plant it is concluded from the numerical results that the consumed power of hydro pump is less than the enhanced power of the plant hence the use of the hydro pump results in improvement of the yearly produced energy of the studied barrage type tidal power plant from 500 55 gwh to 513 82 gwh in addition the impact of the generation modes of the plant on the energy generation is evaluated the barrage type tidal power plants can operate in three modes including ebb generation flood generation and ebb flood generation mode it is concluded from the numerical results that the generated energy of the plant in the ebb generation mode is higher than the other operation modes hence the ebb generation mode is the best operation mode of barrage type tidal power plants from energy harvesting and economic aspects it is also resulted that the ebb generation mode with annual generated energy of 500 55 gwh is the best operation mode among different generation modes of the barrage type tidal power plants the annual produced energy of the other generation modes i e flood generation mode and ebb flood generation mode are respectively 308 67 gwh and 492 21 gwh the same results are concluded in the previous works reported in aggidis and benzon 2013 neto et al 2017 and angeloudis et al 2018 in order to continue this research it is suggested that in addition to the design parameters considered i e the number of turbines the number of gates gate width turbine tip diameter and turbine hub diameter the starting head of the turbine to be included as the sixth design variable then using a population based optimization algorithm the optimal values of the parameters are determined to achieve maximum generated energy of the plant another field of research can be the optimum determination of the number and capacity of the hydro pumps used in the barrage type tidal power plant for achieving the maximum annual produced energy also an optimization algorithm is implemented to optimally dispatch these hydro pumps in each hour in the operation phase credit authorship contribution statement amir ghaedi

20904,the sudden rise in oil price in 1970s led various countries around the world to turn to renewable energy resources for electric power generation instead of fossil fuel based power plants among different renewable power generations wind and solar power plants have reached maturity and have been able to make a significant contribution to electricity supply tidal power plants have grown less due to high cost of investment hence their share of electricity generation has been lower than that of wind and solar power plants the potential of tidal energy is high and it is expected that tidal energy can play a key role for electricity production in the future power system due to its accurate predictability two types of tidal power plants including barrage type and current type tidal power plants are developed for energy extracting from tides the current type tidal power plant generates electricity from the kinetic energy of tidal currents in a way similar to wind turbines while the barrage type tidal power plants are equipped with dam barrage and reservoir in order to generate electricity from the potential energy of water stored in the reservoir this paper proposes several

generation are simulated and the best operation mode in terms of power generation is determined keywords barrage type tidal power plant particle swarm optimization ebb generation hydro pump generated power enhancement the novelty and contributions of the paper can be expressed as considering all effective parameters in the optimal planning studies of the tidal barrages power plant including number of turbines number of gates gate width and turbine diameters are determined while only the number of turbines and turbine diameters are considered in the optimization approaches presented considering all influencing parameters in the optimal operation studies of the tidal barrages power plant including hourly number of turbines and number of sluices while only the hourly number of turbines is considered in the optimization procedures reported in the previous researches the objective function of the optimal operation studies of tidal barrage power plant is modified by considering the revenue from the sale of the electricity this is due to the variations in the electricity price over time a comparison among different operation modes of the barrage type tidal power plants including ebb generation flood generation and two way generation modes is performed from generated power point of the view proposing four methods in order to enhance the generated power of barrage type tidal power plants 1 introduction the sudden rise of oil prices in 1970s concerns about the depletion of fossil fuel resources environmental problems associated to the fossil fuels such as global warming climate change and greenhouse gas emission have led countries around the world to use alternative of renewable resources instead of fossil fuels among different renewable energy sources the low cost of generating electricity of wind and solar has made them competitive with other conventional energy resources hence large scale wind and photovoltaic farms are installed around the world despite the benefits of tidal power plants including high energy potential and accurate predictability the tidal power plants have not grown as much as wind and solar power plants because of their high investment cost two methods can be utilized for converting the tidal energy to the electricity the kinetic energy of tidal currents is utilized in the current type tidal power plants hence the electricity is generated using the tidal turbines in a way similar to wind turbine while the construction of dam barrage and reservoir is required in the barrage type tidal power plants the water can move between the sea and the reservoir through the gates placed in the barrage in the occurrence of a tide hence the electricity can be generated using the turbines installed in the gates several researches have been done aiming to justify the benefits of using tidal power plants for electric power generation in the power systems and study the effects of tidal units on the power system in ferreira and estefen 2009 bae et al 2010 aggidis and benzon 2013 aggidis and feather 2012 the barrage type tidal power plants located at the bacanga estuary at the lake sihwa dike across the mersey estuary and at the solway firth respectively are studied and the generated power of these plants are estimated using the hourly data of the water head however a comprehensive optimization to maximize the extracted power

the other characteristics of the plant such as turbines and gates are not determined in petley and aggidis 2016 the ebb mode equipped to the pump action at high tide is selected for optimizing the operation of the swansea bay tidal lagoon and the starting head number of turbines and turbine diameter are determined with the goal of obtaining the maximum annual energy output from the tidal lagoon the optimization procedure performed in this paper can be used to maximize the annual energy of the barrage type tidal power plants a suitable model based on the fuzzy analytic network process and the fuzzy goal programming is proposed in lee et al 2017 in order to solve the multi criteria decision making problem of selecting the dam sites of barrage type tidal power plants however the optimal sizing of the tidal barrages with determination of the number of turbines and sluices is not studied in lee et al 2017 three scenarios are considered in zhou et al 2014 for investigating the impacts of turbines and sluices number on the generated power of tidal barrages including 216 turbines and 166 sluices as the first scenario 382 turbines with no sluices as the second scenario and 764 turbines and no sluices as the third scenario however the optimal number of turbines and sluices which maximize the generated power of the barrage type tidal power plants can not be determined in this

weissenberger 2017 the hydrodynamic impacts of the barrage type tidal power plants located in the bristol channel and the severn estuary in the uk and in the bay of fundy are studied in angeloudis and falconer 2017 xia et al 2010 adcockthomas et al 2015 cousineau et al 2012 respectively several tidal barrages constructed and installed in different regions including bacanga estuary mersey estuary lake sihwa in the south korea solway firth swansea bay the bay of fundy red sea bristol channel and the severn estuary in the uk which are reported in literatures and different aspects related to their design generated power estimation and operation planning are studied however a comprehensive optimization procedure considering the effect of all influencing parameters simultaneously for maximizing the produced energy of the tidal barrages in the planning and operation phases is not established in this paper as a complement to the previous works a comprehensive optimization procedure is suggested considering all affective parameters including number of turbines number of sluices sluice width turbine tip diameter and turbine hub diameter in the design process and the hourly number of turbines and hourly number of sluices in the operation phase the particle swarm optimization algorithm as a suitable population based optimization algorithms is used for maximizing the generated

operation studies of the tidal barrages power plant including hourly number of turbines and number of sluices while only the hourly number of turbines is considered in the optimization procedures reported in the previous researches the objective function of the optimal operation studies of tidal barrage power plant is modified by considering the revenue from the sale of the electricity this is due to the variations in the electricity price over time for reaching these purposes the paper is organized as follows in the second section the structure and operation of barrage type tidal power

potential of tidal energy resources in the regions close to the coastal lines is estimated to be 1 tw and with the maturity of the tidal power plant technology it is expected that the tidal energy play a significant role in generating electricity in the future power system kempener and neumann 2014 there are four technologies for converting the energy of tides to the electricity including tidal barrages tidal lagoons tidal stream converters and dynamic tidal power plants magagna and uihlein 2015 tidal barrages are equipped with dam barrage and reservoir there are several gates in the barrage and the turbines are placed in the gates the water can move between the sea and the reservoir through the gates or sluices in the tidal occurrences thus the water stream can rotate the turbines and generate electricity the principle of electricity generation in the tidal lagoons are similar to the tidal barrages however in the tidal lagoons the reservoirs are independent enclosures in a highly tidal environment tidal stream converters or current type tidal power plants extract the kinetic energy of tides from the water flow in these power plants the kinetic energy of tidal currents is converted to the electricity using the tidal turbines in a way similar to wind turbines in the dynamic tidal power plants difference in water level created by an open dam structure constructed perpendicular to the coast is utilized for rotating bidirectional turbines and generates the electricity among these technologies barrage type tidal power plants with large capacity are constructed around the world the larance barrage type tidal power plant with 240 mw in france the sihwa power plant with 254 mw in south korea and the annapolis power plant with 20 mw in canada are examples of the large scale barrage type tidal power plants installed in the world the structure of a typical barrage type tidal power plant is presented in fig 1 as it can be seen in this figure a barrage that can be used as the road is constructed on the estuary and a reservoir is created on the other side of the barrage several gates or sluices are placed in the barrage and the turbines can be installed in the gates when the tidal is occurred the water can move between the sea and the reservoir through the gates the turbines are placed in the gates and the electricity can be generated three operating modes can be utilized for generating the electricity in the barrage type tidal power plants when the sea level is higher than reservoir level in the ebb generation mode and in the flood state the water flows from the sea to the reservoir through the turbine free gates and fills the reservoir when the reservoir level is higher than the sea level in the ebb state the gates equipped with the turbines are opened and the water is transferred from the reservoir to the sea through low head turbines and the electricity is generated in this stage the head of water passing through the turbines must be higher than a minimum value that the turbine can economically generates electricity when the sea level is higher than reservoir level in the flood generation mode the water can move from sea to the reservoir through the sluices equipped to the turbines thus the reservoir is filled and the electricity is generated when the reservoir level is higher than sea level in the ebb state the turbine free gates are opened and the water can move from the reservoir to the sea and the reservoir is drained in the double effect generation mode when the sea level is higher than reservoir level in the flood state the water can move from the sea to the reservoir through the gates equipped with the turbines and fills the reservoir and generates electricity simultaneously when the reservoir level is higher than sea level in the ebb state the water is transferred from the reservoir to the sea through the gates equipped with the turbines and the reservoir is drained and the electricity is generated simultaneously the hill chart proposed by aggidis and feather can be used for calculating the generated power of the hydro turbines over a variety of heads and rates of discharge in the barrage type tidal power plants aggidis and feather 2012 based on this approach the generated power of the turbine can be obtained by multiplying the equations of the flow head and efficiency in fig 2 the model of andritz hydro 3 blade low head bulb turbine unit is presented https www andritz com h the values on the hill chart are functions of the following equations which enable such scaling to take place and allow head flow and efficiency characteristics to be determined for calculating the output power 1 n 11 n d h 2 q 11 q d 2 h 3 n 2 60 f p where n 11 is the unit speed of the model n is

equation 5 q q 11 d 2 h the generated power of the barrage type tidal power plant can be computed as 6 p η ρ g h q the kaplan turbines have high efficiency in different operating conditions including different water head water flow and turbine velocity hence this type of turbines is widely used in the barrage type tidal power plants the mentioned approach based on the hill chart can be effectively used for determining the generated power of the kaplan turbines over a variety of heads and rates of discharge the generated power of a low head turbine such as kaplan turbine is calculated as 7 based on the water head that is the difference between sea level and reservoir level in the ebb generation mode neto et al 2015 7 p η t η g ρ g h r h t d q t where η t η g are respectively the efficiencies

water flow rate transferred from the sea to the reservoir through turbine free sluices can be calculated as neto et al 2015 11 q s h r w s 2 g h t d h r 1 h r h t d where w s is the total width of the sluices in the other operation mode of barrage type tidal power plant these equations can easily be modified for example in the flood generation mode in the flood state when the sea level is higher than reservoir level the electricity is generated hence in 7 h r h td is replaced by h td h r 3 the methods for generated power enhancement of barrage type tidal power plants in this paper four methods of enhancing the generated power of barrage type tidal power plants are investigated in order to reduce the price of electricity produced by these power plants including optimum design of power plant the optimum dispatch of turbines and gates during the operation of plant use of hydro pump and choose the best mode of operation in the first method an optimal design of the tidal barrages using of the pso algorithm is proposed that simultaneously considers all effective parameters i e number of turbines number of sluices turbine hub and tip diameters and sluice width in the optimization procedure in the second method the optimal values for influencing parameters for further increment in the generated power of the designed tidal barrage are determined using of the pso algorithm including hourly number of turbine and hourly number of sluice then the impact of the hydro pump and different generation modes of the tidal barrages on the produced energy of these renewable power plants are investigated it is deduced from the simulation results that the hydro pump can improve the generated power of the tidal barrages and the ebb generation mode is the best from power generation point of view among different generation modes of the tidal barrages thus the use of the hydro pump and the operation in the ebb generation mode are the third and fourth methods for improving the generated power of tidal barrages briefly this paper proposes the optimal design the optimal operation use of the hydro pump and operation in the ebb generation mode in order to optimally enhance the generated energy of the tidal barrages 3 1 the optimum design of power plant to design an optimum plant a barrage type tidal power plant is considered to be installed in the area with high tidal energy potential i e high tidal range the sea level or tidal height can be predicted accurately and they can be presented by a mathematical model the tide variation model is based on the harmonic decomposition of a time series of the local tides each harmonic component models a physical phenomenon of tides the series of the tide variation is as 12 neto et al 2015 12 h t d t h 0 k

structure and the energy conversion system the hourly generated power of the power plant during a year this study presents the total volume of the reservoir and the dependency between the volume of the reservoir and the reservoir level the plant constraints should be considered in the studies of determining the generated power of the barrage type tidal power plant e g the minimum and maximum level of reservoir and the turbine minimum head based on these constraints the turbine cannot produce power at heads below the minimum specified head and the level of the water in the reservoir cannot be less than a minimum value and more than the maximum value in this stage five parameters are considered as optimization variables for optimizing the generated energy of the plant during a year i e the number of turbines the number of gates the gates width turbine tip diameter and turbine hub diameter using of a suitable optimization method the parameters of the barrage type tidal power plant can be determined in this paper due to the proximity quality diverse response stability and adaptability of the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm this technique is selected for optimal calculation of annual generated energy of barrage type tidal power plant and determination of the design variables the pso algorithm is a population based stochastic optimization technique motivated by intelligent collective behaviour of some animals such as flocks of birds or schools of fish wang et al 2018 in pso particles can update their positions and velocities according to the environmental changes namely it meets the requirements of proximity and quality particles in the pso can keep their stable movement in the space while change their movement mode to adapt the change in the environment wang et al 2018 in the pso technique algorithm is initialized with a group of random particles solutions and then searches for optimal values by updating generations in each iteration the particles are updated by two best values including pbest and gbest the pbest is the best solution fitness that it has achieved so far the gbest or global best tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best values obtained so far by any particle in the population the updating of the velocity and position of the particles is performed based on 13 and 14 wang et al 2018 13 v i j k 1 v i j k c 1

particles c 1 and c 2 are the learning coefficients r 1 and r 2 are the random numbers in 0 1 interval the flowchart of the proposed technique based on the pso algorithm to determine the optimum parameters of the under construction barrage type tidal power plant is depicted in fig 3 3 2 the optimum operation of power plant in the previous subsection the optimum design of a barrage type tidal power plants installed in a certain region with the predicted hourly tidal height and specific bathymetry data including total volume of the reservoir and the dependency between the reservoir volume and the reservoir height is proposed using the pso algorithm the the design variables i e the optimum values of number of turbines number of gates diameters of turbine tip and hub and width of gates can be calculated after constructing the barrage type tidal power plant according to the optimum design in the operation studies of the plant the parameters including turbine tip diameter turbine hub diameter and the sluice width can suppose to be fixed however the number of turbines and the number of sluices can be changed based on the hourly tidal height for further increment in the generated power and consequently the generated energy of the plant thus in this paper during the operation of the plant the number of gates and turbines are changed between 0 to maximum number the value obtained for the optimum design and the optimum number at each hour is determined for maximizing the yearly generated energy the study time can be set one or more days in determination of the optimum numbers of the turbines and sluices of the barrage type tidal power plant however due to the variation in the electricity price over different times the objective function can be modified for considering the revenue of the plant from the sale of the electricity for this purpose the objective function is calculated by summing the hourly revenue of the plant which is determined by multiplying the hourly generated power of the plant in the hourly price of the electricity thus the hourly numbers of turbines and sluices are determined in such a way to maximize the objective function the flowchart of the proposed method for optimum determination of the numbers of turbines and sluices is presented in fig 4 3 3 the effect of hydro pump on the generated power of barrage type tidal power plant in the barrage type tidal power plant the generated power is dependent on the water head passing through the turbines i e the difference between sea level and reservoir level in the flood state when the sea level is higher than reservoir level the water can move from the sea to the reservoir and consequently the reservoir level is increased until the flood ends at this time using the hydro pumps the seawater can be pumped and the reservoir level can be increased in the pumping operation the difference between sea level and the reservoir level is low hence the hydro pumps consumes little power to pump the sea water to the reservoir in the ebb state when the reservoir level is adequately higher than the sea level the water is transferred from the turbine and the electricity is generated due to the higher head created by hydro pump the generated power of the barrage type tidal power plant equipped with the hydro pump is greater than the generated power of plants without hydro pump 3 4 the best operation mode of barrage type tidal power plant as it mentioned the barrage type tidal power plants can be operated in three modes including ebb generation flood generation and double effect generation modes due to the low volumetric capacity of the basin at the lower levels the ebb generation mode is more efficient than the flood generation mode it can be demonstrated from the simulation of barrage type tidal power plants or from the actual data collected in the operation of available power plants that the average level of the basin in the ebb generation mode is much higher than the other two modes in the double effect generation mode the basin level tends to stabilize at an operating region that the average reservoir value is close to the average value of sea level the energy yielding of double effect generation mode is lower than the ebb generation mode due to the low efficiency of this operating region arisen from the morphological properties of the basin in addition the turbines used in the barrage type tidal power plants operated in the double effect generation mode are more expensive and have more complex design than the ebb generation mode the environmental and urban consideration of the basin affect the choice of the operation mode of the barrage type tidal power plants neto et al 2017 among different operation modes the ebb generation mode is more suitable from this point of view in the ebb generation mode the value of the useful water volume of each tide cycle which is rebuilt is much higher than the flood generation mode hence in the ebb generation mode the quality of the water through its continuous rebuilding is more maintained it can be concluded that the ebb generation mode is the best choice for operation of barrage type tidal power plants because of the best energy yielding and less complex and cheaper turbine design in this paper the hydrodynamic impacts of the barrage type tidal power plants are not considered in the proposed optimization approach the hydrodynamic impacts of the tidal barrages and their effects of the produced energy of the barrage type tidal power plants have been fully investigated in angeloudis and falconer 2017 xia et al 2010 adcockthomas et al 2015 cousineau et al 2012 it is deduced from the numerical results performed in these articles that the receding flow direction of ebb generation mode results the turbine sections to be oriented however in the flood generation mode due to the development of large counter rotating vortices upstream the water jets are induced by the turbines with dissipating the momentum of the water jet the water head difference across the hydraulic structures decreases gradually hence the recirculation zones are expended at holding periods a large proportion of the impounded area is subsequently occupied by the vortices during ebb tides the velocity of the currents is weaker than the current velocity during flood tides and the upstream ebb currents cannot flush out sediments accumulated during the flood tide angeloudis and falconer 2017 thus the vortices and stagnant areas prevail downstream where the turbines are concentrated only in the middle third of the impoundment and flow is restricted from the adjacent gates placed in this stage the formation of recirculation zones can be harmful to the environment because the produced suspended sediments and pollutants are drawn to the vortices centroid by an imbalance between centrifugal force and bed friction thus the hydrodynamic impacts of tidal impoundments extend beyond the flow patterns close to the turbine and gate regions the sluices should be placed in such a manner that targets their wake through the recirculation centroid in order to reduce the hydrodynamic impacts of the tidal barrages for the purpose of dissipating the vortices the sluices can be opened at ebb tides as soon as the head difference stops the production of the turbines in the tidal barrages 4 numerical results in this section the effects of the proposed methods on the generated power of a barrage type tidal power plant are studied the studied barrage type tidal power plant is considered to be installed in the bacanga estuary and the tidal variation data of this region can be utilized for this study the main tide harmonic components are given in table 1 the variation in the tidal height of this region is shown in fig 5 using the harmonic components of the tides the dependency between the reservoir volume and the reservoir level can be determined based on the bathymetry studies of the reservoir this dependency for the studied barrage type tidal power plant is shown in fig 6 it is assumed that the reservoir level must remain between 2 5 and 4 5m because of the reservoir restrictions and the other uses from the water stored in the reservoir for example if the reservoir level falls below 2 5m the life of fish and other aquatic living in the reservoir may be endangered the minimum head required for turbines to generate electricity is considered to be 1m and the efficiency of the generator η g is assumed to be 90 the efficiency of the understudied kaplan turbine η t considering different flow rate is presented in fig 7 4 1 the optimum design of power plant the optimum design for this understudied barrage type power plant in the ebb generation mode is obtained using the proposed method the convergence of the pso algorithm is shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the pso algorithm has performed well in finding the optimum values of the design variables the optimum parameters including number of turbines number of sluices sluice width diameter of turbine hub and diameter of turbine tip are listed in table 2 the hourly tidal height reservoir level and generated power of the plant are calculated and presented in fig 9 for the optimum design of the studied barrage type tidal power plant part of the figure has been enlarged to make it more convenience to see the variations the yearly generated energy of the optimum designed plant would be 500 55 gwh in the following the optimal design of the studied tidal barrage is performed using the genetic algorithm ga and the results are given in table 2 as it can be seen in this table using the pso algorithm results in plant with better generating performance than using the ga algorithm the annual produced energy of the tidal barrage designed by the pso algorithm is 500 55 gwh which is more than the annual produced energy of the tidal barrage specified by the ga which is 498 02 gwh the hourly turbine efficiency during the studied year is determined using the method based on the hill chart eqns 1 6 and the proposed method eqns 7 11 for investigating the effectiveness of the proposed method in calculating the generated power of the tidal barrages the results are compared in fig 10 as it can be seen the amount of turbine efficiency obtained from both methods are in reasonable coincidence hence the proposed method has been able to estimate the turbine efficiency with acceptable accuracy in the following the results of sensitivity analyses are presented for this purpose at each stage 4 of 5 design parameters are considered to be fixed and the remaining parameter is changed and the effect of this parameter on the generated power of the plant is investigated the results of these studies are shown in figs 11 15 it is concluded that the pso algorithm can properly find the optimum values of the design parameters and the plant generated energy is reduced by changing the parameters from their optimal values 4 2 the optimal operation of power plant in this stage the optimum operation of the studied barrage type tidal power plant in the ebb generation mode is performed and the optimum numbers of turbines and gates at each hour is determined to reach this goal the analyses are executed during a day and the hourly numbers of gates and turbines are determined the results are given in table 3 the convergence of the algorithm is shown in fig 16 the generated energy of this day considering the fixed values of turbines and sluices i e 76 turbines and 40 sluices during the day would be 1 401 gwh however the generated energy is enhanced and would be 1 413 gwh based on the optimal dispatch of turbines and gates during the operation of plant in the studied day due to the variation in the electricity price as shown in fig 17 the revenue of the studied tidal barrage is considered as the objective function and the hourly number of turbines and number of sluices are determined using the proposed method the results are presented in fig 18 as it can be seen the hourly optimal numbers of turbines and sluices for maximizing the revenue from the sale of the electricity is different from the optimal hourly number of turbines and sluices for maximizing the produced energy of the plant thus if the tidal barrages are participated in the electricity market and the goal is to maximize the profit from the sale of power plant electricity the optimization of the revenue as the objective function should be used 4 3 the effect of hydro pump on the generated power of understudied barrage type tidal power plant in this subsection the effect of hydro pump on the generated power of studied barrage type tidal power plant is studied for this purpose a hydro pump with water flow rate of 10 m3 s and efficiency of 100 is considered and the generated power of the plant in the ebb generation mode is calculated in this study it is assumed that the hydro pump is operated in the maximum flood and pumps the seawater to the reservoir to increase the reservoir level the generated power of the power plant considering the hydro pump effect and the consumed power of the hydro pump are calculated and shown in figs 19 and 20 respectively the yearly generated energy of the studied power plant is calculated and it is concluded that the yearly produced energy is enhanced from 500 55 gwh to 513 82 gwh by hydro pump utilization 4 4 the best operation mode of barrage type tidal power plant in this subsection three operating modes of the barrage type tidal power plan including ebb generation flood generation and double effect generation modes are simulated for the studied barrage type tidal power plant the generated power of the studied plant in these three modes are calculated and consequently the yearly generated energy and the operating time of the plant under these three operation modes are determined and presented in table 4 it is deduced from the results that the ebb generation mode is the best operation mode of the barrage type tidal power plants also the yearly produced energy of the plant in the ebb generation mode is higher than the other operating modes 5 discussion in this section the results obtained by the proposed techniques are compared with the results of the previous papers in aggidis and benzon 2013 operational optimization of a barrage type tidal power plant installed on the mersey estuary is performed using the zero dimensional modelling approach in this paper the optimum starting heads over 30 tidal cycles for 700 mw barrage type tidal plant in ebb generation mode is determined besides the impact of the flood pumping on the annual energy generation of the plant is evaluated it is concluded from the results in aggidis and benzon 2013 that the annual generated energy of the plant is increased from 1274 gwh to 1519 gwh while it is deduced from the numerical results of the proposed method that the ebb generation mode can result in more energy generation by hydro pump utilization e g the annual produced energy of the plant is improved from 500 55 gwh to 513 82 gwh in aggidis and feather 2012 the impact of different parameters on the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plant installed on the solway firth is investigated including turbine diameter starting head number of turbines and generator limit in this paper ebb generation mode of the plant is selected and the sensitivity analysis is performed while in the proposed method five parameters including the number of turbines number of gates diameters of turbine tip and hub and width of gates are determined for considering the impact of different parameters on the generated energy of the plant by comparing the similar graphs reported in aggidis and benzon 2013 and aggidis and feather 2012 i e the generated energy versus the number of turbines and turbine diameters the same results are obtained however in the proposed method if the number of turbines exceeds an optimum value the width of the sluices is reduced and the generated power of the plant decreases this is due to the restriction of the total width of the plant barrage in neto et al 2015 an initial estimation of the optimal number of turbines to be installed in a specific location is performed for this purpose the annual produced energy of the barrage type tidal power plant is maximized using the genetic algorithm to determine the optimal number of the turbines then by obtaining an optimal dispatch of turbines over the generation process the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plant is significantly increased it is deduced from the results of the studied power plant installed on the bacanga estuary that the initial number of turbines can be estimated equal to 11 if the number of turbines is considered to be 11 fixed the annual generated energy of the plant would be 41 038 gwh however the annual generated energy of the plant can be enhanced to 44 092 gwh by optimal dispatching of the turbines during the studied year in the proposed method the optimal values of the number of turbines number of sluices diameters of turbine tip and hub and width of gates are determined using the pso algorithm thus better results can be obtained due to using more variables in the optimization procedure besides both the number of turbines and the number of gates at each hour of operation of the plant can be optimally determined which will lead to a more effective result in neto et al 2017 a barrage type tidal power plant is considered to be installed in the estuary of bcanga in brazil and the generated power of the plant is analysed considering the current conditions and constraints it is concluded from the paper that the flood generation mode is less efficient than ebb generation mode due to low volumetric capacity of the basin at the lower levels in this paper the reservoir level profiles are simulated in different generation modes and it is deduced from the results that in the case of the ebb generation mode the average level of the reservoir will be much higher than in the other cases the results of the proposed method show that the annual generated energy of the plant in the ebb generation mode is 500 55 gwh which is more than the annual produced energy of the other generation modes i e flood generation mode with 308 67 gwh and two way generation mode with 492 21 gwh the operation of the barrage type tidal power plant is optimized in angeloudis et al 2018 and the time duration and starting time of different operation modes are determined including pumping water at flood tide emptying holding water at low water preserving flood generation filling flood generation with sluicing filling sluicing filling pumping water at ebb tide filling holding water at high water preserving ebb generating emptying ebb generation with sluicing emptying and sluicing emptying based on the method presented in angeloudis et al 2018 an overall increase in the generated energy of 20 40 is achieved in the current paper among different operation modes of the barrage type tidal power plant it is deduced the ebb generation mode is the best from annual energy generation point of view in addition it has been yield from the numerical results that the hydro pump can improve the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plants in petley and aggidis 2016 a tidal lagoon is considered to be installed on swansea bay and the annual generated energy of the plant is estimated in this paper the annual energy generation of the plant are calculated considering number of turbines starting head and turbine diameter is determined and thus the optimal values of these parameters besides the impact of hydro pump on the annual energy generation is evaluated it is concluded from the numerical results that the annual generated energy of the plant in dual mode ebb mode optimized ebb mode and optimized ebb mode with pumping would be respectively 479 8 596 06 726 8 and 731 7 gwh while in the proposed method both optimal design and optimal operation studies are performed for maximizing the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plants also the effect of the hydro pump and the operation modes of the plant on the annual generated energy are analysed the optimal design approach proposed in this paper can be used in the generation expansion planning of the power system for optimal design of barrage type tidal power plant in the specific region besides the optimal dispatch of the turbines and sluices proposed in this paper can be used by the power system operators and the owners of the tidal power plants to perform optimal operation of the power system two approaches are proposed for optimal operation of the tidal barrages in the first approach the produced energy of the barrage type tidal power plants is considered to be maximum and in the second one the revenue of the tidal barrages of the sale of the electricity is considered to be maximum which is suitable for the electricity markets the differences between the optimizations made in this article and the previous articles can be summarised as follows in the planning stage all affected parameters including the numbers of turbines and sluices sluice width and turbine diameter are considered in this paper while in the previously published works only the number of turbines and turbine diameter are taken into account in the operation stage all affected parameters including the numbers of turbines and sluices are considered in the optimization procedure while in the previous works only the number of turbines is considered the objective function of the operation study is proposed to be the revenue of the tidal barrages from selling the electricity which is suitable for participation analysis of the barrage type tidal power plants in the electricity markets however in the past works only the produced energy of the plant is considered as the objective function a suitable optimization algorithm i e particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the objective function in this article while other optimization methods are utilized in the previously performed researches in this paper the optimization of a barrage type tidal power plant located in the bacanga estuary is performed considering the minimum and maximum water level in the reservoir and minimum head of the turbine required for power generation the hydrodynamic impacts and other limitations of the tidal barrages affect the estimated generated power of the barrage type tidal power plant such as the start and stop times of power generation of the turbines the change in the reservoir volume and reservoir level due to the sedimentation as the rated power of the barrage type tidal power plants increases the hydrodynamic effects increase hence the proposed approach cannot be used to evaluate these large scale tidal barrages thus new techniques must be introduced in the future works in order to investigate the hydrodynamic impacts of the large scale barrage type tidal power plants in the future works performing a comprehensive optimization process for maximum energy generation of the barrage type tidal power plants can be suggested considering other parameters not included in this article such as starting head of the turbine number and capacity of the hydro pumps also the future works can focus on the optimal dispatch of the hydro pumps for more increment in the generated energy of the barrage type tidal power plants 6 conclusion tidal power plants have not been grown as much as wind and photovoltaic power plants due to the higher cost of tidal power plant in comparison to wind and photovoltaic power plants this paper proposes four methods to enhance the generated power and energy of these renewable units in order to reduce the electricity cost of the barrage type tidal power plants in the initial study step an optimum design procedure for the barrage type tidal power plant using the pso algorithm is presented for determining the optimum values for number of turbines number of sluices gate width diameter of turbine tip and diameter of turbine hub the harmonic components of the time series of the tidal height are used to model the variation of tides the historical data associated to the tidal height of bacanga estuary in brazil kaplan turbine data and the bathymetry data that presents the dependency of reservoir volume on the reservoir level are utilized as input data of a studied plant the optimal values of design parameters are determined using the pso algorithm aiming to maximize the annual energy generation of the plant after obtaining the barrage type tidal power plant specifications an optimization procedure is implemented for determining the optimal values of the number of turbines and gates in each hour of operation of the plant for further increment in the generated energy of the plant the study conducted in this article is more comprehensive compared to previous works done in the field of optimization of barrage type tidal power plants and more parameters has been considered in optimization procedure of achieving higher energy generation in the previous researches performed in aggidis and feather 2012 neto et al 2015 and petley and aggidis 2016 only the parameters of the number of turbines and their diameter have been included in the optimization process while in the proposed method in addition to these parameters the number of gates gate width and diameter of turbine tip and hub have also been selected as design variables the optimal dispatch of turbines are performed in neto et al 2015 and the hourly number of turbines of the barrage type tidal power plant in the operation phase is determined using the genetic algorithm while in the proposed method in addition to the number of turbines optimal dispatch of the sluices is performed and the optimal number of turbines and gates in each hour are determined using the pso algorithm for more increment in the generated energy of the plant due to the variation in the electricity price over times another optimization procedure is performed for maximizing the revenue of the tidal barrage and the hourly number of the turbines and sluices is determined in the following the impact of the hydro pumps on the generated power and energy of the barrage type tidal power plant is evaluated the hydro pump is used at the maximum flood state to increase the reservoir level and enhance the generated power of the plant it is concluded from the numerical results that the consumed power of hydro pump is less than the enhanced power of the plant hence the use of the hydro pump results in improvement of the yearly produced energy of the studied barrage type tidal power plant from 500 55 gwh to 513 82 gwh in addition the impact of the generation modes of the plant on the energy generation is evaluated the barrage type tidal power plants can operate in three modes including ebb generation flood generation and ebb flood generation mode it is concluded from the numerical results that the generated energy of the plant in the ebb generation mode is higher than the other operation modes hence the ebb generation mode is the best operation mode of barrage type tidal power plants from energy harvesting and economic aspects it is also resulted that the ebb generation mode with annual generated energy of 500 55 gwh is the best operation mode among different generation modes of the barrage type tidal power plants the annual produced energy of the other generation modes i e flood generation mode and ebb flood generation mode are respectively 308 67 gwh and 492 21 gwh the same results are concluded in the previous works reported in aggidis and benzon 2013 neto et al 2017 and angeloudis et al 2018 in order to continue this research it is suggested that in addition to the design parameters considered i e the number of turbines the number of gates gate width turbine tip diameter and turbine hub diameter the starting head of the turbine to be included as the sixth design variable then using a population based optimization algorithm the optimal values of the parameters are determined to achieve maximum generated energy of the plant another field of research can be the optimum determination of the number and capacity of the hydro pumps used in the barrage type tidal power plant for achieving the maximum annual produced energy also an optimization algorithm is implemented to optimally dispatch these hydro pumps in each hour in the operation phase credit authorship contribution statement amir ghaedi
