10175,deficit irrigation di and alternate partial root zone irrigation apri are widely recognized water saving irrigation methods this meta analysis provided a systematic and quantitative result of the relative changes in yield and water use efficiency wue of seven agricultural products maize wheat cotton potato tomato apple and grape under conventional full irrigation full apri and di globally three comparisons were performed 1 apri by full 2 apri by di and 3 di by full the results showed that the relative changes of yield and wue differed among the three comparisons higher yield and wue were achieved in fruits apple and grape under apri compared with full or di however the percentage changes in yield and wue under apri were not significantly different in vegetables potato and tomato and crops maize wheat and cotton compared with full apri performed better for acidic soils clay loam or sandy loam high bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 irrigation amount of 80 100 full and was more appropriate for furrow irrigation in drier and colder environments compared with full di performed better for clay loam low bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and precipitation 200 mm yields under apri and di were remarkably lower than those under full while the corresponding wue were significantly higher compared with di fruits with furrow irrigation and in soils with clay and sandy loam were better under apri there was no significant difference in yield between apri and di but wue under apri was higher apri increased both yield and wue in regions with low average annual temperature 9 it is critical to weigh the cost of yield penalty the economic benefit of saving water and the cost of implementing irrigation method before choosing an effective water saving irrigation method keywords alternate partial root zone irrigation conventional irrigation yield wue meta analysis 1 introduction the global climate change water resources shortage and ever growing population have brought great challenges to the sustainable development of agriculture around the world hanjra and qureshi 2010 wheeler and von braun 2013 by 2050 the global population will reach 9 billion and the demand for foods will double bagatur 2014 water is a major factor influencing agricultural production especially in arid and semi arid regions solomon and cramer 1993 zheng et al 2018 2021 fao 2012 sufficient availability of water in the root zone is crucial throughout the growing season of crops xu et al 2020 yang et al 2006 yawson et al 2014 therefore it is of significance to find ways to reduce agricultural water use while maintaining or even increasing crop yields rosegrant et al 2009 yan et al 2019 deficit irrigation di and alternate partial root zone irrigation apri are two widely recognized effective water saving irrigation methods di involves the application of water in a strictly controlled manner that is lower than the total water demand during the specified part or the seasonal cycle of crop development liu et al 2020 kriedemann and goodwon 2009 by contrast apri alternates irrigation in space or time to create a dry and wet cycle in different parts of the root system to maintain plant water conditions under maximum water potential and to control the vegetative growth kriedemann and goodwon 2009 sadras 2009 although there are many differences between the two irrigation methods their purpose is to directly reduce the input of irrigation water in time or space so as to improve wue of crops without significantly reducing crop yields compared to the conventional full irrigation kirda et al 2007 kriedemann and goodwin 2003 kriedemann and goodwon 2009 morison et al 2008 sadras 2009 since apri was proposed it has received attention worldwide pérez pérez et al 2020 and a large number of related experiments have been conducted the results showed that apri can save 30 50 of irrigation water and increase wue while reducing crop yields slightly in many crops such as oat lin et al 2012 grape intrigliolo and castel 2009 kusakabe et al 2016 cotton tang et al 2005 2010 papaya santos et al 2021 maize fu et al 2017 and tomato sarker et al 2016 however the results of some studies were inconsistent and concluded that apri can increase the crop yields for example du et al 2017 reported that apri with eight irrigation times significantly increased the yield and wue of apple in arid northwest china du et al 2008a found that the seed cotton yield under alternate drip irrigation adi was 5 61 higher than that under conventional drip irrigation cdi sadras 2009 concluded that the yield produced by apri and conventional irrigation was within a range of 20 in 80 of cases and apri outperformed deficit irrigation by 20 or more in other cases adu et al 2018 found the yields of different crops produced by deficit irrigation and apri were similar obviously the conclusions on the crop yield and wue among these three irrigation methods di apri and full are still inconsistent in view of this situation meta analysis can provide a solution meta analysis is a statistical model used to quantitatively analyze and summarize the results from multiple independent studies with the same theme so that meta analysis researchers can draw conclusions from the concatenated dataset stanley and jarrell 1989 in present meta analysis has been widely used in agricultural studies some meta analyses have also been done on the impact of different irrigation methods on crop yield and wue for example yu et al 2020 applied a meta analysis to quantify the effects of deficit irrigation on water use efficiency and yield of wheat relative to full irrigation adu et al 2018 employed a meta analysis to study the influence of full irrigation deficit irrigation and partial root zone irrigation on crop yields carrijo et al 2017 conducted a meta analysis to quantify the effect of alternate wetting and drying on rice yield and water use however the previous meta analyses on various irrigation methods only focused on the impact of different factors on various indicators of a single crop or on a single indicator of various crops there is a lack of a systematic and quantitative analysis of the yield and wue of various crops under di apri and full on a global scale therefore a global meta analysis was distinctly conducted to examine the relative changes of crop yield and wue under apri by full apri by di and di by full in order to enable comparisons under similar conditions as much as possible some of the related crops soil and irrigation management practices contributing to the differences in crop yield and wue were considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection relevant peer reviewed studies from 1997 to 2020 were collected the search engines used in this article included google scholar https xueshu soogle top elsevier science direct https www sciencedirect com search and china national knowledge infrastructure https www cnki net using the key words partial root drying or deficit irrigation or partial root zone or irrigation strategies regimes or water saving irrigation and water use efficiency and yield in total there were 90 publications including 305 pairs of observations of yield and wue that satisfied our criteria for the meta analysis the list of the 90 publications from which the data were extracted are listed in appendix a these publications were screened using the following criteria i only publications describing experiments conducted in the field with side by side comparisons of full or di and apri were selected and pot or

plot can be used to intuitively assess whether there is a publication bias if there is no publication bias the funnel plot should be similar to an inverted symmetric funnel however if there is publication bias the plot will be an asymmetric funnel adu et al 2018 duval and tweedie 2000 ferreira et al 2016 higgins and green 2011 hereafter we need to further evaluate its potential impact on the overall effect size through the trim and fill method duval and tweedie 2000 ferreira et al 2016 jennions et al 2013 according to the results of funnel plot the yield of apri by full was near symmetrical and the trim and fill analysis indicated that there was no missing study however for the funnel plots of yield of apri by di di by full and wue of apri by full apri by di di by full there were five eleven three two and two estimated missing studies respectively although it changed the magnitude of the effect size it did not change the significance meanwhile the rosenthal s fail safe number nfs orwin 1983 for estimating the number of additional studies needs to invalidate the statistically significant results n f s 5 k 10 where k is the number of studies the nfs values of yield and wue calculated using stata were 57 361 and 1768 respectively the two nfs were significantly higher than 1175 5 231 10 and 375 5 73 10 so the publication bias was not a big problem for this meta analysis 2 4 data analyses in this meta analysis all data analyses were conducted by the stata se 15 1 software stata college station tx usa the mapping software used in this meta analysis included origin v9 0 and graphpad prism8 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset the database was selected from 90 articles reporting the studies of seven agricultural species from 20 countries around the world the studied species included crops maize wheat and cotton vegetables potato and tomato and fruits apple and grape the relative frequency distribution of effect sizes on yield and wue followed gaussian normal distributions fig 1 indicating that the dataset were homogeneous shan and yan 2013 yields were significantly reduced under apri and di compared with full and the overall effect sizes of yield for apri by full and di by full were 7 09 95 ci 7 96 to 6 21 and 17 44 95 ci 18 8 to 16 there was no significant difference between apri and di and the overall effect size of yield was 1 54 95 ci 2 79 0 28 fig 2 as for wue the overall effect size of these three comparisons were all significantly increased and wue for apri by full apri by di and di by full were 8 46 95 ci 6 81 10 12 4 77 95 ci 3 03 6 55 and 12 78 95 ci 8 47 17 26 fig 2 3 2 yield and wue response of agricultural species groups to different irrigation methods 3 2 1 apri by full compared with full apri significantly reduced yield and increased wue for all agricultural species groups fig 3a d apri had the smallest negative effect on yield of fruits 6 72 while crops had the largest negative effect on yield 7 18 but there were no significant difference among the agricultural species groups fig 3a however the wue of fruits was increased most by 22 33 95 ci 14 02 31 25 which was significantly higher than that of crops 7 fig 3d obviously the effect of apri was best for fruits and worst for crops 3 2 2 apri by di compared with di yield and wue of apri showed significantly different trends among the agricultural species groups the yield and wue of fruits both increased while vegetables showed opposite trends but the wue of them were not significantly different fig 3b e among them the yield of fruits showed an increased trend by 4 46 95 ci 0 89 8 16 while both vegetables and fruits showed decreased trend by 8 64 95 ci 10 24 to 7 00 and 3 97 95 ci 5 53 to 2 38 respectively fig 3b apart from crops 5 77 the changes in wue were not significant 1 05 and 0 76 respectively for fruits and vegetables fig 3e 3 2 3 di and full di decreased yield significantly but increased wue relative to full among different agricultural species groups with varying degrees of success fig 3c f crops reduced yield least by 10 03 95 ci 12 62 to 7 37 while its wue increased least 6 96 as for fruits and vegetables there was no significant difference between the reduction in yield and the increase in wue 3 3 yield and wue response of irrigation management to different irrigation methods 3 3 1 apri by full the irrigation methods decreased yield and increased wue under apri with varying degrees of success except sprinkler irrigation fig 4a b the effect size for yield in response to sprinkler irrigation was not significant which may be due to the small sample size n 4 fig 4a from all observations apri decreased yield by 1 11 8 11 and 4 78 under sprinkler drip and furrow irrigation but it significantly increased wue by 8 36 and 8 89 under drip and furrow irrigation respectively comprehensively considering yield and wue furrow irrigation performed best fig 4a b in term of the deficit stage apri compared to full significantly decreased yield by 8 14 reproductive stage and 6 87 throughout the season but it significantly increased wue by 11 66 and 8 17 respectively however the differences of yield and wue between these two stages were not significant fig 4c d the effects of apri on yield and wue also varied with deficit proportions expressed as a fraction of full fig 4e f and the degree of apri on yield was positively correlated with deficit proportions when the deficit proportion ranged 80 100 the reduction of yield was minimal 3 16 95 ci 4 82 to 1 46 moreover apri decreased yield by 8 09 2 90 and 25 37 when the deficit proportions were within the range of 60 80 40 60 and 40 respectively fig 4e the percentage change in wue showed a decreasing and then increasing trend as the deficit proportion decreased with the smallest wue of 4 56 95 ci 1 38 7 84 irrigation proportion was 60 80 full besides apri increased wue by 9 63 95 ci 7 65 11 64 4 56 1 38 7 84 11 18 4 21 18 62 when the deficit proportion was 80 100 60 80 and 40 60 respectively fig 4f 3 3 2 apri by di compared with di apri of different irrigation methods deficit stages and proportions significantly increased wue while the changes of yield were inconsistent fig 5 yields of drip and furrow irrigation were both decreased 5 94 and 2 88 respectively thereafter the percentage change of yield in response to sprinkler irrigation increased which may be due to the small sample size n 3 fig 5a the wue of drip and furrow irrigation was increased 4 17 and 5 41 respectively but the results were not significant different fig 5b in terms of deficit stage apri increased yield and wue relative to di when the deficit occurred at the reproductive stage specifically the yield was increased by 4 29 95 ci 0 5 8 23 and wue was increased by 2 35 95 ci 3 46 8 5 however the result of wue was not significant different because the 95 ci included 0 fig 5c d no matter that deficit stage occurred at reproductive stage or throughout the season the difference between them was not significant fig 5d compared with di the reduction of yield under apri was positively correlated with deficit proportions fig 5e namely apri decreased yield by 4 7 5 72 and 11 54 when the deficit proportions were 80 100 60 80 and 40 60 respectively nevertheless when the deficit proportions were 40 60 and 60 80 the difference between apri and di was not significant because the 95 confidence internal of them included 0 fig 5e the largest wue 47 36 occurred when the deficit proportion was 40 60 while the smallest wue 15 48 occurred at 60 80 fig 5f however the sample size of the deficit proportion of 40 60 was small so the results need to be further verified 3 3 3 di by full under different irrigation methods deficit stages and deficit proportions yield and wue of di were affected to varying degrees relative to full fig 6 the yields and wue for all irrigation methods considered in this meta analysis except sprinkler irrigation were all significantly different from 0 but the effect size for yield was not significant due to the small size n 3 when using di under sprinkler irrigation fig 6a b the percentage change in yield under furrow irrigation 9 6 was significantly greater than that under drip irrigation 22 54 but it was slightly greater than that under sprinkler irrigation 10 17 fig 6a the wue of furrow irrigation 8 11 was lower than that of drip irrigation 18 3 but their results were not significant fig 6b with regard to the influence of deficit stage the reduction of yield of di occurred at reproductive stage 20 54 95 ci 23 02 to 17 98 was greater than that occurred throughout the season 16 02 95 ci 17 76 14 24 and the differences were significant fig 6c however the wue under water deficit throughout the season was significantly higher than that at reproductive stage and increased wue by 20 76 95 ci 12 02 27 72 throughout the season and 5 85 95 ci 2 00 14 18 reproductive stage fig 6d the percentage changes of yield and wue under di were also affected by deficit proportion relative to full fig 6e f specifically the yield was negatively related to deficit proportion and yield were decreased by 6 43 80 100 15 34 60 80 and 21 49 40 60 respectively fig 6e the wue of deficit proportion at 40 60 13 79 was marginally higher than that at 60 80 11 96 but these results were not significantly different fig 6f 3 4 yield and wue response of soil properties to different irrigation methods 3 4 1 apri by full regardless of soil properties apri decreased yield but increased wue compared with full except for wue for soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 with varying degrees of success fig 7 apri decreased yield in clay sandy clay clay loam sandy clay loam loam sandy loam and sand by 2 12 4 6 4 86 28 64 7 41 3 47 and 9 14 relative to full respectively the increases in wue of apri relative to full were 6 65 20 56 7 18 and 11 52 in sandy clay clay loam loam and sandy loam respectively fig 7a and b the relative change of apri on yield was negatively correlated to bulk density but the trend was opposite for wue fig 7c d the reduction of yield for soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was 17 10 95 ci 19 49 to 14 64 lower than that of soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 5 42 95 ci 6 44 4 38 and the difference was significant fig 7c however wue for soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was increased by 8 01 95 ci 6 24 9 82 which was significantly higher than that for soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 30 97 95 ci 43 01 16 37 fig 7d with regard to the influence of soil ph on apri apri compared to full decreased yield by 1 45 95 ci 4 68 1 89 and 14 18 17 07 to 11 19 for soils with ph 7 and 7 respectively and the reduction of yield for soils with ph 7 was not significant fig 6e 3 4 2 apri by di the relative changes of yield and wue of apri relative to di was affected by soil properties soil texture bulk density and ph fig 8 except for clay and sandy loam other soil textures decreased yield to varying degrees specifically apri decreased yields in sandy clay silt clay loam clay loam sandy clay loam silt loam loam and sand by 5 29 1 09 21 89 0 55 4 46 1 96 and 1 54 respectively fig 8a in contrast except for clay loam 26 93 apri increased wue by 4 94 4 04 2 35 and 7 56 when soil textures were clay sandy clay loam and sandy loam apart from clay and loam the results were significant fig 8d regardless of soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 or 1 35 g cm 3 apri decreased yield significantly relative to di and the reduction of yield for soil with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 3 52 was significantly higher than that with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 15 73 fig 8b the relative changes of yield between the two soil ph were opposite but these results were not remarkably different between the two different irrigation regimes because the 95 ci of soil ph included 0 specifically the decrease of yield for soil with ph 7 was 3 95 ci 6 52 0 65 and the increase for soils with ph 7 was 3 37 0 59 7 5 fig 8c 3 4 3 di by full soil texture and bulk density decreased yield but increased wue relative to full with varying degrees of success fig 9 the largest decrease occurred in sandy loam 25 37 while the smallest decrease occurred in loam 2 67 fig 9a the relative changes in wue under di compared with full were 43 24 5 85 9 94 and 4 99 for clay loam loam sandy clay and sandy loam respectively fig 9b the smallest decrease in yield and the largest increase in wue under di occurred in soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 with values of 13 12 95 ci 16 49 9 61 and 28 77 95 ci 9 40 51 57 respectively which were higher than those in soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 13 65 and 6 14 respectively however the results between these two soil bulk densities were not significant fig 9c d 3 5 yield and wue response of meteorological factors to different irrigation methods 3 5 1 apri by full regarding to the response of yield and wue to different meteorological factors precipitation and temperature under apri compared to full the two seasonal precipitation levels during both significantly increased wue but caused a significant reduction in yield as for the average annual temperature it significantly increased wue but not yield fig 10 seasonal precipitation 200 mm caused a larger decrease in yield by 5 59 95 ci 7 19 to 3 96 but no significant difference was observed for seasonal precipitation 200 mm 4 83 95 ci 5 8 to 3 84 however seasonal precipitation 200 mm significantly increased wue by 12 49 95 ci 8 67 16 44 which was significantly higher than seasonal precipitation 200 mm 5 62 95 ci 5 08 6 16 fig 10a b the percentage increase in yield for average annual temperature 9 7 c was 10 4 95 ci 6 4 14 6 and 1 08 95 ci 1 41 3 63 but the difference was not significant because of the 95 ci containing 0 average annual temperature 9 c increased wue but not yield the percentage change was a 5 7 increase in wue but a 6 61 decrease in yield fig 10c d 3 5 2 apri by di the relative changes of yield and wue under apri to di were also influenced by the seasonal precipitation and average annual temperature fig 11 the yield under apri in regions with seasonal precipitation 200 mm 4 83 95 ci 5 80 to 3 84 was larger than that 200 mm 5 59 95 ci 7 19 to 3 96 compared to di fig 11a the percentage changes of yield under apri at different temperatures were either significantly higher than or not significantly different from that under di fig 11c apri caused higher wue than di regardless of precipitation levels during the growing season fig 11b although there were positive responses of wue at different temperatures the difference was not significant fig 11d 3 5 3 di by full the effect of di on yield increased with increasing seasonal precipitation amount fig 11a the percentage change of greater seasonal precipitation 200 mm 7 6 was significantly higher than that of low precipitation 200 mm 22 3 although higher percentage change was found for seasonal precipitation 200 mm 5 0 no significant difference was observed between the two precipitation levels moreover the reduction of wue for low seasonal precipitation 200 mm under di was not significantly different from that under full fig 11b the percentage decrease of yield and wue were 12 7 and 7 0 in regions with higher average annual temperature 9 c respectively fig 11c d 4 discussion 4 1 yield and wue of agricultural species groups compared with full yield under apri and di significantly decreased and the degree varied significantly among agricultural species groups fig 3a c suggesting that different agricultural species groups had various responses to water deficit mccarthy 1999 pérez pérez et al 2012 thereby these differences led to yield differences costa et al 2007 steduto et al 2012 wang et al 2018 2019 concluded that the irrigation level significantly affected potato yield and seed cotton yield furthermore compared with full the significant reduction of yield under apri and di was probably due to the deficit stage including the reproductive stage adu et al 2018 the decrease of yield under apri were similar for fruits vegetables and crops whereas the wue of fruits was increased most among the three agricultural species groups compared with full fig 3a d besides when compared with di both yield and wue of fruits increased under apri fig 3b e therefore apri was more conducive to fruit trees compared with other agricultural species the result is similar to those reported by du et al 2005 who revealed that fruit trees might be more suitable for the application of apri technique because of their deeper root system and wide spacing similar results were also demonstrated by du et al 2008b zegbe and behboudian 2008 and dos santos et al 2003 the yield reduction under di was lager for fruits and vegetables than crops compared with full however the trend of wue was opposite fig 3c f therefore the choice of deficit irrigation depends to a large extent on economically weighting the loss of yield and the benefits of saving irrigation water for different agricultural species the comparison results of crop yield and wue under apri and di were inconsistent fig 3b e for fruits apri significantly increased yields by 4 46 while vegetables and crops significantly decreased by 8 64 and 3 97 respectively the results may be due to the differences in applied water and the duration of deficit under apri and di after all different agricultural species and cultivars have different response to water stress goodwin and macrae 1990 mccarthy 1999 there was no difference or significant increase in wue between apri and di which agreed with the finding of peng 2012 who found prd improved the drought resistance of crops and saved water compared with deficit irrigation wue under di and apri were significantly increased among all crops fig 3d f the results are consistent with that of du et al 2010 2017 and sadras 2009 4 2 yield and wue of irrigation managements in this meta analysis we found that the response of crop yields and wue to apri and di varied significantly in response to irrigation management practices relative to full including irrigation strategy deficit stage and proportion figs 4 6 regardless of di or apri compared with full or apri compared with di changes of yield of drip irrigation showed a larger decrease compared to furrow irrigation figs 4a 6a this may be because the reduced irrigation water used in furrow irrigation was able to improve the oxygen content in soils and reduced nutrient loss caused by anaerobic respiration while drip irrigation has been verified as a means of regular and even water supply cetin and bilgel 2002 yu et al 2020 as for drip irrigation the water condition of crops under drip irrigation was probably inherently better than that of furrow irrigation so the reduced water supply under drip irrigation resulted in a reduction in yield camp 1998 however wue of pairwise comparisons of irrigation methods were all significantly increased compared to the control treatment figs 4b 6b this can be largely attributed to the reduced evapotranspiration sezen and yazar 2006 with respect to the deficit stage the greater reduction in yield occurred when apri and di were applied at the reproductive stage which is in agreement with previous studies cheng et al 2018 jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 one possible reason is that the water deficit at the reproductive stage may cause early wilting of the lower leaves of crops which reduce the radiation intercepted by crops leading to a decrease in crop yields cheng et al 2018 another probable reason may be due to the water stress occurred at flowering robertson and giunta 1994 which significantly inhibits the formation of flowers and ultimately reduces the number of grains grewal 2010 the results also revealed that deficit irrigation throughout the season showed a moderate but not significant higher wue which is in accordance with the results of yu et al 2020 the possible reason is that the water deficit at the vegetative stage is too early to influence yield but saves water to a certain degree lu et al 2019 the responses of yield to different irrigation managements not only depend on the irrigation strategy and deficit stage but also on the deficit proportion we found apri and di reduced yield significantly when reduced the amount of irrigation water at each level in comparison to full which contradicts to the previous results that apri can save 30 of full irrigation water improve wue and do not significantly reduce yield over full irrigation du et al 2008b fu et al 2017 giuliani et al 2017 shahnazari et al 2008 the difference may be due to the different deficit stage and the duration of wet and dry cycling and intensity helyes and varga 1994 nuruddin et al 2003 zegbe et al 2006 in this meta analysis when the irrigation proportion of apri and di was within 80 100 full the duration of the wet and dry cycling under field conditions considered in this meta analysis was mostly longer than 14 d and it influenced the intensity of the apri and di responses ahmadi et al 2010 yactayo et al 2013 another reason for this could be the deficit stage in this meta analysis deficit was applied either at reproductive or throughout the season and reproductive stage was the stage of yield formation chen et al 2014 therefore the effect of reduced water supply on crop yields was relatively large 4 3 yield and wue of soil properties generally for most soil properties yield of apri and di compared with full decreased while wue increased obviously figs 7a b and 9a b however there was no significantly difference in yield between apri and di fig 8a as for the former yield in sandy clay loam was most negative and wue in clay loam was most positive fig 7a b these results were in accordance with the findings of adu et al 2018 who found the better yield in sandy clay loam referring to the relative yield of fi to di and prdi over clay silt loam this may be due to the poor water retention of sandy soil where plants may soon suffer from the water stress at a water deficit stage therefore the largest reduction in yield in sandy soil was not entirely unexpected kirda 2002 zhang et al 2004 besides the texture characteristics of soils also affected the rooting and water extraction capabilities of crops thereby limiting the ability of plants to resist water stress tolk et al 1999 zhang et al 2004 wue of apri by full in clay loam was most positive fig 7b crops grow in finer soils may have enough time to adapt to the lower soil water content and to adjust the drought response and reduce the negative effect of water deficit kirda 2002 simultaneously it also showed that water saving irrigation strategies did not necessarily have significant results in all soils the performance of yield in response to apri by full and apri by di for soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was better than that for soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 figs 7c and 8c the reason for this result may be due to that high soil bulk density can result in soil hypoxia or anoxia due to the increased soil compaction and reduced nutrient uptake elongation of roots and soil aeration wolkowski and lowery 2008 obviously these factors significantly limited the growth of crops ityel et al 2014 apri maintained and controlled the active root layer of the soil to alternately appear in the dry area of the vertical or horizontal profile which significantly improved the soil aeration and elongation of roots kang et al 1997 the yield of apri compared with full for soil ph 7 was better than that for soil ph 7 fig 7e this was probably because the drought caused by apri promoted the aerobic respiration du et al 2018 which led to the volatilization of ammonia in the root soil carrijo et al 2017 and the decrease in soil nitrogen uptake and possibly yield compared with di apri increased yield for soil ph 7 while yield was decreased for soil ph 7 but this result was not significant because the 95 confidence internal of soil ph included 0 fig 8c 4 4 yield and wue of meteorological factors precipitation and temperature are widely recognized as two main factors influencing yield and wue mo et al 2018 yu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 our results indicated that the percentage increase of wue under apri in regions with higher seasonal precipitation 200 mm was significant lower than that with low precipitation 200 mm fig 10b the possible reason can be that higher precipitation caused greater et zheng et al 2019 the yield and wue in regions with average annual temperature 9 c were higher than those with average annual temperature 9 c fig 10c d it was mainly due to that agricultural species planted in regions with low temperature 9 c could extend the growing season length zhang et al 2018 and thus produced large yield and wue greater yield under apri were easier to achieve in regions with higher seasonal precipitation 200 mm while the percentage increase of wue was larger in low precipitation environment 200 mm compared with di fig 11a b the result may be greatly attributed to that apri promoted the lateral root growth cheng et al 2018 2021 which was beneficial to the utilization of soil water and fertilization in low precipitation environment 200 mm wang et al 2010 besides apri reduced the soil water loss by evaporation relative to di thereby increasing yield and wue to some degree the yield and wue under di showed an increasing trend with increasing seasonal precipitation compared to full fig 12a b it indicated that higher yield and wue under di could be more likely to achieve in regions with higher seasonal precipitation 200 mm one possible reason can be that di could avoid the excessive soil saturation in higher precipitation environment which suppressed the root respiration iqbal et al 2011 and affected crop water and fertilizer absorption thereby hindering yield and wue xu et al 2016 4 5 limitations and implications the meta analysis evaluated the effects of different irrigation meteorological and soil factors on yield and wue of seven agricultural species under apri di and full however because of the insufficient data in wue the effects of soil ph on the response of wue to apri di and full could not be side by side compared in addition the response of yield to di compared to full for different soil textures was also not discussed therefore these missing comparisons need to be done in the future in this meta analysis we only investigated the responses of maize wheat cotton potato tomato apple and grape to apri di and full indeed some other varieties also met these criteria but the data were collected from only one or two published papers these seven varieties were studied relatively more than other varieties among the collected literature this meta analysis analyzed the effects of apri di full on yield and wue considering agricultural species group soil texture bulk density ph irrigation method the amount of water applied and the period when apri or di irrigation was undertaken however the frequency of irrigation and fertilization also affected the results thus more factors need to be analyzed to investigate the responses of yield and wue 5 conclusions this meta analysis analyzed the percentage changes of yield and wue of seven agricultural species under apri di and full under different irrigation managements soil properties and meteorological factors overall yield under apri and di were remarkably lower than those under full while the corresponding wue were significantly higher there was no significant difference in yield between apri and di but wue under apri was higher compared with full apri performed better in fruits with irrigation amount of 80 100 full silt loam loam and sand soils with high bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and furrow irrigation besides the response of apri was better in regions with low seasonal precipitation 200 mm and low average annual temperature 9 c compared with full di performed better for clay loam low bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and higher seasonal precipitation 200 mm compared with di fruits with furrow irrigation and soil with clay and sandy loam were better under apri apri in regions with low average annual temperature 9 c was more likely to increase both yield and wue therefore it is critical to weigh the cost of yield penalty the economic benefit of saving water and the cost of implementing irrigation methods before choosing various

10175,deficit irrigation di and alternate partial root zone irrigation apri are widely recognized water saving irrigation methods this meta analysis provided a systematic and quantitative result of the relative changes in yield and water use efficiency wue of seven agricultural products maize wheat cotton potato tomato apple and grape under conventional full irrigation full apri and di globally three comparisons were performed 1 apri by full 2 apri by di and 3 di by full the results showed that the relative changes of yield and wue differed among the three comparisons higher yield and wue were achieved in fruits apple and grape under apri compared with full or di however the percentage changes in yield and wue under apri were not significantly different in vegetables potato and tomato and crops maize wheat and cotton compared with full apri performed better for acidic soils clay loam or sandy loam high bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 irrigation amount of 80 100 full and was more appropriate for furrow irrigation in drier and colder environments compared with full di performed better for clay loam low bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and precipitation 200 mm yields under apri and di were remarkably lower than those under full while the corresponding wue were significantly higher compared with di fruits with furrow irrigation and in soils with clay and sandy loam were better under apri there was no significant difference in yield between apri and di but wue under apri was higher apri increased both yield and wue in regions with low average annual temperature 9 it is critical to weigh the cost of yield penalty the economic benefit of saving water and the cost of implementing irrigation method before choosing an effective water saving irrigation method keywords alternate partial root zone irrigation conventional irrigation yield wue meta analysis 1 introduction the global climate change water resources shortage and ever growing population have brought great challenges to the sustainable development of agriculture around the world hanjra and qureshi 2010 wheeler and von braun 2013 by 2050 the global population will reach 9 billion and the demand for foods will double bagatur 2014 water is a major factor influencing agricultural production especially in arid and semi arid regions solomon and cramer 1993 zheng et al 2018 2021 fao 2012 sufficient availability of water in the root zone is crucial throughout the growing season of crops xu et al 2020 yang et al 2006 yawson et al 2014 therefore it is of significance to find ways to reduce agricultural water use while maintaining or even increasing crop yields rosegrant et al 2009 yan et al 2019 deficit irrigation di and alternate partial root zone irrigation apri are two widely recognized effective water saving irrigation methods di involves the application of water in a strictly controlled manner that is lower than the total water demand during the specified part or the seasonal cycle of crop development liu et al 2020 kriedemann and goodwon 2009 by contrast apri alternates irrigation in space or time to create a dry and wet cycle in different parts of the root system to maintain plant water conditions under maximum water potential and to control the vegetative growth kriedemann and goodwon 2009 sadras 2009 although there are many differences between the two irrigation methods their purpose is to directly reduce the input of irrigation water in time or space so as to improve wue of crops without significantly reducing crop yields compared to the conventional full irrigation kirda et al 2007 kriedemann and goodwin 2003 kriedemann and goodwon 2009 morison et al 2008 sadras 2009 since apri was proposed it has received attention worldwide pérez pérez et al 2020 and a large number of related experiments have been conducted the results showed that apri can save 30 50 of irrigation water and increase wue while reducing crop yields slightly in many crops such as oat lin et al 2012 grape intrigliolo and castel 2009 kusakabe et al 2016 cotton tang et al 2005 2010 papaya santos et al 2021 maize fu et al 2017 and tomato sarker et al 2016 however the results of some studies were inconsistent and concluded that apri can increase the crop yields for example du et al 2017 reported that apri with eight irrigation times significantly increased the yield and wue of apple in arid northwest china du et al 2008a found that the seed cotton yield under alternate drip irrigation adi was 5 61 higher than that under conventional drip irrigation cdi sadras 2009 concluded that the yield produced by apri and conventional irrigation was within a range of 20 in 80 of cases and apri outperformed deficit irrigation by 20 or more in other cases adu et al 2018 found the yields of different crops produced by deficit irrigation and apri were similar obviously the conclusions on the crop yield and wue among these three irrigation methods di apri and full are still inconsistent in view of this situation meta analysis can provide a solution meta analysis is a statistical model used to quantitatively analyze and summarize the results from multiple independent studies with the same theme so that meta analysis researchers can draw conclusions from the concatenated dataset stanley and jarrell 1989 in present meta analysis has been widely used in agricultural studies some meta analyses have also been done on the impact of different irrigation methods on crop yield and wue for example yu et al 2020 applied a meta analysis to quantify the effects of deficit irrigation on water use efficiency and yield of wheat relative to full irrigation adu et al 2018 employed a meta analysis to study the influence of full irrigation deficit irrigation and partial root zone irrigation on crop yields carrijo et al 2017 conducted a meta analysis to quantify the effect of alternate wetting and drying on rice yield and water use however the previous meta analyses on various irrigation methods only focused on the impact of different factors on various indicators of a single crop or on a single indicator of various crops there is a lack of a systematic and quantitative analysis of the yield and wue of various crops under di apri and full on a global scale therefore a global meta analysis was distinctly conducted to examine the relative changes of crop yield and wue under apri by full apri by di and di by full in order to enable comparisons under similar conditions as much as possible some of the related crops soil and irrigation management practices contributing to the differences in crop yield and wue were considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection relevant peer reviewed studies from 1997 to 2020 were collected the search engines used in this

partial root drying or deficit irrigation or partial root zone or irrigation strategies regimes or water saving irrigation and water use efficiency and yield in total there were 90 publications including 305 pairs of observations of yield and wue that satisfied our criteria for the meta analysis the list of the 90 publications from which the data were extracted are listed in appendix a these publications were screened using the following criteria i only publications describing experiments conducted in the field with side by side comparisons of full or di and apri were selected and pot or

plot can be used to intuitively assess whether there is a publication bias if there is no publication bias the funnel plot should be similar to an inverted symmetric funnel however if there is publication bias the plot will be an asymmetric funnel adu et al 2018 duval and tweedie 2000 ferreira et al 2016 higgins and green 2011 hereafter we need to further evaluate its potential impact on the overall effect size through the trim and fill method duval and tweedie 2000 ferreira et al 2016 jennions et al 2013 according to the results of funnel plot the yield of apri by full was near symmetrical and the trim and fill analysis indicated that there was no missing study however for the funnel plots of yield of apri by di di by full and wue of apri by full apri by di di by full there were five eleven three two and two estimated missing studies respectively although it changed the magnitude of the effect size it did not change the significance meanwhile the rosenthal s fail safe number nfs orwin 1983 for estimating the number of additional studies needs to invalidate the statistically significant results n f s 5 k 10 where k is the number of studies the nfs values of yield and wue calculated using stata were 57 361 and 1768 respectively the two nfs were significantly higher than 1175 5 231 10 and 375 5 73 10 so the publication bias was not a big problem for this meta analysis 2 4 data analyses in this meta analysis all data analyses were conducted by the stata se 15 1 software stata college station tx usa the mapping software used in this meta analysis included origin v9 0 and graphpad prism8 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset the database was selected from 90 articles reporting the studies of seven agricultural species from 20 countries around the world the studied species included crops maize wheat and cotton vegetables potato and tomato and fruits apple and grape the relative frequency distribution of effect sizes on yield and wue followed gaussian normal distributions fig 1 indicating that the dataset were homogeneous shan and yan 2013 yields were significantly reduced under apri and di compared with full and the overall effect sizes of yield for apri by full and di by full were 7 09 95 ci 7 96 to 6 21 and 17 44 95 ci 18 8 to 16 there was no significant difference between apri and di and the overall effect size of yield was 1 54 95 ci 2 79 0 28 fig 2 as for wue the overall effect size of these three comparisons were all significantly increased and wue for apri by full apri by di and di by full were 8 46 95 ci 6 81 10 12 4 77 95 ci 3 03 6 55 and 12 78 95 ci 8 47 17 26 fig 2 3 2 yield and wue response of agricultural species groups to different irrigation methods 3 2 1 apri by full compared with full apri significantly reduced yield and increased wue for all agricultural species groups fig 3a d apri had the smallest negative effect on yield of fruits 6 72 while crops had the largest negative effect on yield 7 18 but there were no significant difference among the agricultural species groups fig 3a however the wue of fruits was increased most by 22 33 95 ci 14 02 31 25 which was significantly higher than that of crops 7 fig 3d obviously the effect of apri was best for fruits and worst for crops 3 2 2 apri by di compared with di yield and wue of apri showed significantly different trends among the agricultural species groups the yield and wue of fruits both increased while vegetables showed opposite trends but the wue of them were not significantly different fig 3b e among them the yield of fruits showed an increased trend by 4 46 95 ci 0 89 8 16 while both vegetables and fruits showed decreased trend by 8 64 95 ci 10 24 to 7 00 and 3 97 95 ci 5 53 to 2 38 respectively fig 3b apart from crops 5 77 the changes in wue were not significant 1 05 and 0 76 respectively for fruits and vegetables fig 3e 3 2 3 di and full di decreased yield significantly but increased wue relative to full among different agricultural species groups with varying degrees of success fig 3c f crops reduced yield least by 10 03 95 ci 12 62 to 7 37 while its wue increased least 6 96 as for fruits and vegetables there was no significant difference between the reduction in yield and the increase in wue 3 3 yield and wue response of irrigation management to different irrigation methods 3 3 1 apri by full the irrigation methods decreased yield and increased wue under apri with varying degrees of success except sprinkler irrigation fig 4a b the effect size for yield in response to sprinkler irrigation was not significant which may be due to the small sample size n 4 fig 4a from all observations apri decreased yield by 1 11 8 11 and 4 78 under sprinkler drip and furrow irrigation but it significantly increased wue by 8 36 and 8 89 under drip and furrow irrigation respectively comprehensively considering yield and wue furrow irrigation performed best fig 4a b in term of the deficit stage apri compared to full significantly decreased yield by 8 14 reproductive stage and 6 87 throughout the season but it significantly increased wue by 11 66 and 8 17 respectively however the differences of yield and wue between these two stages were not significant fig 4c d the effects of apri on yield and wue also varied with deficit proportions expressed as a fraction of full fig 4e f and the degree of apri on yield was positively correlated with deficit proportions when the deficit proportion ranged 80 100 the reduction of yield was minimal 3 16 95 ci 4 82 to 1 46 moreover apri decreased yield by 8 09 2 90 and 25 37 when the deficit proportions were within the range of 60 80 40 60 and 40 respectively fig 4e the percentage change in wue showed a decreasing and then increasing trend as the deficit proportion decreased with the smallest wue of 4 56 95 ci 1 38 7 84 irrigation proportion was 60 80 full besides apri increased wue by 9 63 95 ci 7 65 11 64 4 56 1 38 7 84 11 18 4 21 18 62 when the deficit proportion was 80 100 60 80 and 40 60 respectively fig 4f 3 3 2 apri by di compared with di apri of different irrigation methods deficit stages and proportions significantly increased wue while the changes of yield were inconsistent fig 5 yields of drip and furrow irrigation were both decreased 5 94 and 2 88 respectively thereafter the percentage change of yield in response to sprinkler irrigation increased which may be due to the small sample size n 3 fig 5a the wue of drip and furrow irrigation was increased 4 17 and 5 41 respectively but the results were not significant different fig 5b in terms of deficit stage apri increased yield and wue relative to di when the deficit occurred at the reproductive stage specifically the yield was increased by 4 29 95 ci 0 5 8 23 and wue was increased by 2 35 95 ci 3 46 8 5 however the result of wue was not significant different because the 95 ci included 0 fig 5c d no matter that deficit stage occurred at reproductive stage or throughout the season the difference between them was not significant fig 5d compared with di the reduction of yield under apri was positively correlated with deficit proportions fig 5e namely apri decreased yield by 4 7 5 72 and 11 54 when the deficit proportions were 80 100 60 80 and 40 60 respectively nevertheless when the deficit proportions were 40 60 and 60 80 the difference between apri and di was not significant because the 95 confidence internal of them included 0 fig 5e the largest wue 47 36 occurred when the deficit proportion was 40 60 while the smallest wue 15 48 occurred at 60 80 fig 5f however the sample size of the deficit proportion of 40 60 was small so the results need to be further verified 3 3 3 di by full under different irrigation methods deficit stages and deficit proportions yield and wue of di were affected to varying degrees relative to full fig 6 the yields and wue for all irrigation methods considered in this meta analysis except sprinkler irrigation were all significantly different from 0 but the effect size for yield was not significant due to the small size n 3 when using di under sprinkler irrigation fig 6a b the percentage change in yield under furrow irrigation 9 6 was significantly greater than that under drip irrigation 22 54 but it was slightly greater than that under sprinkler irrigation 10 17 fig 6a the wue of furrow irrigation 8 11 was lower than that of drip irrigation 18 3 but their results were not significant fig 6b with regard to the influence of deficit stage the reduction of yield of di occurred at reproductive stage 20 54 95 ci 23 02 to 17 98 was greater than that occurred throughout the season 16 02 95 ci 17 76 14 24 and the differences were significant fig 6c however the wue under water deficit throughout the season was significantly higher than that at reproductive stage and increased wue by 20 76 95 ci 12 02 27 72 throughout the season and 5 85 95 ci 2 00 14 18 reproductive stage fig 6d the percentage changes of yield and wue under di were also affected by deficit proportion relative to full fig 6e f specifically the yield was negatively related to deficit proportion and yield were decreased by 6 43 80 100 15 34 60 80 and 21 49 40 60 respectively fig 6e the wue of deficit proportion at 40 60 13 79 was marginally higher than that at 60 80 11 96 but these results were not significantly different fig 6f 3 4 yield and wue response of soil properties to different irrigation methods 3 4 1 apri by full regardless of soil properties apri decreased yield but increased wue compared with full except for wue for soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 with varying degrees of success fig 7 apri decreased yield in clay sandy clay clay loam sandy clay loam loam sandy loam and sand by 2 12 4 6 4 86 28 64 7 41 3 47 and 9 14 relative to full respectively the increases in wue of apri relative to full were 6 65 20 56 7 18 and 11 52 in sandy clay clay loam loam and sandy loam respectively fig 7a and b the relative change of apri on yield was negatively correlated to bulk density but the trend was opposite for wue fig 7c d the reduction of yield for soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was 17 10 95 ci 19 49 to 14 64 lower than that of soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 5 42 95 ci 6 44 4 38 and the difference was significant fig 7c however wue for soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was increased by 8 01 95 ci 6 24 9 82 which was significantly higher than that for soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 30 97 95 ci 43 01 16 37 fig 7d with regard to the influence of soil ph on apri apri compared to full decreased yield by 1 45 95 ci 4 68 1 89 and 14 18 17 07 to 11 19 for soils with ph 7 and 7 respectively and the reduction of yield for soils with ph 7 was not significant fig 6e 3 4 2 apri by di the relative changes of yield and wue of apri relative to di was affected by soil properties soil texture bulk density and ph fig 8 except for clay and sandy loam other soil textures decreased yield to varying degrees specifically apri decreased yields in sandy clay silt clay loam clay loam sandy clay loam silt loam loam and sand by 5 29 1 09 21 89 0 55 4 46 1 96 and 1 54 respectively fig 8a in contrast except for clay loam 26 93 apri increased wue by 4 94 4 04 2 35 and 7 56 when soil textures were clay sandy clay loam and sandy loam apart from clay and loam the results were significant fig 8d regardless of soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 or 1 35 g cm 3 apri decreased yield significantly relative to di and the reduction of yield for soil with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 3 52 was significantly higher than that with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 15 73 fig 8b the relative changes of yield between the two soil ph were opposite but these results were not remarkably different between the two different irrigation regimes because the 95 ci of soil ph included 0 specifically the decrease of yield for soil with ph 7 was 3 95 ci 6 52 0 65 and the increase for soils with ph 7 was 3 37 0 59 7 5 fig 8c 3 4 3 di by full soil texture and bulk density decreased yield but increased wue relative to full with varying degrees of success fig 9 the largest decrease occurred in sandy loam 25 37 while the smallest decrease occurred in loam 2 67 fig 9a the relative changes in wue under di compared with full were 43 24 5 85 9 94 and 4 99 for clay loam loam sandy clay and sandy loam respectively fig 9b the smallest decrease in yield and the largest increase in wue under di occurred in soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 with values of 13 12 95 ci 16 49 9 61 and 28 77 95 ci 9 40 51 57 respectively which were higher than those in soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 13 65 and 6 14 respectively however the results between these two soil bulk densities were not significant fig 9c d 3 5 yield and wue response of meteorological factors to different irrigation methods 3 5 1 apri by full regarding to the response of yield and wue to different meteorological factors precipitation and temperature under apri compared to full the two seasonal precipitation levels during both significantly increased wue but caused a significant reduction in yield as for the average annual temperature it significantly increased wue but not yield fig 10 seasonal precipitation 200 mm caused a larger decrease in yield by 5 59 95 ci 7 19 to 3 96 but no significant difference was observed for seasonal precipitation 200 mm 4 83 95 ci 5 8 to 3 84 however seasonal precipitation 200 mm significantly increased wue by 12 49 95 ci 8 67 16 44 which was significantly higher than seasonal precipitation 200 mm 5 62 95 ci 5 08 6 16 fig 10a b the percentage increase in yield for average annual temperature 9 7 c was 10 4 95 ci 6 4 14 6 and 1 08 95 ci 1 41 3 63 but the difference was not significant because of the 95 ci containing 0 average annual temperature 9 c increased wue but not yield the percentage change was a 5 7 increase in wue but a 6 61 decrease in yield fig 10c d 3 5 2 apri by di the relative changes of yield and wue under apri to di were also influenced by the seasonal precipitation and average annual temperature fig 11 the yield under apri in regions with seasonal precipitation 200 mm 4 83 95 ci 5 80 to 3 84 was larger than that 200 mm 5 59 95 ci 7 19 to 3 96 compared to di fig 11a the percentage changes of yield under apri at different temperatures were either significantly higher than or not significantly different from that under di fig 11c apri caused higher wue than di regardless of precipitation levels during the growing season fig 11b although there were positive responses of wue at different temperatures the difference was not significant fig 11d 3 5 3 di by full the effect of di on yield increased with increasing seasonal precipitation amount fig 11a the percentage change of greater seasonal precipitation 200 mm 7 6 was significantly higher than that of low precipitation 200 mm 22 3 although higher percentage change was found for seasonal precipitation 200 mm 5 0 no significant difference was observed between the two precipitation levels moreover the reduction of wue for low seasonal precipitation 200 mm under di was not significantly different from that under full fig 11b the percentage decrease of yield and wue were 12 7 and 7 0 in regions with higher average annual temperature 9 c respectively fig 11c d 4 discussion 4 1 yield and wue of agricultural species groups compared with full yield under apri and di significantly decreased and the degree varied significantly among agricultural species groups fig 3a c suggesting that different agricultural species groups had various responses to water deficit mccarthy 1999 pérez pérez et al 2012 thereby these differences led to yield differences costa et al 2007 steduto et al 2012 wang et al 2018 2019 concluded that the irrigation level significantly affected potato yield and seed cotton yield furthermore compared with full the significant reduction of yield under apri and di was probably due to the deficit stage including the reproductive stage adu et al 2018 the decrease of yield under apri were similar for fruits vegetables and crops whereas the wue of fruits was increased most among the three agricultural species groups compared with full fig 3a d besides when compared with di both yield and wue of fruits increased under apri fig 3b e therefore apri was more conducive to fruit trees compared with other agricultural species the result is similar to those reported by du et al 2005 who revealed that fruit trees might be more suitable for the application of apri technique because of their deeper root system and wide spacing similar results were also demonstrated by du et al 2008b zegbe and behboudian 2008 and dos santos et al 2003 the yield reduction under di was lager for fruits and vegetables than crops compared with full however the trend of wue was opposite fig 3c f therefore the choice of deficit irrigation depends to a large extent on economically weighting the loss of yield and the benefits of saving irrigation water for different agricultural species the comparison results of crop yield and wue under apri and di were inconsistent fig 3b e for fruits apri significantly increased yields by 4 46 while vegetables and crops significantly decreased by 8 64 and 3 97 respectively the results may be due to the differences in applied water and the duration of deficit under apri and di after all different agricultural species and cultivars have different response to water stress goodwin and macrae 1990 mccarthy 1999 there was no difference or significant increase in wue between apri and di which agreed with the finding of peng 2012 who found prd improved the drought resistance of crops and saved water compared with deficit irrigation wue under di and apri were significantly increased among all crops fig 3d f the results are consistent with that of du et al 2010 2017 and sadras 2009 4 2 yield and wue of irrigation managements in this meta analysis we found that the response of crop yields and wue to apri and di varied significantly in response to irrigation management practices relative to full including irrigation strategy deficit stage and proportion figs 4 6 regardless of di or apri compared with full or apri compared with di changes of yield of drip irrigation showed a larger decrease compared to furrow irrigation figs 4a 6a this may be because the reduced irrigation water used in furrow irrigation was able to improve the oxygen content in soils and reduced nutrient loss caused by anaerobic respiration while drip irrigation has been verified as a means of regular and even water supply cetin and bilgel 2002 yu et al 2020 as for drip irrigation the water condition of crops under drip irrigation was probably inherently better than that of furrow irrigation so the reduced water supply under drip irrigation resulted in a reduction in yield camp 1998 however wue of pairwise comparisons of irrigation methods were all significantly increased compared to the control treatment figs 4b 6b this can be largely attributed to the reduced evapotranspiration sezen and yazar 2006 with respect to the deficit stage the greater reduction in yield occurred when apri and di were applied at the reproductive stage which is in agreement with previous studies cheng et al 2018 jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 one possible reason is that the water deficit at the reproductive stage may cause early wilting of the lower leaves of crops which reduce the radiation intercepted by crops leading to a decrease in crop yields cheng et al 2018 another probable reason may be due to the water stress occurred at flowering robertson and giunta 1994 which significantly inhibits the formation of flowers and ultimately reduces the number of grains grewal 2010 the results also revealed that deficit irrigation throughout the season showed a moderate but not significant higher wue which is in accordance with the results of yu et al 2020 the possible reason is that the water deficit at the vegetative stage is too early to influence yield but saves water to a certain degree lu et al 2019 the responses of yield to different irrigation managements not only depend on the irrigation strategy and deficit stage but also on the deficit proportion we found apri and di reduced yield significantly when reduced the amount of irrigation water at each level in comparison to full which contradicts to the previous results that apri can save 30 of full irrigation water improve wue and do not significantly reduce yield over full irrigation du et al 2008b fu et al 2017 giuliani et al 2017 shahnazari et al 2008 the difference may be due to the different deficit stage and the duration of wet and dry cycling and intensity helyes and varga 1994 nuruddin et al 2003 zegbe et al 2006 in this meta analysis when the irrigation proportion of apri and di was within 80 100 full the duration of the wet and dry cycling under field conditions considered in this meta analysis was mostly longer than 14 d and it influenced the intensity of the apri and di responses ahmadi et al 2010 yactayo et al 2013 another reason for this could be the deficit stage in this meta analysis deficit was applied either at reproductive or throughout the season and reproductive stage was the stage of yield formation chen et al 2014 therefore the effect of reduced water supply on crop yields was relatively large 4 3 yield and wue of soil properties generally for most soil properties yield of apri and di compared with full decreased while wue increased obviously figs 7a b and 9a b however there was no significantly difference in yield between apri and di fig 8a as for the former yield in sandy clay loam was most negative and wue in clay loam was most positive fig 7a b these results were in accordance with the findings of adu et al 2018 who found the better yield in sandy clay loam referring to the relative yield of fi to di and prdi over clay silt loam this may be due to the poor water retention of sandy soil where plants may soon suffer from the water stress at a water deficit stage therefore the largest reduction in yield in sandy soil was not entirely unexpected kirda 2002 zhang et al 2004 besides the texture characteristics of soils also affected the rooting and water extraction capabilities of crops thereby limiting the ability of plants to resist water stress tolk et al 1999 zhang et al 2004 wue of apri by full in clay loam was most positive fig 7b crops grow in finer soils may have enough time to adapt to the lower soil water content and to adjust the drought response and reduce the negative effect of water deficit kirda 2002 simultaneously it also showed that water saving irrigation strategies did not necessarily have significant results in all soils the performance of yield in response to apri by full and apri by di for soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was better than that for soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 figs 7c and 8c the reason for this result may be due to that high soil bulk density can result in soil hypoxia or anoxia due to the increased soil compaction and reduced nutrient uptake elongation of roots and soil aeration wolkowski and lowery 2008 obviously these factors significantly limited the growth of crops ityel et al 2014 apri maintained and controlled the active root layer of the soil to alternately appear in the dry area of the vertical or horizontal profile which significantly improved the soil aeration and elongation of roots kang et al 1997 the yield of apri compared with full for soil ph 7 was better than that for soil ph 7 fig 7e this was probably because the drought caused by apri promoted the aerobic respiration du et al 2018 which led to the volatilization of ammonia in the root soil carrijo et al 2017 and the decrease in soil nitrogen uptake and possibly yield compared with di apri increased yield for soil ph 7 while yield was decreased for soil ph 7 but this result was not significant because the 95 confidence internal of soil ph included 0 fig 8c 4 4 yield and wue of meteorological factors precipitation and temperature are widely recognized as two main factors influencing yield and wue mo et al 2018 yu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 our results indicated that the percentage increase of wue under apri in regions with higher seasonal precipitation 200 mm was significant lower than that with low precipitation 200 mm fig 10b the possible reason can be that higher precipitation caused greater et zheng et al 2019 the yield and wue in regions with average annual temperature 9 c were higher than those with average annual temperature 9 c fig 10c d it was mainly due to that agricultural species planted in regions with low temperature 9 c could extend the growing season length zhang et al 2018 and thus produced large yield and wue greater yield under apri were easier to achieve in regions with higher seasonal precipitation 200 mm while the percentage increase of wue was larger in low precipitation environment 200 mm compared with di fig 11a b the result may be greatly attributed to that apri promoted the lateral root growth cheng et al 2018 2021 which was beneficial to the utilization of soil water and fertilization in low precipitation environment 200 mm wang et al 2010 besides apri reduced the soil water loss by evaporation relative to di thereby increasing yield and wue to some degree the yield and wue under di showed an increasing trend with increasing seasonal precipitation compared to full fig 12a b it indicated that higher yield and wue under di could be more likely to achieve in regions with higher seasonal precipitation 200 mm one possible reason can be that di could avoid the excessive soil saturation in higher precipitation environment which suppressed the root respiration iqbal et al 2011 and affected crop water and fertilizer absorption thereby hindering yield and wue xu et al 2016 4 5 limitations and implications the meta analysis evaluated the effects of different irrigation meteorological and soil factors on yield and wue of seven agricultural species under apri di and full however because of the insufficient data in wue the effects of soil ph on the response of wue to apri di and full could not be side by side compared in addition the response of yield to di compared to full for different soil textures was also not discussed therefore these missing comparisons need to be done in the future in this meta analysis we only investigated the responses of maize wheat cotton potato tomato apple and grape to apri di and full indeed some other varieties also met these criteria but the data were collected from only one or two published papers these seven varieties were studied relatively more than other varieties among the collected literature this meta analysis analyzed the effects of apri di full on yield and wue considering agricultural species group soil texture bulk density ph irrigation method the amount of water applied and the period when apri or di irrigation was undertaken however the frequency of irrigation and fertilization also affected the results thus more factors need to be analyzed to investigate the responses of yield and wue 5 conclusions this meta analysis analyzed the percentage changes of yield and wue of seven agricultural species under apri di and full under different irrigation managements soil properties and meteorological factors overall yield under apri and di were remarkably lower than those under full while the corresponding wue were significantly higher there was no significant difference in yield between apri and di but wue under apri was higher compared with full apri performed better in fruits with irrigation amount of 80 100 full silt loam loam and sand soils with high bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and furrow irrigation besides the response of apri was better in regions with low seasonal precipitation 200 mm and low average annual temperature 9 c compared with full di performed better for clay loam low bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 and higher seasonal precipitation 200 mm compared with di fruits with furrow irrigation and soil with clay and sandy loam were better under apri apri in regions with low average annual temperature 9 c was more likely to increase both yield and wue therefore it is critical to weigh the cost of yield penalty the economic benefit of saving water and the cost of implementing irrigation methods before choosing various

10176,practical solutions to optimise nitrogen use efficiency within modern surface irrigated cotton systems in australia may be possible by regulating the frequency of water and reducing the n applied compared with typical current practises a two year study examined the effect of irrigating at three different water deficits that applied a similar total irrigation volume 60 kpa hf between 80 and 100 kpa if and between 100 and 120 kpa lf for a period from initial flowering throughout boll development in combination with different nitrogen fertiliser rates on the growth yield nitrogen use efficiency and lint quality of cotton it was hypothesised that shorter deficits would increase n uptake and nitrogen use efficiency compared with longer deficits caused by consistently higher soil water potentials in the root zone the major effects of irrigation treatment on growth was to increase plant height and number of bolls delay crop maturity and decrease micronaire the irrigation strategy according to yield was most consistently optimised over both seasons when soil matric potential was maintained between 80 and 100 kpa if treatment lint yield was reduced by 9 13 when the irrigation deficit was 100 kpa the most efficient fertiliser use varied between the two years but was always lowest in the treatment with the highest deficit irrigation deficit did not change nitrogen uptake or internal nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen even at rates substantially lower than typically used commercially did not affect fibre quality there was no interaction between irrigation strategy and n fertiliser rate on yield fibre quality and fertiliser use efficiency keywords surface irrigation irrigation interval water stress fibre length micronaire 1 introduction in recent years plant breeding programmes in australia have continued to introduce high yielding cotton varieties adapted to modern crop management conaty and constable 2020 liu et al 2013 this together with improved irrigation practice and farm management have provided significant commercial yield improvements constable and bange 2015 and increased water use efficiency however rochester and bange 2016 showed that nitrogen application rates were excessive of the economic optimum and over the last decade nitrogen use efficiency nue in the cotton industry has continued to decline rochester and bange 2016 macdonald et al 2017 showed how the application of nitrogen with current irrigation practises is inefficient as it can lead to 15 of the nitrogen fertiliser applied being lost via runoff deep drainage or as gaseous emissions efficient nutrient uptake has been identified as one of the key constraints to reaching high lint yield potentials 3500 kg ha 1 that are possible in current australian cultivars constable and bange 2015 and improvements in nue could be obtained by increasing nitrogen uptake rochester and constable 2015 and reducing environmental losses particularly to the atmosphere through denitrification grace et al 2016 one method of potentially improving plant n uptake which is the main driver of cotton productivity and improving nue is through irrigation management this is because the rate of leaf expansion photosynthesis and fruiting has been identified as being modulated by nitrogen and water use constable and bange 2015 although pre sowing soil and crop tissue analysis are usually used to guide quantities of n applied it is typical for cotton managers to apply excessive rates over and above the economic optimum rate to manage the risk of n and other nutrient deficiency rochester et al 2001 in practise typical yield expectations of 2270 2724 kg ha 1 lint are targeted and n application rates to support this are commonly 284 kg n ha 1 roth and rural 2017 despite the economic optimum for cotton cotton rotations being estimated at 160 kg n ha 1 rochester and bange 2016 in order to obtain high crop yields high n application rates are necessary however crop n uptake has increased by 140 in order to support 40 increases in lint yield from new cultivars over the last three decades which has a major effect on internal nutrient use efficiency rochester and bange 2016 one component of the efficiency of nutrient use in cotton may be the plants ability to transfer nutrients from vegetative to reproductive organs rochester and constable 2015 this growth has also been considered to be affected by irrigation frequency through soil and root water potential improving availability and diffusive transport of nutrients in the root zone and more efficient internal redistribution constable and bange 2015 dodd et al 2015 currently the ability of modern basin level surface irrigation systems are rapidly evolving to provide optimal supply and drainage of field water for plant requirements through improved design delivery of high water supply flow rates and surface irrigation automation north et al 2010 these large scale surface irrigated farming systems offer the potential for irrigation nitrogen application strategies to be optimised more than ever before so that the supply of the inputs is better synchronised with plant demand gonzález dugo et al 2011 preventing excessive accumulation in soils and environmental losses effects of irrigation timing rather than volume and placement have received some attention in relation to soil drying and re wetting applied to alternate wetting and drying and deficit irrigation techniques dodd et al 2015 such studies have tended to prioritise soil nutrient availability from the mineralisation of soil organic matter through the birch effect rather than considering replenishment by supplied fertiliser and understanding how soil water potential enhances mass flow of soil nutrients for example there remains uncertainty on whether differences in xylem phosphate concentration in response to deficit irrigation compared with partial root zone drying resulted from changes in soil nutrient availability or variation in plant nutrient uptake ability caused by root water potential dodd et al 2015 empirical experimental studies in grain sorghum have shown that applying total seasonal amounts of irrigation water that are typical of farmer practise to maximise yield in smaller volume high frequency events rather than fewer large applications resulted in increased plant n uptake biomass and reductions in losses to the atmosphere and leaching jamali et al 2016 similarly daycent simulation modelling has shown that optimised irrigation schedules applying 40 mm water at each event result in maintaining high yields of wheat and cotton with significantly lower losses through nitrous oxide emissions scheer et al 2013 in wheat crops small but frequent irrigations have shown higher productivity and water use efficiency benefits than fewer large application in sandy soils chaudhary and bhatnagar 1977 on the other hand constable and hearn 1981 found that in grey cracking clay soils that are prone to waterlogging irrigation at only 40 available water depletion decreased n uptake of cotton consistently over four consecutive seasons in other crops such as lettuce micro scale irrigation and highly controlled glasshouse experiments have shown that compound fertilisers applied at low concentrations with high irrigation frequency induced a significant increase in yield in model plants silber et al 2003 yield improvement was primarily related to enhancement of nutrient uptake through two main mechanisms i continuous replenishment of nutrients in the root depletion zone and ii enhanced transport of dissolved nutrients by mass flow due to higher averaged water content in the growing medium with the exception of one previous field investigation in cotton in northern nsw australia which reported that irrigation application frequency can be used to increase plant nitrogen uptake baird 2016 no other recent investigations at commercial scale involving large scale surface irrigation and conventional fertiliser placement strategies pre plant and in crop broadcast or side dressed urea have been undertaken the current study aimed to increase knowledge for the optimisation of surface irrigation strategies in combination with new cotton varieties to obtain improvements for farmers in nue whilst maintaining high yield and lint quality so that advances in environmental sustainability as well as productivity can be realised this was undertaken by measuring the growth development yield fibre quality and nue response of a high yielding cotton cultivar grown at commercial scale under furrow irrigation by investigating the effects of i frequency of irrigation high intermediate and low during the period of boll development from first flower for six seven weeks ii nitrogen rates that were reduced compared with current commercial practise and iii any soil moisture deficit nitrogen interactions 2 material and methods 2 1 site characteristics treatments and experimental design the study was conducted during the 2016 17 and 2017 18 cotton growing seasons in a 12 44 ha area of a commercial syphon irrigated farm located in the murrumbidgee valley at darlington point nsw australia 34 38 s 145 54 e more details about the location of the farm can be found in ballester et al 2019 the soil at the site is classified as chromosol isbell 2002 a clay loam soil locally known as a red brown earth selected soil properties of the site at 0 00 0 30 m 0 30 0 60 m and 0 60 0 90 m depth are shown in table 1 the cotton was furrow irrigated with water being applied to the furrows from a head ditch through syphons of 50 mm of internal diameter irrigation water was of good quality throughout the seasons 0 1 ds m 1 the cotton cultivar sicot 746brf was sown on 17 october in 2016 and 3 october in 2017 on beds of 1 8 m width at a plant row spacing of 0 90 m the crop was planted at 18 seeds m 1 and establishment resulted in 10 7 plants m 1 in the 2016 17 growing season and 10 0 plants m 1 in 2017 18 during the 2016 17 season two nitrogen n rates were applied 270 kg n ha 1 n 270 which was the rate applied by the farmer to the rest of the paddock outside the trial and a lower rate of 180 kg n ha 1 n 180 in 2018 higher rates of n were applied than the previous year to align with farmer practise based on consultant advice the increased rate was recommended in order to attempt to improve the congruence between soil supply and crop demand and prevent potential yield decline which is often observed in consecutive cotton rotations rochester and peoples 1998 the n rates applied were 309 kg n ha 1 n 309 and 244 kg n ha 1 n 244 table 2 describes the dates when fertiliser was applied method of application and total amount of n fertiliser applied for each treatment and growing season the different strategies were governed by the study being conducted in a commercial system and working within farm operational logistics the frequencies of irrigation tested high hf intermediate if and low lf were based on soil matric potential readings and were imposed from initial flowering following in crop urea n fertiliser side dressing table 2 for six to seven weeks boll formation soil matric potential is a measure of the force with which water is held by the soil and has been indicated as a suitable technique for scheduling irrigation yadvinder et al 2014 measurements were taken at 0 20 m depth as in kang et al 2012 the hf treatment was irrigated weekly to maintain the soil matric potential 60 kpa in the if and lf treatments irrigation was triggered at values between 80 and 100 kpa and 100 and 120 kpa respectively in all cases irrigation was applied until water in the furrows reached the top of the beds at the drainage end of the site when the imposition of irrigation treatments was initiated there were no statistically significant differences in plant growth parameters the average plant height was 0 49 0 07 m on 11 january and 0 45 0 04 m on 4 january in the first and second growing season respectively the number of nodes at that time was 17 3 1 4 in 2017 and 18 0 1 4 in 2018 when irrigation treatments ended in late february all the plots were irrigated simultaneously after this the final irrigation was applied to all the treatments on the same date with the exception of the lf treatment in 2018 when due to the maturity of the crop this treatment was irrigated for the last time on 28 february while the hf and if treatments received the final irrigation on 19 march treatments were distributed in a split plot design with irrigation as the main plot factor replicated three times nine main plots in total and n rates as subplots fig 1 main plots had an area of 1 38 ha and consisted of 24 plant rows 12 beds of which 16 rows received the highest n rate applied within each growing season n 270 and n 309 the first and second seasons respectively and the remaining eight rows the lowest n rate n 180 and n 244 application of growth regulators pest and disease control was managed as commercial practise defoliant was applied according to treatment before harvest as per consultant agronomist recommendations 2 2 meteorological conditions an on site weather station was used to monitor the meteorological conditions during the study fig 2 depicts daily reference evapotranspiration eto rainfall and minimum maximum and average air temperature during the 2016 17 and 2017 18 growing seasons from mid november to mid may both seasons were similar in terms of eto and rainfall during the first season of study total eto and rainfall were 1387 mm and 95 4 mm respectively from planting to harvest the crop accumulated 2180 growth degree days gdd base 12 c according to the day degree calculator tool provided by cotton seed distributors https www csd net au ddc minimum daily air temperatures 11 c can cause chilling injury cold shock and delay the development of cotton hearn and constable 1984 hot conditions maximum daily air temperature 36 c have also heat stress implications for cotton yield and quality in the 2016 17 cotton growing season there were 70 cold shock days 26 from emergence to first flower and 34 heat stress days in the 2017 18 growing season total eto was 1380 mm and 108 8 mm of rainfall were recorded during this season the crop accumulated 2483 gdd 303 gdd more than in the previous season and there were 48 cold shock days 19 from emergence to first flower and 44 heat stress days 2 3 soil moisture soil matric potential was continuously monitored in one main plot of each irrigation treatment during both seasons using watermark sensors model 200ss irrometer company inc california usa sensors were installed in both n rate subplots see fig 1 in pairs in the plant line and at 0 20 m below the soil surface the average of the matric potential from the two sensors in each plot was used to manage the irrigation treatments according to the threshold values multisensor capacitance probes ep100g 12 entelechy pty ltd golden grove sa australia with moisture sensors at 0 10 m intervals along the length of the probe 1 20 m long were installed in one plot of each irrigation treatment six probes in total close to the watermark sensors the capacitance probe readings are influenced by the soil type bosch 2004 and without proper calibration can thus provide different readings for the same soil water content martínez gimeno et al 2020 field calibration protocols under wet moist and dry conditions are not recommended for soils with a high clay content and a moderate to high shrink swell potential provenzano et al 2016 such as the soil of the current study because of this the capacitance probes were used to monitor the root activity to a depth of 0 95 m in each of the irrigation treatments and assess the relative differences in amount of water applied rather than for irrigation scheduling purposes relative soil water content for each treatment was calculated considering the maximum values measured by each sensor during the growing season readings from the soil matric potential sensors and capacitance probes were temporarily stored in wifield loggers goanna telemetry goondiwindi qld australia which periodically sent data to a cloud based data storage processing and internet interface in real time brinkhoff et al 2017 2 4 plant determinations plants from one metre row were cut at the cotyledons and collected from all the subplots immediately prior to first chemical defoliation plant height number of nodes and number of bolls were determined plant material was dried at 70 c to constant weight finely ground and analysed using a leco cns 2000 analyzer leco corp st joseph mi to obtain n concentration total plant n uptake was obtained by multiplying dry matter by plant n concentration 2 5 maturity yield and fibre quality days from planting to the date when 60 of the harvestable bolls were opened was calculated for each plot by linear interpolation to determine maturity according to gwathmey et al 2016 the percentage of open bolls was monitored in plants from two metre row at three locations south middle and north of the site within each subplot 12 metre row per irrigation plot from march to may at harvest each plot was mechanically harvested into round modules and each module was electronically weighed the modules were ginned commercially rivcot carrathool nsw and lint yield and cottonseed yield was determined lint samples were taken from each subplot n 18 and sent to a commercial classing laboratory proclass griffith nsw australia for fibre quality assessment using a uster hvi 1000 high volume instrument uster technologies inc knoxville tn among a suite of fibre quality parameters assessed only the results of the fibre length and micronaire are discussed since these were the only parameters in which treatments had a clear effect 2 6 nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency nue was assessed by determining the internal crop nue inue lint yield divided by total n uptake and the n fertiliser use efficiency nfue lint yield per kg of fertiliser n applied according to rochester 2014 2 7 statistical analysis a two way mixed analyses of variance anova model was used in spss v 24 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa to examine the interactions between irrigation frequency and nitrogen rates on any of the parameters assessed the assumptions considered were i there were no outliers ii data followed a normal distribution and iii there was equality of variances between groups outliers were checked via the studentized residuals values 3 standard deviations the assumption of normality was checked by means of the shapiro wilk test of normality the levene s test was used to test the assumption of homogeneity of variances when there was a two way interaction the effects of the between subjects factor irrigation at every level of the within subjects factor fertiliser n rates was investigated by means of the glm univariate procedure significant differences between irrigation treatments was tested using the tukey s honest significant difference post hoc test at a significance level of 0 05 3 results irrigation was applied within the targeted soil matric potential values for each treatment fig 3 although lower values drier soil were obtained in the last two irrigations of all the treatments during the second season of study in the 2016 17 season to meet targeted threshold values the hf treatment received eight irrigation events during the period when treatments were imposed the if treatment received four irrigation events and the lf treatment received three irrigations in the 2017 18 growing season and for the period when irrigation treatments were imposed the hf if and lf treatments received six four and three irrigation events respectively fig 3 while the multisensor capacitance probes were not calibrated for the specific soil of the site and absolute values cannot be considered accurate for computing the amount of water applied to each treatment these data were useful for comparative purposes according to the probes there were not great differences in the amount of water applied to the treatments over the 2016 17 growing season 3 7 this was also the case for the hf and if treatments in the 2017 18 growing season when the latter received 10 less water than the most frequently irrigated treatment hf during this season however the lf treatment missed the final irrigation event that occurred on 19 march 2018 for the hf and if treatments because it had already reached maturity consequently greater differences were observed at this time in the amount of water applied relative to the hf and if treatments 26 7 and 18 3 respectively according to the capacitance probes plants within all treatments extracted water from a maximum depth of 0 75 0 90 m in the soil profile fig 4 this however occurred earlier in the season for the if treatment in the 2016 17 growing season and in the lf treatment in both seasons than in the hf treatment 3 1 plant growth and development and n uptake by defoliation plants from the hf treatment in 2017 had significantly greater height number of nodes and number of total fruit positions than the if and lf treatments the hf treatment had significantly p 0 01 lower number of bolls per metre than the lf treatment but differences with if were not statistically significant differences in dry mass between irrigation treatments were not statistically significant table 3 the n 270 treatment had significantly p 0 05 greater plant height number of nodes number of total positions and number of bolls than n 180 n uptake was neither significantly affected by the n fertiliser rate nor the irrigation treatments no differences were observed in thee first season among irrigation treatments and between n rates in the ratio of the boll dry mass to the aboveground dry mass in the 2017 18 growing season at defoliation plants from the hf treatment had significantly greater plant height number of total fruit positions and number of bolls per metre however the ratio of the boll dry mass to the aboveground dry mass was lower than in the lf and if treatments table 4 the highest n fertiliser rate n 309 had significantly greater plant height and number of nodes but significantly lower ratio of the boll dry mass to the aboveground dry mass than the n 244 treatment table 4 there were no statistically significant differences in n uptake among the irrigation treatments and between the n fertiliser rates which on average for all the plots was higher than in the previous season 317 1 44 8 kg n ha 1 3 2 maturity irrigation frequency had a significant p 0 001 effect on maturity in both years of study tables 3 and 4 in the 2016 17 season the hf and if treatments delayed maturity with respect to the if and lf treatments seven and five days respectively in practice the crop was commercially harvested on 04 may 2017 in the lf treatment and seven days later in the if treatment harvest in the hf treatment was delayed until 30 may 2017 due to rain illustrating the risk of high frequency irrigation on delayed maturity and exposure to undesired weather events in the second growing season the hf and if treatments significantly delayed maturity on average 10 and 9 days with respect to the lf treatment table 4 during this season the lf treatment was harvested on 30 april 2018 and the if and hf treatments were harvested eight days later neither the nitrogen rate treatments nor the interaction of these with the irrigation treatments had a statistically significant effect on maturity in any of the two growing seasons 3 3 yield and fibre quality in the 2016 17 growing season lint yield ranged between 1726 kg ha 1 and 2376 kg ha 1 the irrigation treatments had a statistically significant effect on lint yield but not the n fertiliser rates table 3 lint yield in the lf treatment was significantly reduced on average by 13 8 compared with the hf treatment respectively no statistically significant differences were observed in lint yield between the if treatment and the hf and lf treatments both crop micronaire and fibre length were significantly affected by the irrigation treatments table 5 greater irrigation deficits increased micronaire while the opposite was observed for fibre length despite the field being in the third season of continuous cotton lint yield was higher p 0 001 than the previous season ranging between 2115 and 2548 kg ha 1 table 4 lint yield in the if treatment was in this case significantly higher than in the hf and the lf treatments the n fertiliser rate did not influence lint yield similar to that observed in the 2016 17 season crop micronaire significantly increased with greater moisture deficits table 5 however no differences in fibre length were observed between irrigation treatments during this season 3 4 n use efficiency the inue was not significantly affected by the irrigation frequency and n fertiliser rates fig 5 on average for all the plots inue was 9 51 0 70 kg lint kg n 1 in the 2016 17 season and lower 7 43 1 05 kg lint kg n 1 in 2017 18 the nfue was significantly affected by the irrigation treatments in both growing seasons fig 5 in the 2016 17 growing season the hf treatment had significantly p 0 05 higher nfue than the lf treatment while no differences in nfue were observed between the hf and if treatments the second growing season however the if treatment had the highest nfue with statistically significant differences with respect to both the hf and lf treatments 4 discussion this work tested whether nitrogen use efficiency could be improved by applying high intermediate or low frequency of irrigation in combination with n fertiliser rates that were lower than typically recommended for expected commercial yields from irrigated cotton grown in southern nsw australia all the treatments produced lint yields that are within commercial expectations abares 2019 the if treatment with fertiliser n rates that were 60 90 kg n ha 1 lower than farmer practise was the strategy that used the applied n fertiliser most efficiently to produce lint this result supports the findings of rochester 2012 that a substantial proportion of n that is taken up by cotton crops is soil derived n and that only between 20 and 60 of applied fertiliser n is recovered by the cotton plant depending on soil fertility and preceding crops monitoring soil water tension at 0 20 m depth was effective for scheduling irrigation differently in the irrigation treatments results from this study show that different thresholds of soil water tension can be set up for cotton production depending on the final objective pursued of either maximising crop profitability or seeking advantages from an advanced or earlier maturing crop as discussed later in this section soil moisture forecast techniques such as those explored in brinkhoff et al 2019 could be used as a guide for operators of farms to make all the arrangements needed and have water available for irrigation at the right time in advance of irrigation water needs while currently soil water potential in commercial farms is obtained from point source measurements other methods capable of capturing the spatial variability in soil moisture within fields such as the use of canopy spectral reflectance measurements panigrahi and das 2018 are being explored as more advantageous methodologies for the future the greater soil water depletion in the 0 75 0 95 m soil profile in treatments if and lf than in the weekly irrigated treatment fig 4 would suggest that root system development was promoted in plants from the if and lf treatments to get access to water at deeper soil layers than in the hf treatment as has been reported for cotton under moderate water deficit conditions ullah et al 2017 root growth promotion in the if and lf treatments may have been at the expense of reducing shoot growth particularly in the 2016 17 growing season tables 3 and 4 as generally observed in plants in response to water deficiency hsiao and xu 2000 this was most likely caused by moderate cyclic water stress occurring in the if and particularly the lf treatments as indicated by stomatal conductance measurements reductions of up to 47 in the lf treatment compared to hf performed in this site and reported elsewhere ballester et al 2019 in agreement with studies dealing with the effects of frequency of irrigation and water deficit on cotton performance gwathmey et al 2011 hunsaker et al 1998 pettigrew 2004 more frequent irrigation events had a delaying effect on crop maturity over the two years of study maturity in the hf and if treatments was delayed 7 10 days and 5 9 days respectively compared to the lf treatment however the reduction in crop duration obtained through the lf practise occurred at the expense of significantly reducing lint yield in both growing seasons 13 8 in 2017 and 8 5 in 2018 compared with the treatment with the highest lint yield the associated yield penalty in the lf strategy should be considered in view of any advantages from earlier maturity in association with weather or operational logistics such as relatively early ginning within the region as well as subsequent preparation for winter cropping opportunity for example in the first season of study rainfall events occurring at the end of the cotton season delayed harvest date in the hf treatment 26 days compared with the lf treatment which was ready to harvest before adverse weather conditions typical of autumn occurred the fact that the if and lf treatments had different effects on lint yield in each growing season compared to the hf strategy could be related with the imposition of the irrigation treatments occurring earlier in the 2016 17 growing season than in 2017 18 for example while all of the days that reached maximum air temperatures 40 0 c nine days in total occurred during the period of imposition of the irrigation treatments in the 2016 17 growing season seven out of 15 days with maximum temperatures over 40 0 c occurred before treatments were imposed in 2018 in the first growing season the weekly irrigated treatment hf could have offset high temperatures reached in these very hot days heat stress days while it did not always in the second moreover although irrigation according to treatments began from 10th january and 16th january in the first and second growing season respectively gdd at that time were 871 in 2017 and 1170 in the 2018 according to the growth targets obtained with the day degree calculator tool this would suggest that phenologically irrigation treatments were imposed six days before the crop was at first flower stage in the 2016 17 growing season while 19 days after in the 2017 18 growing season treatments with higher n uptake in this study tended to have a higher lint yield similar to the observations of rochester 2007 however the different irrigation deficits and n rates did not dramatically alter plant n uptake in the first year there may be considered to be some response according to the irrigation deficit on inue the amount of lint produced relative to the amount of n that was taken up by the crop fig 5a however the results were insignificant in the second year of the study crop n uptake was beyond 300 kg n ha 1 suggesting luxury uptake of n in all the treatments and reducing inue to less than 8 kg n kg 1 this indicated the crop took up more n than required to produce the achieved yields and therefore was probably over supplied with n overall no significant differences were observed in inue across treatments and therefore n uptake was not the limiting factor to yield although there was no difference in the dry mass between the different irrigation strategies tables 3 and 4 patterns in plant height and number of nodes indicated increased productivity with more frequent irrigation which may hint towards changes in the internal distribution of nutrients rochester and constable 2015 however this requires further substantiation since the inue did not indicate this boll mass dry mass ratio was unchanged and lint yield did not provide consistent delineation according to deficit the nfue on the other hand was affected by the irrigation treatments through their effect on yield treatments that produced the highest yields had the highest nfue within each growing season however the increase in lint yield observed in the treatments fertilised with the highest n rate did not compensate for the extra n fertiliser applied and resulted in significantly lower nfue than in the reduced n fertiliser rate within each season fig 5 in this scenario with an average nfue of 11 6 and 9 9 kg lint kg n 1 in the first and second growing seasons respectively the standard practise with a reduced rate of n fertiliser was the most efficient treatment in this study nevertheless and as commonly found for the cotton farms in the murray darling basin these values of nfue and inue were lower than the economic optimum for inue 12 4 0 4 kg lint kg n 1 and nfue 13 18 kg lint kg n 1 defined by rochester 2011 and rochester 2014 for high yielding irrigated cotton crops in australia the low efficiency observed in this study was most likely because of the seasonal conditions that lowered the potential yields the fact that fertiliser n rates applied were not reduced accordingly and that furrow irrigation is the irrigation system that offers the lowest nfue within the cotton industry macdonald et al 2018 fibre quality parameters were affected by the frequency of irrigation with micronaire being more sensitive than fibre length only the lf treatment significantly reduced fibre length compared to the hf in the 2016 17 growing season when the lowest percentage of soil water content was reached between irrigation events see fig 4 this was likely caused by the fibre elongation period being shortened through high temperatures and water stress this is in contrast to no negative quality effects observed in the if treatment over the two seasons of study even in the lf treatment in the 2017 18 growing season conditions were not apparently extreme enough to detrimentally affect fibre length contrary to the fibre length micronaire significantly increased with less frequent irrigations and a greater soil water deficit in both growing seasons possibly caused by earlier maturation table 4 water deficit has been reported to increase micronaire lokhande and reddy 2014 but also decrease it when plants experience prolonged or severe water stress bradow and davidonis 2000 in the study presented here micronaire values in the hf treatment were the lowest in both seasons most likely caused by low maturity of upper bolls table 4 and incurred penalty discounts in the second season of study when values fell outside the fibre quality range required by cotton processors 3 5 4 9 5 conclusion this paper provides data on the effects of three different irrigation deficits interacted with two different n fertiliser rates in a short season large commercial scale field trial conducted on furrow irrigated high yielding cotton on a chromosol soil the if treatment with fertiliser n rates that were 60 90 kg n ha 1 lower than farmer practise similar to what has been specified as the economic optimum for current australian cultivars was the strategy with the greatest nitrogen use efficiency and did not compromise yield or fibre quality irrigation deficits singularly had no effect on plant n uptake or inue suggesting that in this case maintaining higher soil water potential than is usually practised did not facilitate changes to nutrient uptake mechanisms through soil diffusion nor significantly improve the plant internal distribution of nitrogen to the extent of affecting plant growth irrigation at soil water tension below 100 kpa during boll formation increased yield but delayed crop maturity by up to 10 days which caused decreased micronaire to the point of price deductions therefore yield potential obtained through prolonging the period to cutout needs to be balanced in this short growing season region against disadvantages that can occur with fibre quality caused by immaturity autumnal weather and shortening day length at harvesting as well as delaying timely ginning and preparation for subsequent winter crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

10176,practical solutions to optimise nitrogen use efficiency within modern surface irrigated cotton systems in australia may be possible by regulating the frequency of water and reducing the n applied compared with typical current practises a two year study examined the effect of irrigating at three different water deficits that applied a similar total irrigation volume 60 kpa hf between 80 and 100 kpa if and between 100 and 120 kpa lf for a period from initial flowering throughout boll development in combination with different nitrogen fertiliser rates on the growth yield nitrogen use efficiency and lint quality of cotton it was hypothesised that shorter deficits would increase n uptake and nitrogen use efficiency compared with longer deficits caused by consistently higher soil water potentials in the root zone the major effects of irrigation treatment on growth was to increase plant height and number of bolls delay crop maturity and decrease micronaire the irrigation strategy according to yield was most consistently optimised over both seasons when soil matric potential was maintained between 80 and 100 kpa if treatment lint yield was reduced by 9 13 when the irrigation deficit was 100 kpa the most efficient fertiliser use varied between the two years but was always lowest in the treatment with the highest deficit irrigation deficit did not change nitrogen uptake or internal nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen even at rates substantially lower than typically used commercially did not affect fibre quality there was no interaction between irrigation strategy and n fertiliser rate on yield fibre quality and fertiliser use efficiency keywords surface irrigation irrigation interval water stress fibre length micronaire 1 introduction in recent years plant breeding programmes in australia have continued to introduce high yielding cotton varieties adapted to modern crop management conaty and constable 2020 liu et al 2013 this together with improved irrigation practice and farm management have provided significant commercial yield improvements constable and bange 2015 and increased water use efficiency however rochester and bange 2016 showed that nitrogen application rates were excessive of the economic optimum and over the last decade nitrogen use efficiency nue in the cotton industry has continued to decline rochester and bange 2016 macdonald et al 2017 showed how the application of nitrogen with current irrigation practises is inefficient as it can lead to 15 of the nitrogen fertiliser applied being lost via runoff deep drainage or as gaseous emissions efficient nutrient uptake has been identified as one of the key constraints to reaching high lint yield potentials 3500 kg ha 1 that are possible in current australian cultivars constable and bange 2015 and improvements in nue could be obtained by increasing nitrogen uptake rochester and constable 2015 and reducing environmental losses particularly to the atmosphere through denitrification grace et al 2016 one method of potentially improving plant n uptake which is the main driver of cotton productivity and improving nue is through irrigation management this is because the rate of leaf expansion photosynthesis and fruiting has been identified as being modulated by nitrogen and water use constable and bange 2015 although pre sowing soil and crop tissue analysis are usually used to guide quantities of n applied it is typical for cotton managers to apply excessive rates over and above the economic optimum rate to manage the risk of n and other nutrient deficiency rochester et al 2001 in practise typical yield expectations of 2270 2724 kg ha 1 lint are targeted and n application rates to support this are commonly 284 kg n ha 1 roth and rural 2017 despite the economic optimum for cotton cotton rotations being estimated at 160 kg n ha 1 rochester and bange 2016 in order to obtain high crop yields high n application rates are necessary however crop n uptake has increased by 140 in order to support 40 increases in lint yield from new cultivars over the last three decades which has a major effect on internal nutrient use efficiency rochester and bange 2016 one component of the efficiency of nutrient use in cotton may be the plants ability to transfer nutrients from vegetative to reproductive organs rochester and constable 2015 this growth has also been considered to be affected by irrigation frequency through soil and root water potential improving availability and diffusive transport of nutrients in the root zone and more efficient internal redistribution constable and bange 2015 dodd et al 2015 currently the ability of modern basin level surface irrigation systems are rapidly evolving to provide optimal supply and drainage of field water for plant requirements through improved design delivery of high water supply flow rates and surface irrigation automation north et al 2010 these large scale surface irrigated farming systems offer the potential for irrigation nitrogen application strategies to be optimised more than ever before so that the supply of the inputs is better synchronised with plant demand gonzález dugo et al 2011 preventing excessive accumulation in soils and environmental losses effects of irrigation timing rather than volume and placement have received some attention in relation to soil drying and re wetting applied to alternate wetting and drying and deficit irrigation techniques dodd et al 2015 such studies have tended to prioritise soil nutrient availability from the mineralisation of soil organic matter through the birch effect rather than considering replenishment by supplied fertiliser and understanding how soil water potential enhances mass flow of soil nutrients for example there remains uncertainty on whether differences in xylem phosphate concentration in response to deficit irrigation compared with partial root zone drying resulted from changes in soil nutrient availability or variation in plant nutrient uptake ability caused by root water potential dodd et al 2015 empirical experimental studies in grain sorghum have shown that applying total seasonal amounts of irrigation water that are typical of farmer practise to maximise yield in smaller volume high frequency events rather than fewer large applications resulted in increased plant n uptake biomass and reductions in losses to the atmosphere and leaching jamali et al 2016 similarly daycent simulation modelling has shown that optimised irrigation schedules applying 40 mm water at each event result in maintaining high yields of wheat and cotton with significantly lower losses through nitrous oxide emissions scheer et al 2013 in wheat crops small but frequent irrigations have shown higher productivity and water use efficiency benefits than fewer large application in sandy soils chaudhary and bhatnagar 1977 on the other hand constable and hearn 1981 found that in grey cracking clay soils that are prone to waterlogging irrigation at only 40 available water depletion decreased n uptake of cotton consistently over four consecutive seasons in other crops such as lettuce micro scale irrigation and highly controlled glasshouse experiments have shown that compound fertilisers applied at low concentrations with high irrigation frequency induced a significant increase in yield in model plants silber et al 2003 yield improvement was primarily related to enhancement of nutrient uptake through two main mechanisms i continuous replenishment of nutrients in the root depletion zone and ii enhanced transport of dissolved nutrients by mass flow due to higher averaged water content in the growing medium with the exception of one previous field investigation in cotton in northern nsw australia which reported that irrigation application frequency can be used to increase plant nitrogen uptake baird 2016 no other recent investigations at commercial scale involving large scale surface irrigation and conventional fertiliser placement strategies pre plant and in crop broadcast or side dressed urea have been undertaken the current study aimed to increase knowledge for the optimisation of surface irrigation strategies in combination with new cotton varieties to obtain improvements for farmers in nue whilst maintaining high yield and lint quality so that advances in environmental sustainability as well as productivity can be realised this was undertaken by measuring the growth development yield fibre quality and nue response of a high yielding cotton cultivar grown at commercial scale under furrow irrigation by investigating the effects of i frequency of irrigation high intermediate and low during the period of boll development from first flower for six seven weeks ii nitrogen rates that were reduced compared with current commercial practise and iii any soil moisture deficit nitrogen interactions 2 material and methods 2 1 site characteristics treatments and experimental design the study was conducted during the 2016 17 and 2017 18 cotton growing seasons in a 12 44 ha area of a commercial syphon irrigated farm located in the murrumbidgee valley at darlington point nsw australia 34 38 s 145 54 e more details about the location of the farm can be found in ballester et al 2019 the soil at the site is classified as chromosol isbell 2002 a clay loam soil locally known as a red brown earth selected soil properties of the site at 0 00 0 30 m 0 30 0 60 m and 0 60 0 90 m depth are shown in table 1 the cotton was furrow irrigated with water being applied to the furrows from a head ditch through syphons of 50 mm of internal diameter irrigation water was of good quality throughout the seasons 0 1 ds m 1 the cotton cultivar sicot 746brf was sown on 17 october in 2016 and 3 october in 2017 on beds of 1 8 m width at a plant row spacing of 0 90 m the crop was planted at 18 seeds m 1 and establishment resulted in 10 7 plants m 1 in the 2016 17 growing season and 10 0 plants m 1 in 2017 18 during the 2016 17 season two nitrogen n rates were applied 270 kg n ha 1 n 270 which was the rate applied by the farmer to the rest of the paddock outside the trial and a lower rate of 180 kg n ha 1 n 180 in 2018 higher rates of n were applied than the previous year to align with farmer practise based on consultant advice the increased rate was recommended in order to attempt to improve the congruence between soil supply and crop demand and prevent potential yield decline which is often observed in consecutive cotton rotations rochester and peoples 1998 the n rates applied were 309 kg n ha 1 n 309 and 244 kg n ha 1 n 244 table 2 describes the dates when fertiliser was applied method of application and total amount of n fertiliser applied for each treatment and growing season the different strategies were governed by the study being conducted in a commercial system and working within farm operational logistics the frequencies of irrigation tested high hf intermediate if and low lf were based on soil matric potential readings and were imposed from initial flowering following in crop urea n fertiliser side dressing table 2 for six to seven weeks boll formation soil matric potential is a measure of the force with which water is held by the soil and has been indicated as a suitable technique for scheduling irrigation yadvinder et al 2014 measurements were taken at 0 20 m depth as in kang et al 2012 the hf treatment was irrigated weekly to maintain the soil matric potential 60 kpa in the if and lf treatments irrigation was triggered at values between 80 and 100 kpa and 100 and 120 kpa respectively in all cases irrigation was applied until water in the furrows reached the top of the beds at the drainage end of the site when the imposition of irrigation treatments was initiated there were no statistically significant differences in plant growth parameters the average plant height was 0 49 0 07 m on 11 january and 0 45 0 04 m on 4 january in the first and second growing season respectively the number of nodes at that time was 17 3 1 4 in 2017 and 18 0 1 4 in 2018 when irrigation treatments ended in late february all the plots were irrigated simultaneously after this the final irrigation was applied to all the treatments on the same date with the exception of the lf treatment in 2018 when due to the maturity of the crop this treatment was irrigated for the last time on 28 february while the hf and if treatments received the final irrigation on 19 march treatments were distributed in a split plot design with irrigation as the main plot factor replicated three times nine main plots in total and n rates as subplots fig 1 main plots had an area of 1 38 ha and consisted of 24 plant rows 12 beds of which 16 rows received the highest n rate applied within each growing season n 270 and n 309 the first and second seasons respectively and the remaining eight rows the lowest n rate n 180 and n 244 application of growth regulators pest and disease control was managed as commercial practise defoliant was applied according to treatment before harvest as per consultant agronomist recommendations 2 2 meteorological conditions an on site weather station was used to monitor the meteorological conditions during the study fig 2 depicts daily reference evapotranspiration eto rainfall and minimum maximum and average air temperature during the 2016 17 and 2017 18 growing seasons from mid november to mid may both seasons were similar in terms of eto and rainfall during the first season of study total eto and rainfall were 1387 mm and 95 4 mm respectively from planting to harvest the crop accumulated 2180 growth degree days gdd base 12 c according to the day degree calculator tool provided by cotton seed distributors https www csd net au ddc minimum daily air temperatures 11 c can cause chilling injury cold shock and delay the development of cotton hearn and constable 1984 hot conditions maximum daily air temperature 36 c have also heat stress implications for cotton yield and quality in the 2016 17 cotton growing season there were 70 cold shock days 26 from emergence to first flower and 34 heat stress days in the 2017 18 growing season total eto was 1380 mm and 108 8 mm of rainfall were recorded during this season the crop accumulated 2483 gdd 303 gdd more than in the previous season and there were 48 cold shock days 19 from emergence to first flower and 44 heat stress days 2 3 soil moisture soil matric potential was continuously monitored in one main plot of each irrigation treatment during both seasons using watermark sensors model 200ss irrometer company inc california usa sensors were installed in both n rate subplots see fig 1 in pairs in the plant line and at 0 20 m below the soil surface the average of the matric potential from the two sensors in each plot was used to manage the irrigation treatments according to the threshold values multisensor capacitance probes ep100g 12 entelechy pty ltd golden grove sa australia with moisture sensors at 0 10 m intervals along the length of the probe 1 20 m long were installed in one plot of each irrigation treatment six probes in total close to the watermark sensors the capacitance probe readings are influenced by the soil type bosch 2004 and without proper calibration can thus provide different readings for the same soil water content martínez gimeno et al 2020 field calibration protocols under wet moist and dry conditions are not recommended for soils with a high clay content and a moderate to high shrink swell potential provenzano et al 2016 such as the soil of the current study because of this the capacitance probes were used to monitor the root activity to a depth of 0 95 m in each of the irrigation treatments and assess the relative differences in amount of water applied rather than for irrigation scheduling purposes relative soil water content for each treatment was calculated considering the maximum values measured by each sensor during the growing season readings from the soil matric potential sensors and capacitance probes were temporarily stored in wifield loggers goanna telemetry goondiwindi qld australia which periodically sent data to a cloud based data storage processing and internet interface in real time brinkhoff et al 2017 2 4 plant determinations plants from one metre row were cut at the cotyledons and collected from all the subplots immediately prior to first chemical defoliation plant height number of nodes and number of bolls were determined plant material was dried at 70 c to constant weight finely ground and analysed using a leco cns 2000 analyzer leco corp st joseph mi to obtain n concentration total plant n uptake was obtained by multiplying dry matter by plant n concentration 2 5 maturity yield and fibre quality days from planting to the date when 60 of the harvestable bolls were opened was calculated for each plot by linear interpolation to determine maturity according to gwathmey et al 2016 the percentage of open bolls was monitored in plants from two metre row at three locations south middle and north of the site within each subplot 12 metre row per irrigation plot from march to may at harvest each plot was mechanically harvested into round modules and each module was electronically weighed the modules were ginned commercially rivcot carrathool nsw and lint yield and cottonseed yield was determined lint samples were taken from each subplot n 18 and sent to a commercial classing laboratory proclass griffith nsw australia for fibre quality assessment using a uster hvi 1000 high volume instrument uster technologies inc knoxville tn among a suite of fibre quality parameters assessed only the results of the fibre length and micronaire are discussed since these were the only parameters in which treatments had a clear effect 2 6 nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency nue was assessed by determining the internal crop nue inue lint yield divided by total n uptake and the n fertiliser use efficiency nfue lint yield per kg of fertiliser n applied according to rochester 2014 2 7 statistical analysis a two way mixed analyses of variance anova model was used in spss v 24 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa to examine the interactions between irrigation frequency and nitrogen rates on any of the parameters assessed the assumptions considered were i there were no outliers ii data followed a normal distribution and iii there was equality of variances between groups outliers were checked via the studentized residuals values 3 standard deviations the assumption of normality was checked by means of the shapiro wilk test of normality the levene s test was used to test the assumption of homogeneity of variances when there was a two way interaction the effects of the between subjects factor irrigation at every level of the within subjects factor fertiliser n rates was investigated by means of the glm univariate procedure significant differences between irrigation treatments was tested using the tukey s honest significant difference post hoc test at a significance level of 0 05 3 results irrigation was applied within the targeted soil matric potential values for each treatment fig 3 although lower values drier soil were obtained in the last two irrigations of all the treatments during the second season of study in the 2016 17 season to meet targeted threshold values the hf treatment received eight irrigation events during the period when treatments were imposed the if treatment received four irrigation events and the lf treatment received three irrigations in the 2017 18 growing season and for the period when irrigation treatments were imposed the hf if and lf treatments received six four and three irrigation events respectively fig 3 while the multisensor capacitance probes were not calibrated for the specific soil of the site and absolute values cannot be considered accurate for computing the amount of water applied to each treatment these data were useful for comparative purposes according to the probes there were not great differences in the amount of water applied to the treatments over the 2016 17 growing season 3 7 this was also the case for the hf and if treatments in the 2017 18 growing season when the latter received 10 less water than the most frequently irrigated treatment hf during this season however the lf treatment missed the final irrigation event that occurred on 19 march 2018 for the hf and if treatments because it had already reached maturity consequently greater differences were observed at this time in the amount of water applied relative to the hf and if treatments 26 7 and 18 3 respectively according to the capacitance probes plants within all treatments extracted water from a maximum depth of 0 75 0 90 m in the soil profile fig 4 this however occurred earlier in the season for the if treatment in the 2016 17 growing season and in the lf treatment in both seasons than in the hf treatment 3 1 plant growth and development and n uptake by defoliation plants from the hf treatment in 2017 had significantly greater height number of nodes and number of total fruit positions than the if and lf treatments the hf treatment had significantly p 0 01 lower number of bolls per metre than the lf treatment but differences with if were not statistically significant differences in dry mass between irrigation treatments were not statistically significant table 3 the n 270 treatment had significantly p 0 05 greater plant height number of nodes number of total positions and number of bolls than n 180 n uptake was neither significantly affected by the n fertiliser rate nor the irrigation treatments no differences were observed in thee first season among irrigation treatments and between n rates in the ratio of the boll dry mass to the aboveground dry mass in the 2017 18 growing season at defoliation plants from the hf treatment had significantly greater plant height number of total fruit positions and number of bolls per metre however the ratio of the boll dry mass to the aboveground dry mass was lower than in the lf and if treatments table 4 the highest n fertiliser rate n 309 had significantly greater plant height and number of nodes but significantly lower ratio of the boll dry mass to the aboveground dry mass than the n 244 treatment table 4 there were no statistically significant differences in n uptake among the irrigation treatments and between the n fertiliser rates which on average for all the plots was higher than in the previous season 317 1 44 8 kg n ha 1 3 2 maturity irrigation frequency had a significant p 0 001 effect on maturity in both years of study tables 3 and 4 in the 2016 17 season the hf and if treatments delayed maturity with respect to the if and lf treatments seven and five days respectively in practice the crop was commercially harvested on 04 may 2017 in the lf treatment and seven days later in the if treatment harvest in the hf treatment was delayed until 30 may 2017 due to rain illustrating the risk of high frequency irrigation on delayed maturity and exposure to undesired weather events in the second growing season the hf and if treatments significantly delayed maturity on average 10 and 9 days with respect to the lf treatment table 4 during this season the lf treatment was harvested on 30 april 2018 and the if and hf treatments were harvested eight days later neither the nitrogen rate treatments nor the interaction of these with the irrigation treatments had a statistically significant effect on maturity in any of the two growing seasons 3 3 yield and fibre quality in the 2016 17 growing season lint yield ranged between 1726 kg ha 1 and 2376 kg ha 1 the irrigation treatments had a statistically significant effect on lint yield but not the n fertiliser rates table 3 lint yield in the lf treatment was significantly reduced on average by 13 8 compared with the hf treatment respectively no statistically significant differences were observed in lint yield between the if treatment and the hf and lf treatments both crop micronaire and fibre length were significantly affected by the irrigation treatments table 5 greater irrigation deficits increased micronaire while the opposite was observed for fibre length despite the field being in the third season of continuous cotton lint yield was higher p 0 001 than the previous season ranging between 2115 and 2548 kg ha 1 table 4 lint yield in the if treatment was in this case significantly higher than in the hf and the lf treatments the n fertiliser rate did not influence lint yield similar to that observed in the 2016 17 season crop micronaire significantly increased with greater moisture deficits table 5 however no differences in fibre length were observed between irrigation treatments during this season 3 4 n use efficiency the inue was not significantly affected by the irrigation frequency and n fertiliser rates fig 5 on average for all the plots inue was 9 51 0 70 kg lint kg n 1 in the 2016 17 season and lower 7 43 1 05 kg lint kg n 1 in 2017 18 the nfue was significantly affected by the irrigation treatments in both growing seasons fig 5 in the 2016 17 growing season the hf treatment had significantly p 0 05 higher nfue than the lf treatment while no differences in nfue were observed between the hf and if treatments the second growing season however the if treatment had the highest nfue with statistically significant differences with respect to both the hf and lf treatments 4 discussion this work tested whether nitrogen use efficiency could be improved by applying high intermediate or low frequency of irrigation in combination with n fertiliser rates that were lower than typically recommended for expected commercial yields from irrigated cotton grown in southern nsw australia all the treatments produced lint yields that are within commercial expectations abares 2019 the if treatment with fertiliser n rates that were 60 90 kg n ha 1 lower than farmer practise was the strategy that used the applied n fertiliser most efficiently to produce lint this result supports the findings of rochester 2012 that a substantial proportion of n that is taken up by cotton crops is soil derived n and that only between 20 and 60 of applied fertiliser n is recovered by the cotton plant depending on soil fertility and preceding crops monitoring soil water tension at 0 20 m depth was effective for scheduling irrigation differently in the irrigation treatments results from this study show that different thresholds of soil water tension can be set up for cotton production depending on the final objective pursued of either maximising crop profitability or seeking advantages from an advanced or earlier maturing crop as discussed later in this section soil moisture forecast techniques such as those explored in brinkhoff et al 2019 could be used as a guide for operators of farms to make all the arrangements needed and have water available for irrigation at the right time in advance of irrigation water needs while currently soil water potential in commercial farms is obtained from point source measurements other methods capable of capturing the spatial variability in soil moisture within fields such as the use of canopy spectral reflectance measurements panigrahi and das 2018 are being explored as more advantageous methodologies for the future the greater soil water depletion in the 0 75 0 95 m soil profile in treatments if and lf than in the weekly irrigated treatment fig 4 would suggest that root system development was promoted in plants from the if and lf treatments to get access to water at deeper soil layers than in the hf treatment as has been reported for cotton under moderate water deficit conditions ullah et al 2017 root growth promotion in the if and lf treatments may have been at the expense of reducing shoot growth particularly in the 2016 17 growing season tables 3 and 4 as generally observed in plants in response to water deficiency hsiao and xu 2000 this was most likely caused by moderate cyclic water stress occurring in the if and particularly the lf treatments as indicated by stomatal conductance measurements reductions of up to 47 in the lf treatment compared to hf performed in this site and reported elsewhere ballester et al 2019 in agreement with studies dealing with the effects of frequency of irrigation and water deficit on cotton performance gwathmey et al 2011 hunsaker et al 1998 pettigrew 2004 more frequent irrigation events had a delaying effect on crop maturity over the two years of study maturity in the hf and if treatments was delayed 7 10 days and 5 9 days respectively compared to the lf treatment however the reduction in crop duration obtained through the lf practise occurred at the expense of significantly reducing lint yield in both growing seasons 13 8 in 2017 and 8 5 in 2018 compared with the treatment with the highest lint yield the associated yield penalty in the lf strategy should be considered in view of any advantages from earlier maturity in association with weather or operational logistics such as relatively early ginning within the region as well as subsequent preparation for winter cropping opportunity for example in the first season of study rainfall events occurring at the end of the cotton season delayed harvest date in the hf treatment 26 days compared with the lf treatment which was ready to harvest before adverse weather conditions typical of autumn occurred the fact that the if and lf treatments had different effects on lint yield in each growing season compared to the hf strategy could be related with the imposition of the irrigation treatments occurring earlier in the 2016 17 growing season than in 2017 18 for example while all of the days that reached maximum air temperatures 40 0 c nine days in total occurred during the period of imposition of the irrigation treatments in the 2016 17 growing season seven out of 15 days with maximum temperatures over 40 0 c occurred before treatments were imposed in 2018 in the first growing season the weekly irrigated treatment hf could have offset high temperatures reached in these very hot days heat stress days while it did not always in the second moreover although irrigation according to treatments began from 10th january and 16th january in the first and second growing season respectively gdd at that time were 871 in 2017 and 1170 in the 2018 according to the growth targets obtained with the day degree calculator tool this would suggest that phenologically irrigation treatments were imposed six days before the crop was at first flower stage in the 2016 17 growing season while 19 days after in the 2017 18 growing season treatments with higher n uptake in this study tended to have a higher lint yield similar to the observations of rochester 2007 however the different irrigation deficits and n rates did not dramatically alter plant n uptake in the first year there may be considered to be some response according to the irrigation deficit on inue the amount of lint produced relative to the amount of n that was taken up by the crop fig 5a however the results were insignificant in the second year of the study crop n uptake was beyond 300 kg n ha 1 suggesting luxury uptake of n in all the treatments and reducing inue to less than 8 kg n kg 1 this indicated the crop took up more n than required to produce the achieved yields and therefore was probably over supplied with n overall no significant differences were observed in inue across treatments and therefore n uptake was not the limiting factor to yield although there was no difference in the dry mass between the different irrigation strategies tables 3 and 4 patterns in plant height and number of nodes indicated increased productivity with more frequent irrigation which may hint towards changes in the internal distribution of nutrients rochester and constable 2015 however this requires further substantiation since the inue did not indicate this boll mass dry mass ratio was unchanged and lint yield did not provide consistent delineation according to deficit the nfue on the other hand was affected by the irrigation treatments through their effect on yield treatments that produced the highest yields had the highest nfue within each growing season however the increase in lint yield observed in the treatments fertilised with the highest n rate did not compensate for the extra n fertiliser applied and resulted in significantly lower nfue than in the reduced n fertiliser rate within each season fig 5 in this scenario with an average nfue of 11 6 and 9 9 kg lint kg n 1 in the first and second growing seasons respectively the standard practise with a reduced rate of n fertiliser was the most efficient treatment in this study nevertheless and as commonly found for the cotton farms in the murray darling basin these values of nfue and inue were lower than the economic optimum for inue 12 4 0 4 kg lint kg n 1 and nfue 13 18 kg lint kg n 1 defined by rochester 2011 and rochester 2014 for high yielding irrigated cotton crops in australia the low efficiency observed in this study was most likely because of the seasonal conditions that lowered the potential yields the fact that fertiliser n rates applied were not reduced accordingly and that furrow irrigation is the irrigation system that offers the lowest nfue within the cotton industry macdonald et al 2018 fibre quality parameters were affected by the frequency of irrigation with micronaire being more sensitive than fibre length only the lf treatment significantly reduced fibre length compared to the hf in the 2016 17 growing season when the lowest percentage of soil water content was reached between irrigation events see fig 4 this was likely caused by the fibre elongation period being shortened through high temperatures and water stress this is in contrast to no negative quality effects observed in the if treatment over the two seasons of study even in the lf treatment in the 2017 18 growing season conditions were not apparently extreme enough to detrimentally affect fibre length contrary to the fibre length micronaire significantly increased with less frequent irrigations and a greater soil water deficit in both growing seasons possibly caused by earlier maturation table 4 water deficit has been reported to increase micronaire lokhande and reddy 2014 but also decrease it when plants experience prolonged or severe water stress bradow and davidonis 2000 in the study presented here micronaire values in the hf treatment were the lowest in both seasons most likely caused by low maturity of upper bolls table 4 and incurred penalty discounts in the second season of study when values fell outside the fibre quality range required by cotton processors 3 5 4 9 5 conclusion this paper provides data on the effects of three different irrigation deficits interacted with two different n fertiliser rates in a short season large commercial scale field trial conducted on furrow irrigated high yielding cotton on a chromosol soil the if treatment with fertiliser n rates that were 60 90 kg n ha 1 lower than farmer practise similar to what has been specified as the economic optimum for current australian cultivars was the strategy with the greatest nitrogen use efficiency and did not compromise yield or fibre quality irrigation deficits singularly had no effect on plant n uptake or inue suggesting that in this case maintaining higher soil water potential than is usually practised did not facilitate changes to nutrient uptake mechanisms through soil diffusion nor significantly improve the plant internal distribution of nitrogen to the extent of affecting plant growth irrigation at soil water tension below 100 kpa during boll formation increased yield but delayed crop maturity by up to 10 days which caused decreased micronaire to the point of price deductions therefore yield potential obtained through prolonging the period to cutout needs to be balanced in this short growing season region against disadvantages that can occur with fibre quality caused by immaturity autumnal weather and shortening day length at harvesting as well as delaying timely ginning and preparation for

10177,knowledge driven smart irrigation proposes to achieve explicitly targeted crop yield and or irrigation water use efficiency wue a coupled crop growth and soil water transport model was established and applied to schedule irrigation for drip irrigated and film mulched maize through numerical simulation by designing various scenarios with either a constant or variable threshold of plant water deficit index pwdi to initiate irrigation the quantitative relationship between pwdi threshold and the corresponding yield and wue was investigated with acceptable errors between the measured and simulated values r2 0 85 the model allowed determination of pwdi thresholds designed to reach specific combinations of yield and wue to consider actual conditions such as availability and cost of water resources regulated deficit irrigation with a variable threshold considering variability of physiological response to water stress was superior to a constant pwdi threshold in improving wue a constant pwdi threshold of 0 54 and 45 threshold combinations among various growth stages were suggested to obtain same relative values of yield and wue numerical simulation has the potential to provide reliable dynamic information regarding soil water and crop growth necessary for smart irrigation scheduling due to its ability in integrating the effects of environmental conditions and economic considerations and as such should be further studied to enhance simulation accuracy and subsequently to optimize irrigation scheduling under complex situations keywords irrigation scheduling decision support system crop growth soil water transport regulated deficit irrigation 1 introduction a contradiction between food demand and water shortage has become increasingly prominent globally instead of traditional irrigation more and more attention has been paid regarding knowledge and technology driven smart irrigation due to advantages such as automatic controllability and feasibility in optimizing crop yield and irrigation water use efficiency wue through decision support systems irrigation association 2011 the key task of a smart irrigation decision support system sidss is to promote timely supply of appropriate quantities of water to crops according to predetermined targets of yield and or wue shi et al 2020 in the last decades a number of sidsss have been developed to determine when and how much water to irrigate based on data regarding either weather plant soil or their combinations irrigation association 2011 due to inevitable difficulties in both theory and practice of irrigation decision making and application such weather plant or soil based sidsss have yet to become popularly adopted in commercial practice jones 2004 dukes 2012 in the case of a relatively simple and convenient soil based sidss irrigation is triggered when an index representing the extent of water availability or stress to crop exceeds a threshold accurate estimation of crop

estimation of an available soil water based plant water deficit index pwdi and thus irrigation precision can be significantly improved by considering not only the quantity of soil water but also its relative distribution to roots shi et al 2015 wu et al 2017 in order to demonstrate how to determine an efficient pwdi threshold within its theoretical range from 0 to 1 shi et al 2020 investigated the effects of pwdi threshold on the yields and wue of drip irrigated maize and sprinkler irrigated alfalfa through field experiments to relieve the unpredictable effects of some factors e g climate nutrient variety and cultivation the measured yields and wue were normalized to their corresponding potentials and then were fitted as the functions of pwdi threshold values based on this quantitative relationship water application was able to be scheduled according to any attainable target of yield and or wue and conversely yield and wue could be predicted according to any designed irrigation scheme shi et al 2020 the field study in shi et al 2020 was limited to eight combinations of pwdi thresholds between 0 21 and 0 71 and the corresponding relative yields and wues for maize and four such combinations between 0 15 and 0 6 for alfalfa further verification under more scenarios with various pwdi thresholds between 0 and 1 as well as specification for different crops environmental conditions and cultivation modes is necessary additionally under each experimental treatment in shi et al 2020 the pwdi threshold was kept constant throughout the growing season in fact the effects of water stress on plant water relations and physiological mechanisms can be significantly different at various plant phenological stages hsiao 1973 zhang et al 1999 it may therefore be hypothesized that the soil water based sidss can be further improved achieving higher yields and or wue if adapted to allow for regulated deficit irrigation rdi with a time variable pwdi threshold shi et al 2020

w4 treatment shi et al 2020 to reflect real water stress extent the pwdi values under w1 w4 treatments were re estimated daily and the pwdi thresholds used to initiate the existing irrigation events were adjusted from the primary values of 0 01 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 to 0 21 0 5 0 6 and 0 66 respectively shi et al 2020 according to the measured data under w1 and w3 treatments φ and λ in eq 11 rue and δ

this result indicated that the model was reliable in catching the growth dynamics of maize cultured under various soil water conditions with a determination coefficient r2 between the measured and simulated data higher than 0 95 3 2 numerical simulation with a constant pwdi threshold the coupled model dependably simulated irrigation depth plant growth and transpiration grain yield and wue with acceptable rmse and r2 higher than 0 85 between the simulated and measured data for the four actual water treatments w1 w4 in nexp 1 fig 2 the relatively obvious deviation came from the simulation of aboveground biomass with the largest relative error of 6 5 under w1 treatment and an average relative error of 5 8 fig 2b besides irrigation depth irrigation scheduling according to the coupled model was also comparable with the experimental data for w1 w4 treatments totally 33 7 5 and 4 irrigation events were respectively predicted during the treatment period from 37 to 129 dap agreeing well with the actual 34 7 4 and 3 irrigation events fig 3 under w3 and w4 treatments the predicted first irrigation event was respectively delayed 9 and 4 d but did not cause significant limitation to plant growth or yield fig 2b due to an additional irrigation event and similar ultimate irrigation depth fig 4 among the 99 scenarios almost all the applied water was consumed by transpiration fig 2a which should be attributed to the objective soil water content being set as field water capacity eq 4 deeper simulation depth than the soil wetting depth eqs 5 8 and the effect of film mulch limiting soil evaporation with the increase of pwdi threshold from 0 01 to 0 99 accompanied by the reduction of irrigation events from 92 times to zero fig 3 during the treatment period 37 129 dap less water was supplied and transpired fig 2a and plant growth and yield were more seriously limited fig 2b nevertheless wue was generally improved until the occurrence of extreme water stress with a pwdi threshold higher than 0 85 afterwards it sharply decreased fig 2c these results regarding the simulated effects of water stress on plant growth production and wue generally accorded well with findings in the literature involving various soil plant and climate conditions radin et al 1989 zhang et al 1999 kang et al 2002 liu et al 2005 emekli et al 2007 candogan et al 2013 however for the simulation of wue fluctuation occurred when pwdi threshold exceeded 0 45 and the fluctuation range expanded with the increase of pwdi threshold fig 2c this might be explained by the different irrigation schemes among the consecutive scenarios after a sharp decrease from 92 to 9 times when pwdi threshold increased from 0 01 to 0 45 irrigation events subsequently were only gradually reduced under many scenarios the number of irrigation events was identical while irrigation depth and duration were different fig 3 for example under each one of the 12 scenarios for pwdi threshold between 0 66 and 0 77 irrigation was uniformly triggered four times during the treatment period compared to 0 66 the predicted total irrigation depth under the scenario with a pwdi threshold of 0 77 was enhanced 5 5 from 20 0 to 21 1 cm since a higher pwdi threshold always leads to lower soil water content before irrigation but the four irrigation events were delayed by an average of 5 days and thus transpiration was limited 3 8 from 20 9 to 20 1 cm fig 2a grain yield was subsequently reduced 9 1 from 11120 to 10114 kg ha 1 resulting in a reduction of 14 2 in irrigation wue from 5 57 to 4 78 kg m 3 nevertheless it is challenging to accurately identify the specific optimal scenarios e g with a pwdi threshold of 0 66 in practice due to unpredictable influences potentially coming from environmental conditions management and measurement and simulation inaccuracies as a function of pwdi threshold both yield and wue behaved according to complicated dynamic patterns fig 2 that were difficult to fit using simple i e linear functions in the narrow range from 0 21 under w1 to 0 66 under w4 yield and wue were almost linearly proportional to pwdi threshold with very few exceptions of slight fluctuation consequently the maximal yield of 18859 kg ha 1 interpolated by shi et al 2020 according to the fitted linear relationship agreed well with the maximal value of 18752 kg ha 1 among the 99 scenarios in nexp 1 simulated through the coupled model under the scenario of full irrigation with a pwdi threshold of 0 01 fig 2b however among the 99 scenarios in nexp 1 maximal wue was simulated as 6 22 kg m 3 with a pwdi threshold of 0 85 which was 18 3 higher than the maximal value of 5 26 kg m 3 approximated by shi et al 2020 under the w4 treatment these results suggest that numerical simulations can be favorable compared to other methods for irrigation scheduling due to avoidance of costly and laborious experimental measurements dabach et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2013 3 3 numerical simulation with a variable pwdi threshold simulated results for the total 729 scenarios in nexp 2 are shown in fig 5a where the pwdi thresholds during the early 37 75 dap seedling to jointing stage middle 76 97 dap heading to filling stage and later 98 129 dap filling to mature stage periods were adjusted by 0 1 intervals from 0 1 to 0 9 and labeled around the abscissa axis with three nested scales from bottom to top respectively fig 5a indicates that different combinations of pwdi thresholds among various growth stages produced different combinations of yield and wue in response to the complex effects of soil water stress on plant growth processes such as emergence photosynthesis and biomass accumulation biomass allocation organ construction leaf senescence transpiration and consequently yield production zhang et al 1999 ozturk and aydin 2004 igbadun et al 2007 candogan et al 2013 the highest yield and lowest wue when pwdi thresholds were a uniform 0 1 during the three periods were simulated as 17553 kg ha 1 and 3 26 kg m 3 by supplying 539 2 mm water via 43 events fig 5a when the pwdi threshold increased during either the early middle or later periods yield decreased while wue generally increased due to more serious water stress ozturk and aydin 2004 igbadun et al 2007 the highest wue of 6 67 kg m 3 was achieved when the pwdi thresholds during the early middle and later periods were 0 9 0 7 and 0 8 0 9 0 7 0 8 fig 5a respectively this wue was 7 2 higher than the highest value of 6 22 kg m 3 simulated in nexp 1 with a constant threshold of 0 85 fig 2c the enhancement of the maximal wue through rdi is likely attributed to variable physiological response mechanisms to water stress during different phenological growth stages hsiao 1973 zhang et al 1999 based on the pwdi threshold combination 0 9 0 7 0 8 with the highest wue trends of wue and yield were evaluated by adjusting the pwdi threshold during the early middle or later period between 0 1 and 0 9 while keeping the thresholds during the other two periods constant fig 5a when pwdi threshold increased during the early period wue always increased increasing pwdi thresholds during the middle and later periods led to increases followed by decreases in wue but the trend changed at a lower threshold of 0 7 when increasing thresholds in the middle period this indication that maize wue is most sensitive to water stress during the middle growth season heading and filling stages and most insensitive during the early season seedling to jointing stage is well supported by the literature igbadun et al 2007 additionally fig 5a indicates that yield is most sensitive to water stress during the early season with a biggest change range while most insensitive during the later season with a smallest change range doorenbos and kassam 1979 similar to nexp 1 wue was also found to fluctuate when the same number of irrigation events was accompanied by different irrigation depth and duration among the consecutive scenarios in nexp 2 particularly when the pwdi thresholds were higher than 0 5 during the three periods fig 5a compared to nexp 1 fig 2c the fluctuations of wue in nexp 2 were both slighter and fewer since many intermediate scenarios were neglected when adopting a larger simulation interval of pwdi threshold of 0 1 instead of 0 01 obviously the advantage of numerical simulation in quantification could be more fully embodied by setting more detailed scenarios with smaller intervals for example if the simulation interval of pwdi threshold in nexp 2 was changed from 0 1 to 0 01 as that in nexp 1 the scenarios would increase from 729 to almost one million leading to more comprehensive results however the corresponding numerical simulation time would increase exponentially relative to the relationship of yield or wue as a function of a constant pwdi threshold fig 2b and c a more complicated and comprehensive relationship fig 5a resulted when a variable pwdi threshold was applied to achieve an objective yield and or wue consequently an optimal scheme of rdi could be chosen from these available combinations of pwdi thresholds for the three simulation periods 3 4 scheduling irrigation through numerical simulation besides irrigation crop yield and wue are also significantly influenced by many other complicated uncontrollable or unpredictable factors such as climate spatial variability of soil water and nutrients variety and cultivation ritchie and otter 1985 jalota et al 2010 to schedule smart irrigation for an objective yield and or wue it would be wise and reasonable to eliminate or relieve these unpredictable effects by normalizing yield and wue based on their corresponding potential values which are often obtained theoretically or experimentally in practice to demonstrate smart irrigation scheduling the potential values were simply extrapolated through the fitting relationship between pwdi threshold and the measured yield and wue in shi et al 2020 in this study the simulated maximal yield 18752 kg ha 1 and wue 6 67 kg m 3 among all the scenarios in nexps 1 and 2 were taken as the corresponding potential values to obtain normalized yield and wue synthesizing the above simulation results for maize during the treatment period the changing processes of relative yield and wue as a function of a variable or constant pwdi threshold are demonstrated in figs 5b and 6 respectively irrigation can be scheduled for maize by choosing suitable pwdi thresholds according to the predesigned relative yield and or wue targets for example if a relative yield of 0 85 is desired or expected a constant pwdi threshold in the sidss should be set as 0 25 resulting in a relative wue of 0 53 fig 6 for rdi however there are 20 combinations of pwdi thresholds corresponding to a relative yield of 0 85 with higher relative wue in the range of 0 53 0 65 e g 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 6 and so on respectively for the early middle and later periods fig 5b it seems that rdi with a variable pwdi threshold may be superior to enhance wue and thus save more water resources for a predesigned yield target zheng et al 2012 in most arid and semiarid regions deficit irrigation especially rdi is accompanied to some extent by sacrifice in yield rao et al 1988 singh 2014a assuming a yield reduction less than 20 i e with a relative yield higher than 0 8 is acceptable under scenarios where there is an objective to save water zheng et al 2012 wang et al 2014a 2014b tan et al 2018 the corresponding relative wue resulting from the sidss with a constant pwdi threshold 0 35 would be lower than 0 57 fig 6 while consuming more than 396 mm water fig 2a for rdi with the requirement of relative yield higher than 0 8 and relative wue not less than 0 65 20 combinations of pwdi thresholds were screened out from the 729 scenarios in nexp 2 with total water consumption of only 329 4 367 2 mm table 3 and fig 5b specially option 1 pwdi threshold combination 0 1 0 4 0 6 showed the highest relative yield of 0 85 with a relative wue of 0 65 while option 17 0 2 0 4 0 7 provided the highest relative wue of 0 69 with a relative yield of 0 81 among the 20 options the average pwdi threshold during the early middle and later periods increased from 0 14 to 0 49 and then to 0 66 table 3 this indicates that keeping a relatively slight water stress extent during the seedling and jointing stages while a relatively serious stress extent during the filling and mature stages is beneficial for maize to obtain high yield and wue together doorenbos and kassam 1979 igbadun et al 2007 in this study the principle and procedure to schedule smart irrigation were demonstrated through numerical simulation the target in practice should be logically determined according to actual conditions such as availability and cost of water resources by optimizing crop yield and wue due to the opposite trends changing with pwdi thresholds the irrigation scheme which would lead to equal relative values of yield and wue i e the intersections of the two curves might be the optimal such as the pwdi threshold of 0 54 in nexp 1 resulting in same relative yield and wue of 0 65 fig 6 in this manner 45 optimal pwdi threshold combinations were found for rdi in nexp 2 where the relative values of yield and wue always ranged between 0 64 and 0 74 fig 5b these results indicated that based on a validated model coupling crop growth and soil water transport scheduling irrigation to optimize crop yield and wue through numerical simulation should be reliable and feasible the numerical simulation method in contrast to experimental or machine learning techniques has been proven efficient affordable low labor requirements and has great potential in making decisions regarding precision irrigation to alleviate effects of spatial variability navarro hellín et al 2016 fontanet et al 2020 different from previously published numerical simulation methods for scheduling irrigation dabach et al 2013 garcía morillo et al 2017 fontanet et al 2020 the significant advantage of the method proposed in this study lies in supplying the direct relationships between irrigation scheduling pwdi threshold timing and amount of irrigation and results regarding crop growth yield and water use which is the basis of knowledge driven smart irrigation scheduling necessary for simulation of soil water transport eq 6 initial soil water conditions are usually measured through sampling or sensors such as in this study in practice it might be feasible to simulate soil water flow and subsequently schedule smart irrigation according to an estimated rather than measured initial soil water profile before a growing season field water capacity might be assumed as the initial condition after a full water input event rainfall or irrigation and then the error of soil water transport simulation resulting from the assumption would weaken gradually or even disappear through a self recovering duration raes et al 2008 nevertheless the numerical simulation method should be further evaluated and improved by considering the effects of variable environmental conditions jalota et al 2010 and agricultural production technologies such as fertigation and cultivation thomson and ross 1996 in this study numerical simulation was conducted in only one growing season when rainfall was eluded by a movable rain shelter the effects of intra and inter annual climatic variability on simulated results regarding irrigation scheduling yield and wue should be further evaluated in addition irrigation scheduling was optimized in this study according to several user defined alternatives although the recommended irrigation scheduling might be the best among the limited options it was unlikely the global optimal shang and mao 2006 which would be achieved through combining the coupled soil water transport and crop growth model with a professional optimization model such as genetic algorithm singh and panda 2013 singh 2014b 4 conclusions taking drip irrigated and film mulched maize in a field experiment as an example a coupled model of crop growth and soil water transport was established validated and applied to numerically simulate the quantitative relationship between pwdi threshold and the corresponding yield and wue for scheduling smart irrigation to make an efficient smart irrigation scheme controlled by a constant or variable pwdi threshold both yield and wue should be designed to consider actual conditions such as availability and cost of water resources by coordinating the two targets irrigation schemes leading to equal relative values of yield and wue might be optimal compared to the deficit irrigation based on a constant pwdi threshold rdi with thresholds that varied among growth stages was superior in enhancing wue the numerical simulation technique appears to be a strong potential alternative to experimental means or machine learning techniques for knowledge based irrigation scheduling with inherent advantages in alleviating the effects of spatial variability however further study is needed to enhance simulation accuracy by considering the effects of variable environmental conditions physiological response mechanisms to water stress and agricultural production technologies and to optimize irrigation scheduling by

10177,knowledge driven smart irrigation proposes to achieve explicitly targeted crop yield and or irrigation water use efficiency wue a coupled crop growth and soil water transport model was established and applied to schedule irrigation for drip irrigated and film mulched maize through numerical simulation by designing various scenarios with either a constant or variable threshold of plant water deficit index pwdi to initiate irrigation the quantitative relationship between pwdi threshold and the corresponding yield and wue was investigated with acceptable errors between the measured and simulated values r2 0 85 the model allowed determination of pwdi thresholds designed to reach specific combinations of yield and wue to consider actual conditions such as availability and cost of water resources regulated deficit irrigation with a variable threshold considering variability of physiological response to water stress was superior to a constant pwdi threshold in improving wue a constant pwdi threshold of 0 54 and 45 threshold combinations among various growth stages were suggested to obtain same relative values of yield and wue numerical simulation has the potential to provide reliable dynamic information regarding soil water and crop growth necessary for smart irrigation scheduling due to its ability in integrating the effects of environmental conditions and economic considerations and as such should be further studied to enhance simulation accuracy and subsequently to optimize irrigation scheduling under complex situations keywords irrigation scheduling decision support system crop growth soil water transport regulated deficit irrigation 1 introduction a contradiction between food demand and water shortage has become increasingly prominent globally instead of traditional irrigation more and more attention has been paid regarding knowledge and technology driven smart irrigation due to advantages such as automatic controllability and feasibility in optimizing crop yield and irrigation water use efficiency wue through decision support systems irrigation association 2011 the key task of a smart irrigation decision support system sidss is to promote timely supply of appropriate quantities of water to crops according to predetermined targets of yield and or wue shi et al 2020 in the last decades a number of sidsss have been developed to determine when and how much water to irrigate based on data regarding either weather plant soil or their combinations irrigation association 2011 due to inevitable difficulties in both theory and practice of irrigation decision making and application such weather plant or soil based sidsss have yet to become popularly adopted in commercial practice jones 2004 dukes 2012 in the case of a relatively simple and convenient soil based sidss irrigation is triggered when an index representing the extent of water availability or stress to crop exceeds a threshold accurate estimation of crop stress according to soil water conditions and determination of suitable thresholds to initiate irrigation events can benefit desired yield and or wue targets recent studies have indicated that estimation of an available soil water based plant water deficit index pwdi and thus irrigation precision can be significantly improved by considering not only the quantity of soil water but also its relative distribution to roots shi et al 2015 wu et al 2017 in order to demonstrate how to determine an efficient pwdi threshold within its theoretical range from 0 to 1 shi et al 2020 investigated the effects of pwdi threshold on the yields and wue of drip irrigated maize and sprinkler irrigated alfalfa through field experiments to relieve the unpredictable effects of some factors e g climate nutrient variety and cultivation the measured yields and wue were normalized to their corresponding potentials and then were fitted as the functions of pwdi threshold values based on this quantitative relationship water application was able to be scheduled according to any attainable target of yield and or wue and conversely yield and wue could be predicted according to any designed irrigation scheme shi et al 2020 the field study in shi et al 2020 was limited to eight combinations of pwdi thresholds between 0 21 and 0 71 and the corresponding relative yields and wues for maize and four such combinations between 0 15 and 0 6 for alfalfa further verification under more scenarios with various pwdi thresholds between 0 and 1 as well as specification for different crops environmental conditions and cultivation modes is necessary additionally under each experimental treatment in shi et al 2020 the pwdi threshold was kept constant throughout the growing season in fact the effects of water stress on plant water relations and physiological mechanisms can be significantly different at various plant phenological stages hsiao 1973 zhang et al 1999 it may therefore be hypothesized that the soil water based sidss can be further improved achieving higher yields and or wue if adapted to allow for regulated deficit irrigation rdi with a time variable pwdi threshold shi et al 2020 although experimental and machine learning techniques are available to verify specify or improve a sidss more convenient and less time and resource consuming numerical simulation methods may be more feasible navarro hellín et al 2016 under specific soil plant and climate conditions to schedule irrigation or predict yield and wue according to a constant or variable pwdi threshold precise

continuum systems feddes et al 1978 mailhol et al 2007 khaledian et al 2009 the objective of this study therefore was to demonstrate efficient scheduling of data driven smart irrigation through numerical simulation determining a reasonable constant or variable pwdi threshold for an available soil water based sidss according to combined yield and wue targets the field experimental data for

were adjusted from the primary values of 0 01 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 to 0 21 0 5 0 6 and 0 66 respectively shi et al 2020 according to the measured data under w1 and w3 treatments φ and λ in eq 11 rue and δ in eq 12 and hi opt and τ in eq 16 were optimized table 2 corresponding to the minimal root mean square errors rmse of 0 47 cm2 cm 2 for lai 1332 kg ha 1 for aboveground biomass and 285 kg ha 1 for yield the crop growth model was then validated under the treatments of w2 and w4 with the averaged rmse of 0 32 cm2 cm 2 for lai fig 1 1250 kg ha 1 for aboveground biomass and 240 kg ha 1 for yield this result indicated that the model was reliable in catching the growth dynamics of maize cultured under various soil water conditions with a determination coefficient r2 between the measured and simulated data higher than 0 95 3 2 numerical simulation with a constant pwdi threshold the coupled model dependably simulated irrigation depth plant growth and transpiration grain yield and wue with acceptable rmse and r2 higher than 0 85 between the simulated and measured data for the four actual water treatments w1 w4 in nexp 1 fig 2 the relatively obvious deviation came from the simulation of aboveground biomass with the largest relative error of 6 5 under w1 treatment and an average relative error of 5 8 fig 2b besides irrigation depth irrigation scheduling according to the coupled model was also comparable with the experimental data for w1 w4 treatments totally 33 7 5 and 4 irrigation events were respectively predicted during the treatment period from 37 to 129 dap agreeing well with the actual 34 7 4 and 3 irrigation events fig 3 under w3 and w4 treatments the predicted first irrigation event was respectively delayed 9 and 4 d but did not cause significant limitation to plant growth or yield fig 2b due to an additional irrigation event and similar ultimate irrigation depth fig 4 among the 99 scenarios almost all the applied water was consumed by transpiration fig 2a which should be attributed to the objective soil water content being set as field water capacity eq 4 deeper simulation depth than the soil wetting depth eqs 5 8 and the effect of film mulch limiting soil evaporation with the increase of pwdi threshold from 0 01 to 0 99 accompanied by the reduction of irrigation events from 92 times to zero fig 3 during the treatment period 37 129 dap less water was supplied and transpired fig 2a and plant growth and yield were more seriously limited fig 2b nevertheless wue was generally improved until the occurrence of extreme water stress with a pwdi threshold higher than 0 85 afterwards it sharply decreased fig 2c these results regarding the simulated effects of water stress on plant growth production and wue generally accorded well with findings in the literature involving various soil plant and climate conditions radin et al 1989 zhang et al 1999 kang et al 2002 liu et al 2005 emekli et al 2007 candogan et al 2013 however for the simulation of wue fluctuation occurred when pwdi threshold exceeded 0 45 and the fluctuation range expanded with the increase of pwdi threshold fig 2c this might be explained by the different irrigation schemes among the consecutive scenarios after a sharp decrease from 92 to 9 times when pwdi threshold increased from 0 01 to 0 45 irrigation events subsequently were only gradually reduced under many scenarios the number of irrigation events was identical while irrigation depth and duration were different fig 3 for example under each one of the 12 scenarios for pwdi threshold between 0 66 and 0 77 irrigation was uniformly triggered four times during the treatment period compared to 0 66 the predicted total irrigation depth under the scenario with a pwdi threshold of 0 77 was enhanced 5 5 from 20 0 to 21 1 cm since a higher pwdi threshold always leads to lower soil water content before irrigation but the four irrigation events were delayed by an average of 5 days and thus transpiration was limited 3 8 from 20 9 to 20 1 cm fig 2a grain yield was subsequently reduced 9 1 from 11120 to 10114 kg ha 1 resulting in a reduction of 14 2 in irrigation wue from 5 57 to 4 78 kg m 3 nevertheless it is challenging to accurately identify the specific optimal scenarios e g with a pwdi threshold of 0 66 in practice due to unpredictable influences potentially coming from environmental conditions management and measurement and simulation inaccuracies as a function of pwdi threshold both yield and wue behaved according to complicated dynamic patterns fig 2 that were difficult to fit using simple i e linear functions in the narrow range from 0 21 under w1 to 0 66 under w4 yield and wue were almost linearly proportional to pwdi threshold with very few exceptions of slight fluctuation consequently the maximal yield of 18859 kg ha 1 interpolated by shi et al 2020 according to the fitted linear relationship agreed well with the maximal value of 18752 kg ha 1 among the 99 scenarios in nexp 1 simulated through the coupled model under the scenario of full irrigation with a pwdi threshold of 0 01 fig 2b however among the 99 scenarios in nexp 1 maximal wue was simulated as 6 22 kg m 3 with a pwdi threshold of 0 85 which was 18 3 higher than the maximal value of 5 26 kg m 3 approximated by shi et al 2020 under the w4 treatment these results suggest that numerical simulations can be favorable compared to other methods for irrigation scheduling due to avoidance of costly and laborious experimental measurements dabach et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2013 3 3 numerical simulation with a variable pwdi threshold simulated results for the total 729 scenarios in nexp 2 are shown in fig 5a where the pwdi thresholds during the early 37 75 dap seedling to jointing stage middle 76 97 dap heading to filling stage and later 98 129 dap filling to mature stage periods were adjusted by 0 1 intervals from 0 1 to 0 9 and labeled around the abscissa axis with three nested scales from bottom to top respectively fig 5a indicates that different combinations of pwdi thresholds among various growth stages produced different combinations of yield and wue in response to the complex effects of soil water stress on plant growth processes such as emergence photosynthesis and biomass accumulation biomass allocation organ construction leaf senescence transpiration and consequently yield production zhang et al 1999 ozturk and aydin 2004 igbadun et al 2007 candogan et al 2013 the highest yield and lowest wue when pwdi thresholds were a uniform 0 1 during the three periods were simulated as 17553 kg ha 1 and 3 26 kg m 3 by supplying 539 2 mm water via 43 events fig 5a when the pwdi threshold increased during either the early middle or later periods yield decreased while wue generally increased due to more serious water stress ozturk and aydin 2004 igbadun et al 2007 the highest wue of 6 67 kg m 3 was achieved when the pwdi thresholds during the early middle and later periods were 0 9 0 7 and 0 8 0 9 0 7 0 8 fig 5a respectively this wue was 7 2 higher than the highest value of 6 22 kg m 3 simulated in nexp 1 with a constant threshold of 0 85 fig 2c the enhancement of the maximal wue through rdi is likely attributed to variable physiological response mechanisms to water stress during different phenological growth stages hsiao 1973 zhang et al 1999 based on the pwdi threshold combination 0 9 0 7 0 8 with the highest wue trends of wue and yield were evaluated by adjusting the pwdi threshold during the early middle or later period between 0 1 and 0 9 while keeping the thresholds during the other two periods constant fig 5a when pwdi threshold increased during the early period wue always increased increasing pwdi thresholds during the middle and later periods led to increases followed by decreases in wue but the trend changed at a lower threshold of 0 7 when increasing thresholds in the middle period this indication that maize wue is most sensitive to water stress during the middle growth season heading and filling stages and most insensitive during the early season seedling to jointing stage is well supported by the literature igbadun et al 2007 additionally fig 5a indicates that yield is most sensitive to water stress during the early season with a biggest change range while most insensitive during the later season with a smallest change range doorenbos and kassam 1979 similar to nexp 1 wue was also found to fluctuate when the same number of irrigation events was accompanied by different irrigation depth and duration among the consecutive scenarios in nexp 2 particularly when the pwdi thresholds were higher than 0 5 during the three periods fig 5a compared to nexp 1 fig 2c the fluctuations of wue in nexp 2 were both slighter and fewer since many intermediate scenarios were neglected when adopting a larger simulation interval of pwdi threshold of 0 1 instead of 0 01 obviously the advantage of numerical simulation in quantification could be more fully embodied by setting more detailed scenarios with smaller intervals for example if the simulation interval of pwdi threshold in nexp 2 was changed from 0 1 to 0 01 as that in nexp 1 the scenarios would increase from 729 to almost one million leading to more comprehensive results however the corresponding numerical simulation time would increase exponentially relative to the relationship of yield or wue as a function of a constant pwdi threshold fig 2b and c a more complicated and comprehensive relationship fig 5a resulted when a variable pwdi threshold was applied to achieve an objective yield and or wue consequently an optimal scheme of rdi could be chosen from these available combinations of pwdi thresholds for the three simulation periods 3 4 scheduling irrigation through numerical simulation besides irrigation crop yield and wue are also significantly influenced by many other complicated uncontrollable or unpredictable factors such as climate spatial variability of soil water and nutrients variety and cultivation ritchie and otter 1985 jalota et al 2010 to schedule smart irrigation for an objective yield and or wue it would be wise and reasonable to eliminate or relieve these unpredictable effects by normalizing yield and wue based on their corresponding potential values which are often obtained theoretically or experimentally in practice to demonstrate smart irrigation scheduling the potential values were simply extrapolated through the fitting relationship between pwdi threshold and the measured yield and wue in shi et al 2020 in this study the simulated maximal yield 18752 kg ha 1 and wue 6 67 kg m 3 among all the scenarios in nexps 1 and 2 were taken as the corresponding potential values to obtain normalized yield and wue synthesizing the above simulation results for maize during the treatment period the changing processes of relative yield and wue as a function of a variable or constant pwdi threshold are demonstrated in figs 5b and 6 respectively irrigation can be scheduled for maize by choosing suitable pwdi thresholds according to the predesigned relative yield and or wue targets for example if a relative yield of 0 85 is desired or expected a constant pwdi threshold in the sidss should be set as 0 25 resulting in a relative wue of 0 53 fig 6 for rdi however there are 20 combinations of pwdi thresholds corresponding to a relative yield of 0 85 with higher relative wue in the range of 0 53 0 65 e g 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 6 and so on respectively for the early middle and later periods fig 5b it seems that rdi with a variable pwdi threshold may be superior to enhance wue and thus save more water resources for a predesigned yield target zheng et al 2012 in most arid and semiarid regions deficit irrigation especially rdi is accompanied to some extent by sacrifice in yield rao et al 1988 singh 2014a assuming a yield reduction less than 20 i e with a relative yield higher than 0 8 is acceptable under scenarios where there is an objective to save water zheng et al 2012 wang et al 2014a 2014b tan et al 2018 the corresponding relative wue resulting from the sidss with a constant pwdi threshold 0 35 would be lower than 0 57 fig 6 while consuming more than 396 mm water fig 2a for rdi with the requirement of relative yield higher than 0 8 and relative wue not less than 0 65 20 combinations of pwdi thresholds were screened out from the 729 scenarios in nexp 2 with total water consumption of only 329 4 367 2 mm table 3 and fig 5b specially option 1 pwdi threshold combination 0 1 0 4 0 6 showed the highest relative yield of 0 85 with a relative wue of 0 65 while option 17 0 2 0 4 0 7 provided the highest relative wue of 0 69 with a relative yield of 0 81 among the 20 options the average pwdi threshold during the early middle and later periods increased from 0 14 to 0 49 and then to 0 66 table 3 this indicates that keeping a relatively slight water stress extent during the seedling and jointing stages while a relatively serious stress extent during the filling and mature stages is beneficial for maize to obtain high yield and wue together doorenbos and kassam 1979 igbadun et al 2007 in this study the principle and procedure to schedule smart irrigation were demonstrated through numerical simulation the target in practice should be logically determined according to actual conditions such as availability and cost of water resources by optimizing crop yield and wue due to the opposite trends changing with pwdi thresholds the irrigation scheme which would lead to equal relative values of yield and wue i e the intersections of the two curves might be the optimal such as the pwdi threshold of 0 54 in nexp 1 resulting in same relative yield and wue of 0 65 fig 6 in this manner 45 optimal pwdi threshold combinations were found for rdi in nexp 2 where the relative values of yield and wue always ranged between 0 64 and 0 74 fig 5b these results indicated that based on a validated model coupling crop growth and soil water transport scheduling irrigation to optimize crop yield and wue through numerical simulation should be reliable and feasible the numerical simulation method in contrast to experimental or machine learning techniques has been proven efficient affordable low labor requirements and has great potential in making decisions regarding precision irrigation to alleviate effects of spatial variability navarro hellín et al 2016 fontanet et al 2020 different from previously published numerical simulation methods for scheduling irrigation dabach et al 2013 garcía morillo et al 2017 fontanet et al 2020 the significant advantage of the method proposed in this study lies in supplying the direct relationships between irrigation scheduling pwdi threshold timing and amount of irrigation and results regarding crop growth yield and water use which is the basis of knowledge driven smart irrigation scheduling necessary for simulation of soil water transport eq 6 initial soil water conditions are usually measured through sampling or sensors such as in this study in practice it might be feasible to simulate soil water flow and subsequently schedule smart irrigation according to an estimated rather than measured initial soil water profile before a growing season field water capacity might be assumed as the initial condition after a full water input event rainfall or irrigation and then the error of soil water transport simulation resulting from the assumption would weaken gradually or even disappear through a self recovering duration raes et al 2008 nevertheless the numerical simulation method should be further evaluated and improved by considering the effects of variable environmental conditions jalota et al 2010 and agricultural production technologies such as fertigation and cultivation thomson and ross 1996 in this study numerical simulation was conducted in only one growing season when rainfall was eluded by a movable rain shelter the effects of intra and inter annual climatic variability on simulated results regarding irrigation scheduling yield and wue should be further evaluated in addition irrigation scheduling was optimized in this study according to several user defined alternatives although the recommended irrigation scheduling might be the best among the limited options it was unlikely the global optimal shang and mao 2006 which would be achieved through combining the coupled soil water transport and crop growth model with a professional optimization model such as genetic algorithm singh and panda 2013 singh 2014b 4 conclusions taking drip irrigated and film mulched maize in a field experiment as an example a coupled model of crop growth and soil water transport was established validated and applied to numerically simulate the quantitative relationship between pwdi threshold and the corresponding yield and wue for scheduling smart irrigation to make an efficient smart irrigation scheme controlled by a constant or variable pwdi threshold both yield and wue should be designed to consider actual conditions such as availability and cost of water resources by coordinating the two targets irrigation schemes leading to equal relative values of yield and wue might be optimal compared to the deficit irrigation based on a constant pwdi threshold rdi with thresholds that varied among growth stages was superior in enhancing wue the numerical simulation technique appears to be a strong potential alternative to experimental means or machine learning techniques for knowledge based irrigation scheduling with inherent advantages in alleviating the effects of spatial variability however further study is needed to enhance simulation accuracy by considering the effects of variable environmental conditions physiological response mechanisms to water stress and agricultural production technologies and to optimize irrigation scheduling by

10178,in this paper we develop an agro economic model to plan irrigation interventions specifically we set up an economic optimization model that incorporates typical crop soil water physical relationships the approach described in the paper offers a straightforward estimating procedure that allows to shift from the conventional maximum yield paradigm to drive the irrigation advice to a gross income maximization paradigm the paper focuses on analyzing the very first implication of such approach at the crop level explaining the way how irrigation costs contribute influencing the irrigation advice an empirical example is provided to show the procedure used to nest the developed method into an existing crop water model and to show its practical implication on the irrigation advise a discussion follows on what the described approach differs from other recent approaches developed in the field of irrigation scheduling and on how the scope of application of the method can be extended beyond the farm level the paper concludes highlighting pitfall and suggesting possible solution to further improve the quality of the irrigation advise keywords irrigation scheduling dynamic optimization agro economic crop simulation models 1 introduction thanks to the recent development of proximity and remote sensing devices the accuracy of soil water balance models in providing irrigation advices improved and nowadays there is some evidence about the application of irrigation simulation models to support farmers in irrigation scheduling in different regions mun et al 2015 1 1 about recent advances in simulation modelling a number of studies was recently developed to design deficit irrigation scheduling simulation models aiming both to satisfy the full crop water requirement and to increasing the efficiency of water uses so as to give the highest crop production with the least water use comas et al 2019 fereres and soriano 2007 hunsaker et al 2015 jones 2004 nguyen et al 2017 padilla díaz et al 2016 these models usually provide good results when locally calibrated nevertheless as for our knowledge models uptake by farmers still is quite jeopardized and limited to few crops in one hand the reason can be found in their lack of resilience to non pristine plant growth patterns and climate conditions which are occurring frequently under the pressure of climate changes in the other hand irrigation models do not explicitly account of some important economic aspects that can contribute improving the quality of the irrigation advice the convenience to perform an irrigation intervention and how much to irrigate are the main questions to answer on the ground of these simple information farmers will operate their choice therefore there is still a need to estimate the consequences of water uses on farmers incomes and on how these consequences translates into the irrigation advice the information gap and irrigation models application limit can be worked out at least partially by shifting the paradigm of their objective function from minimum resource use maximum yield strategy to a gross income maximizing strategy which better integrate and harmonize also those off farm pressures that frequently greatly influence farmers decisions english et al 2002 the gross income maximizing strategy paradigm approach considers that marginal stresses except during critical reproductive stages may not affect yield value enough to justify resources and irrigation costs such optimization perspective is particularly interesting for crops grown in conditions of limited water availability water stored in reservoirs as it allows to rationalize water uses along the entire growth season by automatically identifying the periods when it is worth saving water this paper describes the irrigation scheduling gross income maximizing model i profit we develop i profit contributes to the agricultural economics and agronomy literatures by integrating the concepts of marginal revenues and costs with respect to water uses along the growth stages of the crop providing a useful tool to plan irrigation intervention and eventually to set up deficit irrigation strategies under limited water availability conditions specifically the present study progress on recent approaches developed in the field of irrigation scheduling foster et al 2014 lecina 2016 manning et al 2018 switching from a crop stage optimization perspective to a daily basis optimization perspective to allow its use for prescriptive purposes moreover i profit account of two main costs items that mostly contribute influencing gross revenues after having chosen what to grow and what irrigation system to adopt these are the cost to set up an irrigation intervention mainly related to the time spent to move the necessary equipment in the field and the volumetric water use cost mainly related to energy uses and incentive tariffs the developed methodology allows identifying how these costs contribute identifying when to irrigate and how much water to apply to maximize the per hectare crop gross income a numerical example followed by a simulation based on recently published information linker et al 2016 for processing tomato is provided to illustrate how the optimization procedure works in practice how the model can be plug in into existing irrigation models and how the model can improve the irrigation advice the simulation is provided for both sprinkler and drip irrigation to account of the influence of different irrigation systems on the relevance of the analyzed sources of costs the irrigation simulation model used in this paper to test i profit is acquacrop which is based on the fundamentals crop water functions developed by steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 the reminder of the paper is organized in the following sections state of the art where we provide a description of the main factors that contribute influencing water management in agriculture and on how agricultural economists mostly build their normative prescriptions to deal with water scarcity problems the limits of such approaches and the solution offered by recent approaches including the one proposed in this study methodology where we describe the developed optimization procedure i profit integration with aquacrop to illustrate how to integrate our model with an existing irrigation simulation model i profit simulation example to illustrate the implications of changes in the structure and in the value of irrigation costs on the irrigation prescription discussions where we provide some technical and policy implication associated with the irrigation scheduling approach developed in this study including applications that go beyond the operational application studied in this paper conclusions where we discuss the limits of our study and the methodological and operational perspectives of the developed approach 2 state of the art the economic literature explored the issue of water uses in agriculture mainly to analyze the farmers behaviors in response to the globalization of markets yang et al 2003 to water scarcity garcía vila and fereres 2012 and to water pricing molle and berkoff 2007 the globalization of markets is certainly the overarching aspect influencing water uses in agriculture yang et al 2003 shown how decreasing profitability put pressure on domestic food production the problem is nowadays even more actual in a globalised context where agriculture s products are traded as commodities farmers are challenged by international markets and have to face unfair market rules that had made them more and more dependent to governmental compensations and subsidies this situation lasting since decades has deeply changed farmers risk perception and responses transforming the increase of irrigation efficiency ie 2 2 field ie is the ratio of the volume of all irrigation water beneficially used on a farmer s field predominantly evapotranspiration et by crops and salt removal to maintain soil productivity to the total volume of irrigation water applied adjusted for changes in water stored for irrigation in the soil in insurance against water scarcity and the use of water and nutrients as the way ensuring to be able to deliver the right amount of the contracted quality avoiding paying penalties with respect to water scarcity evidences suggest that producers respond to limitation in water availability by reducing the area planted by changing the type of crop grown and by saving water graveline and mérel 2014 thus increasing ie while water authorities on their side respond to water scarcity by applying shifts and quotas molle 2009 it is worth mentioning here that technological developments for irrigation to increase ie may have a rebound effect on water uses as the increase of ie enable to expand the irrigated area berbel et al 2018 and it can causes a reduction of the recoverable return flows grafton et al 2018 this condition highlights the need of an integrated strategy to tackle water scarcity issues that incorporate actions to alleviate potential damages and actions to regulate water uses enabling to expand irrigated area capitalising water savings while not increasing the pressure on water resources about water pricing scholars recognized that this instrument is not suitable for controlling the consumption of water in agriculture as water consumption is mostly influenced by other important factors i e markets crop perceived risk of failure but water pricing can at least dis incentivize water misuses molle and berkoff 2007 this is possible sometimes by applying volumetric pricing when irrigation water is supplied by water authorities through pressure pipes burt 2007 vos and vincent 2011 sometimes by differentiating water pricing with the crop when irrigation water is supplied by water authorities through open canals lika et al 2016 2017 sometimes by applying fees and regulation when the water for irrigation is directly withdrawn by farmers through wells berbel et al 2019 bogaert 2012 fox and walker 2002 in addition recent findings demonstrated that in the presence of multiple type of water resources water pricing for surface water resources could generate a rebound effects on the use of groundwater resources with the risk of aggravating rather than limiting the pressure on water resources portoghese et al 2021 to be effective water pricing should be accompanied by a range of instruments such as groundwater abstraction limits agricultural environmental compliance initiatives voluntary and mandatory bans and discharge restrictions on certain pollutants and obligations to restore or compensate for environmental damage berbel and expósito 2020 wichelns 2004 all in all market forces rules and incentives contribute influencing the exploitation of natural resource by farmers and especially water for irrigation beyond the factors that contribute influencing water uses in agriculture in most of the studies exploring the issue of water uses in agriculture irrigation management decisions depend essentially on the per hectare gross income function that relates a volume of water to crop revenues the shape of the gross income water function helps determining the optimal responses to water scarcity manning et al 2018 the functional relation between gross income and water volume in economic models is sometimes defined by assumptions lika et al 2016 econometric estimation graveline and mérel 2014 water stresses experiments fridgen et al 2000 crop simulation models foster et al 2014 garcía vila and fereres 2012 the annual volume of water is the decisional variable used in most of the existing economic models this is motivated by the fact that many agricultural economists focus their studies in analyzing the general environmental and policy implications about the use of water resources in agriculture i e pressures on the status of water resources regulatory and economic instruments such approaches although motivated by specific research questions disregard the temporal dimension of the problem with the consequence of undervaluing the circumstances that might cause temporary limitation on the availability of water resources the inclusion of the temporal dimension in the economic reasoning helps investigating the conditions justifying the implementation of regulatory instruments i e quota shifts and how these instruments should be implemented i e how to share quotas among farmers ho to distribute irrigation shifts among farmers assessing the efficacy of economic instruments in influencing water saving i e water pricing assessing the practicability of irrigation deficit strategies i e type of deficit irrigation strategy and period of application as a matter of fact the annual volume of water hides the effects of any temporary limitation in the availability of water resources leading to underestimate the real dimension of the problem missing to target sensitive regions but also failing to estimates the real consequences with the result of providing wrong water management and policy prescriptions english et al 2002 3 3 very often problems related to water management in agriculture appear of importance when analysing details i e growth stages and disapperars when such details are not considered in statistical sciences this phenomenon is called simpson s paradox and it was recently addressed in water related problems qian et al 2019 in decision making situation the simpson s paradox teaches that before analysing a problem we need first to figure out which level of detail is it worth to consider in chosing an action or in providing a policy prescription indeed by disregarding the temporal dimension it is implicitly assumed that farmers react to any limitation in the availability of water by minimizing losses as if they can freely choose when to save water and how much all along the growth season still that farmers are often forced to apply restrictions during the most sensitive growth stages of the crop foster et al 2014 and most recently lecina 2016 domínguez et al 2017 and manning et al 2018 deviated from the former approaches by modelling irrigation as a choice of evapotranspiration et targets for different phenological stages with the aim to connect a choice of et targets to water use and gross income their methodologies enable to identify the conditions crop and irrigation water prices phenological stages under which it is possible to apply deficit irrigation di limiting impacts on yield and gross income these scholars succeeded in integrating economic reasoning in agronomic problems enriching the discussion surrounding the issue of di in the irrigated agriculture in line with such scholars we further contributed to develop an optimization model integrating some fundamental agronomic yield water use relationship with few economic optimization principles to improve irrigation scheduling through simulation models in this respect we developed a dynamic programming approach providing irrigation advices on a daily basis and considering different sources of costs in recent years some new methods have been used in irrigation scheduling including genetic algorithms nguyen et al 2017 an effective global random search method and simulated annealing algorithms brown et al 2010 to the best of our knowledge these are among the most recent approaches suggested in the field of irrigation scheduling that in a nutshell are based on probabilistic techniques for approximating the global optimum the suggestion of these last approaches is driven by the fact that the identification of local optimum i e irrigation volume to apply at a given point in time to maximize the gross income in a given time interval do not guarantee the achievement of global optimum i e irrigation volume to apply at a given point in time to maximize the overall gross income of the crop in an optimization process that involve time dependent water yield relationship with the result of leading to sub optimal irrigation planning solutions a way to overcome the limitation of the classical mathematical programming techniques is in using iterative optimization processes as the aforementioned ones but these optimization techniques do not always guarantee to succeed in finding a correct prescription wolpert et al 1995 the dynamic programming approach offered in the present paper is powerful in obtaining stable solutions when it is satisfied a fundamental principle of optimality drawn from the seminal work of bellman and dreyfus 1962 namely a policy is optimal if at a stated period whatever the past decisions may have been the decisions still to be taken constitute an optimal policy when the result of the past decision is included the developed methodology builds up on the fundamental principle of optimality and on some additional insight from optimal control theory sargent 2000 inter alia optimal control theory allows dealing with problems of dynamic optimization with jump discontinuities a typical feature of irrigation scheduling irrigation is a spot intervention that is taken over time jump discontinuities can be handled with a specific typology of decisional variables named control variables these variables serve as the instruments of optimization influencing the optimal time path of and the values taken by states variables i e evapotranspiration to make this possible the objective function is usually accompanied by a conditional function known as the equation of motion that provides a mechanism that influence the values taken by the control then translated into a specific pattern of movement of states variables the distinction of the controls from states variables and other decisional variables is particularly fitting in the field of irrigation scheduling as it allows to treat separately and in sequence the issues of when to irrigate the control and of how much to irrigate to define the optimal time path of states variables i e evapotranspiration recent application of optimal control theory in the field of environmental economics can be found for the management of diffuse pollutants in water bodies grass and uecker 2017 for harvesting in fishery landi et al 2015 and for land use choices uecker 2016 amongst others as for our knowledge there are no application of optimal control theory in the field of irrigation scheduling for an extensive review on the topic refer to augeraud véron et al 2019 3 methodology in the present section we introduce i profit a dynamic optimization model to plan irrigation intervention during the irrigating season the model applies a deterministic approach following the structure of existing irrigation simulation models in general irrigation simulation models provide irrigation prescriptions on the basis of past choices i e the time and the amount of irrigation volume applied in the past and future average weather climatic conditions based on historical climatic data or on a combination of short term weather forecasts and climatic data differently from existing irrigation simulation that provide prescription on a maximum yield basis i profits allows identifying when to irrigate and how much to maximize gross income with gross income we consider the difference between crop revenues and variable irrigation costs this is a typical short run maximization problem focusing on optimizing irrigation scheduling once taken the choices regarding the crop to grow and the irrigation system to use the main assumption behind the approach here proposed are reported in table 1 among these assumptions the ones that requires a change on the approach proposed below is the perfect information about future weather conditions an assumption intrinsic to irrigation simulation models how to overcome relax this assumption as well as the perfect information about future price assumption is discussed in the conclusion as a further improvement of the developed methodology the reminder assumptions are considered while discussing our method in this section without loss of generalities in the following we offer a simplified formulation of the problem accompanied by a numerical example in appendix a while providing further details on how i profit is integrated into existing irrigation simulation models in the following section the per hectare gross income π function of a generic crop is introduced with eq 1 1 π t vy t e t 1 e t c x t here t is the time that begin with transplanting sowing and end with harvesting x t is a decisional variable that defines the irrigation volume to apply on day t e t is the crop evapotranspiration on day t y t e t 1 e t is the daily per hectare water yield function of a crop that relates the yield to the evapotranspiration on day t and to the evapotranspiration of previous time steps 4 4 the relation between the yield on day t and the evapotranspiration on day t 1 defines a linkage between any stresses suffered in the past and future production the daily water yield function represents the contribution provided by the irrigation on day t and previous periods on the final yield the daily water yield function can also be expressed as follows y t e t 1 e t y e t 1 e t e t 1 t y e t 1 e t e t 1 t namely the daily water yield function is defined by the difference between the expected yield with irrigation treated as a free decisional variable and the same expected yield in the absence of irrigation on day t worth noting that consistently with existing irrigation simulation models the water yield relationship on day t is defined by considering given the irrigation choices made in the past and assuming no water stresses in future periods the problem here described can be directly defined on y e t 1 e t e t 1 t and solved through the calculus of variation as an alternative to our approach this procedure is typically the one adopted in optimal control theory but it brings to analogs results considerably complicating the procedure here described c x t is the variable per hectare cost faced by the farmer to irrigate v is the expected output price the relation between the irrigation volume and the evapotranspiration become apparent when considering the daily water balance of the rootzone the daily water balance of the root zone relates the irrigation volume to the evapotranspiration schematically the root zone can be presented by means of a container in which the water content may fluctuate without loss of generality we simplify the soil water balance in the fashion of eq 2 2 l t 1 x t e t l t t here l t 1 is the amount of water available at time t and stored in the root zone in previous periods l t is the amount of water stored in the root zone for the next period 5 5 a more accurate description of the daily water balance model includes precipitation runoff capillary rise and water loss for deep percolation this specification is provided in appendix b and it reflect the formula provied in the fao irrigation and drainage paper n 56 allen et al 1998 in addition in our model x t is used interchangeably to represent the irrigation volume and the irrigation depth we do not intentionally introduce these terms here because they wouldn t change the main outcome of the model worth noting that both the structure of the production function and the water balance model are consistent with the fundamental principle of optimality a necessary condition to achieve global optimal solutions now assuming no water losses associated with irrigation except for deep percolation we can consider that x t ranges between the following threshold values 3 0 x t l t l t 1 t here l t is the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the root zone for the next period from eq 3 we can infer for the maximum irrigation volume to achieve field capacity x t and the time frame within which crop water requirement are fully satisfied as follows 4 x t t t t e t l t l t 1 t here e t is the crop evapotranspiration under no water stresses at time t l t 1 defines the threshold soil humidity level below which the crop start facing water stresses t defines the future time at which the crop start facing water stresses after irrigating to field capacity by focusing on the cost function we intentionally account of only those variable costs that can reasonably be influenced by planning irrigation intervention after having chosen what to grow and what irrigation system to adopt 6 6 there are basically two main decisional components that contribute conditioning if and how much water to apply at each time step of the growth season of a crop organization and economy the organization component is discretional to the farmer as farmers differs one another essentially because of labor and irrigation equipment availability an additional condition can be easily added to our problem by setting the minimum number of time steps with no irrigation after an irrigation intervention is performed this component is usually already part of the crop growth models used to drive irrigation scheduling so we prefer to focus on the economic component the economic component is related to the characteristic of the cost function with these premises we can consider two main cost items the cost to set up an irrigation intervention h and the volumetric cost k the costs to set up an irrigation intervention is mainly determined by the time spent to move the necessary equipment in the field valued at the cost of the labor employed or at the hourly rate of the contractor i e these costs are usually relevant for sprinkler irrigation while negligible for drip irrigation 7 7 in reality for drip irrigation we do have set up costs at the beginning of the irrigation season related to the installation of hoses cleaning of filters etc and at the end of the season to remove the material however planning irrigation intervention has no influence on these costs and therefore these are not considered in our problem the volumetric cost is mainly determined by the energy used to irrigate valued at its unit price i e these costs are usually relevant for both sprinkler and drip irrigation while negligible for gravity irrigation and or valued at the volumetric tariff i e this happen in the case farmers have to pay for irrigation on a volumetric basis although most frequently they pay a flat rate or a license for the use of private wells disconnected from the irrigation volume and therefore not influencing water uses the above considerations justify the structure of the per hectare variable cost function as follows 5 c x t kw t h i t here i t is a binary decisional variable that defines when to irrigate and it takes the value of 1 in the case it is worth irrigating 0 otherwise w t is a continuous decisional variable that defines how much to irrigate these decisional variables are interlinked in such a way that how much to irrigate is secondary to whether to irrigate in other words i t dominates w t if i t 1 then w t 0 if i t 0 then w t 0 the relation between x t and i t can be expressed by eq 6 6 x t w t i t here w t is the variable component of x t and i t is the binary component more precisely i t is our control variable whose value influence the ones taken by x t now that all the pieces of the problem are described we can introduce our optimization problem 7 max π t t v y t e t 1 l t 1 i t w t l t kw t h i t s t 8 i t w t l t l t 1 t 9 0 l t l t w t 0 e t 0 i t 0 1 t 10 w t 0 if i t 1 w t 0 if i t 0 t and 11 l 0 l 0 t t l 0 t given eq 7 is the objective function under maximization this equation is obtained by substituting eqs 2 5 and 6 into eqs 1 8 and 9 set the value boundaries for the irrigation volume to apply for the water content in the soil for the evapotranspiration and for the control it is worth to remind here that our decisional variables are represented by i t and w t while e t and l t are the state variables directly influenced by the decisional variables in addition i t e t and w t are flow variables as their variation is measured over time while l t is alike a stock variable powered by w t and feeding e t the flow nature of i t become apparent when considering its inclusion into the yield function and that the yield function is influenced by the values taken by the prior state variables e t thus the variation in the yield determined by the variation in the evapotranspiration triggers changes on i t and consequently on w t which in turn influence variations on state variables eq 10 defines the rules that influence the values taken by irrigation volume to apply when the control change finally eq 11 sets the initial level of the amount of water stored in the root zone and the time at which the crop reaches maturity a necessary condition to achieve an equilibrium solution the equilibrium solution of our problem allows identifying the rules about when and how much water to apply on day t as follows 12 d π d e t t t v y t e t 1 e t 0 t 13 i t 0 if d π d e t 0 i t 1 if d π d e t 0 and d π d i t t t t v y t e t 1 e t h t 14 w t 0 if i t 0 d π d w t t t t v y t e t 1 e t k t eq 12 describes how changes on the state variable e t affects changes on gross revenues any water stresses caused by a reduction on the evapotranspiration on day t influence gross revenues through a chain reaction that affect the potential contribution of future irrigation on the production any changes on gross revenues caused by changes on e t defined by eq 12 drives also the signs of eq 13 the marginal revenue on eq 12 is bound to increase over time without irrigation this value reflect the shadow price of water and it influence whether it is convenient to irrigate the marginal revenue on eq 12 equal zero in the absence of water stresses accordingly i t 0 as there is no reason to irrigate in the absence of water stresses i e d π d i t 0 if d π d e t 0 the opposite happens in the presence of water stresses i e d π d i t 0 if d π d e t 0 in both cases there is no reason to irrigate up until the time when the benefits brought by the irrigation intervention equals the costs or in other words up until the time where the benefits of irrigating outweigh the benefits of not irrigating i e t t t v y t e t 1 e t h 8 8 we recall here that eq 2 relates past and future soil water content states because of that the water balance at the time when an irrigation intervention is performed would be l t 1 x t l t e t the day after the water balance would be l t l t 1 e t 1 which can be rewritten as follows l t 1 x t e t l t 1 e t 1 following this procedure the day before the next irrigation intervention the water balance would be x t t t t 1 e t e t t this is to show that x t and consequently i t appears in the daily water yield function all along the interval between succeeding irrigation intervention as a consequence the water yield functions between succeeding irrigation intervention are all differentiable with respect to i t same considerations hold when differentiating the water yield functions with respect to w t worth noting that the benefits of irrigating increase with time as soil moisture decreases and the shadow price of irrigation water increases 9 9 the variation on the gross revenue of eq 13 can also be depicted as follows t t t v y t e t 1 e t t t t y t e t 1 e t i t 1 y t e t 1 e t i t 0 the item t defines the time at which the previous irrigation intervention was performed the value taken by y t e t 1 e t i t 0 is influenced by eq 12 and this value decreases as the shadow price of water increases it might be worth to set eqs 13 and 14 directly as a condition of the optimization problem here described in the case the mathematical programming software used to run the model does not allow to deal with binary decisional variables in synthesis eqs 12 and 13 together allow to minimize set up costs and enable identifying when to irrigate these equations tell us also that the higher the set up costs the greater the time interval between succeeding irrigation intervention to maximize gross income the time window between one irrigation and the next equals the time covered by the irrigation intervention to satisfy crop water requirements plus the time the crop start facing water stresses at least until the point where the benefit brought by the irrigation intervention equal set up costs such that t t t e t t t t e t t t t e t with e t e t where t defines the future time at which the crop start facing water stresses and t defines the time at which the next irrigation intervention will occur by violating the suggestions provided by the model about when to irrigate we fell into two sub optimal states 1 we may have an early irrigation on day t if set up costs outweigh benefits i e t t t v y t e t 1 e t h 2 on the other side we may have a delayed irrigation on day t if benefits outweigh set up costs i e t t t v y t e t 1 e t h eq 14 together with condition 8 defines the rules about how much water to apply when i t 1 in our simplified model the optimal irrigation volume to apply is influenced by the volumetric cost by soil moisture at filed capacity and by the soil water yield relation given the set up costs eq 14 is satisfied with strict equality in the case the effects of the volumetric cost on water uses outweigh the effects of the set up costs this happen both when condition 8 is not binding and eq 13 is binding and when condition 8 is binding and eq 13 is strictly greater than h with the first option the interval between one irrigation and the next is influenced exclusively by the set up costs while the volumetric costs contribute influencing exclusively the irrigation volume applied per irrigation intervention 10 10 worth noting that eq 13 allows identifying the minimum interval between one irrigation and the next that incorporates a period where the crop is under water stresses whose duration is influenced by the set up cost levels other things being equal differently eq 14 defines the optimal irrigation volume considering the effect of the volumetric cost on water uses in the same time window but in the absence of water stresses with the second option the irrigation volume is fixed at field capacity while the interval between one irrigation and the next it binds at a point in time where the marginal productivity of water with respect to water uses equals the volumetric cost which is a step forward with respect to the point in time where the marginal productivity of water with respect to the irrigation intervention equals the set up cost both options reducing the irrigation volume extending the interval between succeeding irrigation intervention brings to the same optimal solution in the case eq 14 is satisfied with strict equality 11 11 thus we fell into a condition of indeterminateness as more than one optimal solution is valid to solve this problem we have to run the optimization problem in two steps first by imposing a strict equality to condition 8 second by running the optimization in the absence of volumetric costs store the i t optimal values and run again the problem introducing volumetric costs be that as it may existing mathematical programming software offer the possibility to impose a priority on the control allowing avoiding the two steps optimization procedure described for the second option the suggested procedure allows identifying two boundary optimal solutions one with less water per irrigation and higher frequencies of irrigation and one with more water per irrigation and lower frequencies of irrigation the first option might be preferred in the presence of nutrient leaching issues the second in the presence of labor availability or soil salinity issues the volumetric cost does not influence the irrigation prescription in the case eq 14 is not satisfied with strict equality and the problem solves with one single optimal solution exclusively influenced by the set up cost level 12 12 worth noting that the effects brought by the set up costs are similar to the effects brought by a limitation on water uses as a consequence the volumetric cost influence water uses when these costs outweigh the shadow price of water all in all these considerations allow to conclude that the higher the set up cost the higher the volumetric cost threshold above which volumetric costs start influencing water uses and the lower the effects of the volumetric costs on water uses eq 14 tell us also that the higher the volumetric cost the greater the effect on water uses worth noting that being other things equal in the absence of set up cost there is no reason to store water into the rootzone for the future as it would be more convenient irrigating day by day 13 13 the convenience of irrigating day by day in the absence of set up costs is especially evident when considering water losses for deep percolation accounting of water losses would not change the economic implications so far discussed however the demand for irrigation gets steeper with increasing losses with the results of narrowing the interval between successive irrigation intervention in synthesis the relation between eqs 12 14 and condition 8 highlights the mechanism that relates the value of i t and w t with the values of e t or in other words the mechanisms that explain how the value of the control is influenced by the past dynamic of the state variable and how the control contributes influencing the future dynamic of the state variable appendix a provides a simple numerical example to better appreciate the robustness of the developed approach fig 1 depict the relationships above analyzed the figure shows gains and losses associated with different irrigation volume on day t to satisfy crop water requirements just on day t and in a time window between day t and day t t where t is the time at which the next irrigation event will occur specifically w t represents the optimal irrigation volume to maximize gross income on day t such quantity is the projection on the x axes of the cross point between the marginal volumetric costs k and the marginal revenue curve π t this is a necessary and sufficient condition to maximize gross income on day t if assuming zero set up costs h 0 similarly w t represents the optimal irrigation volume on day t to maximize gross income in a time window between day t and day t t such quantity is the projection on the x axes of the cross point between the marginal volumetric costs k and the marginal revenue curve π t the marginal revenue curve π t is higher than π t because it aggregates the demand curves of subsequent periods in this scenario we suppose positive set up costs levels h 0 because of that the last part of the marginal revenue curve π t is truncated increasing set up cost levels results with a shift upward of the demand curve the shift upward of the demand curve is determined by increasing the interval between one irrigation and the next as a consequence the truncated portion of the demand curve increases with increasing set up cost levels in light of eq 13 the set up cost equals the area below the demand curve right to the point w t the marginal volumetric cost k influences the optimal irrigation volume only if this is higher than the threshold level k defined by projection on the y axes at the point where the demand curve is truncated as shown by the figure the effect might be that of reducing the irrigation volume however same optimal solution can be achieved by maintaining the amount of irrigation water at field capacity and widening the time interval between one irrigation and the next graphically that would result in an upward shift of the marginal revenue curve up until the point where the curve cross the threshold level of k in the absence of set up cost i e h 0 there is no reason to store water for the future on a cost perspective as a consequence the irrigation volume would equal w t and the local optimum solution is aligned with the global optimum conversely the presence of set up cost i e h 0 justifies the need to store water for the future as a consequence the irrigation volume would equal w t and the global optimum is satisfied but is not anymore aligned with the local optimum the model might bring to a sub optimal solution locally i e suggesting to apply more water than the quantity needed to satisfy the crop water requirement at a given point in time while to an optimal solution globally i e storing water for future periods at a given point in time to reduce the number of irrigation intervention minimizing economic losses and maximizing gross income in summary in the simplified model presented here under given crop phenological characteristics and soil and climatic conditions the marginal revenue the set up cost and the volumetric cost contribute influencing the convenience of when to irrigate and how much worth noting that the optimization approach so far developed can be enriched with a number of conditions see the one reported in table 1 as for example a constrain on water availability can be added to the optimization model depicted in eqs 7 11 to further highlight the potentiality of the method above described 15 t w t w here w is the total available water for the season when this constraint is satisfied with strict equality the farmer experiences some restriction on water availability with direct consequences on yield with this constraint the optimization model allows to automatically select the best periods to apply restrictions on water uses during the growth season to minimize yield losses this happens when the benefits brought by each irrigation intervention equals the shadow price of water all along the growth stages of the crop with the inclusion of such constraint it is implicitly assumed that the farmer can freely choose to allocate the available water all along the irrigating season as if the water for irrigation can be stored at the beginning of the season the application of such constraint might also be useful to optimize deficit irrigation techniques and can be applied to limited time intervals if limitations in water availability are contingent to specific periods so far i profits provides ideal prescriptions about irrigation to maximize gross income in the short term although other important factors that are out of the scope of the present study contribute influencing farmers decisions these prescriptions follow the priorities when and how much to irrigate these priorities depend only partially on the costs to irrigate for instance the when perspective is largely influenced by the workforce availability and the operational capacity of the irrigation system minimum and maximum flow rate the how much perspective is largely influenced by considerations of the human behavior type e g the fear of an imminent rise in demand for evapotranspiration or a possible limitation of use of the resource whatever are the reasons that push the farmer to take decision that differs from the ones suggested by the model such decisions once undertaken by the farmers can be incorporated in the model as hind cast to adjust future prescriptions even in the case the farmer is not in the condition to follow model prescriptions the model can provide useful information to estimate the opportunity costs faced by the farmer due to her sub optimal decisions on a crop gross income maximizing perspective 4 i profit integration with aquacrop i profit can be integrated into existing irrigation simulation models in two main ways plug in and full integration unlike the full integration the plug in does not require a full knowledge of how the simulation model works i e how the yield is related to water uses and or how past choices are related to future outcomes but is less efficient i e it requires more computational efforts with the plug in option eqs 12 14 must be imposed as a condition to the optimization problem to obtain optimal outcomes while with full integration this is not required as equilibrium conditions are internally determined with respect to the irrigation simulation model acquacrop v 6 1 the procedure adopted to identify the optimal interval between one irrigation and the next with the plug in option is as follows 1 run the simulation irrigation model from time t to t with and without irrigation and store simulation results 2 calculate the daily contribution on crop yield by multiplying the cumulative crop transpiration with the water productivity index and the harvest index 3 calculate expected revenues perform the difference between the two simulation and compare the difference with the set up costs to identify how much water to apply the procedure is as follows 1 calculate the ratio between the differences in revenues and the differences in the evapotranspiration if this ratio is above the volumetric cost irrigation has to be performed at field capacity otherwise 2 1 option 1 reducing the irrigation volume the irrigation volume per irrigation intervention should be reduced progressively with iterative run of the irrigation simulation model until marginal revenues equals the volumetric cost at the point in time where differences in revenues equals the set up cost 2 2 option 2 moving forward the time when the next irrigation intervention will be performed identify the point in time where marginal revenues equals the volumetric cost with the full integration option there is a need to exactly know the crop soil water dynamics and how canopy and root expansion and transpiration are affected by water stresses besides reshaping the procedure used to calculate the irrigation advice 5 i profit simulation example in the following we tested i profit by using the acquacrop v 6 1 simulation outcome of a crop with specific physiological characteristics and cultivated under given pedo climatic and economic water and output pricing condition specifically the aquacrop model has been calibrated for processing tomato using data collected in field experiments carried out in the last decade in the po valley italy the data collected included data on soil climate soil water content measurements fruits weights and plant biomass the latter recorded at least in correspondence of critical plant phenological development more information available at battilani et al 2015 rainfall measurements and all the data needed to calculate evapotranspiration by a penman monteith allen equation were available at hourly time steps available online at http www smr arpa emr it dext3r the experiments were carried out on silty clay soils typical of the po valley low land fine sand 30 silt 50 clay 20 those soils are deep and without notice able skeleton 2 mm an extended shallow water table is usually present during the growing season at a depth ranging from 0 60 m to 1 5 1 8 m the climate in the test area is sub humid and the total amount of yearly rainfall is about 750 850 mm crop water requirements ranges between 2 700 and 3 200 mm and the yield between 63 and 80 t ha irrigation for processing tomato is usually performed through gun hereafter sprinkler or drip irrigation systems in the region typically irrigation frequency is set from 2 to 3 times per weeks up to daily according with the evapotranspiration patterns and rainfall distribution sprinkler irrigation is usually made by means of reel irrigation machines with an interval of 3 10 days according to the machine availability minimum volume of about 10 15 mm the calibrated model has been validated for soil water content total yield harvest index total biomass and its partition in above ground vegetation and fruit on eight independent datasets collected in a period ranging from 2004 to 2010 the calibrated parameters to run the aquacrop simulation are provided in appendix b in the present study the weather data of 2013 were used for simulations as well as the economic data reported in appendix c the example provided here is consistent with the approach developed by steduto et al 2009 and it is meant to develop sensitivity analyses to show how the set up and the volumetric irrigation costs contribute influencing irrigation prescriptions to maximize gross income in an aquacrop like setting specifically we used the following procedure to implement the methodology described above 1 calculate the irrigation prescriptions in the absence of water stresses and without imposing any particular irrigation rule irrigation volume time interval between subsequent irrigation events through the fao irrigation model acquacrop v 6 1 using the data provided by linker et al 2016 2 adapting i profit to aquacrop irrigation simulation model see appendix b for further detail about how the integration is performed 3 integrating the daily output of the irrigation model soil water balance and crop coefficients to calculate yield responses to water stresses along the growth season and economic information from the technical literature input and output prices time needed to equip an irrigation intervention labor costs yield conversion of dry matter to fresh matter 4 recalculate the irrigation prescriptions using information from the output of the agronomic model and the other economic information sources by the means of the economic optimization model here introduced and solved using a mixed integer nonlinear programming solver with the mathematical programming software gams v 24 3 http old gams com 14 14 in gams it is qualified as a prior in a way that the problem is first solved for it which defines the time path of irrigation interventions and then for w t which defines the irrigation volume to apply for each intervention the results reported below should be read by way of example to show how irrigation prescriptions change when integrating an economic optimization logic into existing agronomic models an additional numerical example to better appreciate the goodness of the developed methodology is provided in appendix a 6 results in fig 2 we show optimum irrigation planning under different cost scenarios with no costs k 0 m3 h 0 i the system suggests planning a total number of 24 irrigation intervention for a total amount of 3 100 m3 ha of irrigation water top left graph in fig 2 in the presence of set up costs k 0 m3 h 30 i the system suggests planning a total number of 6 irrigation intervention for a total amount of 2 823 m3 ha of irrigation water down left graph in fig 2 in the presence of volumetric costs k 0 15 m3 h 0 i the system suggests planning a total number of 23 irrigation intervention for a total amount of 2 740 m3 ha of irrigation water up left graph in fig 1 in the presence of volumetric costs and set up costs k 0 15 m3 h 30 i the system suggests planning a total number of 5 irrigation intervention for a total amount of 2 540 m3 ha of irrigation water down right graph in fig 2 for the no cost scenario irrigation is not constrained by construction when the cost to set up an irrigation intervention is null the amount of water stored in the rootzone for the subsequent periods is also null and the number of irrigation intervention is maximized the irrigation advises changes drastically when including a cost item into the optimization model k 0 h 0 when activating the costs to set up an irrigation intervention h 0 the number of irrigation interventions suggested by the model drop down as well as the irrigation volume conversely when activating the volumetric cost k 0 the suggested number of irrigation intervention does not vary significantly while the suggested irrigation volume decreases this happen because at each time step of the growth season the model suggests whether to irrigate and how much on the basis of the equality between irrigation marginal costs at time t and the sum of the benefits obtained from time t onwards because of that irrigation intervention this equality is satisfied for decreasing irrigation volume when the volumetric cost increase as a result with positive volumetric cost levels the overall irrigation volume is reduced but the number of irrigation intervention is not necessarily reduced when the cost to set up an irrigation intervention is active this influences the length of the interval between subsequent irrigation intervention and necessarily the irrigation volume this effect is better highlighted in fig 3 the figure shows the trend of the frequency of irrigation intervention fig 3a and of the amount of irrigation water to apply fig 3b for increasing costs to irrigate the trend is provided for the two different costs items k and h treated as independent costs specifically the dotted line in fig 3 represent the trend of the frequency of irrigation intervention and of the amount of irrigation water to apply for increasing set up costs while the straight line represents the trend of the frequency of irrigation intervention and of the amount of irrigation water to apply for increasing volumetric costs for the set up cost the frequency of irrigation intervention suggested by the model drop down just when the cost to set up an irrigation intervention is very low dotted line in fig 3a but without significantly influencing the total irrigation volume dotted line in fig 3b in addition when the set up cost is high the reduction in the frequency of irrigation intervention is very low conversely the reduction in the irrigation volume is very high this is not the case for the volumetric cost here both the frequencies of irrigation intervention straight line in fig 3a and the irrigation volume straight line in fig 3b gradually decreases for increasing costs in general fig 3 reveal that for increasing irrigation costs the discrepancy between the frequency of irrigation intervention among the comparing cost items tend to decrease while the discrepancy in the irrigation volume to apply among the comparing cost items tend to increase fig 4 depict the cross influence of the two sources of irrigation cost set up costs and volumetric costs on the optimal irrigation volume to apply to maximize gross income in the absence of set up costs the optimal amount of irrigation water steadily decreases for increasing volumetric irrigation costs in the presence of set up costs the optimal amount of irrigation water decreases discontinuously in steps such discontinuity is stressed for increasing irrigation set up cost levels that is consistently with our theoretical implications the volumetric cost is less likely to condition water uses for increasing set up cost level the horizontal portion of the curves depicted in fig 4 point out no cost effects on the optimal irrigation volume to apply this happens because the reduction in water uses determined by the activation of set up costs is higher than the reduction in water uses influenced by the volumetric cost finally fig 5 depict the maximum yield and gross income trend for different water availability levels the two curves in fig 5 are obtained by incorporating eq 12 within the optimization problem described from eqs 3 6 and running the optimization iteratively for different water availability levels the optimization procedure so far developed allows identifying the best allocation of water during the entire growth season to minimize gross income losses in other words this procedure allows identifying efficient water uses and yield targets necessary to design optimal irrigation planning 7 discussion technical and policy implication the methodology presented with this paper contributed enriching the literature developed in the field of irrigation scheduling doorenbos and kassam 1979 hunsaker et al 2015 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 basically the approach offered here describes an estimating procedure that allows to shift from the conventional maximum yield paradigm to drive the irrigation advice jones 2004 zhang et al 2019 not even to the maximal water productivity but to a gross income maximization paradigm the paper focused on analyzing the very first implication of such approach at the crop level explaining the way how irrigation costs contribute influencing the irrigation advice the method allows reducing the discretion left to the farmer in defining the time intervals between consecutive irrigation interventions by automatically suggesting when to irrigate and how much such a peculiarity of the proposed method is particularly valuable in the case the water available for irrigation is limited as it allows identifying when it is more convenient to save water the scope of application of the method developed in this study can be extended beyond the farm level to support normative analysis including regulatory and water pricing policies about water pricing most of the normative approaches analyzing the implication of water pricing in agriculture reveal that water pricing discourage water misuses although sometimes water pricing is not efficient galioto et al 2013 lika et al 2016 2017 such theoretical implications often conflict with empirical evidences that largely demonstrated the ineffectiveness of water pricing in agriculture bogaert 2012 molle 2009 the theoretical literature on water pricing largely ignores the temporal dimension of the problem which is instead revealed to be of crucial importance in the empirical analysis the lesson learned from the empirical evidences is that a tariff proportional to the volume of water applied with irrigation is usually too low to influence water uses and that even when the tariff is high the effect on water uses is negligible at critical moments of the growth season molle and berkoff 2007 the approach developed in this study is consistent with the empirical evidence in that it demonstrated that any changes in water prices does not necessarily results with changes in the irrigation prescription and that the impact varies with the different stages of the growth season 8 conclusions limits and perspectives the methodology developed in this study allows to provide a recommendation on how best to manage irrigation scheduling time by time to achieve a global optimum to the best of our knowledge the most recent approaches suggested in the field of irrigation scheduling jin et al 2012 linker et al 2016 mun et al 2015 allow to achieve an approximation of the global optimum such approximation might fail in providing a correct prescription wolpert et al 1995 a limit of the method developed in the present study is in that it gives recommendations on how best to manage irrigation from the current day until the end of the season however the recommendation is only valid for a few days after the current day this happens because the optimization procedure cannot include an exact knowledge of the future climate and in particular of the future precipitation precipitation was not included on purpose on the developed model no doubt for on farm scheduling future climate variability is important this explain the development of recent methodologies to manage uncertainty in the field of irrigation scheduling jin et al 2012 mun et al 2015 such uncertainty is further exacerbated by no exact knowledge of future prices which poses similar methodological issues lecina 2016 as for example the dynamic interval programming technique developed by jin et al 2012 to make optimal decisions under uncertainty can be easily integrated with the approach developed in this study by running recursively the model for upper and lower precipitations state scenarios weighted by the relevant probabilities of occurrence however in the opinion of the authors an important step forward for the proposed method would be that of adjusting prescriptions by accounting of the accuracy of forecasts in the fashion already developed in a recent study galioto et al 2020 and by nesting the approach developed with this study into a markov process a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event this way it would be possible to estimate the risk of failure associated to any delay in the application of the irrigation prescription further enriching the information environment under which the farmer operates besides the aforementioned limits the approach developed in this study allows to estimate the economic consequences caused by any restriction in water availability time by time for different type of crop and under different agronomic conditions enabling amplifying the scope of application of the method from the crop level to the farm and district level the application of the method at the farm level would help farmers driving their diversification strategies in the case water availability is an issue they have to deal with the application of the method at the district level would help driving water authorities regulatory prescriptions addressed to farmers served by irrigation networks in this case the method would help classifying priorities of intervention to establish shifts and turns for irrigation during the growth season in this respect i profit can be used as a plug in water supply system models to define operating rules to minimize economic losses like for instance realm perera et al 2005 in a broader context scheduling implementing also economic management criteria can help considering the aspects related to wefe nexus water energy food and environment including those

appendix a i profit numerical example in this appendix we provide a numerical example to deepen on the gross income maximization rules described in section 3 to plan irrigation intervention this example is provided for illustrative purpose only with the aim of showing how the developed approach works in practice and how it can be easily adapted to real world conditions imagine that the daily water yield function of a generic crop takes the following form a 1 y t a e t b e 2 t t here a and b are generic crop parameters that relates evapotranspiration to crop yield these parameters are assumed not varying with time the evapotranspiration is assumed being related to soil moisture and irrigation in the same fashion of eq 2 from eq 4 we can infer the future time at which the crop start facing water stresses after the irrigation such that t t l t l t 1 e t here l t is the soil humidity at field capacity l t 1 is the threshold level of soil moisture below which the crop start facing water stresses and e t is the daily crop evapotranspiration in the absence of water stresses below the soil moisture threshold level the crop evapotranspiration shrinks down its potential and its reduction become more severe with time the dynamic of the evapotranspiration when the soil moisture fell below the threshold level in the absence of external input of water can be depicted in the following fashion a 2 e t t ϱ t t 1 ϱ ϱ e t t here ϱ is a reduction factor that ranges between 0 and 1 and it is supposed to be influenced by crop and soil characteristics namely the evapotranspiration after day t t fell down as time passes in the absence external input of water and its reduction is more severe with low level of ϱ eq 13 allows identifying the interval between one irrigation and the next to maximize gross income based on our assumption condition 13 can be rearranged as follows a 3 vy t ϱ t t 1 ϱ ϱ v y t h t here t t t is the time interval between one irrigation and the next worth noting that t is divided into two sub intervals i e the time window where crop water requirements are fully satisfied by the irrigation intervention t t and the time window where the crop is subject to increasing water stresses t t vy t is the cumulative revenue between one irrigation and the next and v y t is the maximum revenue achieved in the absence of water stresses in the same time condition 13 tells us that it is worth irrigating when the revenue loss associated with water stresses achieves the threshold value of h below h the interval between one irrigation and the next would be too narrow with the effect to exceed in costs and misuse water above h the interval between one irrigation and the next would be too far with the effect to lose production although reducing water uses in the present example we can rearrange condition 13 to obtain the time window where the crop is under increasing water stresses as follows t t ϱ 1 ϱ v y t vy t h the time under water stress tend to increase when ϱ is high low the reduction on e t with time when h is high and when v is low this is to highlight that a mix of crop soil and economic conditions contribute influencing the optimal time path between one irrigation and the next once identified the optimal time path between succeeding irrigation intervention it is necessary to determine how much water to apply to maximize gross income in light of the volumetric costs this is possible by maximizing the gross income function of eq 1 subject to eq 4 with respect to the irrigation volume to apply in the time interval between succeeding irrigation intervention identified in the first step t this way we would obtain the optimal irrigation volume as follows a 4 w t min a k 2 b t t a 2 b t t 1 a 2 b t t t ϱ t t 1 ϱ ϱ a 2 b namely w t can take two values and only one of the two values is influenced by the volumetric cost the volumetric cost plays a role in influencing water uses if its effects outweigh the set up cost effects first term on the rhs of eq a 4 this happen when eq 4 does not binds at the optimum otherwise the volumetric cost effect is null or rather is covered by the reduction in water uses determined by optimizing the number of irrigation intervention second term on the rhs of eq a 4 table a 1 provides the parameters used to develop the above exercise results fig a 1 a depict the gross income generated using the parameters values reported in table a 1 for different time intervals between succeeding irrigation intervention in the primary y axis and water uses in the secondary y axis the irrigation volume reduces with increasing time interval between one irrigation and the next while the gross income achieve a maximum at a 6 days interval in our example the 6 days interval is the point at which the variation in gross income due to the irrigation intervention approaches the set up cost value consistently with condition 13 fig a 1 b depict the relation between the amount of irrigation water and volumetric costs for different time interval between one irrigation and the next the figure shows that volumetric costs start influencing water uses for a value above 0 10 m3 when the time interval between one irrigation and the next is of 6 days the optimal time path the threshold above which the volumetric cost start influencing water uses condition 4 does not binds at the equilibrium tend to increase as the time between one irrigation and the next increases appendix b focus on the crop water production function eq 1 approximates the crop water production function depicted in the fao irrigation and drainage paper n 66 eq a 1 convey the relationship between the crop water production function of eq 1 and the fao crop water production function b 1 y t e t 1 e t h t w t k s t e t k c t e t 1 e 0 t t where h t is the harvest index w t is the water productivity factor k s t e t is a dimensionless transpiration reduction factor dependent on the soil water root zone content and indirectly to irrigation k c t e t 1 is the crop coefficient whose value is influenced by canopy cover at time t 1 e 0 t is the potential reference evapotranspiration the potential reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the crop coefficient determine the potential crop evapotranspiration the potential crop evapotranspiration multiplied by crop stress coefficient finally determine the actual crop evapotranspiration e t the water stress coefficient is then obtained by the following equation b 2 k s t 0 if l t d t 1 if d t l r l t d t l t l r if l t d t l r t here l t is the total available soil water in the root zone which is obtained by the difference between the water content at field capacity and the water content at wilting point l r is the readily available soil water in the root zone that is a fraction of the total available soil water that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress reduction in et occurs l r p l t with 0 p 1 d t is the soil water root depletion where d t l t l t the soil water root depletion results from a daily water balance computation for the root zone rainfall irrigation and capillary rise of groundwater towards the root zone add water to the root zone and decrease the root zone depletion soil evaporation crop transpiration and percolation losses remove water from the root zone and increase the depletion the daily water balance expressed in terms of depletion at the end of the day is b 3 d t d t 1 p t ro t ρ x t cr t e t r t t where d t is the root zone depletion at the end of day t d t 1 is the water content in the root zone at the end of the previous day t 1 p t is the precipitation on day t r o t is the runoff from the soil surface on day t ρ x t is the net irrigation depth on day t that infiltrates the soil where x t is the irrigation volume and ρ is a discount factor whose value which ranges between 0 and 1 is influenced by the irrigation efficiency of the irrigation system cr t is the capillary rise from the groundwater table on day t et x t is the crop evapotranspiration on day t r t is the water loss out of the root zone by deep percolation on day t eq a 3 can be easily converted into eq 2 by assuming that c r t r 0 t p t 0 r t 0 and ρ 1 appendix c tomato model parameters the information provided in table c 1 and weather data were used to estimate crop evapotranspiration the canopy development and water balance variables of processing tomato in the absence of water stresses all along the growth season table c 2 provides the economic information used in i profits that together with the agronomic parameters obtained by running aquacrop enable to adjust irrigation prescriptions maximizing gross income worth noting that the economic parameters provided in table c 2 are reference parameters however the paper provides a sensitivity analysis using values above and below such reference parameters with the purpose to highlight how the variation of these parameters can potentially influence irrigation prescriptions 
10178,in this paper we develop an agro economic model to plan irrigation interventions specifically we set up an economic optimization model that incorporates typical crop soil water physical relationships the approach described in the paper offers a straightforward estimating procedure that allows to shift from the conventional maximum yield paradigm to drive the irrigation advice to a gross income maximization paradigm the paper focuses on analyzing the very first implication of such approach at the crop level explaining the way how irrigation costs contribute influencing the irrigation advice an empirical example is provided to show the procedure used to nest the developed method into an existing crop water model and to show its practical implication on the irrigation advise a discussion follows on what the described approach differs from other recent approaches developed in the field of irrigation scheduling and on how the scope of application of the method can be extended beyond the farm level the paper concludes highlighting pitfall and suggesting possible solution to further improve the quality of the irrigation advise keywords irrigation scheduling dynamic optimization agro economic crop simulation models 1 introduction thanks to the recent development of proximity and remote sensing devices the accuracy of soil water balance models in providing irrigation advices improved and nowadays there is some evidence about the application of irrigation simulation models to support farmers in irrigation scheduling in different regions mun et al 2015 1 1 about recent advances in simulation modelling a number of studies was recently developed to design deficit irrigation scheduling simulation models aiming both to satisfy the full crop water requirement and to increasing the efficiency of water uses so as to give the highest crop production with the least water use comas et al 2019 fereres and soriano 2007 hunsaker et al 2015 jones 2004 nguyen et al 2017 padilla díaz et al 2016 these models usually provide good results when locally calibrated nevertheless as for our knowledge models uptake by farmers still is quite jeopardized and limited to few crops in one hand the reason can be found in their lack of resilience to non pristine plant growth patterns and climate conditions which are occurring frequently under the pressure of climate changes in the other hand irrigation models do not explicitly account of some important economic aspects that can contribute improving the quality of the irrigation advice the convenience to perform an irrigation intervention and how much to irrigate are the main questions to answer on the ground of these simple information farmers will operate their choice therefore there is still a need to estimate the consequences of water uses on farmers incomes and on how these consequences translates into the irrigation advice the information gap and irrigation models application limit can be worked out at least partially by shifting the paradigm of their objective function from minimum resource use maximum yield strategy to a gross income maximizing strategy which better integrate and harmonize also those off farm pressures that frequently greatly influence farmers decisions english et al 2002 the gross income maximizing strategy paradigm approach considers that marginal stresses except during critical reproductive stages may not affect yield value enough to justify resources and irrigation costs such optimization perspective is particularly interesting for crops grown in conditions of limited water availability water stored in reservoirs as it allows to rationalize water uses along the entire growth season by automatically identifying the periods when it is worth saving water this paper describes the irrigation scheduling gross income maximizing model i profit we develop i profit contributes to the agricultural economics and agronomy literatures by integrating the concepts of marginal revenues and costs with respect to water uses along the growth stages of the crop providing a useful tool to plan irrigation intervention and eventually to set up deficit irrigation strategies under limited water availability conditions specifically the present study progress on recent approaches developed in the field of irrigation scheduling foster et al 2014 lecina 2016 manning et al 2018 switching from a crop stage optimization perspective to a daily basis optimization perspective to allow its use for prescriptive purposes moreover i profit account of two main costs items that mostly contribute influencing gross revenues after having chosen what to grow and what irrigation system to adopt these are the cost to set up an irrigation intervention mainly related to the time spent to move the necessary equipment in the field and the volumetric water use cost mainly related to energy uses and incentive tariffs the developed methodology allows identifying how these costs contribute identifying when to irrigate and how much water to apply to maximize the per hectare crop gross income a numerical example followed by a simulation based on recently published information linker et al 2016 for processing tomato is provided to illustrate how the optimization procedure works in practice how the model can be plug in into existing irrigation models and how the model can improve the irrigation advice the simulation is provided for both sprinkler and drip irrigation to account of the influence of different irrigation systems on the relevance of the analyzed sources of costs the irrigation simulation model used in this paper to test i profit is acquacrop which is based on the fundamentals crop water functions developed by steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 the reminder of the paper is organized in the following sections state of the art where we provide a description of the main factors that contribute influencing water management in agriculture and on how agricultural economists mostly build their normative prescriptions to deal with water scarcity problems the limits of such approaches and the solution offered by recent approaches including the one proposed in this study methodology where we describe the developed optimization procedure i profit integration with aquacrop to illustrate how to integrate our model with an existing irrigation simulation model i profit simulation example to illustrate the implications of changes in the structure and in the value of irrigation costs on the irrigation prescription discussions where we provide some technical and policy implication associated with the irrigation scheduling approach developed in this study including applications that go beyond the operational application studied in this paper conclusions where we discuss the limits of our study and the methodological and operational perspectives of the developed approach 2 state of the art the economic literature explored the issue of water uses in agriculture mainly to analyze the farmers behaviors in response to the globalization of markets yang et al 2003 to water scarcity garcía vila and fereres 2012 and to water pricing molle and berkoff 2007 the globalization of markets is certainly the overarching aspect influencing water uses in agriculture yang et al 2003 shown how decreasing profitability put pressure on domestic food production the problem is nowadays even more actual in a globalised context where agriculture s products are traded as commodities farmers are challenged by international markets and have to face unfair market rules that had made them more and more dependent to governmental compensations and subsidies this situation lasting since decades has deeply changed farmers risk perception and responses transforming the increase of irrigation efficiency ie 2 2 field ie is the ratio of the volume of all irrigation water beneficially used on a farmer s field predominantly evapotranspiration et by crops and salt removal to maintain soil productivity to the total volume of irrigation water applied adjusted for changes in water stored for irrigation in the soil in insurance against water scarcity and the use of water and nutrients as the way ensuring to be able to deliver the right amount of the contracted quality avoiding paying penalties with respect to water scarcity evidences suggest that producers respond to limitation in water availability by reducing the area planted by changing the type of crop grown and by saving water graveline and mérel 2014 thus increasing ie while water authorities on their side respond to water scarcity by applying shifts and quotas molle 2009 it is worth mentioning here that technological developments for irrigation to increase ie may have a rebound effect on water uses as the increase of ie enable to expand the irrigated area berbel et al 2018 and it can causes a reduction of the recoverable return flows grafton et al 2018 this condition highlights the need of an integrated strategy to tackle water scarcity issues that incorporate actions to alleviate potential damages and actions to regulate water uses enabling to expand irrigated area capitalising water savings while not increasing the pressure on water resources about water pricing scholars recognized that this instrument is not suitable for controlling the consumption of water in agriculture as water consumption is mostly influenced by other important factors i e markets crop perceived risk of failure but water pricing can at least dis incentivize water misuses molle and berkoff 2007 this is possible sometimes by applying volumetric pricing when irrigation water is supplied by water authorities through pressure pipes burt 2007 vos and vincent 2011 sometimes by differentiating water pricing with the crop when irrigation water is supplied by water authorities through open canals lika et al 2016 2017 sometimes by applying fees and regulation when the water for irrigation is directly withdrawn by farmers through wells berbel et al 2019 bogaert 2012 fox and walker 2002 in addition recent findings demonstrated that in the presence of multiple type of water resources water pricing for surface water resources could generate a rebound effects on the use of groundwater resources with the risk of aggravating rather than limiting the pressure on water resources portoghese et al 2021 to be effective water pricing should be accompanied by a range of instruments such as groundwater abstraction limits agricultural environmental compliance initiatives voluntary and mandatory bans and discharge restrictions on certain pollutants and obligations to restore or compensate for environmental damage berbel and expósito 2020 wichelns 2004 all in all market forces rules and incentives contribute influencing the exploitation of natural resource by farmers and especially water for irrigation beyond the factors that contribute influencing water uses in agriculture in most of the studies exploring the issue of water uses in agriculture irrigation management decisions depend essentially on the per hectare gross income function that relates a volume of water to crop revenues the shape of the gross income water function helps determining the optimal responses to water scarcity manning et al 2018 the functional relation between gross income and water volume in economic models is sometimes defined by assumptions lika et al 2016 econometric estimation graveline and mérel 2014 water stresses experiments fridgen et al 2000 crop simulation models foster et al 2014 garcía vila and fereres 2012 the annual volume of water is the decisional variable used in most of the existing economic models this is motivated by the fact that many agricultural economists focus their studies in analyzing the general environmental and policy implications about the use of water resources in agriculture i e pressures on the status of water resources regulatory and economic instruments such approaches although motivated by specific research questions disregard the temporal dimension of the problem with the consequence of undervaluing the circumstances that might cause temporary limitation on the availability of water resources the inclusion of the temporal dimension in the economic reasoning helps investigating the conditions justifying the implementation of regulatory instruments i e quota shifts and how these instruments should be implemented i e how to share quotas among farmers ho to distribute irrigation shifts among farmers assessing the efficacy of economic instruments in influencing water saving i e water pricing assessing the practicability of irrigation deficit strategies i e type of deficit irrigation strategy and period of application as a matter of fact the annual volume of water hides the effects of any temporary limitation in the availability of water resources leading to underestimate the real dimension of the problem missing to target sensitive regions but also failing to estimates the real consequences with the result of providing wrong water management and policy prescriptions english et al 2002 3 3 very often problems related to water management in agriculture appear of importance when analysing details i e growth stages and disapperars when such details are not considered in statistical sciences this phenomenon is called simpson s paradox and it was recently addressed in water related problems qian et al 2019 in decision making situation the simpson s paradox teaches that before analysing a problem we need first to figure out which level of detail is it worth to consider in chosing an action or in providing a policy prescription indeed by disregarding the temporal dimension it is implicitly assumed that farmers react to any limitation in the availability of water by minimizing losses as if they can freely choose when to save water and how much all along the growth season still that farmers are often forced to apply restrictions during the most sensitive growth stages of the crop foster et al 2014 and most recently lecina 2016 domínguez et al 2017 and manning et al 2018 deviated from the former approaches by modelling irrigation as a choice of evapotranspiration et targets for different phenological stages with the aim to connect a choice of et targets to water use and gross income their methodologies enable to identify the conditions crop and irrigation water prices phenological stages under which it is possible to apply deficit irrigation di limiting impacts on yield and gross income these scholars succeeded in integrating economic reasoning in agronomic problems enriching the discussion surrounding the issue of di in the irrigated agriculture in line with such scholars we further contributed to develop an optimization model integrating some fundamental agronomic yield water use relationship with few economic optimization principles to improve irrigation scheduling through simulation models in this respect we developed a dynamic programming approach providing irrigation advices on a daily basis and considering different sources of costs in recent years some new methods have been used in irrigation scheduling including genetic algorithms nguyen et al 2017 an effective global random search method and simulated annealing algorithms brown et al 2010 to the best of our knowledge these are among the most recent approaches suggested in the field of irrigation scheduling that in a nutshell are based on probabilistic techniques for approximating the global optimum the suggestion of these last approaches is driven by the fact that the identification of local optimum i e irrigation volume to apply at a given point in time to maximize the gross income in a given time interval do not guarantee the achievement of global optimum i e irrigation volume to apply at a given point in time to maximize the overall gross income of the crop in an optimization process that involve time dependent water yield relationship with the result of leading to sub optimal irrigation planning solutions a way to overcome the limitation of the classical mathematical programming techniques is in using iterative optimization processes as the aforementioned ones but these optimization techniques do not always guarantee to succeed in finding a correct prescription wolpert et al 1995 the dynamic programming approach offered in the present paper is powerful in obtaining stable solutions when it is satisfied a fundamental principle of optimality drawn from the seminal work of bellman and dreyfus 1962 namely a policy is optimal if at a stated period whatever the past decisions may have been the decisions still to be taken constitute an optimal policy when the result of the past decision is included the developed methodology builds up on the fundamental principle of optimality and on some additional insight from optimal control theory sargent 2000 inter alia optimal control theory allows dealing with problems of dynamic optimization with jump discontinuities a typical feature of irrigation scheduling irrigation is a spot intervention that is taken over time jump discontinuities can be handled with a specific typology of decisional variables named control variables these variables serve as the instruments of optimization influencing the optimal time path of and the values taken by states variables i e evapotranspiration to make this possible the objective function is usually accompanied by a conditional function known as the equation of motion that provides a mechanism that influence the values taken by the control then translated into a specific pattern of movement of states variables the distinction of the controls from states variables and other decisional variables is particularly fitting in the field of irrigation scheduling as it allows to treat separately and in sequence the issues of when to irrigate the control and of how much to irrigate to define the optimal time path of states variables i e evapotranspiration recent application of optimal control theory in the field of environmental economics can be found for the management of diffuse pollutants in water bodies grass and uecker 2017 for harvesting in fishery landi et al 2015 and for land use choices uecker 2016 amongst others as for our knowledge there are no application of optimal control theory in the field of irrigation scheduling for an extensive review on the topic refer to augeraud véron et al 2019 3 methodology in the present section we introduce i profit a dynamic optimization model to plan irrigation intervention during the irrigating season the model applies a deterministic approach following the structure of existing irrigation simulation models in general irrigation simulation models provide irrigation prescriptions on the basis of past choices i e the time and the amount of irrigation volume applied in the past and future average weather climatic conditions based on historical climatic data or on a combination of short term weather forecasts and climatic data differently from existing irrigation simulation that provide prescription on a maximum yield basis i profits allows identifying when to irrigate and how much to maximize gross income with gross income we consider the difference between crop revenues and variable irrigation costs this is a typical short run maximization problem focusing on optimizing irrigation scheduling once taken the choices regarding the crop to grow and the irrigation system to use the main assumption behind the approach here proposed are reported in table 1 among these assumptions the ones that requires a change on the approach proposed below is the perfect information about future weather conditions an assumption intrinsic to irrigation simulation models how to overcome relax this assumption as well as the perfect information about future price assumption is discussed in the conclusion as a further improvement of the developed methodology the reminder assumptions are considered while discussing our method in this section without loss of generalities in the following we offer a simplified formulation of the problem accompanied by a numerical example in appendix a while providing further details on how i profit is integrated into existing irrigation simulation models in the following section the per hectare gross income π function of a generic crop is introduced with eq 1 1 π t vy t e t 1 e t c x t here t is the time that begin with transplanting sowing and end with harvesting x t is a decisional variable that defines the irrigation volume to apply on day t e t is the crop evapotranspiration on day t y t e t 1 e t is the daily per hectare water yield function of a crop that relates the yield to the evapotranspiration on day t and to the evapotranspiration of previous time steps 4 4 the relation between the yield on day t and the evapotranspiration on day t 1 defines a linkage between any stresses suffered in the past and future production the daily water yield function represents the contribution provided by the irrigation on day t and previous periods on the final yield the daily water yield function can also be expressed as follows y t e t 1 e t y e t 1 e t e t 1 t y e t 1 e t e t 1 t namely the daily water yield function is defined by the difference between the expected yield with irrigation treated as a free decisional variable and the same expected yield in the absence of irrigation on day t worth noting that consistently with existing irrigation simulation models the water yield relationship on day t is defined by considering given the irrigation choices made in the past and assuming no water stresses in future periods the problem here described can be directly defined on y e t 1 e t e t 1 t and solved through the calculus of variation as an alternative to our approach this procedure is typically the one adopted in optimal control theory but it brings to analogs results considerably complicating the procedure here described c x t is the variable per hectare cost faced by the farmer to irrigate v is the expected output price the relation between the irrigation volume and the evapotranspiration become apparent when considering the daily water balance of the rootzone the daily water balance of the root zone relates the irrigation volume to the evapotranspiration schematically the root zone can be presented by means of a container in which the water content may fluctuate without loss of generality we simplify the soil water balance in the fashion of eq 2 2 l t 1 x t e t l t t here l t 1 is the amount of water available at time t and stored in the root zone in previous periods l t is the amount of water stored in the root zone for the next period 5 5 a more accurate description of the daily water balance model includes precipitation runoff capillary rise and water loss for deep percolation this specification is provided in appendix b and it reflect the formula provied in the fao irrigation and drainage paper n 56 allen et al 1998 in addition in our model x t is used interchangeably to represent the irrigation volume and the irrigation depth we do not intentionally introduce these terms here because they wouldn t change the main outcome of the model worth noting that both the structure of the production function and the water balance model are consistent with the fundamental principle of optimality a necessary condition to achieve global optimal solutions now assuming no water losses associated with irrigation except for deep percolation we can consider that x t ranges between the following threshold values 3 0 x t l t l t 1 t here l t is the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the root zone for the next period from eq 3 we can infer for the maximum irrigation volume to achieve field capacity x t and the time frame within which crop water requirement are fully satisfied as follows 4 x t t t t e t l t l t 1 t here e t is the crop evapotranspiration under no water stresses at time t l t 1 defines the threshold soil humidity level below which the crop start facing water stresses t defines the future time at which the crop start facing water stresses after irrigating to field capacity by focusing on the cost function we intentionally account of only those variable costs that can reasonably be influenced by planning irrigation intervention after having chosen what to grow and what irrigation system to adopt 6 6 there are basically two main decisional components that contribute conditioning if and how much water to apply at each time step of the growth season of a crop organization and economy the organization component is discretional to the farmer as farmers differs one another essentially because of labor and irrigation equipment availability an additional condition can be easily added to our problem by setting the minimum number of time steps with no irrigation after an irrigation intervention is performed this component is usually already part of the crop growth models used to drive irrigation scheduling so we prefer to focus on the economic component the economic component is related to the characteristic of the cost function with these premises we can consider two main cost items the cost to set up an irrigation intervention h and the volumetric cost k the costs to set up an irrigation intervention is mainly determined by the time spent to move the necessary equipment in the field valued at the cost of the labor employed or at the hourly rate of the contractor i e these costs are usually relevant for sprinkler irrigation while negligible for drip irrigation 7 7 in reality for drip irrigation we do have set up costs at the beginning of the irrigation season related to the installation of hoses cleaning of filters etc and at the end of the season to remove the material however planning irrigation intervention has no influence on these costs and therefore these are not considered in our problem the volumetric cost is mainly determined by the energy used to irrigate valued at its unit price i e these costs are usually relevant for both sprinkler and drip irrigation while negligible for gravity irrigation and or valued at the volumetric tariff i e this happen in the case farmers have to pay for irrigation on a volumetric basis although most frequently they pay a flat rate or a license for the use of private wells disconnected from the irrigation volume and therefore not influencing water uses the above considerations justify the structure of the per hectare variable cost function as follows 5 c x t kw t h i t here i t is a binary decisional variable that defines when to irrigate and it takes the value of 1 in the case it is worth irrigating 0 otherwise w t is a continuous decisional variable that defines how much to irrigate these decisional variables are interlinked in such a way that how much to irrigate is secondary to whether to irrigate in other words i t dominates w t if i t 1 then w t 0 if i t 0 then w t 0 the relation between x t and i t can be expressed by eq 6 6 x t w t i t here w t is the variable component of x t and i t is the binary component more precisely i t is our control variable whose value influence the ones taken by x t now that all the pieces of the problem are described we can introduce our optimization problem 7 max π t t v y t e t 1 l t 1 i t w t l t kw t h i t s t 8 i t w t l t l t 1 t 9 0 l t l t w t 0 e t 0 i t 0 1 t 10 w t 0 if i t 1 w t 0 if i t 0 t and 11 l 0 l 0 t t l 0 t given eq 7 is the objective function under maximization this equation is obtained by substituting eqs 2 5 and 6 into eqs 1 8 and 9 set the value boundaries for the irrigation volume to apply for the water content in the soil for the evapotranspiration and for the control it is worth to remind here that our decisional variables are represented by i t and w t while e t and l t are the state variables directly influenced by the decisional variables in addition i t e t and w t are flow variables as their variation is measured over time while l t is alike a stock variable powered by w t and feeding e t the flow nature of i t become apparent when considering its inclusion into the yield function and that the yield function is influenced by the values taken by the prior state variables e t thus the variation in the yield determined by the variation in the evapotranspiration triggers changes on i t and consequently on w t which in turn influence variations on state variables eq 10 defines the rules that influence the values taken by irrigation volume to apply when the control change finally eq 11 sets the initial level of the amount of water stored in the root zone and the time at which the crop reaches maturity a necessary condition to achieve an equilibrium solution the equilibrium solution of our problem allows identifying the rules about when and how much water to apply on day t as follows 12 d π d e t t t v y t e t 1 e t 0 t 13 i t 0 if d π d e t 0 i t 1 if d π d e t 0 and d π d i t t t t v y t e t 1 e t h t 14 w t 0 if i t 0 d π d w t t t t v y t e t 1 e t k t eq 12 describes how changes on the state variable e t affects changes on gross revenues any water stresses caused by a reduction on the evapotranspiration on day t influence gross revenues through a chain reaction that affect the potential contribution of future irrigation on the production any changes on gross revenues caused by changes on e t defined by eq 12 drives also the signs of eq 13 the marginal revenue on eq 12 is bound to increase over time without irrigation this value reflect the shadow price of water and it influence whether it is convenient to irrigate the marginal revenue on eq 12 equal zero in the absence of water stresses accordingly i t 0 as there is no reason to irrigate in the absence of water stresses i e d π d i t 0 if d π d e t 0 the opposite happens in the presence of water stresses i e d π d i t 0 if d π d e t 0 in both cases there is no reason to irrigate up until the time when the benefits brought by the irrigation intervention equals the costs or in other words up until the time where the benefits of irrigating outweigh the benefits of not irrigating i e t t t v y t e t 1 e t h 8 8 we recall here that eq 2 relates past and future soil water content states because of that the water balance at the time when an irrigation intervention is performed would be l t 1 x t l t e t the day after the water balance would be l t l t 1 e t 1 which can be rewritten as follows l t 1 x t e t l t 1 e t 1 following this procedure the day before the next irrigation intervention the water balance would be x t t t t 1 e t e t t this is to show that x t and consequently i t appears in the daily water yield function all along the interval between succeeding irrigation intervention as a consequence the water yield functions between succeeding irrigation intervention are all differentiable with respect to i t same considerations hold when differentiating the water yield functions with respect to w t worth noting that the benefits of irrigating increase with time as soil moisture decreases and the shadow price of irrigation water increases 9 9 the variation on the gross revenue of eq 13 can also be depicted as follows t t t v y t e t 1 e t t t t y t e t 1 e t i t 1 y t e t 1 e t i t 0 the item t defines the time at which the previous irrigation intervention was performed the value taken by y t e t 1 e t i t 0 is influenced by eq 12 and this value decreases as the shadow price of water increases it might be worth to set eqs 13 and 14 directly as a condition of the optimization problem here described in the case the mathematical programming software used to run the model does not allow to deal with binary decisional variables in synthesis eqs 12 and 13 together allow to minimize set up costs and enable identifying when to irrigate these equations tell us also that the higher the set up costs the greater the time interval between succeeding irrigation intervention to maximize gross income the time window between one irrigation and the next equals the time covered by the irrigation intervention to satisfy crop water requirements plus the time the crop start facing water stresses at least until the point where the benefit brought by the irrigation intervention equal set up costs such that t t t e t t t t e t t t t e t with e t e t where t defines the future time at which the crop start facing water stresses and t defines the time at which the next irrigation intervention will occur by violating the suggestions provided by the model about when to irrigate we fell into two sub optimal states 1 we may have an early irrigation on day t if set up costs outweigh benefits i e t t t v y t e t 1 e t h 2 on the other side we may have a delayed irrigation on day t if benefits outweigh set up costs i e t t t v y t e t 1 e t h eq 14 together with condition 8 defines the rules about how much water to apply when i t 1 in our simplified model the optimal irrigation volume to apply is influenced by the volumetric cost by soil moisture at filed capacity and by the soil water yield relation given the set up costs eq 14 is satisfied with strict equality in the case the effects of the volumetric cost on water uses outweigh the effects of the set up costs this happen both when condition 8 is not binding and eq 13 is binding and when condition 8 is binding and eq 13 is strictly greater than h with the first option the interval between one irrigation and the next is influenced exclusively by the set up costs while the volumetric costs contribute influencing exclusively the irrigation volume applied per irrigation intervention 10 10 worth noting that eq 13 allows identifying the minimum interval between one irrigation and the next that incorporates a period where the crop is under water stresses whose duration is influenced by the set up cost levels other things being equal differently eq 14 defines the optimal irrigation volume considering the effect of the volumetric cost on water uses in the same time window but in the absence of water stresses with the second option the irrigation volume is fixed at field capacity while the interval between one irrigation and the next it binds at a point in time where the marginal productivity of water with respect to water uses equals the volumetric cost which is a step forward with respect to the point in time where the marginal productivity of water with respect to the irrigation intervention equals the set up cost both options reducing the irrigation volume extending the interval between succeeding irrigation intervention brings to the same optimal solution in the case eq 14 is satisfied with strict equality 11 11 thus we fell into a condition of indeterminateness as more than one optimal solution is valid to solve this problem we have to run the optimization problem in two steps first by imposing a strict equality to condition 8 second by running the optimization in the absence of volumetric costs store the i t optimal values and run again the problem introducing volumetric costs be that as it may existing mathematical programming software offer the possibility to impose a priority on the control allowing avoiding the two steps optimization procedure described for the second option the suggested procedure allows identifying two boundary optimal solutions one with less water per irrigation and higher frequencies of irrigation and one with more water per irrigation and lower frequencies of irrigation the first option might be preferred in the presence of nutrient leaching issues the second in the presence of labor availability or soil salinity issues the volumetric cost does not influence the irrigation prescription in the case eq 14 is not satisfied with strict equality and the problem solves with one single optimal solution exclusively influenced by the set up cost level 12 12 worth noting that the effects brought by the set up costs are similar to the effects brought by a limitation on water uses as a consequence the volumetric cost influence water uses when these costs outweigh the shadow price of water all in all these considerations allow to conclude that the higher the set up cost the higher the volumetric cost threshold above which volumetric costs start influencing water uses and the lower the effects of the volumetric costs on water uses eq 14 tell us also that the higher the volumetric cost the greater the effect on water uses worth noting that being other things equal in the absence of set up cost there is no reason to store water into the rootzone for the future as it would be more convenient irrigating day by day 13 13 the convenience of irrigating day by day in the absence of set up costs is especially evident when considering water losses for deep percolation accounting of water losses would not change the economic implications so far discussed however the demand for irrigation gets steeper with increasing losses with the results of narrowing the interval between successive irrigation intervention in synthesis the relation between eqs 12 14 and condition 8 highlights the mechanism that relates the value of i t and w t with the values of e t or in other words the mechanisms that explain how the value of the control is influenced by the past dynamic of the state variable and how the control contributes influencing the future dynamic of the state variable appendix a provides a simple numerical example to better appreciate the robustness of the developed approach fig 1 depict the relationships above analyzed the figure shows gains and losses associated with different irrigation volume on day t to satisfy crop water requirements just on day t and in a time window between day t and day t t where t is the time at which the next irrigation event will occur specifically w t represents the optimal irrigation volume to maximize gross income on day t such quantity is the projection on the x axes of the cross point between the marginal volumetric costs k and the marginal revenue curve π t this is a necessary and sufficient condition to maximize gross income on day t if assuming zero set up costs h 0 similarly w t represents the optimal irrigation volume on day t to maximize gross income in a time window between day t and day t t such quantity is the projection on the x axes of the cross point between the marginal volumetric costs k and the marginal revenue curve π t the marginal revenue curve π t is higher than π t because it aggregates the demand curves of subsequent periods in this scenario we suppose positive set up costs levels h 0 because of that the last part of the marginal revenue curve π t is truncated increasing set up cost levels results with a shift upward of the demand curve the shift upward of the demand curve is determined by increasing the interval between one irrigation and the next as a consequence the truncated portion of the demand curve increases with increasing set up cost levels in light of eq 13 the set up cost equals the area below the demand curve right to the point w t the marginal volumetric cost k influences the optimal irrigation volume only if this is higher than the threshold level k defined by projection on the y axes at the point where the demand curve is truncated as shown by the figure the effect might be that of reducing the irrigation volume however same optimal solution can be achieved by maintaining the amount of irrigation water at field capacity and widening the time interval between one irrigation and the next graphically that would result in an upward shift of the marginal revenue curve up until the point where the curve cross the threshold level of k in the absence of set up cost i e h 0 there is no reason to store water for the future on a cost perspective as a consequence the irrigation volume would equal w t and the local optimum solution is aligned with the global optimum conversely the presence of set up cost i e h 0 justifies the need to store water for the future as a consequence the irrigation volume would equal w t and the global optimum is satisfied but is not anymore aligned with the local optimum the model might bring to a sub optimal solution locally i e suggesting to apply more water than the quantity needed to satisfy the crop water requirement at a given point in time while to an optimal solution globally i e storing water for future periods at a given point in time to reduce the number of irrigation intervention minimizing economic losses and maximizing gross income in summary in the simplified model presented here under given crop phenological characteristics and soil and climatic conditions the marginal revenue the set up cost and the volumetric cost contribute influencing the convenience of when to irrigate and how much worth noting that the optimization approach so far developed can be enriched with a number of conditions see the one reported in table 1 as for example a constrain on water availability can be added to the optimization model depicted in eqs 7 11 to further highlight the potentiality of the method above described 15 t w t w here w is the total available water for the season when this constraint is satisfied with strict equality the farmer experiences some restriction on water availability with direct consequences on yield with this constraint the optimization model allows to automatically select the best periods to apply restrictions on water uses during the growth season to minimize yield losses this happens when the benefits brought by each irrigation intervention equals the shadow price of water all along the growth stages of the crop with the inclusion of such constraint it is implicitly assumed that the farmer can freely choose to allocate the available water all along the irrigating season as if the water for irrigation can be stored at the beginning of the season the application of such constraint might also be useful to optimize deficit irrigation techniques and can be applied to limited time intervals if limitations in water availability are contingent to specific periods so far i profits provides ideal prescriptions about irrigation to maximize gross income in the short term although other important factors that are out of the scope of the present study contribute influencing farmers decisions these prescriptions follow the priorities when and how much to irrigate these priorities depend only partially on the costs to irrigate for instance the when perspective is largely influenced by the workforce availability and the operational capacity of the irrigation system minimum and maximum flow rate the how much perspective is largely influenced by considerations of the human behavior type e g the fear of an imminent rise in demand for evapotranspiration or a possible limitation of use of the resource whatever are the reasons that push the farmer to take decision that differs from the ones suggested by the model such decisions once undertaken by the farmers can be incorporated in the model as hind cast to adjust future prescriptions even in the case the farmer is not in the condition to follow model prescriptions the model can provide useful information to estimate the opportunity costs faced by the farmer due to her sub optimal decisions on a crop gross income maximizing perspective 4 i profit integration with aquacrop i profit can be integrated into existing irrigation simulation models in two main ways plug in and full integration unlike the full integration the plug in does not require a full knowledge of how the simulation model works i e how the yield is related to water uses and or how past choices are related to future outcomes but is less efficient i e it requires more computational efforts with the plug in option eqs 12 14 must be imposed as a condition to the optimization problem to obtain optimal outcomes while with full integration this is not required as equilibrium conditions are internally determined with respect to the irrigation simulation model acquacrop v 6 1 the procedure adopted to identify the optimal interval between one irrigation and the next with the plug in option is as follows 1 run the simulation irrigation model from time t to t with and without irrigation and store simulation results 2 calculate the daily contribution on crop yield by multiplying the cumulative crop transpiration with the water productivity index and the harvest index 3 calculate expected revenues perform the difference between the two simulation and compare the difference with the set up costs to identify how much water to apply the procedure is as follows 1 calculate the ratio between the differences in revenues and the differences in the evapotranspiration if this ratio is above the volumetric cost irrigation has to be performed at field capacity otherwise 2 1 option 1 reducing the irrigation volume the irrigation volume per irrigation intervention should be reduced progressively with iterative run of the irrigation simulation model until marginal revenues equals the volumetric cost at the point in time where differences in revenues equals the set up cost 2 2 option 2 moving forward the time when the next irrigation intervention will be performed identify the point in time where marginal revenues equals the volumetric cost with the full integration option there is a need to exactly know the crop soil water dynamics and how canopy and root expansion and transpiration are affected by water stresses besides reshaping the procedure used to calculate the irrigation advice 5 i profit simulation example in the following we tested i profit by using the acquacrop v 6 1 simulation outcome of a crop with specific physiological characteristics and cultivated under given pedo climatic and economic water and output pricing condition specifically the aquacrop model has been calibrated for processing tomato using data collected in field experiments carried out in the last decade in the po valley italy the data collected included data on soil climate soil water content measurements fruits weights and plant biomass the latter recorded at least in correspondence of critical plant phenological development more information available at battilani et al 2015 rainfall measurements and all the data needed to calculate evapotranspiration by a penman monteith allen equation were available at hourly time steps available online at http www smr arpa emr it dext3r the experiments were carried out on silty clay soils typical of the po valley low land fine sand 30 silt 50 clay 20 those soils are deep and without notice able skeleton 2 mm an extended shallow water table is usually present during the growing season at a depth ranging from 0 60 m to 1 5 1 8 m the climate in the test area is sub humid and the total amount of yearly rainfall is about 750 850 mm crop water requirements ranges between 2 700 and 3 200 mm and the yield between 63 and 80 t ha irrigation for processing tomato is usually performed through gun hereafter sprinkler or drip irrigation systems in the region typically irrigation frequency is set from 2 to 3 times per weeks up to daily according with the evapotranspiration patterns and rainfall distribution sprinkler irrigation is usually made by means of reel irrigation machines with an interval of 3 10 days according to the machine availability minimum volume of about 10 15 mm the calibrated model has been validated for soil water content total yield harvest index total biomass and its partition in above ground vegetation and fruit on eight independent datasets collected in a period ranging from 2004 to 2010 the calibrated parameters to run the aquacrop simulation are provided in appendix b in the present study the weather data of 2013 were used for simulations as well as the economic data reported in appendix c the example provided here is consistent with the approach developed by steduto et al 2009 and it is meant to develop sensitivity analyses to show how the set up and the volumetric irrigation costs contribute influencing irrigation prescriptions to maximize gross income in an aquacrop like setting specifically we used the following procedure to implement the methodology described above 1 calculate the irrigation prescriptions in the absence of water stresses and without imposing any particular irrigation rule irrigation volume time interval between subsequent irrigation events through the fao irrigation model acquacrop v 6 1 using the data provided by linker et al 2016 2 adapting i profit to aquacrop irrigation simulation model see appendix b for further detail about how the integration is performed 3 integrating the daily output of the irrigation model soil water balance and crop coefficients to calculate yield responses to water stresses along the growth season and economic information from the technical literature input and output prices time needed to equip an irrigation intervention labor costs yield conversion of dry matter to fresh matter 4 recalculate the irrigation prescriptions using information from the output of the agronomic model and the other economic information sources by the means of the economic optimization model here introduced and solved using a mixed integer nonlinear programming solver with the mathematical programming software gams v 24 3 http old gams com 14 14 in gams it is qualified as a prior in a way that the problem is first solved for it which defines the time path of irrigation interventions and then for w t which defines the irrigation volume to apply for each intervention the results reported below should be read by way of example to show how irrigation prescriptions change when integrating an economic optimization logic into existing agronomic models an additional numerical example to better appreciate the goodness of the developed methodology is provided in appendix a 6 results in fig 2 we show optimum irrigation planning under different cost scenarios with no costs k 0 m3 h 0 i the system suggests planning a total number of 24 irrigation intervention for a total amount of 3 100 m3 ha of irrigation water top left graph in fig 2 in the presence of set up costs k 0 m3 h 30 i the system suggests planning a total number of 6 irrigation intervention for a total amount of 2 823 m3 ha of irrigation water down left graph in fig 2 in the presence of volumetric costs k 0 15 m3 h 0 i the system suggests planning a total number of 23 irrigation intervention for a total amount of 2 740 m3 ha of irrigation water up left graph in fig 1 in the presence of volumetric costs and set up costs k 0 15 m3 h 30 i the system suggests planning a total number of 5 irrigation intervention for a total amount of 2 540 m3 ha of irrigation water down right graph in fig 2 for the no cost scenario irrigation is not constrained by construction when the cost to set up an irrigation intervention is null the amount of water stored in the rootzone for the subsequent periods is also null and the number of irrigation intervention is maximized the irrigation advises changes drastically when including a cost item into the optimization model k 0 h 0 when activating the costs to set up an irrigation intervention h 0 the number of irrigation interventions suggested by the model drop down as well as the irrigation volume conversely when activating the volumetric cost k 0 the suggested number of irrigation intervention does not vary significantly while the suggested irrigation volume decreases this happen because at each time step of the growth season the model suggests whether to irrigate and how much on the basis of the equality between irrigation marginal costs at time t and the sum of the benefits obtained from time t onwards because of that irrigation intervention this equality is satisfied for decreasing irrigation volume when the volumetric cost increase as a result with positive volumetric cost levels the overall irrigation volume is reduced but the number of irrigation intervention is not necessarily reduced when the cost to set up an irrigation intervention is active this influences the length of the interval between subsequent irrigation intervention and necessarily the irrigation volume this effect is better highlighted in fig 3 the figure shows the trend of the frequency of irrigation intervention fig 3a and of the amount of irrigation water to apply fig 3b for increasing costs to irrigate the trend is provided for the two different costs items k and h treated as independent costs specifically the dotted line in fig 3 represent the trend of the frequency of irrigation intervention and of the amount of irrigation water to apply for increasing set up costs while the straight line represents the trend of the frequency of irrigation intervention and of the amount of irrigation water to apply for increasing volumetric costs for the set up cost the frequency of irrigation intervention suggested by the model drop down just when the cost to set up an irrigation intervention is very low dotted line in fig 3a but without significantly influencing the total irrigation volume dotted line in fig 3b in addition when the set up cost is high the reduction in the frequency of irrigation intervention is very low conversely the reduction in the irrigation volume is very high this is not the case for the volumetric cost here both the frequencies of irrigation intervention straight line in fig 3a and the irrigation volume straight line in fig 3b gradually decreases for increasing costs in general fig 3 reveal that for increasing irrigation costs the discrepancy between the frequency of irrigation intervention among the comparing cost items tend to decrease while the discrepancy in the irrigation volume to apply among the comparing cost items tend to increase fig 4 depict the cross influence of the two sources of irrigation cost set up costs and volumetric costs on the optimal irrigation volume to apply to maximize gross income in the absence of set up costs the optimal amount of irrigation water steadily decreases for increasing volumetric irrigation costs in the presence of set up costs the optimal amount of irrigation water decreases discontinuously in steps such discontinuity is stressed for increasing irrigation set up cost levels that is consistently with our theoretical implications the volumetric cost is less likely to condition water uses for increasing set up cost level the horizontal portion of the curves depicted in fig 4 point out no cost effects on the optimal irrigation volume to apply this happens because the reduction in water uses determined by the activation of set up costs is higher than the reduction in water uses influenced by the volumetric cost finally fig 5 depict the maximum yield and gross income trend for different water availability levels the two curves in fig 5 are obtained by incorporating eq 12 within the optimization problem described from eqs 3 6 and running the optimization iteratively for different water availability levels the optimization procedure so far developed allows identifying the best allocation of water during the entire growth season to minimize gross income losses in other words this procedure allows identifying efficient water uses and yield targets necessary to design optimal irrigation planning 7 discussion technical and policy implication the methodology presented with this paper contributed enriching the literature developed in the field of irrigation scheduling doorenbos and kassam 1979 hunsaker et al 2015 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 basically the approach offered here describes an estimating procedure that allows to shift from the conventional maximum yield paradigm to drive the irrigation advice jones 2004 zhang et al 2019 not even to the maximal water productivity but to a gross income maximization paradigm the paper focused on analyzing the very first implication of such approach at the crop level explaining the way how irrigation costs contribute influencing the irrigation advice the method allows reducing the discretion left to the farmer in defining the time intervals between consecutive irrigation interventions by automatically suggesting when to irrigate and how much such a peculiarity of the proposed method is particularly valuable in the case the water available for irrigation is limited as it allows identifying when it is more convenient to save water the scope of application of the method developed in this study can be extended beyond the farm level to support normative analysis including regulatory and water pricing policies about water pricing most of the normative approaches analyzing the implication of water pricing in agriculture reveal that water pricing discourage water misuses although sometimes water pricing is not efficient galioto et al 2013 lika et al 2016 2017 such theoretical implications often conflict with empirical evidences that largely demonstrated the ineffectiveness of water pricing in agriculture bogaert 2012 molle 2009 the theoretical literature on water pricing largely ignores the temporal dimension of the problem which is instead revealed to be of crucial importance in the empirical analysis the lesson learned from the empirical evidences is that a tariff proportional to the volume of water applied with irrigation is usually too low to influence water uses and that even when the tariff is high the effect on water uses is negligible at critical moments of the growth season molle and berkoff 2007 the approach developed in this study is consistent with the empirical evidence in that it demonstrated that any changes in water prices does not necessarily results with changes in the irrigation prescription and that the impact varies with the different stages of the growth season 8 conclusions limits and perspectives the methodology developed in this study allows to provide a recommendation on how best to manage irrigation scheduling time by time to achieve a global optimum to the best of our knowledge the most recent approaches suggested in the field of irrigation scheduling jin et al 2012 linker et al 2016 mun et al 2015 allow to achieve an approximation of the global optimum such approximation might fail in providing a correct prescription wolpert et al 1995 a limit of the method developed in the present study is in that it gives recommendations on how best to manage irrigation from the current day until the end of the season however the recommendation is only valid for a few days after the current day this happens because the optimization procedure cannot include an exact knowledge of the future climate and in particular of the future precipitation precipitation was not included on purpose on the developed model no doubt for on farm scheduling future climate variability is important this explain the development of recent methodologies to manage uncertainty in the field of irrigation scheduling jin et al 2012 mun et al 2015 such uncertainty is further exacerbated by no exact knowledge of future prices which poses similar methodological issues lecina 2016 as for example the dynamic interval programming technique developed by jin et al 2012 to make optimal decisions under uncertainty can be easily integrated with the approach developed in this study by running recursively the model for upper and lower precipitations state scenarios weighted by the relevant probabilities of occurrence however in the opinion of the authors an important step forward for the proposed method would be that of adjusting prescriptions by accounting of the accuracy of forecasts in the fashion already developed in a recent study galioto et al 2020 and by nesting the approach developed with this study into a markov process a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event this way it would be possible to estimate the risk of failure associated to any delay in the application of the irrigation prescription further enriching the information environment under which the farmer operates besides the aforementioned limits the approach developed in this study allows to estimate the economic consequences caused by any restriction in water availability time by time for different type of crop and under different agronomic conditions enabling amplifying the scope of application of the method from the crop level to the farm and district level the application of the method at the farm level would help farmers driving their diversification strategies in the case water availability is an issue they have to deal with the application of the method at the district level would help driving water authorities regulatory prescriptions addressed to farmers served by irrigation networks in this case the method would help classifying priorities of intervention to establish shifts and turns for irrigation during the growth season in this respect i profit can be used as a plug in water supply system models to define operating rules to minimize economic losses like for instance realm perera et al 2005 in a broader context scheduling implementing also economic management criteria can help considering the aspects related to wefe nexus water energy food and environment including those associated with reduced return flows ecosystem services and a better water accountability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors greatfully aknowledge the anonimous reviewers for the valuable suggestions appendix a i profit numerical example in this appendix we provide a numerical example to deepen on the gross income maximization rules described in section 3 to plan irrigation intervention this example is provided for illustrative purpose only with the aim of showing how the developed approach works in practice and how it can be easily adapted to real world conditions imagine that the daily water yield function of a generic crop takes the following form a 1 y t a e t b e 2 t t here a and b are generic crop parameters that relates evapotranspiration to crop yield these parameters are assumed not varying with time the evapotranspiration is assumed being related to soil moisture and irrigation in the same fashion of eq 2 from eq 4 we can infer the future time at which the crop start facing water stresses after the irrigation such that t t l t l t 1 e t here l t is the soil humidity at field capacity l t 1 is the threshold level of soil moisture below which the crop start facing water stresses and e t is the daily crop evapotranspiration in the absence of water stresses below the soil moisture threshold level the crop evapotranspiration shrinks down its potential and its reduction become more severe with time the dynamic of the evapotranspiration when the soil moisture fell below the threshold level in the absence of external input of water can be depicted in the following fashion a 2 e t t ϱ t t 1 ϱ ϱ e t t here ϱ is a reduction factor that ranges between 0 and 1 and it is supposed to be influenced by crop and soil characteristics namely the evapotranspiration after day t t fell down as time passes in the absence external input of water and its reduction is more severe with low level of ϱ eq 13 allows identifying the interval between one irrigation and the next to maximize gross income based on our assumption condition 13 can be rearranged as follows a 3 vy t ϱ t t 1 ϱ ϱ v y t h t here t t t is the time interval between one irrigation and the next worth noting that t is divided into two sub intervals i e the time window where crop water requirements are fully satisfied by the irrigation intervention t t and the time window where the crop is subject to increasing water stresses t t vy t is the cumulative revenue between one irrigation and the next and v y t is the maximum revenue achieved in the absence of water stresses in the same time condition 13 tells us that it is worth irrigating when the revenue loss associated with water stresses achieves the threshold value of h below h the interval between one irrigation and the next would be too narrow with the effect to exceed in costs and misuse water above h the interval between one irrigation and the next would be too far with the effect to lose production although reducing water uses in the present example we can rearrange condition 13 to obtain the time window where the crop is under increasing water stresses as follows t t ϱ 1 ϱ v y t vy t h the time under water stress tend to increase when ϱ is high low the reduction on e t with time when h is high and when v is low this is to highlight that a mix of crop soil and economic conditions contribute influencing the optimal time path between one irrigation and the next once identified the optimal time path between succeeding irrigation intervention it is necessary to determine how much water to apply to maximize gross income in light of the volumetric costs this is possible by maximizing the gross income function of eq 1 subject to eq 4 with respect to the irrigation volume to apply in the time interval between succeeding irrigation intervention identified in the first step t this way we would obtain the optimal irrigation volume as follows a 4 w t min a k 2 b t t a 2 b t t 1 a 2 b t t t ϱ t t 1 ϱ ϱ a 2 b namely w t can take two values and only one of the two values is influenced by the volumetric cost the volumetric cost plays a role in influencing water uses if its effects outweigh the set up cost effects first term on the rhs of eq a 4 this happen when eq 4 does not binds at the optimum otherwise the volumetric cost effect is null or rather is covered by the reduction in water uses determined by optimizing the number of irrigation intervention second term on the rhs of eq a 4 table a 1 provides the parameters used to develop the above exercise results fig a 1 a depict the gross income generated using the parameters values reported in table a 1 for different time intervals between succeeding irrigation intervention in the primary y axis and water uses in the secondary y axis the irrigation volume reduces with increasing time interval between one irrigation and the next while the gross income achieve a maximum at a 6 days interval in our example the 6 days interval is the point at which the variation in gross income due to the irrigation intervention approaches the set up cost value consistently with condition 13 fig a 1 b depict the relation between the amount of irrigation water and volumetric costs for different time interval between one irrigation and the next the figure shows that volumetric costs start influencing water uses for a value above 0 10 m3 when the time interval between one irrigation and the next is of 6 days the optimal time path the threshold above which the volumetric cost start influencing water uses condition 4 does not binds at the equilibrium tend to increase as the time between one irrigation and the next increases appendix b focus on the crop water production function eq 1 approximates the crop water production function depicted in the fao irrigation and drainage paper n 66 eq a 1 convey the relationship between the crop water production function of eq 1 and the fao crop water production function b 1 y t e t 1 e t h t w t k s t e t k c t e t 1 e 0 t t where h t is the harvest index w t is the water productivity factor k s t e t is a dimensionless transpiration reduction factor dependent on the soil water root zone content and indirectly to irrigation k c t e t 1 is the crop coefficient whose value is influenced by canopy cover at time t 1 e 0 t is the potential reference evapotranspiration the potential reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the crop coefficient determine the potential crop evapotranspiration the potential crop evapotranspiration multiplied by crop stress coefficient finally determine the actual crop evapotranspiration e t the water stress coefficient is then obtained by the following equation b 2 k s t 0 if l t d t 1 if d t l r l t d t l t l r if l t d t l r t here l t is the total available soil water in the root zone which is obtained by the difference between the water content at field capacity and the water content at wilting point l r is the readily available soil water in the root zone that is a fraction of the total available soil water that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress reduction in et occurs l r p l t with

eq a 3 can be easily converted into eq 2 by assuming that c r t r 0 t p t 0 r t 0 and ρ 1 appendix c tomato model parameters the information provided in table c 1 and weather data were used to estimate crop evapotranspiration the canopy development and water balance variables of processing tomato in the absence of water stresses all along the growth season table c 2 provides the economic information used in i profits that together with the agronomic parameters obtained by running aquacrop enable to adjust irrigation prescriptions maximizing gross income worth noting that the economic parameters provided in table c 2 are reference parameters however the paper provides a sensitivity analysis using values above and below such reference parameters with the purpose to highlight how the variation of these parameters can potentially influence irrigation prescriptions 
10179,a sustainable agricultural system requires increasing water use efficiency and enhancing knowledge of crop water use this prerequisite is more pronounced in the regions with inadequate water resources and limited observational data such as southern iran therefore this study aimed at finding the water requirement of mature orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito by identifying standard evapotranspiration rate and crop coefficients single and dual seventy two orange trees in a drip irrigated orchard with loam soil were classified into six treatments and irrigated

increased rapidly since the mid 1980s fao estimates a nearly 40 increase in the world citrus production during the last 30 years faostat 2017 more than 40 million tons mt of the productions come from asian countries and iran contributes to 4 3 mt of the total productions with fars province in southern iran as the largest contributors ahmadi et al 2015 southern iran is characterized by dry summers and mild winters semi arid to arid regions and has the agriculture as the prime driver of the economy jamshidi et al 2019b nevertheless the limited water sources availability along with the recent prolonged droughts have posed severe challenges to the sustainability of the agricultural productivity of the regions the current situation necessitates the provision of water saving practices for enhancing agriculture production and alleviating the current orchard vulnerability the applicability of water saving approaches at core requires accurate information on crop water use i e crop coefficient and evapotranspiration fernández et al 2019 considering the limited academic research in southern iran on orchard water use it is crucial to carry out in situ and local experiments to identify crop specific information and water consumption for field grown orchards improving crop productivity requires a wide range of contributions including developing measurement devices henderson et al 2018 vagulabranan et al 2016 improving crop and soil based model simulations noshadi and jamshidi 2014 and optimizing irrigation scheduling nguyen et al 2017 perea et al 2016 in this regards many measurement platforms and models like multi resolution data sources for rainfall skofronick jackson et al 2017 and multiple evapotranspiration schemes and datasets abatzoglou 2013 niyogi et al 2020 as the two main drivers that affect crop yield and productivity have been developed nevertheless the major challenge in improving crop water productivity is still associated with collecting reliable in situ measurements in data sparse regions particularly for crop coefficient kc and the crop evapotranspiration rate etc jamshidi et al 2020 the importance of accurate etc estimates has been highlighted in several studies de medeiros et al 2005 er raki et al 2008 jamshidi et al 2019a with particular emphasis on crop coefficient maestre valero et al 2017 niziński et al 2017 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 nevertheless different studies have reported a range of values for kc etc even for a specific crop type the kc values recommended by fao for mature citrus trees for a mediterranean climate varies from 0 65 to 0 75 other studies on citrus however reported different values including 0 63 1 17 for 14 year old sweet lime by sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 in a semi arid region 0 96 1 9 for 33 year old navel orange in an arid climate by snyder and o connell 2007 0 3 0 9 for 8 year old citrus orchard in tropical savanna climate by peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 and 0 67 0 96 for 14 year old navel oranges by jamshidi et al 2020 the discrepancies in the kc and etc values can stem from the physiological specification of the crop consoli et al 2006 management practices zitouna chebbi et al 2015 the climate of the study region yang et al 2003 and soil characterization maestre valero et al 2017 applying water saving practices based on the information measured and calibrated for other regions could lead to exacerbating the water use efficiency therefore the information on crop coefficient and evapotranspiration needs to be locally measured particularly considering the importance of every drop in water scarce regions villalobos et al 2009 a sustainable implication of water saving practices requires monitoring crop water status rodríguez gamir et al 2010 the stem water potential ψstem and stomatal conductance gs are two water stress indices that properly reflect plant water status de lima et al 2015 taylor et al 2015 for a mature citrus tree in an optimum growing environment i e no water or heat stress the average values for gs and ψstem have been reported in a range of 0 12 0 15 molm 2 s 1 and 0 9 1 1 mpa respectively ballester et al 2013a romero trigueros et al 2014 when the soil moisture availability starts to deplete below a certain threshold the plant regulates its leaf gas exchange by partially closing the stomata gomes et al 2004 reported the midday ψstem below 1 mpa in young orange trees could trigger releasing the abscisic acid aba and stomatal closure villalobos et al 2009 used the daily gs of clementine mandarin average 1 85 mm s 1 and developed a model to calculate the transpiration of the orchards romero trigueros et al 2019 have also reported a high level of agreement between the crop water stress index reflecting water stress condition of the plant and the stem water potential in grapefruit trees while ψstem has been highlighted to have the most substantial role in governing the opening and closing of stomata the mechanism between ψstem and gs varies among different crop types and environmental conditions liu et al 2006 establishing the feedback mechanism between these two indicators can significantly help understand how the plants are functioning and responding to the water availability and irrigation strategy for example jamshidi et al 2020 reported an isohydric behavior of navel orange trees due to maintaining a relatively constant leaf turgor in water stress conditions by increasing stomatal resistance in this study we attempted to identify the crop coefficient and standard evapotranspiration rate of matured citrus trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito under the semi arid climate conditions of southern iran additionally the study aimed to identify the plant feedback in terms of ψstem an and g s responses to the different irrigation levels the finding of this study helps the local growers to identify the exact crop water use and develop more accurate irrigation scheduling to preserve the limited water sources 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the experiments were conducted for two consecutive years during 2017 and 2018 in a clean cultivated citrus orchard located 35 km west of kazeroon city latitude 28 32 n longitude 51 43 e elevation 920 m a s l fars province southern iran the climate of the study is classified as semi arid with an annual mean rainfall of 352 mm soufi 2004 the mean air temperature rises to over 40 c during the summer months and drops down to 3 c during the colder months the orchard soil type was classified as loam for the root zone depth the field capacity was 0 29 cm3 cm3 and the permanent wilting point was 0 11 cm3 cm3 the detailed characteristics of the soil and water of the study plot are listed in table 1 the orchard was compromised of 25 years old orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito planted at 6 5 m spacing the trees were drip irrigated and had an average height of 3 m with the shading area of 85 of the allotted spacing the trees start the flower bud induction during january and february and the flowering stage continues to the end of march april is the end of petal fall and in may the fruit setting starts and the young fruits ripen and develop through june to august the orange fruits typically remain on the trees until the end of december when they are harvested 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design the experimental plot was designed comprising of six irrigation levels in randomized blocks since the objective of the study was to identify the standard crop water use the amount of applied water for the irrigation treatments was set up based on the fraction of reference evapotranspiration eto from a high to low extent to cover the range proposed by fao 56 and other studies under similar climatic conditions allen et al 2005 jamshidi et al 2020 sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 each treatment had three replicates with four trees per each replicate that irrigated at 100 90 80 70 60 and 50 of eto the eto rate was calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using the following equation 1 et 0 rn g k t ρ a c p e s e a r a γ 1 r c r a λ where eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration rn is the net radiation g is the soil heat flux is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship γ is the psychrometric constant λ is the latent heat cp is the specific heat of air ρ a is the mean air density at constant pressure r a is the aerodynamic resistance r c is the canopy resistance e s is the saturated vapor pressure e a is the actual vapor pressure in kpa and k t is a time determination conversion coefficient in addition to the six irrigation treatments we also measured the amount of water that the local growers used for irrigating the orchard the supplied water for each irrigation treatment was determined weekly and adjusted based on the amount of rainfall all treatments were watered equally at 100 of eto prior to applying the irrigation levels to reduce any pre existing water deficiency the trees were subjected to the irrigation treatments from june to the end of december and the next january the water restriction was ended during february and all treatments were fully irrigated at 100 of eto this period coincides with the flowering and post blooming stages which have been well known as the most sensitive stage to water deficiency garcía tejero et al 2010 therefore to avoid fruit abscission and potential yield loss these stages were supplied with an adequate amount of water 100 eto 2 3 soil water balance parameterization we applied the water balance method to measure the amount of water consumed by crop evapotranspiration eq 2 the water balance approach considers the irrigation and rainfall as the primary inputs and subtracts the water content stored at the root zone sand deep percolated below the root zone to calculate etc flumignan et al 2011 sepaskhah and andam 2001 2 et c i p d i 1 n θ z i where i is the amount of applied water mm d is the deep percolation mm p is the rainfall mm n is the number of soil layers z is the soil layer thickness mm and θ s the volumetric soil water contents swc stored at soil profile cm3 cm 3 the amount of applied water in each of the treatments was measured using analog water meters rainfall data were collected from the weather station located 5 km north of the orchard weekly soil moisture variability was recorded with a neutron probe cpn 503 elite hydroprobetm at 30 cm soil layer intervals up to 120 cm in each replicate a microlysimeter was installed and the evaporation amount was recorded the microlysimeters were constructed using the procedures described in jamshidi et al 2020 the amount of water loss due to deep percolation was considered as negligible given the fact that treatments were drip irrigated other studies performed on drip irrigated orchards have also suggested that the amount of deep percolation is insignificant zhang et al 2017 by identifying the soil moisture content and measuring the amount of applied water and precipitation the evapotranspiration rate was calculated weekly for each of the irrigation levels 2 4 physiological measurements the midday stem water potential ψ stem was gauged on a bi weekly basis using a pressure chamber and based on the guideline provided in turner 1988 accordingly in each of the experimented trees ten leaves were selected and covered with aluminum foil for two hours prior to performing the measurements these leaves were cut from the tree and their water potential was immediately measured in the pressure chamber additionally a handheld photosynthesis system was used to record the stomatal conductance accordingly the sensor head was clipped onto a randomly selected leaf and stomatal conductance was recorded the physiological measurements were carried out between 12 00 and 2 00 pm on fair weather days 2 5 analysis and calculations the weekly crop coefficient k c was calculated as the ratio of et c based on weekly water balance to et o based on penman monteith calculations as 3 k c et c et 0 the single crop coefficient represents the combined impact of transpiration and soil evaporation into a single unit to differentiate between the effect of transpiration and evaporation wright 1982 introduced the concept of dual crop coefficient k cb as 4 k c dual k cb k e where k cb represents crop transpiration and k e represents soil water evaporation the values of k cb and k e were calculated using the following equations 5 k cb t et 0 k e e et 0 the calculated single and dual crop coefficient were compared with the values suggested in the fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 the k c values from the fao 56 are presented for sub humid regions with calm wind speeds u 2 of 2 m s 1 and minimum relative humidity rh min of 45 since the climatic condition of our study region was semi arid to compare the crop coefficients obtained in the study with those of fao 56 the mid season and end season k c and k cb values are adjusted based on the following equations 6 k c mid end season k c fao 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 7 k cb mid end season k cb fao 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the 2 m height m s 1 rh min is the minimum relative humidity and h is the plant canopy height m for the statistical analyses the tukey test was invoked to determine if the interaction among the treatments is mutually statistically significant 3 result and discussions 3 1 reference evapotranspiration the time series of daily reference evapotranspiration along with the primary meteorological variables including relative humidity wind speed rainfall and air temperature during the study years 2017 and 2018 are presented in fig 1 eto rates showed the lowest variability during winter january in particular with the mean value of 2 55 mm day 1 while it reached to just above 9 mm day 1 during summertime june in particular most of the rainfall occurred from january to april with a total amount of 333 2 mm in 2017 and 356 2 mm in 2018 the rainfall distribution of the two years of study was fairly similar with limited to no events from april to october and most of the events occurred from december to march the amount of applied water for each of the replicated was aimed to remain identical among the replicates however marginal differences were observed primarily due to emitter non uniformity that seemed reasonable considering the filed condition more detailed information on the differences between the treatments in terms of applied water rainfall and eto are presented in table 2 3 2 soil water content and crop evapotranspiration the soil moisture was measured at four soil layers i e 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 was scaled up into two groups as the top layer 0 60 cm and bottom layer 60 120 cm fig 2 shows the variability of soil moisture at these two layers throughout the two growing seasons the topsoil layer showed a higher variability compared to the deeper soil layer the soil moisture availability is controlled by atmospheric conditions evaporative demand root absorption and soil characteristics famiglietti et al 2008 deeper soil layers are limitedly impacted by atmospheric condition and root water absorption due to lower root distribution at deeper layers and therefore lower variability was observed at deeper layers across the irrigation treatments there was no significant difference during the non restriction period but as the irrigation treatments applied the soil moisture magnitude started to deviate from each other expectedly higher soil moisture availability was found on ir 100 with the mean values of 0 24 cm3 cm 3 for the top layer and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 for the sub soil layer during the water restriction period the soil moisture levels decreased as the severity of the water restriction increased and the mean soil water content dropped to 15 cm3 cm 3 during the water restriction period in ir 50 during summertime the extreme temperature and high evaporative demand caused the soil moisture availability to drop significantly reached to pwp in ir 60 and ir 50 as the climatic condition started to become milder the soil water content recovered the rate of recovery in lower irrigation levels e g ir 50 and ir 60 was slower compared to higher irrigation levels the amount of etc was monthly averaged and presented in fig 3 to identify the standard evapotranspiration rate we considered the variation of soil water content and etc among the irrigation treatments based on the soil moisture availability we calculated a water stress factor to identify the treatments that experienced water stress in fact eq 3 represents the single crop coefficient for an ideal condition i e adequate water mild weather and disease free condition for non ideal conditions particularly in low soil water potential a factor of water stress ks is incorporated into the kc this factor was calculated using the following equation 8 k s taw d r taw raw where taw is the amount of available water between field capacity θ fc and pwp θ pwp raw is readily available water defined as the available soil moisture between θ fc and the extent that the plant can absorb soil water considered as 0 6 θ fc following fao 56 recommendation and d r is root zone depletion relative to θ fc when d r is below raw the stress factor equals to 1 signifying a non stress condition as d r exceeds raw the plants experience a water stress condition with ks 1 allen et al 2005 in our study the ks for ir 80 ir 70 ir 60 and ir 50 was calculated as 0 88 0 81 0 74 and 0 58 these treatments were considered as deficit irrigation strategies for choosing the standard etc rate between ir 100 and ir 90 the incremental change in etc and soil moisture was evaluated it was observed that by increasing the irrigation amount from ir 90 to ir 100 the increase in the rate of et c was not statistically significant 1 65 on average while the increase in soil moisture was significant in ir 100 compared to ir 90 the additional water supply for ir 100 trees was not absorbed by the plant roots rather the extra water was stored in the soil profile therefore the et rate of the trees that were irrigated at 90 of eto was identified as the standard non stress condition and ir 100 was on over irrigation treatment the standard et c for the orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito ranged from 46 3 1 2 mm in january to 257 3 3 5 mm in july the seasonal et c was 1830 4 mm in 2017 and 1862 3 mm in the following year the kc values based on the ir 90 i e standard irrigation treatment ranged from 0 65 in january reached 0 95 in june and dropped to 0 7 at the end of winter fig 3 and table 3 our results of kc and etc were comparable with the values reported by jamshidi et al 2020 and jamshidi et al 2021a on washington navel oranges at an adjacent site 50 km south of our study location they reported the average seasonal etc value as 1850 mm with a mean kc value of 0 8 additionally considering other studies on a similar climatic condition but on different citrus types the reported results from rogers et al 1983 and sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 were compatible with our study with the mean k c values of 1 during summer and 0 73 in winter within a similar crop type i e citrus the crop coefficient value can vary significantly depending on the environmental condition crop variety trees shape and vigor and agricultural management table 3 provides a better contrast of our reported kc values against other studies on citrus under comparable climatic conditions our measurements of the irrigation amount performed traditionally by the local farmers showed that they were irrigating at around 109 of eto 19 higher than the standard etc the details of the conventional irrigation application are provided in table 4 accordingly for each of the phenological growing stages we have shown the amount of standard water requirement and the amount of water local growers were using the over irrigation pattern was not uniformly distributed among the growing stages with the highest magnitude 21 during fruit set and fruit development and lowest 11 during harvest time given the seasonal crop water use of 1830 mm for an orange tree in the region the 19 over irrigation was translated into 347 mm per season considering the large orchard acreages in the region and limited water resources correcting the irrigation pattern by lowering 19 of water applications in the orchards could significantly contribute to the sustainability of the region by partitioning evapotranspiration the values for dual crop coefficient as evaporation ke and transpiration kcb coefficients were also calculated across the irrigation treatments and presented in table 5 on average evaporation constituted 6 5 of etc during winter and over 16 7 during summer for ir 90 the standard irrigation treatment the high summer soil evaporation was attributed to the higher frequency of irrigation higher vapor pressure deficit along with the hot winds fig 4 shows the detailed comparison of kc kcb and ke with the values from fao 56 adjusted for the region of study the values from fao 56 was lower compared to the measured values in our study 10 15 lower during a growing season this disparity has also been highlighted in several studies including niziński et al 2017 pérez pérez et al 2012 ruiz et al 2001 due to the several factors affecting the experimental conditions 3 3 plant physiological results 3 3 1 stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate responses the response of plants to water deficiency reflects in physiological feedbacks including loss of stem water potential closure of stomata and limiting the gas exchange between the leaf and air consoli et al 2006 in this section we provided the physiological response of the experimented orange trees to the irrigation levels including the variation of stem water potential ψ stem net photosynthesis an and stomatal conductance g s during the growing seasons illustrated in fig 5 the stomatal conductance of all trees fluctuated in a similar range before imposing water restriction at around 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 this showed the similarity between all of the treatments when the water availability was not a limiting factor with the start of the water restriction period june the difference between the irrigation treatment in terms of stomatal closure became evident fig 5 a the trees in the ir 100 treatment kept their stomatal conductance at a relatively constant rate of 0 10 and 0 12 molm 2 s 1 as the severity of water restriction increased i e from ir 100 to ir 50 a higher degree of stomatal closure was observed with ir 50 showing the lowest g s values mean value of 0 065 molm 2 s 1 during water restriction period by ending the water restriction period in each season january the stomatal conductance of ir 90 ir 80 ir 70 treatments returned to 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 signifying full recovery of the trees the ir 60 and ir 50 however could not fully recover and the g s values remained at a slightly lower compared to other treatments our reported values for stomatal resistance of well irrigated trees were aligned with the suggested values by allen et al 2005 however the g s values reported in literature hold a high variation from 0 005 molm 2 s 1 reported by dzikiti et al 2007 to 0 14 molm 2 s 1 in the study by pérez pérez et al 2012 for water stress conditions our measured g s values ranging from 0 04 to 0 08 molm 2 s 1 during summertime for ir 60 and ir 50 trees were in a similar range reported by consoli et al 2017 mossad et al 2018 and gomes et al 2004 with 0 03 0 09 molm 2 s 1 for orange trees on 40 60 of water reduction the net photosynthesis rate an followed a similar trend as the stomatal resistance during both of the growing seasons the ir 100 and ir 90 standard irrigation treatment trees kept their an at a constant rate of 12 2 molm 2 s 1 with the reduction of water supply plants started to regulate their gas exchange by lowering the an to 9 8 8 2 7 9 6 6 molm 2 s 1 for ir 80 ir 70 ir 60 and ir 50 the close relationship between stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis was illustrated in fig 7 a this relationship was translated into the equation of gs 0 01 an 0 008 with r2 of 0 81 monthly average values of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance for all irrigation treatments are provided in fig 6 3 3 2 stem water potential response the resulting time series of the measured stem water potential ψ stem showed a lower variability compared to an and g s particularly in ir 100 ir 90 and ir 80 the mean ψ stem values remained relatively constant at 0 71 0 0 8 0 76 0 21 and 0 82 0 27 mpa by lowering water supply below 80 of eto i e ir 70 ir 60 and ir 50 the impact of water deficit was reflected in the loss of turgor the ψ stem from 0 75 mpa during non stress condition was dropped to 1 6 0 31 1 96 0 33 and 2 44 0 35 respectively for ir 70 ir 60 and ir 50 during the water restriction period all of the treatments were recovered after the water restriction period was finished with no significant difference among the treatments jamshidi et al 2020 reported the ψ stem of 12 years old navel washington oranges within the range of 0 07 to 2 9 mpa which was aligned with our findings additionally garcía tejero et al 2010 and ballester et al 2013b reported a range 1 2 to 2 5 mpa for navel oranges which was consistent with our measurements monthly average values of stem water potential for all irrigation treatments are also provided in fig 6 when the soil moisture availability starts to deplete below a certain threshold the plant regulates its leaf gas exchange by partially closing the stomata stomatal closure can also be triggered by other mechanisms including loss of leaf turgor the release of the abscisic acid aba increase of co2 concentration change in vapor pressure deficit and light intensity pérez pérez et al 2012 rana et al 2005 however the main driver of closing stomatal and its feedback mechanism with leaf turgor is crop dependant liu et al 2006 we first analyzed the physiological behavior of the experimented trees by considering the relationship between g s and ψ stem it was observed that while the mean value gs dropped by 22 percent during the water restriction period for none to mild water stressed conditions i e ir 100 ir 90 and ir 80 the ψ stem values reduced by only 6 this marginal reduction in stem water potential signified the isohydric behavior of the trees an isohydric plant reduces its stomatal conductance to preserve the leaves turgor when experiencing a drought condition however the plants did not show strict behavior considering the trees under moderate to severe water stress i e ir 700 ir 60 and ir 50 when the water supply was reduced below 70 of eto the stomatal adjustment was not adequate to sustain the balance between water absorption root water uptake and water loss transpiration causing the drop in water potential predominantly during hot windy days of summer with high evaporative demand the feedback between g s and ψ stem resulted in a statistically significant equation of gs 0 0453 ψstem 0 146 with r2 of 0 54 consistent with our results a linear correlation between ψ stem and g s in citrus has been reported by pérez pérez et al 2012 and mossad et al 2018 these types of correlations however are local and site crop dependent as other forms have been reported by other investigators for example a sigmoid correlation indicating a steady rate of ψ stem for a range of gs was reported by gomes et al 2004 and jamshidi et al 2020 the differences stem from the amplitude of controlling factors in experimental conditions including management driven e g tillage pruning fertilizing physiologically driven crop type variety and environmentally driven e g weather soil type factors the majority of prior studies have attributed the lack of soil moisture as the primary cause of stomatal closure while some researchers have highlighted the role of vpd on regulating stomatal conductance e g mossad et al 2018 in fig 7 c and d we have visualized the behavior of stomatal conductance as well as stem water potential with the change in soil water content and vpd considering the gs plot in high range of soil moisture swc 25 cm3 cm 3 and low vpd vpd 2 kpa the stomatal conductance remained high 0 13 0 15 molm 2 s 1 for the same soil moisture range swc 25 cm3 cm 3 but in high vpd vpd 4 kpa the stomatal conductance remained in high magnitude therefore in a non optimal climatic condition high vpd with adequate availability of the soil water content the plant stomatal remains open signifying a more dominant impact of soil water content on controlling the plant photosynthesis we can confirm this pattern by considering the low values of stomatal conductance i e stomatal closure when the soil moisture is limited swc 15 cm3 cm 3 and the climatic condition is not a stress factor vpd 2 kpa in a recent publication however kimm et al 2020 reported the dominant role of vpd on controlling gs with a relative contribution of 90 the focus of their study was on maize which is a c4 plan and has a different photosynthesis mechanism still such difference necessitates the importance of simultaneous analysis of vpd swc and physiological responses of the plant jamshidi et al 2021b has also highlighted the importance of vpd for estimating crop water stress index using satelitte and insitu data and monitoring citrus trees and orange trees in particular the behavior of stem water potential with regards to vpd and swc was slightly different from that of gs as shown in fig 7c the more scattered response of ѱstem was observed which was particularly due to the isohydric behavior of the trees as noted earlier the trees maintained their stem water potential at the cost of decreasing stomatal resistance in the study by zandalinas et al 2018 the stomatal responses to combined water stress and high temperature and vpd were linked to the severity of water stress this variablity emphasizes the intricate response of the plants given the complexity of the natural environment that involves different abiotic stress factors with various intensities and duration 4 conclusion in this study we attempted to identify the full irrigation requirement of orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito on a field grown condition in southern iran our results indicated irrigating at 90 of eto as the full water requirement for which the crop coefficient ranged from 0 65 in january to 0 95 in june the conventional irrigation application was found to be significantly higher than the actual requirement particularly during the fruit set and fruit development periods with 21 of overirrigation this is particularly important considering limited water availability and drought vulnerability of the region and highlighted the need for modifying the pattern of water application in the region by partitioning evapotranspiration the rate of evaporation was estimated higher than the range suggested in other studies primarily due to the high irrigation frequency persistent wetted area during summer which was coincided with high advection and high evaporative demand our findings could not provide comprehensive details of the feedback mechanism between stomatal conductance and stem water potential nevertheless it was inferred that the swc was the main driver of stomatal closure and stomatal closure was the controlling factor for maintaining the leaf turgor identifying the impact of abiotic stress factors with different intensities and duration on the trees is challenging due to the complexity of an unsupervised natural environment more controlled environmental conditions help evaluate the reproducibility of plant responses in the presence of different factors and changing intensities the outcome of this study provides critical information on crop water use for the citrus orchard in the region that can be used by local growers for a more efficient irrigation scheduling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10179,a sustainable agricultural system requires increasing water use efficiency and enhancing knowledge of crop water use this prerequisite is more pronounced in the regions with inadequate water resources and limited observational data such as southern iran therefore this study aimed at finding the water requirement of mature orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito by identifying standard evapotranspiration rate and crop coefficients single and dual seventy two orange trees in a drip irrigated orchard with loam soil were classified into six treatments and irrigated at 100 90 80 70 60 and 50 of reference evapotranspiration rate during 2017 and 2018 soil moisture variability and crop physiological responses including stem water potential ψ stem net photosynthesis an and stomatal conductance g s were measured our results showed that irrigating at 90 eto provided the full water requirements of the trees the mean crop evapotranspiration rate was calculated as 5 2 mm day 1 with the crop coefficient ranging from 0 65 to 0 95 the average irrigation rate performed traditionally in the region was 19 higher than the actual requirement analysis of physiological response highlighted the controlling role of stomata in regulating transpiration and maintaining leaf turgor during the peak water stress g s ranged from 0 11 to 0 12 molm 2 s 1 in fully irrigated trees to 0 04 0 08 molm 2 s 1 in highly stressed trees our findings will provide a useful guideline for the local growers and agencies to achieve better irrigation scheduling and higher water

prolonged droughts have posed severe challenges to the sustainability of the agricultural productivity of the regions the current situation necessitates the provision of water saving practices for enhancing agriculture production and alleviating the current orchard vulnerability the applicability of water saving approaches at core requires accurate information on crop water use i e crop coefficient and evapotranspiration fernández et al 2019 considering the limited academic research in southern iran on orchard water use it is crucial to carry out in situ and local experiments to identify crop specific information and water consumption for field grown orchards improving crop productivity requires a wide range of contributions including developing measurement devices henderson et al 2018 vagulabranan et al 2016 improving crop and soil based model simulations noshadi and jamshidi 2014 and optimizing irrigation scheduling nguyen et al 2017 perea et al 2016 in this regards many measurement platforms and models like multi resolution data sources for rainfall skofronick jackson et al 2017 and multiple evapotranspiration schemes and datasets abatzoglou 2013 niyogi et al 2020 as the two main drivers that affect crop yield and productivity have been developed nevertheless the major challenge in improving crop water productivity is still associated with collecting reliable in situ measurements in data sparse regions particularly for crop coefficient kc and the crop evapotranspiration rate etc jamshidi et al 2020 the importance of accurate etc estimates has been highlighted in several studies de medeiros et al 2005 er raki et al 2008 jamshidi et al 2019a with particular emphasis on crop coefficient maestre valero et al 2017 niziński et al 2017 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 nevertheless different studies have reported a range of values for kc etc even for a specific crop type the kc values recommended by fao for mature citrus trees for a mediterranean climate varies from 0 65 to 0 75 other studies on citrus however reported different values including 0 63 1 17 for 14 year old sweet lime by sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 in a semi arid region 0 96 1 9 for 33 year old navel orange in an arid climate by snyder and o connell 2007 0 3 0 9 for 8 year old citrus orchard in tropical savanna climate by peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 and 0 67 0 96 for 14 year old navel oranges by jamshidi et al 2020 the discrepancies in the kc and etc values can stem from the physiological specification of the crop consoli et al 2006 management practices zitouna chebbi et al 2015 the climate of the study region yang et al 2003 and soil characterization maestre valero et al 2017 applying water saving practices based on the information measured and calibrated for other regions could lead to exacerbating the water use efficiency therefore the information on crop coefficient and evapotranspiration needs to be locally measured particularly considering the importance of every drop in water scarce regions villalobos et al 2009 a sustainable implication of water saving practices requires monitoring crop water status rodríguez gamir et al 2010 the stem water potential ψstem and stomatal conductance gs are two water stress indices that properly reflect plant water status de lima et al 2015 taylor et al 2015 for a mature citrus tree in an optimum growing environment i e no water or heat stress the average values for gs and ψstem have been reported in a range of 0 12 0 15 molm 2 s 1 and 0 9 1 1 mpa respectively ballester et al 2013a romero trigueros et al 2014 when the soil moisture availability starts to deplete below a certain threshold the plant regulates its leaf gas exchange by partially closing the stomata gomes et al 2004 reported the midday ψstem below 1 mpa in young orange trees could trigger releasing the abscisic acid aba and stomatal closure villalobos et al 2009 used the daily gs of clementine mandarin average 1 85 mm s 1 and developed a model to calculate the transpiration of the orchards romero trigueros et al 2019 have also reported a high level of agreement between the crop water stress index reflecting water stress condition of the plant and the stem water potential in grapefruit trees while ψstem has been highlighted to have the most substantial role in governing the opening and closing of stomata the mechanism between ψstem and gs varies among different crop types and environmental conditions liu et al 2006 establishing the feedback mechanism between these two indicators can significantly help understand how the plants are functioning and responding to the water availability and irrigation strategy for example jamshidi et al 2020 reported an isohydric behavior of navel orange trees due to maintaining a relatively constant leaf turgor in water stress conditions by increasing stomatal resistance in this study we attempted to identify the crop coefficient and standard evapotranspiration rate of matured citrus trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito under the semi arid climate conditions of southern iran additionally the study aimed to identify the plant feedback in terms of ψstem an and g s responses to the different irrigation levels the finding of this study helps the local growers to identify the exact crop water use and develop more accurate irrigation scheduling to preserve the limited water sources 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the experiments were conducted for two consecutive years during 2017 and 2018 in a clean cultivated citrus orchard located 35 km west of kazeroon city latitude 28 32 n longitude 51 43 e elevation 920 m a s l fars province southern iran the climate of the study is classified as semi arid with an annual mean rainfall of 352 mm soufi 2004 the mean air temperature rises to over 40 c during the summer months and drops down to 3 c during the colder months the orchard soil type was classified as loam for the root zone depth the field capacity was 0 29 cm3 cm3 and the permanent wilting point was 0 11 cm3 cm3 the detailed characteristics of the soil and water of the study plot are listed in table 1 the orchard was compromised of 25 years old orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito planted at 6 5 m spacing the trees were drip irrigated and had an average height of 3 m with the shading area of 85 of the allotted spacing the trees start the flower bud induction during january and february and the flowering stage continues to the end of march april is the end of petal fall and in may the fruit setting starts and the young fruits ripen and develop through june to august the orange fruits typically remain on the trees until the end of december when they are harvested 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design the experimental plot was designed comprising of six irrigation levels in randomized blocks since the objective of the study was to identify the standard crop water use the amount of applied water for the irrigation treatments was set up based on the fraction of reference evapotranspiration eto from a high to low extent to cover the range proposed by fao 56 and other studies under similar climatic conditions allen et al 2005 jamshidi et al 2020 sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 each treatment had three replicates with four trees per each replicate that irrigated at 100 90 80 70 60 and 50 of eto the eto rate was calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using the following equation 1 et 0 rn g k t ρ a c p e s e a r a γ 1 r c r a λ where eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration rn is the net radiation g is the soil heat flux is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship γ is the psychrometric constant λ is the latent heat cp is the specific heat of air ρ a is the mean air density at constant pressure r a is the aerodynamic resistance r c is the canopy resistance e s is the saturated vapor pressure e a is the actual vapor pressure in kpa and k t is a time determination conversion coefficient in addition to the six irrigation treatments we also measured the amount of water that the local growers used for irrigating the orchard the supplied water for each irrigation treatment was determined weekly and adjusted based on the amount of rainfall all treatments were watered equally at 100 of eto prior to applying the irrigation levels to reduce any pre existing water deficiency the trees were subjected to the irrigation treatments from june to the end of december and the next january the water restriction was ended during february and all treatments were fully irrigated at 100 of eto this period coincides with the flowering and post blooming stages which have been well known as the most sensitive stage to water deficiency garcía tejero et al 2010 therefore to avoid fruit abscission and potential yield loss these stages were supplied with an adequate amount of water 100 eto 2 3 soil water balance parameterization we applied the water balance method to measure the amount of water consumed by crop evapotranspiration eq 2 the water balance approach considers the irrigation and rainfall as the primary inputs and subtracts the water content stored at the root zone sand deep percolated below the root zone to calculate etc flumignan et al 2011 sepaskhah and andam 2001 2 et c i p d i 1 n θ z i where i is the amount of applied water mm d is the deep percolation mm p is the rainfall mm n is the number of soil layers z is the soil layer thickness mm and θ s the volumetric soil water contents swc stored at soil profile cm3 cm 3 the amount of applied water in each of the treatments was measured using analog water meters rainfall data were collected from the weather station located 5 km north of the orchard weekly soil moisture variability was recorded with a neutron probe cpn 503 elite hydroprobetm at 30 cm soil layer intervals up to 120 cm in each replicate a microlysimeter was installed and the evaporation amount was recorded the microlysimeters were constructed using the procedures described in jamshidi et al 2020 the amount of water loss due to deep percolation was considered as negligible given the fact that treatments were drip irrigated other studies performed on drip irrigated orchards have also suggested that the amount of deep percolation is insignificant zhang et al 2017 by identifying the soil moisture content and measuring the amount of applied water and precipitation the evapotranspiration rate was calculated weekly for each of the irrigation levels 2 4 physiological measurements the midday stem water potential ψ stem was gauged on a bi weekly basis using a pressure chamber and based on the guideline provided in turner 1988 accordingly in each of the experimented trees ten leaves were selected and covered with aluminum foil for two hours prior to performing the measurements these leaves were cut from the tree and their water potential was immediately measured in the pressure chamber additionally a handheld photosynthesis system was used to record the stomatal conductance accordingly the sensor head was clipped onto a randomly selected leaf and stomatal conductance was recorded the physiological measurements were carried out between 12 00 and 2 00 pm on fair weather days 2 5 analysis and calculations the weekly crop coefficient k c was calculated as the ratio of et c based on weekly water balance to et o based on penman monteith calculations as 3 k c et c et 0 the single crop coefficient represents the combined impact of transpiration and soil evaporation into a single unit to differentiate between the effect of transpiration and evaporation wright 1982 introduced the concept of dual crop coefficient k cb as 4 k c dual k cb k e where k cb represents crop transpiration and k e represents soil water evaporation the values of k cb and k e were calculated using the following equations 5 k cb t et 0 k e e et 0 the calculated single and dual crop coefficient were compared with the values suggested in the fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 the k c values from the fao 56 are presented for sub humid regions with calm wind speeds u 2 of 2 m s 1 and minimum relative humidity rh min of 45 since the climatic condition of our study region was semi arid to compare the crop coefficients obtained in the study with those of fao 56 the mid season and end season k c and k cb values are adjusted based on the following equations 6 k c mid end season k c fao 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 7 k cb mid end season k cb fao 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the 2 m height m s 1 rh min is the minimum relative humidity and h is the plant canopy height m for the statistical analyses the tukey test was invoked to determine if the interaction among the treatments is mutually statistically significant 3 result and discussions 3 1 reference evapotranspiration the time series of daily reference evapotranspiration along with the primary meteorological variables including relative humidity wind speed rainfall and air temperature during the study years 2017 and 2018 are presented in fig 1 eto rates showed the lowest variability during winter january in particular with the mean value of 2 55 mm day 1 while it reached to just above 9 mm day 1 during summertime june in particular most of the rainfall occurred from january to april with a total amount of 333 2 mm in 2017 and 356 2 mm in 2018 the rainfall distribution of the two years of study was fairly similar with limited to no events from april to october and most of the events occurred from december to march the amount of applied water for each of the replicated was aimed to remain identical among the replicates however marginal differences were observed primarily due to emitter non uniformity that seemed reasonable considering the filed condition more detailed information on the differences between the treatments in terms of applied water rainfall and eto are presented in table 2 3 2 soil water content and crop evapotranspiration the soil moisture was measured at four soil layers i e 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 was scaled up into two groups as the top layer 0 60 cm and bottom layer 60 120 cm fig 2 shows the variability of soil moisture at these two layers throughout the two growing seasons the topsoil layer showed a higher variability compared to the deeper soil layer the soil moisture availability is controlled by atmospheric conditions evaporative demand root absorption and soil characteristics famiglietti et al 2008 deeper soil layers are limitedly impacted by atmospheric condition and root water absorption due to lower root distribution at deeper layers and therefore lower variability was observed at deeper layers across the irrigation treatments there was no significant difference during the non restriction period but as the irrigation treatments applied the soil moisture magnitude started to deviate from each other expectedly higher soil moisture availability was found on ir 100 with the mean values of 0 24 cm3 cm 3 for the top layer and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 for the sub soil layer during the water restriction period the soil moisture levels decreased as the severity of the water restriction increased and the mean soil water content dropped to 15 cm3 cm 3 during the water restriction period in ir 50 during summertime the extreme temperature and high evaporative demand caused the soil moisture availability to drop significantly reached to pwp in ir 60 and ir 50 as the climatic condition started to become milder the soil water content recovered the rate of recovery in lower irrigation levels e g ir 50 and ir 60 was slower compared to higher irrigation levels the amount of etc was monthly averaged and presented in fig 3 to identify the standard evapotranspiration rate we considered the variation of soil water content and etc among the irrigation treatments based on the soil moisture availability we calculated a water stress factor to identify the treatments that experienced water stress in fact eq 3 represents the single crop coefficient for an ideal condition i e adequate water mild weather and disease free condition for non ideal conditions particularly in low soil water potential a factor of water stress ks is incorporated into the kc this factor was calculated using the following equation 8 k s taw d r taw raw where taw is the amount of available water between field capacity θ fc and pwp θ pwp raw is readily available water defined as the available soil moisture between θ fc and the extent that the plant can absorb soil water considered as 0 6 θ fc following fao 56 recommendation and d r is root zone depletion relative to θ fc when d r is below raw the stress factor equals to 1 signifying a non stress condition as d r exceeds raw the plants experience a water stress condition with ks 1 allen et al 2005 in our study the ks for ir 80 ir 70 ir 60 and ir 50 was calculated as 0 88 0 81 0 74 and 0 58 these treatments were considered as deficit irrigation strategies for choosing the standard etc rate between ir 100 and ir 90 the incremental change in etc and soil moisture was evaluated it was observed that by increasing the irrigation amount from ir 90 to ir 100 the increase in the rate of et c was not statistically significant 1 65 on average while the increase in soil moisture was significant in ir 100 compared to ir 90 the additional water supply for ir 100 trees was not absorbed by the plant roots rather the extra water was stored in the soil profile therefore the et rate of the trees that were irrigated at 90 of eto was identified as the standard non stress condition and ir 100 was on over irrigation treatment the standard et c for the orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito ranged from 46 3 1 2 mm in january to 257 3 3 5 mm in july the seasonal et c was 1830 4 mm in 2017 and 1862 3 mm in the following year the kc values based on the ir 90 i e standard irrigation treatment ranged from 0 65 in january reached 0 95 in june and dropped to 0 7 at the end of winter fig 3 and table 3 our results of kc and etc were comparable with the values reported by jamshidi et al 2020 and jamshidi et al 2021a on washington navel oranges at an adjacent site 50 km south of our study location they reported the average seasonal etc value as 1850 mm with a mean kc value of 0 8 additionally considering other studies on a similar climatic condition but on different citrus types the reported results from rogers et al 1983 and sepaskhah and kashefipour 1995 were compatible with our study with the mean k c values of 1 during summer and 0 73 in winter within a similar crop type i e citrus the crop coefficient value can vary significantly depending on the environmental condition crop variety trees shape and vigor and agricultural management table 3 provides a better contrast of our reported kc values against other studies on citrus under comparable climatic conditions our measurements of the irrigation amount performed traditionally by the local farmers showed that they were irrigating at around 109 of eto 19 higher than the standard etc the details of the conventional irrigation application are provided in table 4 accordingly for each of the phenological growing stages we have shown the amount of standard water requirement and the amount of water local growers were using the over irrigation pattern was not uniformly distributed among the growing stages with the highest magnitude 21 during fruit set and fruit development and lowest 11 during harvest time given the seasonal crop water use of 1830 mm for an orange tree in the region the 19 over irrigation was translated into 347 mm per season considering the large orchard acreages in the region and limited water resources correcting the irrigation pattern by lowering 19 of water applications in the orchards could significantly contribute to the sustainability of the region by partitioning evapotranspiration the values for dual crop coefficient as evaporation ke and transpiration kcb coefficients were also calculated across the irrigation treatments and presented in table 5 on average evaporation constituted 6 5 of etc during winter and over 16 7 during summer for ir 90 the standard irrigation treatment the high summer soil evaporation was attributed to the higher frequency of irrigation higher vapor pressure deficit along with the hot winds fig 4 shows the detailed comparison of kc kcb and ke with the values from fao 56 adjusted for the region of study the values from fao 56 was lower compared to the measured values in our study 10 15 lower during a growing season this disparity has also been highlighted in several studies including niziński et al 2017 pérez pérez et al 2012 ruiz et al 2001 due to the several factors affecting the experimental conditions 3 3 plant physiological results 3 3 1 stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate responses the response of plants to water deficiency reflects in physiological feedbacks including loss of stem water potential closure of stomata and limiting the gas exchange between the leaf and air consoli et al 2006 in this section we provided the physiological response of the experimented orange trees to the irrigation levels including the variation of stem water potential ψ stem net photosynthesis an and stomatal conductance g s during the growing seasons illustrated in fig 5 the stomatal conductance of all trees fluctuated in a similar range before imposing water restriction at around 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 this showed the similarity between all of the treatments when the water availability was not a limiting factor with the start of the water restriction period june the difference between the irrigation treatment in terms of stomatal closure became evident fig 5 a the trees in the ir 100 treatment kept their stomatal conductance at a relatively constant rate of 0 10 and 0 12 molm 2 s 1 as the severity of water restriction increased i e from ir 100 to ir 50 a higher degree of stomatal closure was observed with ir 50 showing the lowest g s values mean value of 0 065 molm 2 s 1 during water restriction period by ending the water restriction period in each season january the stomatal conductance of ir 90 ir 80 ir 70 treatments returned to 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 signifying full recovery of the trees the ir 60 and ir 50 however could not fully recover and the g s values remained at a slightly lower compared to other treatments our reported values for stomatal resistance of well irrigated trees were aligned with the suggested values by allen et al 2005 however the g s values reported in literature hold a high variation from 0 005 molm 2 s 1 reported by dzikiti et al 2007 to 0 14 molm 2 s 1 in the study by pérez pérez et al 2012 for water stress conditions our measured g s values ranging from 0 04 to 0 08 molm 2 s 1 during summertime for ir 60 and ir 50 trees were in a similar range reported by consoli et al 2017 mossad et al 2018 and gomes et al 2004 with 0 03 0 09 molm 2 s 1 for orange trees on 40 60 of water reduction the net photosynthesis rate an followed a similar trend as the stomatal resistance during both of the growing seasons the ir 100 and ir 90 standard irrigation treatment trees kept their an at a constant rate of 12 2 molm 2 s 1 with the reduction of water supply plants started to regulate their gas exchange by lowering the an to 9 8 8 2 7 9 6 6 molm 2 s 1 for ir 80 ir 70 ir 60 and ir 50 the close relationship between stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis was illustrated in fig 7 a this relationship was translated into the equation of gs 0 01 an 0 008 with r2 of 0 81 monthly average values of net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance for all irrigation treatments are provided in fig 6 3 3 2 stem water potential response the resulting time series of the measured stem water potential ψ stem showed a lower variability compared to an and g s particularly in ir 100 ir 90 and ir 80 the mean ψ stem values remained relatively constant at 0 71 0 0 8 0 76 0 21 and 0 82 0 27 mpa by lowering water supply below 80 of eto i e ir 70 ir 60 and ir 50 the impact of water deficit was reflected in the loss of turgor the ψ stem from 0 75 mpa during non stress condition was dropped to 1 6 0 31 1 96 0 33 and 2 44 0 35 respectively for ir 70 ir 60 and ir 50 during the water restriction period all of the treatments were recovered after the water restriction period was finished with no significant difference among the treatments jamshidi et al 2020 reported the ψ stem of 12 years old navel washington oranges within the range of 0 07 to 2 9 mpa which was aligned with our findings additionally garcía tejero et al 2010 and ballester et al 2013b reported a range 1 2 to 2 5 mpa for navel oranges which was consistent with our measurements monthly average values of stem water potential for all irrigation treatments are also provided in fig 6 when the soil moisture availability starts to deplete below a certain threshold the plant regulates its leaf gas exchange by partially closing the stomata stomatal closure can also be triggered by other mechanisms including loss of leaf turgor the release of the abscisic acid aba increase of co2 concentration change in vapor pressure deficit and light intensity pérez pérez et al 2012 rana et al 2005 however the main driver of closing stomatal and its feedback mechanism with leaf turgor is crop dependant liu et al 2006 we first analyzed the physiological behavior of the experimented trees by considering the relationship between g s and ψ stem it was observed that while the mean value gs dropped by 22 percent during the water restriction period for none to mild water stressed conditions i e ir 100 ir 90 and ir 80 the ψ stem values reduced by only 6 this marginal reduction in stem water potential signified the isohydric behavior of the trees an isohydric plant reduces its stomatal conductance to preserve the leaves turgor when experiencing a drought condition however the plants did not show strict behavior considering the trees under moderate to severe water stress i e ir 700 ir 60 and ir 50 when the water supply was reduced below 70 of eto the stomatal adjustment was not adequate to sustain the balance between water absorption root water uptake and water loss transpiration causing the drop in water potential predominantly during hot windy days of summer with high evaporative demand the feedback between g s and ψ stem resulted in a statistically significant equation of gs 0 0453 ψstem 0 146 with r2 of 0 54 consistent with our results a linear correlation between ψ stem and g s in citrus has been reported by pérez pérez et al 2012 and mossad et al 2018 these types of correlations however are local and site crop dependent as other forms have been reported by other investigators for example a sigmoid correlation indicating a steady rate of ψ stem for a range of gs was reported by gomes et al 2004 and jamshidi et al 2020 the differences stem from the amplitude of controlling factors in experimental conditions including management driven e g tillage pruning fertilizing physiologically driven crop type variety and environmentally driven e g weather soil type factors the majority of prior studies have attributed the lack of soil moisture as the primary cause of stomatal closure while some researchers have highlighted the role of vpd on regulating stomatal conductance e g mossad et al 2018 in fig 7 c and d we have visualized the behavior of stomatal conductance as well as stem water potential with the change in soil water content and vpd considering the gs plot in high range of soil moisture swc 25 cm3 cm 3 and low vpd vpd 2 kpa the stomatal conductance remained high 0 13 0 15 molm 2 s 1 for the same soil moisture range swc 25 cm3 cm 3 but in high vpd vpd 4 kpa the stomatal conductance remained in high magnitude therefore in a non optimal climatic condition high vpd with adequate availability of the soil water content the plant stomatal remains open signifying a more dominant impact of soil water content on controlling the plant photosynthesis we can confirm this pattern by considering the low values of stomatal conductance i e stomatal closure when the soil moisture is limited swc 15 cm3 cm 3 and the climatic condition is not a stress factor vpd 2 kpa in a recent publication however kimm et al 2020 reported the dominant role of vpd on controlling gs with a relative contribution of 90 the focus of their study was on maize which is a c4 plan and has a different photosynthesis mechanism still such difference necessitates the importance of simultaneous analysis of vpd swc and physiological responses of the plant jamshidi et al 2021b has also highlighted the importance of vpd for estimating crop water stress index using satelitte and insitu data and monitoring citrus trees and orange trees in particular the behavior of stem water potential with regards to vpd and swc was slightly different from that of gs as shown in fig 7c the more scattered response of ѱstem was observed which was particularly due to the isohydric behavior of the trees as noted earlier the trees maintained their stem water potential at the cost of decreasing stomatal resistance in the study by zandalinas et al 2018 the stomatal responses to combined water stress and high temperature and vpd were linked to the severity of water stress this variablity emphasizes the intricate response of the plants given the complexity of the natural environment that involves different abiotic stress factors with various intensities and duration 4 conclusion in this study we attempted to identify the full irrigation requirement of orange trees citrus sinensis l osbeck cv tarocco ippolito on a field grown condition in southern iran our results indicated irrigating at 90 of eto as the full water requirement for which the crop coefficient ranged from 0 65 in january to 0 95 in june the conventional irrigation application was found to be significantly higher than the actual requirement particularly during the fruit set and fruit development periods with 21 of overirrigation this is particularly important considering limited water availability and drought vulnerability of the region and highlighted the need for modifying the pattern of water application in the region by partitioning evapotranspiration the rate of evaporation was estimated higher than the range suggested in other studies primarily due to the high irrigation frequency persistent wetted area during summer which was coincided with high advection and high evaporative demand our findings could not provide comprehensive details of the feedback mechanism between stomatal conductance and stem water potential nevertheless it was inferred that the swc was the main driver of stomatal closure and stomatal closure was the controlling factor for maintaining the leaf turgor identifying the impact of abiotic stress factors with different intensities and duration on the trees is challenging due to the complexity of an unsupervised natural environment more controlled environmental conditions help evaluate the reproducibility of plant responses in the presence of different factors and changing intensities the outcome of this study provides critical information on crop water use for the citrus orchard in the region that can be used by local growers for a more efficient irrigation scheduling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
