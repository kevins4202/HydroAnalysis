6690,joint monitoring of the variations of glaciers and lakes within a basin is essential for an accurate understanding of region wide climate change and the water cycle process the central kunlun kekexili region is an ideal experimental field due to the wide distribution of glaciers and lakes in this study we first investigated the glacier mass balance of 2000 2015 16 for seven major glacier clusters by utilizing high resolution spot 6 7 stereo imagery and the srtm dem the final results revealed an overall mass balance of 0 16 0 05 m w e a for the study region with a total glacier area of 967 km2 secondly icesat glas altimetry data were used to quantify the water level change of 2003 2008 09 for the two largest glacier fed closed lakes i e lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake in this region based on this we applied a strategy which establishes the statistical relationship between the lake area change and the lake water level change for 2003 2008 09 to estimate the specific water level using the corresponding lake area we then further calculated the variation in lake water storage between 2000 and 2015 the results showed that the water storage of lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake increased by 1 82 0 14 km3 and 1 90 0 38 km3 respectively for each lake basin meanwhile the glaciers lost 0 18 0 03 km3 and 0 21 0 04 km3 of water accounting for 9 9 and 11 1 of the increase in lake water storage for lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively our results not only demonstrate that glacier meltwater has only a limited impact on the lake expansion in this region but they also provide new evidence for the warming and wetting process of the climate in the northern part of the qinghai tibet plateau keywords glacier mass balance lake volume change qinghai tibet plateau spot 6 7 imagery icesat gla14 data 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp which is also known as the third pole of the earth contains a large number of alpine glaciers and lakes both of which are sensitive indicators of climate change studies have shown that glaciers across the qtp and its surroundings have experienced apparent mass loss yao et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 since the 1970s while most of the lakes in the interior of the qtp have been expanding song et al 2013 lei et al 2013 2014 after the 2000s both the glaciers and lakes have shown an accelerated change tendency zhang et al 2011 song et al 2013 lei et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 kääb et al 2015 brun et al 2017 within the qtp the variation of the glaciers and lakes not only plays an important role in regulating the regional water balance especially for a closed lake basin but also brings several potential risks for the ecological environment of the plateau tong et al 2016 therefore conducting a joint investigation into the glacier mass change and lake water budget of the qtp is of great significance for monitoring glacier mass change field measurement also known as the glaciological method is not only laborious and time consuming but is also a very challenging task due to the harsh natural environment with the rapid development of remote sensing technology the geodetic method based on the differencing of various topography data acquired in different epochs has been widely used gardelle et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 brun et al 2017 li et al 2017b compared to a considerable number of glacier investigations in the qtp s surroundings e g the himalaya karakoram mountains the inner qtp glaciers have received relatively little attention especially in the northern region over the whole inner qtp geodetic based estimates suggest that the glaciers overall have been in a negative state of mass budget for 2000 2016 with an apparent acceleration after 2008 for example from a comparison of aster digital elevation models dems brun et al 2017 reported an overall mass change of 0 14 0 07 m w e a for 2000 2016 for which the rate of mass loss increased from 0 01 0 19 m w e a for 2000 2008 to 0 24 0 20 m w e a for 2008 2016 despite a substantial overlap of error bars moreover based on icesat laser altimetry data of 2003 2008 09 gardner et al 2013 and brun et al 2017 also reported a slightly negative mass balance of 0 01 0 10 m w e a and 0 06 0 06 m w e a respectively at a sub region spatial scale the existing studies have revealed a strongly heterogeneous pattern of glacier mass change within the qtp for example the glaciers in the northwest of the qtp experienced relatively weak surface thinning e g 0 07 0 14 m a over the ulugh muztagh region fig 1 for 1975 2000 zhou et al 2018 or even pronounced thickening e g 0 44 0 26 and 0 86 0 31 m a zengse kungri and songzhi peak for 2003 2009 neckel et al 2014 phan et al 2017 in contrast the central qtp e g tanggula mountains suffered from serious surface down wasting with a rate of elevation change increasing from 0 26 0 14 m a for 1976 2000 zhou et al 2018 to 0 68 0 29 or 0 88 0 41 m a for 2003 2009 neckel et al 2014 phan et al 2017 in particular in the north of the qtp i e the central kunlun kekexili region the existing results of the glacier elevation change exhibited a contradictory situation e g 0 90 0 28 m a in neckel et al 2014 versus 0 03 0 47 m a in phan et al 2017 for 2003 2009 however despite being a 1 1 geographic grid brun et al s 2017 results implied that this region may have been in a state of mass deficit for 2000 2016 accordingly how the glaciers of this region respond to climate variation at a fine spatial scale is still an issue that deserves to be solved especially considering the spatial distribution of the glaciers being relatively dispersed in addition by exploying icesat ice cloud and land elevation satellite data previous studies have shown that the vast majority of lakes in the northern part of the qtp have experienced varying degrees of water level rise with the rate ranging from 0 04 m a to 0 53 m a for 2003 2009 zhang et al 2011 phan et al 2012 song et al 2014b recent studies analyzing icesat data and cryosat 2 radar altimetry data revealed that for the period of 2003 2014 2015 the lakes of the northern qtp as a whole experienced the most significant water level rise compared to other regions within the plateau song et al 2015a 2015b jiang et al 2017 for example for kekexili lake and lexiewudan lake the two largest glacier fed closed lakes the rates of water level rise increased from 0 29 m a and 0 34 m a for 2003 2009 song et al 2014b to 0 40 m a and 0 45 m a for 2010 2015 jiang et al 2017 respectively however for the period corresponding to the glacier monitoring of this study i e 2000 2015 the lake volume change which is the most direct reflection of regional surface water storage is still unknown although zhang et al 2017 estimated the lake volume change across the whole qtp from the early 1970s to 2015 to estimate lake volume change specific lake water levels at the beginning and end of the observation period must be known in particular for a study period in which lake water levels are unavailable e g 2000 2015 in general the previous studies first established a functional relationship between lake area and water level for a certain period with continuous water level measurements e g 2003 2009 by using a first order linear or second order regression model and then calculated the unmeasured lake water levels based on the corresponding lake areas song et al 2013 2014a zhang et al 2013a nevertheless in this study we directly build on the statistical relationship between lake level change and area change to estimate the unmeasured water level and further calculate the lake volume change once the lake storage change is known we can quantitatively evaluate the contribution of glacier meltwater to lake expansion in a closed lake basin based on an assumption that the glacier mass loss is completely transferred to the lakes lei et al 2012 2013 with regard to the causes of lake expansion especially the contribution of glacier meltwater song et al 2014b and zhang et al 2017 from the angle of qualitative analysis and quantitative evaluation respectively concluded that for the whole of the qtp glacier meltwater plays an important but not a dominant role in lake growth in addition for local areas quantitative evaluations based on either integrated physical models e g hydrological models glacier melt models and heat balance equations or an indirect estimate of glacier meltwater based on the hypothesis mentioned above have mainly concentrated on the central qtp due to the abundant in situ observation data e g in seling co lake lei et al 2013 tong et al 2016 and nam co lake wu et al 2014a b li et al 2017a however to date the contribution of glacier meltwater to lake water level rise is still unclear in the north of the qtp in view of the above issues the aims of this study included two main aspects firstly by using spot 6 7 stereo imagery acquired in 2015 16 and shuttle radar topography mission srtm dems from 2000 we generated the first high resolution map of glacier elevation change in the central kunlun kekexili region including seven sampling regions and obtained a region wide glacier mass change figure based on the geodetic method secondly we estimated the water storage change of two typical glacier fed closed lakes i e lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake between 2000 and 2015 using the strategy mentioned above we then roughly quantified the contribution of glacier meltwater to the lake expansion based on the assumption mentioned above the results of this work will help to improve the understanding of the responses of glaciers and lakes to climate change and the relationship between them in the northern part of the qtp 2 study region the central kunlun kekexili region is located in the north of the qtp with an average altitude of above 5000 m owing to the harsh natural environment characterized by a cold and dry climate this area is sometimes referred to as no man s land on this plateau the mean annual air temperature is on average about 10 c and the annual precipitation is 173 494 mm li et al 1996 more than 90 of the precipitation occurs from may to september implying that the glaciers in this region belong to the summer accumulation type in addition affected by the intense westerly winds this area is one of the regions with the highest wind speed in the entire qtp li et al 1996 furthermore throughout the whole region the terrain is relatively flat and there are some scattered mountains among which the highest peak is xinqingfeng mountain with an altitude of about 6800 m fig 1 in these high altitudes the glaciers and ice caps are fully developed and together cover a total area of 1810 km2 in the northern part of the qtp from optical images it appears that the glacier surface are relatively clean and that debris is almost non existent in addition there are a large number of alpine lakes of all shapes and sizes in this region of these lakes kekexili lake and lexiewudan lake which both cover an area of more than 200 km2 are the largest glacier fed endorheic lakes in particular over the lexiewudan basin the minimum distance from glacier front to lake inlet is only about 20 km this is thus an ideal experimental region for evaluating the response of lakes to glacier changes in the kekexili basin the water from yinma lake seasonally overflows into kekexili lake in addition these three lakes despite being located in adjacent areas have different phenological features possibly due to the differences in hydrochemical characteristics bathymetry and lake shape yao et al 2013 3 dataset 3 1 spot 6 7 imagery as an extension of the spot mission two advanced satellites spot 6 and spot 7 pushbroom imaging systems were successfully launched on september 9 2012 and june 7 2014 both satellites were designed with the same orbit setting sun synchronous orbit with a 98 2 inclination at an altitude of 694 km and phased 180 from each other allowing the satellites to revisit anywhere with a minimum period of one day the panchromatic and multispectral images are acquired simultaneously with a ground sample distance gsd of about 2 1 m and 8 4 m nadir condition corresponding to a nominal resolution of 1 5 m and 6 m by oversampling processing in the ground segment spot 6 7 user guide the radiometric coding of the images is 12 bits which is higher than that in the previous spot series satellites benefiting from the exceptional agility of the telescope instrument the two satellites can offer a flexible base to height b h ratio to generate stereo or tri stereo data over the qtp they have been successfully used to estimate glacier elevation changes ragettli et al 2016 kääb et al 2018 in this study we selected the classic stereo mode forward and backward viewing geometry with a b h ratio between 0 39 and 0 56 table 1 all of these images have had radiometric and sensor distortion corrections performed 3 2 landsat 5 7 8 imagery we collected a total of 18 landsat images five scenes for landsat 5 11 scenes for landsat 7 and two scenes for landsat 8 to retrieve the time series lake boundaries and to provide a reference for the glacier outlines in 2000 because of the scan line corrector slc failure of the landsat 7 satellite on may 30 2003 the landsat 7 images have contained wedge shaped data gaps since that date causing approximately 22 data loss for each scene all of the images we used belonged to the highest quality level 1 precision terrain l1tp data due to that the geo registration accuracy of the data is better than 12 m they can be directly used to perform a pixel level time series analysis https landsat usgs gov landsat collections moreover regarding the issue of data selection a vital and universal criterion is that the fraction of cloud coverage in the optical images should be as small as possible especially over the glaciers and lakes as well as their nearby zones more concretely for glacier areas we should avoid utilizing images affected by heavy seasonal snowfall which can make it difficult to distinguish exact glacier outlines for lake areas in order to obtain more accurate boundaries we chose images acquired in the non freezing period with regard to the few images inevitably contaminated by cloud we employed the images close to their acquisition dates to assist with the complete delineation of lake glacier boundaries details are given in table 1 3 3 srtm dem in this study we used the srtm 1 arc second 30 m global elevation data srtm gl1 from the u s geological survey to investigate the glacier elevation change compared to the raw data products the voids of this dataset have been filled but may still exist in some areas by checking the srtm non void filled elevation data we found that this study region is not affected by data gaps moreover the srtm x band dems released by the dlr with a spatial resolution of 25 m ludwig and schneider 2006 were used to estimate the first order approximation of the penetration depth of the c band radar for technical reasons the swath width of the srtm x band dem is limited to 50 km resulting in incomplete data coverage for the land surface roth et al 2001 for example in the yulanggangri ice cap and the xinqingfeng and malan mountains the x band dem data are unavailable it should be noted that the srtm c band dem provides the orthometric height with the egm96 geoid as the vertical datum while the x band data represent the ellipsoid height with respect to wgs84 for the horizontal datum they are both referenced to the wgs84 ellipsoid farr et al 2007 3 4 icesat glas elevation data the icesat satellite launched in january 2003 is the first spaceborne laser altimeter mission and its main payload is the geoscience laser altimeter system glas instrument with a pulse wavelength of 1064 nm zwally et al 2002 zhang et al 2011 icesat data are acquired in the form of a footprint or facula with a nominal diameter of 70 m in practice with a size of 50 105 m sampled at a spacing of about 172 m along the track zwally et al 2002 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 due to the design of the polar orbit the icesat sample track is relatively sparse at low and middle latitudes e g the qtp with a cross track distance ranging from hundreds of meters to dozens of kilometers in addition studies have proven that icesat glas elevation data have an excellent altimetry and geolocation accuracy corresponding to decimeter and meter levels respectively zwally et al 2002 2008 phan et al 2012 zhang et al 2013b hence icesat glas elevation data have been widely used for monitoring the fluctuation of inland lake water levels zhang et al 2011 2013b phan et al 2012 song et al 2013 in the present study we exploited the latest version l2 level altimeter product gla14 release 34 which can be freely downloaded from the national ice and snow data center nisdc the data are referenced to the topex poseidion ellipsoid and egm 2008 geoid 4 data processing 4 1 glacier change estimation 4 1 1 glacier boundaries in this study we did not generate our own glacier outlines but directly used the second chinese glacier inventory cgi 2 version 1 0 liu et al 2014 which was produced based on landsat tm etm images taken mainly during 2006 2010 guo et al 2015 the position accuracy of the cgi 2 boundaries is about 10 m for manually revised clean ice outlines guo et al 2015 over this study area the cgi 2 outlines represent the glacier extent in 2005 in consideration of possible glacier advance and retreat within our study period we manually edited the cgi 2 boundaries to obtain the most extensive glacier extent by reference to the landsat 5 tm images from 2000 and the orthorectified spot 6 7 images from 2015 16 furthermore based on the final glacier elevation change map we made a slight adjustment for the boundaries in the accumulation zones only for xinqingfeng and malan mountains 4 1 2 spot 6 7 dem generation we processed all of the spot 6 7 stereo images via the orthoengine module of pci geomatica 2014 due to that there are no in situ ground control points gcps in this study region we chose to automatically collect the gcps from the srtm c band dem to be specific the first step was to orthorectify the spot 6 7 panchromatic images with a resolution of 1 5 m by utilizing the srtm data the second step was to implement an automatic gcp collection program in the pci geomatica software with the orthorectified image and the srtm dem as the horizontal and vertical references respectively meanwhile in order to improve the accuracy of the stereo model between 30 and 48 tie points tps used for assisting the orientation were automatically identified based on the correlation matching technique table 2 we found that it was very necessary to visually check every gcp and tp we first removed some gcps measured in glacier areas and mountain ridges valleys with possibly inaccurate elevation information similarly some tps located in the vicinity of cloud and shadow were also discarded only for the ekl 1 and ekl 2 regions the final model residuals in the image space were below 0 52 pixels table 2 finally the extracted dems were resampled to the 30 m resolution in utm projection and a median filter was carried out with a sample window of 3 3 4 1 3 dem differencing with regard to the differencing process for the dems we mainly followed the strategy of zhou et al 2017 2018 specifically we first employed the classic three dimensional registration method proposed by nuth and kääb 2011 to make the srtm dems match the spot 6 7 dems subsequently we checked and corrected the maximum curvature elevation slope and aspect dependent biases by applying the fitted polynomial based on the statistics over ice free regions to the glacier areas in addition given the fact that for this pushbroom type sensor weak variations of the satellite attitude caused by slight jitter can induce bias along the direction of the flight and or cross track in the resulting dem products berthier et al 2007 leprince et al 2007 nuth and kääb 2011 by visually checking the final elevation difference maps we did not find along or cross track bias finally for pixels whose values are larger than the three fold standard deviation of glacier elevation change of the altitude band they belong to we removed them as outliers as for the ice free areas the detailed statistics are given in table 2 4 1 4 estimation of the penetration depth difference between the srtm c band and x band dems in general since c band radar can penetrate into glacier ice by up to 1 2 m and into dry snow by up to 10 m rignot et al 2001 in order to more accurately quantify the glacier thickness changes the impact of the penetration depth needs to be eliminated as much as possible especially for snow covered areas in this study following the method of gardelle et al 2013 we provided the first order approximate estimate of the c band penetration depth by subtracting the srtm c band dem from the x band dem details of the data processing can be found in zhou et al 2018 it should be emphasized that the penetration depth we obtained actually represents the penetration depth difference between c band and x band radar as the x band radar can also penetrate into dry snow by up to 2 6 m dehecq et al 2016 round et al 2017 lambrecht et al 2018 kääb et al 2018 based on the elevation difference map a penetration depth difference curve as a function of altitude was obtained and was then used to perform the correction for each pixel in the glacier areas for the jinyanggangri ice cap the srtm x band dem does not cover the whole study region resulting in no penetration depth corrections at high altitudes above 5700 m given that the obtained penetration depth difference basically showed a linear trend fig 2 we linearly extrapolated the curve to the unmeasured zones and obtained a region wide average penetration difference of 3 14 m which is slightly higher than the original result of 2 26 m in addition for regions where the srtm x band dems are unavailable such as the xinqingfeng malan and yulanggangri regions we did not follow the frequently used strategy of employing the average penetration corrections in the nearby regions gardelle et al 2013 but instead adopted the penetration trend of the adjacent areas and further made a reasonable adjustment referring to linear extrapolation in accordance to the corresponding glacier hypsometry our strategy should be more reasonable as it takes into account the difference in glacier hypsometry for different regions to be specific the penetration trend in wuxuefeng mountain was used to estimate the corrections for xinqingfeng and malan mountains for the yulanggangri ice cap the result for the jingyanggangri ice cap was employed the final average penetration depth differences were 3 43 m for qinqingfeng mountain 3 26 m for malan mountain and 2 55 m for the yulanggangri ice cap table 3 4 1 5 calculation of geodetic mass balance and uncertainty assessment to calculate the mass balance the first step was to obtain the glacier hypsometry and to generate a glacier thickness change curve as a function of altitude for each sub region for the data gaps in the elevation difference map they were filled by the average elevation change calculated by valid pixels in the same altitude band the region wide volume change could then be obtained by an integral operation of the thickness change and the area for each altitude interval ultimately a conversion factor of 850 60 kg m3 was used to translate the volume change into mass change gardelle et al 2013 huss 2013 in particular given that the pattern and magnitude of elevation change of the surge type glaciers were totally different from those of the non surge type glaciers their mass balances b were separately calculated using eq 1 and added to the final region wide results based on an area weighting strategy 1 b f c r 2 δ h s where r is the spatial resolution of the elevation difference map 30 m and δ h and s respectively represent the thickness change of each pixel and the glacier area for a given glacier f c denotes the conversion coefficient 0 85 0 06 to evaluate the total uncertainty of the mass balance the random error and systematic error need to be considered comprehensively for the random error we first took into account the uncertainty of the glacier thickness change which mainly depended on the errors of the dems and the penetration depth difference estimation in fact the latter also depends on the dem error as it was determined by the differencing of the dems given the fact that high altitudes in this study area are almost completely covered by ice and snow we used the standard deviation of the elevation difference of the entire ice free area to represent the uncertainties of the glacier elevation change and penetration difference estimation for each altitude band furthermore in order to consider the influence of spatial autocorrelation between dems we fitted an experimental semivariogram using a spherical model in ice free regions the obtained autocorrelation distance ranges from 80 m to 240 m for the penetration depth difference maps and from 150 m and 330 m for the glacier elevation difference maps considering that glacier areas generally have a higher autocorrelation than stable regions rolstad et al 2009 we conservatively assumed that the autocorrelation distance in glacier areas was four times that in ice free regions the uncertainty of the glacier thickness change σ δ h for each altitude band i was then calculated by eqs 2 4 2 σ δ h i σ g n e f f g i 2 σ p n e f f p i 2 3 n e f f g i 1 n e f f g i 1 n t r 2 π 4 d g 2 n e f f g i 1 4 n e f f p i 1 n e f f p i 1 n t r 2 π 4 d p 2 n e f f p i 1 where σ denotes the standard deviation of the elevation difference in the ice free regions and the subscripts p and g represent the glacier elevation difference map and the penetration depth difference map respectively n e f f g i and n e f f p i denote the number of independent observations for each elevation band n t is the total number of observations for a given altitude interval d g and d p denote the autocorrelation distance for non glacier areas the uncertainties of the volume change σ δ v and the mass balance σ δ m r d n were then respectively calculated by eqs 5 7 based on the strategy of zhou et al 2018 5 σ δ v i 1 n σ δ h i s i 2 where s i is the glacier area for each altitude band 6 σ δ m 0 δ v σ δ f s t 2 σ δ v δ f s t 2 δ v δ f δ s s t 2 2 where σ δ f is the uncertainty of the conversion factor 60 kg m3 δ s is the uncertainty of the glacier boundaries which was assumed to be an error of 10 in this study maurer et al 2016 s t is the total glacier area for each investigated region σ δ m 0 refers to the initial mass balance uncertainty 7 σ δ m r d n σ δ m 0 2 σ a b s p 2 1 1 p v o i d where σ a b s p represents the uncertainty caused by the absolute penetration depth of the c band radar i e considering the uncertainty induced by the penetration depth of the x band radar in this study we conservatively assumed that this was in the order of 1 5 m corresponding to a mass change of 1 28 m w e gardelle et al 2013 p void denotes the proportion of data voids for each region fig 4 the aim of introducing this term was to consider the uncertainty caused by the data gaps more details concerning the accuracy evaluation can be found in zhou et al 2018 in addition it should be highlighted that we did not take the influence of seasonal snowfall into account this study as the images we used were acquired mainly from september to march where the precipitation can be considered negligible furthermore for the systematic error we used the absolute mean of the elevation differences in ice free area to approximately represent it the corresponding mass balance uncertainties σ δ m s y s are between 0 00 and 0 20 m w e table 2 finally the total uncertainty of the mass balance σ δ m can be obtained by eq 8 8 σ δ m σ δ m r d n 2 σ δ m s y s 2 4 2 lake change estimation 4 2 1 lake boundary extraction we first filled the data gaps in the landsat 7 etm images using a simple toolbox landsat gapfill in envi software a band ratio method band 4 band 5 for landsat 5 7 tm etm images band 5 band 6 for landsat 8 oli images with an empirical threshold of 2 0 was then applied to automatically identify the lake outlines li et al 2017a the initial lake boundaries were then refined by visually comparing the landsat false color images rgb bands 5 4 3 for some images more or less contaminated by cloud we made a further revision in local zones of the lake boundaries by reference to the multi temporal landsat images moreover since lexiewudan lake merges with several nearby small lakes during its expansion in the course of editing the lake boundaries we excluded these lakes when they were completely separated but included them when they merged into one lake fig s1 4 2 2 icesat glas data processing lake water volume change estimation and uncertainty assessment in order to ensure the consistency of the reference datum we first transformed the topex poseidon ellipsoid and egm2008 geoid into the wgs84 ellipsoid and egm96 geoid respectively we then took the saturation correction of the glas detector into consideration as specular reflection occurring on a flat lake surface easily induces distortion of the altimetry echo pulses in this study the average saturation correction was about 0 40 m with a maximum of 1 38 m for some footprints whose saturation correction values were characterized by 999 suggesting that these points need to be corrected but do not have valid correction values they were excluded to avoid introducing potential bias abdallah et al 2011 the performance of the saturation correction is shown in fig s2 subsequently we employed a two step procedure to check and remove outliers zhang et al 2011 the first step was to remove the gross error possibly induced by the cloud coverage based on a visual inspection however in this study we did not find this type of error next in consideration of the vertical accuracy of the icesat glas altimetry data we set a threshold of standard deviation of 15 cm to remove some footprints causing a large deviation fig s2 after performing the above corrections the icesat footprints were used to analyze the lake water level change for 2003 2008 09 to obtain the lake volume change within the study period the lake water levels for 2000 and 2015 were needed given that a rise of lake water level is generally expressed by the expansion of the lake area there may be a certain relationship between the lake water level change and the lake area change let us imagine that a lake can be approximately represented by a bowl when the water level rises by δ h from a vertical section a functional relationship δ h δ x tan θ can be easily established where θ denotes the slope and δ x represents the horizontal displacement of the boundary caused by the surface expansion however in practice since the lake shape and the horizontal displacement of the boundary are not regular and highly variable fig s1 the lake area change can be expressed by a generalized function δ s f δ x based on this the relationship between the lake water level change and the area change can be established by δ h f 1 δ s tan θ in addition as the change could be positive increase or negative decrease the functional model can be further extended as δ h f 1 δ s tan θ thus we can use regression analysis to establish the relationship between the area change and the water level change in an absolute sense assuming that the mean slope of the terrain around the lakes is a constant varying with the lakes it should be noted that in this study we only retrieved the lake boundaries for the times with significant water level fluctuations i e in late spring early summer and autumn and performed the differencing operation in pairs of two arbitrary measurements to build the statistical relationship between the lake level change δ h and area change δ s according to the established statistical model we could extrapolate the lake water level using the lake areas for 2000 and 2015 and further estimate the lake water volume change δ v lake using eq 9 lei et al 2013 tong et al 2016 9 δ v lake 1 3 h 2 h 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where h and a denote the lake water level and lake area respectively the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the beginning and the end observation times to evaluate the accuracy of the lake volume change we used the prediction interval of the regression model to approximately represent the uncertainty of the extrapolated water level σ h with regard to the uncertainty of the lake area σ s it was calculated by the product of the lake perimeter and the image resolution 15 m based on an assumption of one pixel error for the lake boundary finally according to error propagation law the uncertainty of the lake volume change σ δ v lake was obtained by eq 10 supposing that the error of each term in eq 9 follows a gaussian distribution 10 σ δ v lake 1 9 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 2 σ h 2 2 σ h 1 2 1 36 h 2 h 1 2 a 2 a 1 1 2 σ s 1 2 a 1 a 2 1 2 σ s 2 2 5 results 5 1 glacier thickness change and mass balance from fig 3 it can be seen that almost all of the glaciers among the investigated areas experienced different degrees of surface thinning near their toes except for the surging glaciers based on the median elevation of each glacier from the randolph glacier inventory rgi version 6 0 rgi consortium 2017 we approximately estimated the position of the region wide glacier equilibrium line by using the mean of them and further divided glaciers areas into two parts the ablation zones and the accumulation zones fig 4 to be specific for the ablation zones the highest rate of surface down wasting of 0 51 0 05 m a appeared in the xinqinfeng region followed by the malan and wuxuefeng regions with a value of 0 47 0 06 m a and 0 43 0 10 m a respectively the other regions also exhibited pronounced surface lowering ranging from 0 26 0 06 m a to 0 18 0 06 m a for the accumulation zones the malan and wuxuefeng regions showed slight thinning at a rate of 0 05 0 08 m a and 0 06 0 06 m a respectively while the ckl 2 exhibited a nearly stable condition 0 00 0 20 m a the rest of areas showed different degrees of thickening ranging from 0 06 0 28 m a to 0 24 0 07 m a synthesizing all the glacier changes over all the sample sites with a total glacier area of 966 7 km2 shows an area weighted mass balance of 0 16 0 05 m w e a for 2000 2015 which is equivalent to a mass loss of 0 16 0 05 gt a across the entire region the pattern of glacier mass change is heterogeneous the highest rate of mass loss occurred in the malan and xinqinfeng mountains with mass budgets of 0 22 0 10 and 0 21 0 10 m w e a followed by the wuxuefeng region with 0 16 0 10 m w e a the jinyanggangri ckl 1 and ckl 2 regions have been in a state of slightly negative budget corresponding to mass changes of 0 04 0 09 0 08 0 21 and 0 09 0 16 m w e a respectively in particular an approximately balanced condition 0 01 0 11 m w e a can be found in the yulanggangri ice cap 5 2 lake water level changes 2003 2008 09 and 2000 2015 from fig 5 the left pictures the rates of lake water level rise for 2003 2008 09 are 0 36 m a and 0 31 m a for lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively this is in agreement with previous results for the same period about 0 34 m a and 0 29 m a phan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 song et al 2014b interestingly the water level exhibited a stable and continuous increase each year in lexiewudan lake but showed a significant increase every two years in kekexili lake moreover in accordance with the selected icesat data and the corresponding lake areas table s1 the statistical model and lake water level changes for 2000 2015 are shown in fig 5 the middle and right pictures in the whole study period the water level of lexiewudan lake basically exhibited a monotonous increase with a mean increase rate of 0 49 m a corresponding to an overall rise of 7 40 m for which the rates of the two sub periods 2000 2007 and 2007 2015 were 0 50 m a 3 52 m and 0 49 m a 3 88 m respectively in contrast kekexili lake reflected a mean rate of water level rise of 0 38 m a 5 76 m for 2000 2015 comparing the results of the two sub periods indicates that the rate of water level rise increased by 100 from 0 26 m a 1 8 m for 2000 2007 to 0 50 m a 3 96 m for 2007 2015 furthermore in order to better validate the performance of our model we compare our results with those obtained by jiang et al 2017 using cryosat 2 data it is evident that the cryosat 2 results are consistent with our estimated trend in kekexili lake but are slightly higher than that in lexiewudan lake fig 5 this may be caused by the systematic bias between the two datasets song et al 2015b crétaux et al 2016 5 3 lake volume change and the contribution of glacier meltwater to lake expansion for 2000 2015 the estimated lake water volume changes are 1 82 0 14 km3 and 1 90 0 38 km3 in lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively summing up the volume changes of each individual glacier within the respective lake basins gives a volume change of 0 18 0 03 km3 and 0 21 0 04 km3 figs s3 and s4 under the simple hypothesis that all of the lost water in the glacier systems flows into the lakes without consideration of evaporation sublimation or the wastage in the course of transport the glacier mass loss respectively accounts for 9 9 and 11 1 of the lake growth in lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake in particular an additional assumption that yinma lake has been in balance during 2000 2015 is needed for the kekexili basin given the fact that the lake extent is unchanged 6 discussion 6 1 the impact of penetration depth on glacier mass change since the penetration depth of the x band radar was not considered the penetration depth of the c band radar we obtained is likely underestimated prior studies have shown that for dry snow the penetration depth of x band radar can reach 2 6 m in antarctica groh et al 2014 seehaus et al 2015 zhao and floricioiu 2017 and 4 6 m in the alps berthier et al 2016 dehecq et al 2016 especially in the qtp and its surroundings the x band average penetration depth in the accumulation zone is about 2 m or less in the karakoram mountain round et al 2017 3 m in the western tibet kääb et al 2018 and 3 4 m in the central pamir lambrecht et al 2018 these imply that the uncorrected x band penetration depth may introduce significant bias into the final mass balance estimation if there is a large amount of dry snow however the precipitation in this region is sparse especially in winter the season of srtm acquisition xie et al 2000 reported that the amount of annual precipitation in the form of snowfall is only about 400 500 mm in the altitude of the glacier equilibrium line in the malan region we can thus intuitively speculate that the thickness and extent of the dry snow may be limited in this area in addition in order to better elaborate this issue we generated a complimentary result by considering the penetration depth of the x band radar assuming an average of 1 5 m for the entire glacier area gardelle et al 2013 the updated results are more negative by 0 08 m w e a than our results but the two results agree within the error bounds fig 6 furthermore under the hypothesis of the average penetration depth of x band radar being 4 m the setting of this study 1 5 m actually means that the coverage ratio of dry snow reaches about 40 in this region intuitively this ratio may be rational or even overestimated this is because with the increase of altitude the accumulation zones consist of superimposed ice zones wet snow zones percolation zones and dry snow zones in sequence xie and liu 2010 a 40 ratio of dry snow with an average thickness of 4 m seems to be high given the currently known climate conditions from another point of view the maximum penetration depth obtained by the extrapolation in this study is about 9 m in the xinqingfeng region which is very close to the 10 m maximum penetration of c band radar for dry snow rignot et al 2001 this might imply that the penetration depth estimation in this study is close to the real penetration depth thus we believe that the impact of the x band penetration depth is not enough to subvert the current results 6 2 comparison with previous mass balance studies with regard to the glacier mass balance our result of 0 16 0 05 m w e a in the whole study region for 2000 2015 is comparable to the icesat based estimate of phan et al 2017 0 03 0 47 m a for 2003 2009 when considering the error bars but clearly disagrees with that of neckel et al 2014 0 77 0 35 m w e a for 2003 2009 despite the fact that our study period is twice as long furthermore for the same or similar study period a detailed comparison of our results with those of brun et al 2017 2000 2016 shows that the differences of the mass balance are between 0 03 and 0 03 m w e a for individual sampling regions and only 0 01 m w e a for the whole regions table 4 this indicates that the two results are compatible given the error bounds in addition due to that brun et al s 2017 results are not affected by the radar penetration depths the comparison also confirms our speculation with respect to the limited impact of the x band penetration depth in this study in addition through a comparison of the pattern of the glacier elevation change between brun et al 2017 and this study we can speculate that this study region likely lies in a transition zone from negative to near zero or positive mass balance for the whole of the kunlun mountains this is because the glaciers from the yulanggangri ice cap toward the west along the kunlun mountains have shown a positive mass balance see fig 2a in brun et al 2017 this can also be confirmed by the findings of neckel et al 2014 and phan et al 2017 6 3 comparison of different regression models for lake water level extrapolation to further validate the effectiveness and reliability of our models used to extrapolate water level we re estimated the water level in 2000 and 2015 by utilizing the first order and second order polynomial fit of the lake area versus the lake water level respectively meanwhile with the cryosat 2 observation in 2014 as the reference we made a comparison for all results in table 5 we can see that if only from the angle of the model selection the second order polynomial model for the two lakes seems to be preferable as its coefficient of determination r2 is larger than others nevertheless the final results show that for 2015 the estimated water levels based on the second order model are 3 46 m lexiewudan lake and 8 35 m kekexili lake higher than the reference value respectively clearly such significant water level change within one year is impossible and the estimates are totally erroneous this can be confirmed by comparing optical images which shows only a weak expansion in these two lakes for 2014 2015 in contrast the results calculated by the two linear models overall are comparable to the reference water level for example in lexiewudan lake the differences between the extrapolated water level and the reference data are 0 13 m and 0 15 m respectively which are lower than the average rate of 0 50 m a for 2003 2014 this may be caused by the systematic bias between the icesat and cryosat 2 datasets fig 5 meanwhile the difference of 0 02 m between the estimated results suggests that the performance of the two linear model is similar in this lake however it should be highlighted that the extrapolation accuracy of our linear model is higher with a relatively low uncertainty e g 0 45 m versus 0 73 m table 5 this is because in the same conditions the increase in the number of independent observations can enhance the robustness and reliability of the model prediction similarly for kekexili lake the differences of the estimated results versus reference water level are 1 22 m and 0 68 m respectively given the latter is very close to the rate of water level rise of 0 50 m a for 2007 2014 our result is more reasonable and reliable meanwhile this also indicates that our model is optimal at least in this lake as another linear model using the lake area and the water level as parameters generates an overestimated result in addition with regard to the lake water level estimation in 2000 considering the performance of our models discussed above we believe that our results are more accurate in spite of the lack of reference data in conclusion the models of lake water level extrapolation we used are effective and the results can be considered as reliable and acceptable 6 4 analysis of the contribution of glacier meltwater and the potential driving forces of lake changes in this study with regard to the contribution of glacier meltwater to lake expansion since we did not consider the mass loss caused by the evaporation and sublimation process in the glacier systems and the transfer wastage i e evaporation percolation loss in the process of runoff flow our results represent a maximum contribution or an upper bound this means that in the lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake basins the contributions from glacier mass loss were no more than 9 9 and 11 1 between 2000 and 2015 respectively revealing a limited impact on lake water storage change if we assume a glacier runoff coefficient of 0 6 wu et al 2014a then the contributions are only 5 9 and 6 66 the estimates are comparable to the findings for the central tibetan plateau lei et al 2013 li et al 2017a tong et al 2016 despite the conditions of each lake basin being different e g the ratio of glacier area to lake area and the ratio of basin area to lake area for example based on the same method as this study lei et al 2013 reported that the glacier mass loss for 1999 2010 accounted for about 11 7 28 7 and 11 4 of the lake water level rise for seling co lake nam co lake and pung co lake respectively updated results obtained by physical based models revealed that the glacier mass loss accounted for only about 10 of the water level rise in nam co lake for 1961 2015 li et al 2017a and 5 in seling co lake for 1979 2013 tong et al 2016 in addition for the whole endorheic basin of the qtp zhang et al 2017 revealed that the contribution of glacier mass loss to lake volume increase is only 13 from the 1970s to 2015 which is basically consistent with our estimates for the variation of the lakes in this study region meteorological data suggested that both the annual precipitation and annual mean air temperature exhibited an increasing trend for 1960 2010 e g at a rate of 0 79 c 10 a and 18 84 mm 10 a respectively jiang et al 2012 while the potential evaporation showed a decrease of 1 10 mm a for 1970 2011 yao et al 2013 the increased precipitation and decreased evaporation were considered to be the main causes of the lake water level rise yao et al 2013 nevertheless some recent studies have shown that the dominant driving forcing behind the lake growth is merely the increased precipitation tong et al 2016 yang et al 2017 lei et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 for instance in seling co lake the precipitation induced runoff accounts for 82 of the increase in the mean annual water input tong et al 2016 on the whole plateau scale the increased net precipitation increase accounts for 74 of lake storage increase while the contribution of the permafrost thaw recharge is only 12 zhang et al 2017 based on these we can speculate that the increased precipitation may be the decisive driving force of lake growth in this study region 7 conclusion in this study based on the geodetic method we calculated the region wide glacier mass balance for 2000 2015 16 in the central kunlun kekexili region including seven sample regions using spot 6 7 stereo imagery and the srtm dem the results reflect a heterogeneous pattern at the sub region spatial scale the most significant glacier mass loss at rates of 0 22 0 10 and 0 21 0 10 m w e a occurred in the malan and xinqingfeng mountains respectively moreover except for the yulanggangri ice cap with a near zero mass balance of 0 01 0 11 m w e a the other regions i e jinyanggangri ice cap and the wuxuefeng and central kunlun mountains experienced slight or moderate mass loss with a mass balance range of 0 04 0 09 m w e a to 0 16 0 10 m w e a the area weighted glacier mass balance is 0 16 0 05 m w e a for the whole region in addition we evaluated the water storage change of two glacier fed closed lakes for 2000 2015 based on the function relationship between water level change and area change the results showed that the water storage of lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake increased by 1 82 0 14 km3 and 1 90 0 38 km3 respectively meanwhile within the two lake basins the water lost from the glaciers was 0 18 0 03 km3 and 0 21 0 04 km3 indicating that the contributions of glacier mass loss to lake expansion were no more than 9 9 and 11 1 in lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively from a quantitative point of view this demonstrates that glacier meltwater is not the dominant influencing factor for the lake expansion in

6690,joint monitoring of the variations of glaciers and lakes within a basin is essential for an accurate understanding of region wide climate change and the water cycle process the central kunlun kekexili region is an ideal experimental field due to the wide distribution of glaciers and lakes in this study we first investigated the glacier mass balance of 2000 2015 16 for seven major glacier clusters by utilizing high resolution spot 6 7 stereo imagery and the srtm dem the final results revealed an overall mass balance of 0 16 0 05 m w e a for the study region with a total glacier area of 967 km2 secondly icesat glas altimetry data were used to quantify the water level change of 2003 2008 09 for the two largest glacier fed closed lakes i e lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake in this region based on this we applied a strategy which establishes the statistical relationship between the lake area change and the lake water level change for 2003 2008 09 to estimate the specific water level using the corresponding lake area we then further calculated the variation in lake water storage between 2000 and 2015 the results showed that the water storage of lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake increased by 1 82 0 14 km3 and 1 90 0 38 km3 respectively for each lake basin meanwhile the glaciers lost 0 18 0 03 km3 and 0 21 0 04 km3 of water accounting for 9 9 and 11 1 of the increase in lake water storage for lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively our results not only demonstrate that glacier meltwater has only a limited impact on the lake expansion in this region but they also provide new evidence for the warming and wetting process of the climate in the northern part of the qinghai tibet plateau keywords glacier mass balance lake volume change qinghai tibet plateau spot 6 7 imagery icesat gla14 data 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp which is also known as the third pole of the earth contains a large number of alpine glaciers and lakes both of which are sensitive indicators of climate change studies have shown that glaciers across the qtp and its surroundings have experienced apparent mass loss yao et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 since the 1970s while most of the lakes in the interior of the qtp have been expanding song et al 2013 lei et al 2013 2014 after the 2000s both the glaciers and lakes have shown an accelerated change tendency zhang et al 2011 song et al 2013 lei et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 kääb et al 2015 brun et al 2017 within the qtp the variation of the glaciers and lakes not only plays an important role in regulating the regional water balance especially for a closed lake basin but also brings several potential risks for the ecological environment of the plateau tong et al 2016 therefore conducting a joint investigation into the glacier mass change and lake water budget of the qtp is of great significance for monitoring glacier mass change field measurement also known as the glaciological method is not only laborious and time consuming but is also a very challenging task due to the harsh natural environment with the rapid development of remote sensing technology the geodetic method based on the differencing of various topography data acquired in different epochs has been widely used gardelle et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 brun et al 2017 li et al 2017b compared to a considerable number of glacier investigations in the qtp s surroundings e g the himalaya karakoram mountains the inner qtp glaciers have received relatively little attention especially in the northern region over the whole inner qtp geodetic based estimates suggest that the glaciers overall have been in a negative state of mass budget for 2000 2016 with an apparent acceleration after 2008 for example from a comparison of aster digital elevation models dems brun et al 2017 reported an overall mass change of 0 14 0 07 m w e a for 2000 2016 for which the rate of mass loss increased from 0 01 0 19 m w e a for 2000 2008 to 0 24 0 20 m w e a for 2008 2016 despite a substantial overlap of error bars moreover based on icesat laser altimetry data of 2003 2008 09 gardner et al 2013 and brun et al 2017 also reported a slightly negative mass balance of 0 01 0 10 m w e a and 0 06 0 06 m w e a respectively at a sub region spatial scale the existing studies have revealed a strongly heterogeneous pattern of glacier mass change within the qtp for example the glaciers in the northwest of the qtp experienced relatively weak surface thinning e g 0 07 0 14 m a over the ulugh muztagh region fig 1 for 1975 2000 zhou et al 2018 or even pronounced thickening e g 0 44 0 26 and 0 86 0 31 m a zengse kungri and songzhi peak for 2003 2009 neckel et al 2014 phan et al 2017 in contrast the central qtp e g tanggula mountains suffered from serious surface down wasting with a rate of elevation change increasing from 0 26 0 14 m a for 1976 2000 zhou et al 2018 to 0 68 0 29 or 0 88 0 41 m a for 2003 2009 neckel et al 2014 phan et al 2017 in particular in the north of the qtp i e the central kunlun kekexili region the existing results of the glacier elevation change exhibited a contradictory situation e g 0 90 0 28 m a in neckel et al 2014 versus 0 03 0 47 m a in phan et al 2017 for 2003 2009 however despite being a 1 1 geographic grid brun et al s 2017 results implied that this region may have been in a state of mass deficit for 2000 2016 accordingly how the glaciers of this region respond to climate variation at a fine spatial scale is still an issue that deserves to be solved especially considering the spatial distribution of the glaciers being relatively dispersed in addition by exploying icesat ice cloud and land elevation satellite data previous studies have shown that the vast majority of lakes in the northern part of the qtp have experienced varying degrees of water level rise with the rate ranging from 0 04 m a to 0 53 m a for 2003 2009 zhang et al 2011 phan et al 2012 song et al 2014b recent studies analyzing icesat data and cryosat 2 radar altimetry data revealed that for the period of 2003 2014 2015 the lakes of the northern qtp as a whole experienced the most significant water level rise compared to other regions within the plateau song et al 2015a 2015b jiang et al 2017 for example for kekexili lake and lexiewudan lake the two largest glacier fed closed lakes the rates of water level rise increased from 0 29 m a and 0 34 m a for 2003 2009 song et al 2014b to 0 40 m a and 0 45 m a for 2010 2015 jiang et al 2017 respectively however for the period corresponding to the glacier monitoring of this study i e 2000 2015 the lake volume change which is the most direct reflection of regional surface water storage is still unknown although zhang et al 2017 estimated the lake volume change across the whole qtp from the early 1970s to 2015 to estimate lake volume change specific lake water levels at the beginning and end of the observation period must be known in particular for a study period in which lake water levels are unavailable e g 2000 2015 in general the previous studies first established a functional relationship between lake area and water level for a certain period with continuous water level measurements e g 2003 2009 by using a first order linear or second order regression model and then calculated the unmeasured lake water levels based on the corresponding lake areas song et al 2013 2014a zhang et al 2013a nevertheless in this study we directly build on the statistical relationship between lake level change and area change to estimate the unmeasured water level and further calculate the lake volume change once the lake storage change is known we can quantitatively evaluate the contribution of glacier meltwater to lake expansion in a closed lake basin based on an assumption that the glacier mass loss is completely transferred to the lakes lei et al 2012 2013 with regard to the causes of lake expansion especially the contribution of glacier meltwater song et al 2014b and zhang et al 2017 from the angle of qualitative analysis and quantitative evaluation respectively concluded that for the whole of the qtp glacier meltwater plays an important but not a dominant role in lake growth in addition for local areas quantitative evaluations based on either integrated physical models e g hydrological models glacier melt models and heat balance equations or an indirect estimate of glacier meltwater based on the hypothesis mentioned above have mainly concentrated on the central qtp due to the abundant in situ observation data e g in seling co lake lei et al 2013 tong et al 2016 and nam co lake wu et al 2014a b li et al 2017a however to date the contribution of glacier meltwater to lake water level rise is still unclear in the north of the qtp in view of the above issues the aims of this study included two main aspects firstly by using spot 6 7 stereo imagery acquired in 2015 16 and shuttle radar topography mission srtm dems from 2000 we generated the first high resolution map of glacier elevation change in the central kunlun kekexili region including seven sampling regions and obtained a region wide glacier mass change figure based on the geodetic method secondly we estimated the water storage change of two typical glacier fed closed lakes i e lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake between 2000 and 2015 using the strategy mentioned above we then roughly quantified the contribution of glacier meltwater to the lake expansion based on the assumption mentioned above the results of this work will help to improve the understanding of the responses of glaciers and lakes to climate change and the relationship between them in the northern part of the qtp 2 study region the central kunlun kekexili region is located in the north of the qtp with an average altitude of above 5000 m owing to the harsh natural environment characterized by a cold and dry climate this area is sometimes referred to as no man s land on this plateau the mean annual air temperature is on average about 10 c and the annual precipitation is 173 494 mm li et al 1996 more than 90 of the precipitation occurs from may to september implying that the glaciers in this region belong to the summer accumulation type in addition affected by the intense westerly winds this area is one of the regions with the highest wind speed in the entire qtp li et al 1996 furthermore throughout the whole region the terrain is relatively flat and there are some scattered mountains among which the highest peak is xinqingfeng mountain with an altitude of about 6800 m fig 1 in these high altitudes the glaciers and ice caps are fully developed and together cover a total area of 1810 km2 in the northern part of the qtp from optical images it appears that the glacier surface are relatively clean and that debris is almost non existent in addition there are a large number of alpine lakes of all shapes and sizes in this region of these lakes kekexili lake and lexiewudan lake which both cover an area of more than 200 km2 are the largest glacier fed endorheic lakes in particular over the lexiewudan basin the minimum distance from glacier front to lake inlet is only about 20 km this is thus an ideal experimental region for evaluating the response of lakes to glacier changes in the kekexili basin the water from yinma lake seasonally overflows into kekexili lake in addition these three lakes despite being located in adjacent areas have different phenological features possibly due to the differences in hydrochemical characteristics bathymetry and lake shape yao et al 2013 3 dataset 3 1 spot 6 7 imagery as an extension of the spot mission two advanced satellites spot 6 and spot 7 pushbroom imaging systems were successfully launched on september 9 2012 and june 7 2014 both satellites were designed with the same orbit setting sun synchronous orbit with a 98 2 inclination at an altitude of 694 km and phased 180 from each other allowing the satellites to revisit anywhere with a minimum period of one day the panchromatic and multispectral images are acquired simultaneously with a ground sample distance gsd of about 2 1 m and 8 4 m nadir condition corresponding to a nominal resolution of 1 5 m and 6 m by oversampling processing in the ground segment spot 6 7 user guide the radiometric coding of the images is 12 bits which is higher than that in the previous spot series satellites benefiting from the exceptional agility of the telescope instrument the two satellites can offer a flexible base to height b h ratio to generate stereo or tri stereo data over the qtp they have been successfully used to estimate glacier elevation changes ragettli et al 2016 kääb et al 2018 in this study we selected the classic stereo mode forward and backward viewing geometry with a b h ratio between 0 39 and 0 56 table 1 all of these images have had radiometric and sensor distortion corrections performed 3 2 landsat 5 7 8 imagery we collected a total of 18 landsat images five scenes for landsat 5 11 scenes for landsat 7 and two scenes for landsat 8 to retrieve the time series lake boundaries and to provide a reference for the glacier outlines in 2000 because of the scan line corrector slc failure of the landsat 7 satellite on may 30 2003 the landsat 7 images have contained wedge shaped data gaps since that date causing approximately 22 data loss for each scene all of the images we used belonged to the highest quality level 1 precision terrain l1tp data due to that the geo registration accuracy of the data is better than 12 m they can be directly used to perform a pixel level time series analysis https landsat usgs gov landsat collections moreover regarding the issue of data selection a vital and universal criterion is that the fraction of cloud coverage in the optical images should be as small as possible especially over the glaciers and lakes as well as their nearby zones more concretely for glacier areas we should avoid utilizing images affected by heavy seasonal snowfall which can make it difficult to distinguish exact glacier outlines for lake areas in order to obtain more accurate boundaries we chose images acquired in the non freezing period with regard to the few images inevitably contaminated by cloud we employed the images close to their acquisition dates to assist with the complete delineation of lake glacier boundaries details are given in table 1 3 3 srtm dem in this study we used the srtm 1 arc second 30 m global elevation data srtm gl1 from the u s geological survey to investigate the glacier elevation change compared to the raw data products the voids of this dataset have been filled but may still exist in some areas by checking the srtm non void filled elevation data we found that this study region is not affected by data gaps moreover the srtm x band dems released by the dlr with a spatial resolution of 25 m ludwig and schneider 2006 were used to estimate the first order approximation of the penetration depth of the c band radar for technical reasons the swath width of the srtm x band dem is limited to 50 km resulting in incomplete data coverage for the land surface roth et al 2001 for example in the yulanggangri ice cap and the xinqingfeng and malan mountains the x band dem data are unavailable it should be noted that the srtm c band dem provides the orthometric height with the egm96 geoid as the vertical datum while the x band data represent the ellipsoid height with respect to wgs84 for the horizontal datum they are both referenced to the wgs84 ellipsoid farr et al 2007 3 4 icesat glas elevation data the icesat satellite launched in january 2003 is the first spaceborne laser altimeter mission and its main payload is the geoscience laser altimeter system glas instrument with a pulse wavelength of 1064 nm zwally et al 2002 zhang et al 2011 icesat data are acquired in the form of a footprint or facula with a nominal diameter of 70 m in practice with a size of 50 105 m sampled at a spacing of about 172 m along the track zwally et al 2002 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 due to the design of the polar orbit the icesat sample track is relatively sparse at low and middle latitudes e g the qtp with a cross track distance ranging from hundreds of meters to dozens of kilometers in addition studies have proven that icesat glas elevation data have an excellent altimetry and geolocation accuracy corresponding to decimeter and meter levels respectively zwally et al 2002 2008 phan et al 2012 zhang et al 2013b hence icesat glas elevation data have been widely used for monitoring the fluctuation of inland lake water levels zhang et al 2011 2013b phan et al 2012 song et al 2013 in the present study we exploited the latest version l2 level altimeter product gla14 release 34 which can be freely downloaded from the national ice and snow data center nisdc the data are referenced to the topex poseidion ellipsoid and egm 2008 geoid 4 data processing 4 1 glacier change estimation 4 1 1 glacier boundaries in this study we did not generate our own glacier outlines but directly used the second chinese glacier inventory cgi 2 version 1 0 liu et al 2014 which was produced based on landsat tm etm images taken mainly during 2006 2010 guo et al 2015 the position accuracy of the cgi 2 boundaries is about 10 m for manually revised clean ice outlines guo et al 2015 over this study area the cgi 2 outlines represent the glacier extent in 2005 in consideration of possible glacier advance and retreat within our study period we manually edited the cgi 2 boundaries to obtain the most extensive glacier extent by reference to the landsat 5 tm images from 2000 and the orthorectified spot 6 7 images from 2015 16 furthermore based on the final glacier elevation change map we made a slight adjustment for the boundaries in the accumulation zones only for xinqingfeng and malan mountains 4 1 2 spot 6 7 dem generation we processed all of the spot 6 7 stereo images via the orthoengine module of pci geomatica 2014 due to that there are no in situ ground control points gcps in this study region we chose to automatically collect the gcps from the srtm c band dem to be specific the first step was to orthorectify the spot 6 7 panchromatic images with a resolution of 1 5 m by utilizing the srtm data the second step was to implement an automatic gcp collection program in the pci geomatica software with the orthorectified image and the srtm dem as the horizontal and vertical references respectively meanwhile in order to improve the accuracy of the stereo model between 30 and 48 tie points tps used for assisting the orientation were automatically identified based on the correlation matching technique table 2 we found that it was very necessary to visually check every gcp and tp we first removed some gcps measured in glacier areas and mountain ridges valleys with possibly inaccurate elevation information similarly some tps located in the vicinity of cloud and shadow were also discarded only for the ekl 1 and ekl 2 regions the final model residuals in the image space were below 0 52 pixels table 2 finally the extracted dems were resampled to the 30 m resolution in utm projection and a median filter was carried out with a sample window of 3 3 4 1 3 dem differencing with regard to the differencing process for the dems we mainly followed the strategy of zhou et al 2017 2018 specifically we first employed the classic three dimensional registration method proposed by nuth and kääb 2011 to make the srtm dems match the spot 6 7 dems subsequently we checked and corrected the maximum curvature elevation slope and aspect dependent biases by applying the fitted polynomial based on the statistics over ice free regions to the glacier areas in addition given the fact that for this pushbroom type sensor weak variations of the satellite attitude caused by slight jitter can induce bias along the direction of the flight and or cross track in the resulting dem products berthier et al 2007 leprince et al 2007 nuth and kääb 2011 by visually checking the final elevation difference maps we did not find along or cross track bias finally for pixels whose values are larger than the three fold standard deviation of glacier elevation change of the altitude band they belong to we removed them as outliers as for the ice free areas the detailed statistics are given in table 2 4 1 4 estimation of the penetration depth difference between the srtm c band and x band dems in general since c band radar can penetrate into glacier ice by up to 1 2 m and into dry snow by up to 10 m rignot et al 2001 in order to more accurately quantify the glacier thickness changes the impact of the penetration depth needs to be eliminated as much as possible especially for snow covered areas in this study following the method of gardelle et al 2013 we provided the first order approximate estimate of the c band penetration depth by subtracting the srtm c band dem from the x band dem details of the data processing can be found in zhou et al 2018 it should be emphasized that the penetration depth we obtained actually represents the penetration depth difference between c band and x band radar as the x band radar can also penetrate into dry snow by up to 2 6 m dehecq et al 2016 round et al 2017 lambrecht et al 2018 kääb et al 2018 based on the elevation difference map a penetration depth difference curve as a function of altitude was obtained and was then used to perform the correction for each pixel in the glacier areas for the jinyanggangri ice cap the srtm x band dem does not cover the whole study region resulting in no penetration depth corrections at high altitudes above 5700 m given that the obtained penetration depth difference basically showed a linear trend fig 2 we linearly extrapolated the curve to the unmeasured zones and obtained a region wide average penetration difference of 3 14 m which is slightly higher than the original result of 2 26 m in addition for regions where the srtm x band dems are unavailable such as the xinqingfeng malan and yulanggangri regions we did not follow the frequently used strategy of employing the average penetration corrections in the nearby regions gardelle et al 2013 but instead adopted the penetration trend of the adjacent areas and further made a reasonable adjustment referring to linear extrapolation in accordance to the corresponding glacier hypsometry our strategy should be more reasonable as it takes into account the difference in glacier hypsometry for different regions to be specific the penetration trend in wuxuefeng mountain was used to estimate the corrections for xinqingfeng and malan mountains for the yulanggangri ice cap the result for the jingyanggangri ice cap was employed the final average penetration depth differences were 3 43 m for qinqingfeng mountain 3 26 m for malan mountain and 2 55 m for the yulanggangri ice cap table 3 4 1 5 calculation of geodetic mass balance and uncertainty assessment to calculate the mass balance the first step was to obtain the glacier hypsometry and to generate a glacier thickness change curve as a function of altitude for each sub region for the data gaps in the elevation difference map they were filled by the average elevation change calculated by valid pixels in the same altitude band the region wide volume change could then be obtained by an integral operation of the thickness change and the area for each altitude interval ultimately a conversion factor of 850 60 kg m3 was used to translate the volume change into mass change gardelle et al 2013 huss 2013 in particular given that the pattern and magnitude of elevation change of the surge type glaciers were totally different from those of the non surge type glaciers their mass balances b were separately calculated using eq 1 and added to the final region wide results based on an area weighting strategy 1 b f c r 2 δ h s where r is the spatial resolution of the elevation difference map 30 m and δ h and s respectively represent the thickness change of each pixel and the glacier area for a given glacier f c denotes the conversion coefficient 0 85 0 06 to evaluate the total uncertainty of the mass balance the random error and systematic error need to be considered comprehensively for the random error we first took into account the uncertainty of the glacier thickness change which mainly depended on the errors of the dems and the penetration depth difference estimation in fact the latter also depends on the dem error as it was determined by the differencing of the dems given the fact that high altitudes in this study area are almost completely covered by ice and snow we used the standard deviation of the elevation difference of the entire ice free area to represent the uncertainties of the glacier elevation change and penetration difference estimation for each altitude band furthermore in order to consider the influence of spatial autocorrelation between dems we fitted an experimental semivariogram using a spherical model in ice free regions the obtained autocorrelation distance ranges from 80 m to 240 m for the penetration depth difference maps and from 150 m and 330 m for the glacier elevation difference maps considering that glacier areas generally have a higher autocorrelation than stable regions rolstad et al 2009 we conservatively assumed that the autocorrelation distance in glacier areas was four times that in ice free regions the uncertainty of the glacier thickness change σ δ h for each altitude band i was then calculated by eqs 2 4 2 σ δ h i σ g n e f f g i 2 σ p n e f f p i 2 3 n e f f g i 1 n e f f g i 1 n t r 2 π 4 d g 2 n e f f g i 1 4 n e f f p i 1 n e f f p i 1 n t r 2 π 4 d p 2 n e f f p i 1 where σ denotes the standard deviation of the elevation difference in the ice free regions and the subscripts p and g represent the glacier elevation difference map and the penetration depth difference map respectively n e f f g i and n e f f p i denote the number of independent observations for each elevation band n t is the total number of observations for a given altitude interval d g and d p denote the autocorrelation distance for non glacier areas the uncertainties of the volume change σ δ v and the mass balance σ δ m r d n were then respectively calculated by eqs 5 7 based on the strategy of zhou et al 2018 5 σ δ v i 1 n σ δ h i s i 2 where s i is the glacier area for each altitude band 6 σ δ m 0 δ v σ δ f s t 2 σ δ v δ f s t 2 δ v δ f δ s s t 2 2 where σ δ f is the uncertainty of the conversion factor 60 kg m3 δ s is the uncertainty of the glacier boundaries which was assumed to be an error of 10 in this study maurer et al 2016 s t is the total glacier area for each investigated region σ δ m 0 refers to the initial mass balance uncertainty 7 σ δ m r d n σ δ m 0 2 σ a b s p 2 1 1 p v o i d where σ a b s p represents the uncertainty caused by the absolute penetration depth of the c band radar i e considering the uncertainty induced by the penetration depth of the x band radar in this study we conservatively assumed that this was in the order of 1 5 m corresponding to a mass change of 1 28 m w e gardelle et al 2013 p void denotes the proportion of data voids for each region fig 4 the aim of introducing this term was to consider the uncertainty caused by the data gaps more details concerning the accuracy evaluation can be found in zhou et al 2018 in addition it should be highlighted that we did not take the influence of seasonal snowfall into account this study as the images we used were acquired mainly from september to march where the precipitation can be considered negligible furthermore for the systematic error we used the absolute mean of the elevation differences in ice free area to approximately represent it the corresponding mass balance uncertainties σ δ m s y s are between 0 00 and 0 20 m w e table 2 finally the total uncertainty of the mass balance σ δ m can be obtained by eq 8 8 σ δ m σ δ m r d n 2 σ δ m s y s 2 4 2 lake change estimation 4 2 1 lake boundary extraction we first filled the data gaps in the landsat 7 etm images using a simple toolbox landsat gapfill in envi software a band ratio method band 4 band 5 for landsat 5 7 tm etm images band 5 band 6 for landsat 8 oli images with an empirical threshold of 2 0 was then applied to automatically identify the lake outlines li et al 2017a the initial lake boundaries were then refined by visually comparing the landsat false color images rgb bands 5 4 3 for some images more or less contaminated by cloud we made a further revision in local zones of the lake boundaries by reference to the multi temporal landsat images moreover since lexiewudan lake merges with several nearby small lakes during its expansion in the course of editing the lake boundaries we excluded these lakes when they were completely separated but included them when they merged into one lake fig s1 4 2 2 icesat glas data processing lake water volume change estimation and uncertainty assessment in order to ensure the consistency of the reference datum we first transformed the topex poseidon ellipsoid and egm2008 geoid into the wgs84 ellipsoid and egm96 geoid respectively we then took the saturation correction of the glas detector into consideration as specular reflection occurring on a flat lake surface easily induces distortion of the altimetry echo pulses in this study the average saturation correction was about 0 40 m with a maximum of 1 38 m for some footprints whose saturation correction values were characterized by 999 suggesting that these points need to be corrected but do not have valid correction values they were excluded to avoid introducing potential bias abdallah et al 2011 the performance of the saturation correction is shown in fig s2 subsequently we employed a two step procedure to check and remove outliers zhang et al 2011 the first step was to remove the gross error possibly induced by the cloud coverage based on a visual inspection however in this study we did not find this type of error next in consideration of the vertical accuracy of the icesat glas altimetry data we set a threshold of standard deviation of 15 cm to remove some footprints causing a large deviation fig s2 after performing the above corrections the icesat footprints were used to analyze the lake water level change for 2003 2008 09 to obtain the lake volume change within the study period the lake water levels for 2000 and 2015 were needed given that a rise of lake water level is generally expressed by the expansion of the lake area there may be a certain relationship between the lake water level change and the lake area change let us imagine that a lake can be approximately represented by a bowl when the water level rises by δ h from a vertical section a functional relationship δ h δ x tan θ can be easily established where θ denotes the slope and δ x represents the horizontal displacement of the boundary caused by the surface expansion however in practice since the lake shape and the horizontal displacement of the boundary are not regular and highly variable fig s1 the lake area change can be expressed by a generalized function δ s f δ x based on this the relationship between the lake water level change and the area change can be established by δ h f 1 δ s tan θ in addition as the change could be positive increase or negative decrease the functional model can be further extended as δ h f 1 δ s tan θ thus we can use regression analysis to establish the relationship between the area change and the water level change in an absolute sense assuming that the mean slope of the terrain around the lakes is a constant varying with the lakes it should be noted that in this study we only retrieved the lake boundaries for the times with significant water level fluctuations i e in late spring early summer and autumn and performed the differencing operation in pairs of two arbitrary measurements to build the statistical relationship between the lake level change δ h and area change δ s according to the established statistical model we could extrapolate the lake water level using the lake areas for 2000 and 2015 and further estimate the lake water volume change δ v lake using eq 9 lei et al 2013 tong et al 2016 9 δ v lake 1 3 h 2 h 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 where h and a denote the lake water level and lake area respectively the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the beginning and the end observation times to evaluate the accuracy of the lake volume change we used the prediction interval of the regression model to approximately represent the uncertainty of the extrapolated water level σ h with regard to the uncertainty of the lake area σ s it was calculated by the product of the lake perimeter and the image resolution 15 m based on an assumption of one pixel error for the lake boundary finally according to error propagation law the uncertainty of the lake volume change σ δ v lake was obtained by eq 10 supposing that the error of each term in eq 9 follows a gaussian distribution 10 σ δ v lake 1 9 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 2 σ h 2 2 σ h 1 2 1 36 h 2 h 1 2 a 2 a 1 1 2 σ s 1 2 a 1 a 2 1 2 σ s 2 2 5 results 5 1 glacier thickness change and mass balance from fig 3 it can be seen that almost all of the glaciers among the investigated areas experienced different degrees of surface thinning near their toes except for the surging glaciers based on the median elevation of each glacier from the randolph glacier inventory rgi version 6 0 rgi consortium 2017 we approximately estimated the position of the region wide glacier equilibrium line by using the mean of them and further divided glaciers areas into two parts the ablation zones and the accumulation zones fig 4 to be specific for the ablation zones the highest rate of surface down wasting of 0 51 0 05 m a appeared in the xinqinfeng region followed by the malan and wuxuefeng regions with a value of 0 47 0 06 m a and 0 43 0 10 m a respectively the other regions also exhibited pronounced surface lowering ranging from 0 26 0 06 m a to 0 18 0 06 m a for the accumulation zones the malan and wuxuefeng regions showed slight thinning at a rate of 0 05 0 08 m a and 0 06 0 06 m a respectively while the ckl 2 exhibited a nearly stable condition 0 00 0 20 m a the rest of areas showed different degrees of thickening ranging from 0 06 0 28 m a to 0 24 0 07 m a synthesizing all the glacier changes over all the sample sites with a total glacier area of 966 7 km2 shows an area weighted mass balance of 0 16 0 05 m w e a for 2000 2015 which is equivalent to a mass loss of 0 16 0 05 gt a across the entire region the pattern of glacier mass change is heterogeneous the highest rate of mass loss occurred in the malan and xinqinfeng mountains with mass budgets of 0 22 0 10 and 0 21 0 10 m w e a followed by the wuxuefeng region with 0 16 0 10 m w e a the jinyanggangri ckl 1 and ckl 2 regions have been in a state of slightly negative budget corresponding to mass changes of 0 04 0 09 0 08 0 21 and 0 09 0 16 m w e a respectively in particular an approximately balanced condition 0 01 0 11 m w e a can be found in the yulanggangri ice cap 5 2 lake water level changes 2003 2008 09 and 2000 2015 from fig 5 the left pictures the rates of lake water level rise for 2003 2008 09 are 0 36 m a and 0 31 m a for lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively this is in agreement with previous results for the same period about 0 34 m a and 0 29 m a phan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 song et al 2014b interestingly the water level exhibited a stable and continuous increase each year in lexiewudan lake but showed a significant increase every two years in kekexili lake moreover in accordance with the selected icesat data and the corresponding lake areas table s1 the statistical model and lake water level changes for 2000 2015 are shown in fig 5 the middle and right pictures in the whole study period the water level of lexiewudan lake basically exhibited a monotonous increase with a mean increase rate of 0 49 m a corresponding to an overall rise of 7 40 m for which the rates of the two sub periods 2000 2007 and 2007 2015 were 0 50 m a 3 52 m and 0 49 m a 3 88 m respectively in contrast kekexili lake reflected a mean rate of water level rise of 0 38 m a 5 76 m for 2000 2015 comparing the results of the two sub periods indicates that the rate of water level rise increased by 100 from 0 26 m a 1 8 m for 2000 2007 to 0 50 m a 3 96 m for 2007 2015 furthermore in order to better validate the performance of our model we compare our results with those obtained by jiang et al 2017 using cryosat 2 data it is evident that the cryosat 2 results are consistent with our estimated trend in kekexili lake but are slightly higher than that in lexiewudan lake fig 5 this may be caused by the systematic bias between the two datasets song et al 2015b crétaux et al 2016 5 3 lake volume change and the contribution of glacier meltwater to lake expansion for 2000 2015 the estimated lake water volume changes are 1 82 0 14 km3 and 1 90 0 38 km3 in lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively summing up the volume changes of each individual glacier within the respective lake basins gives a volume change of 0 18 0 03 km3 and 0 21 0 04 km3 figs s3 and s4 under the simple hypothesis that all of the lost water in the glacier systems flows into the lakes without consideration of evaporation sublimation or the wastage in the course of transport the glacier mass loss respectively accounts for 9 9 and 11 1 of the lake growth in lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake in particular an additional assumption that yinma lake has been in balance during 2000 2015 is needed for the kekexili basin given the fact that the lake extent is unchanged 6 discussion 6 1 the impact of penetration depth on glacier mass change since the penetration depth of the x band radar was not considered the penetration depth of the c band radar we obtained is likely underestimated prior studies have shown that for dry snow the penetration depth of x band radar can reach 2 6 m in antarctica groh et al 2014 seehaus et al 2015 zhao and floricioiu 2017 and 4 6 m in the alps berthier et al 2016 dehecq et al 2016 especially in the qtp and its surroundings the x band average penetration depth in the accumulation zone is about 2 m or less in the karakoram mountain round et al 2017 3 m in the western tibet kääb et al 2018 and 3 4 m in the central pamir lambrecht et al 2018 these imply that the uncorrected x band penetration depth may introduce significant bias into the final mass balance estimation if there is a large amount of dry snow however the precipitation in this region is sparse especially in winter the season of srtm acquisition xie et al 2000 reported that the amount of annual precipitation in the form of snowfall is only about 400 500 mm in the altitude of the glacier equilibrium line in the malan region we can thus intuitively speculate that the thickness and extent of the dry snow may be limited in this area in addition in order to better elaborate this issue we generated a complimentary result by considering the penetration depth of the x band radar assuming an average of 1 5 m for the entire glacier area gardelle et al 2013 the updated results are more negative by 0 08 m w e a than our results but the two results agree within the error bounds fig 6 furthermore under the hypothesis of the average penetration depth of x band radar being 4 m the setting of this study 1 5 m actually means that the coverage ratio of dry snow reaches about 40 in this region intuitively this ratio may be rational or even overestimated this is because with the increase of altitude the accumulation zones consist of superimposed ice zones wet snow zones percolation zones and dry snow zones in sequence xie and liu 2010 a 40 ratio of dry snow with an average thickness of 4 m seems to be high given the currently known climate conditions from another point of view the maximum penetration depth obtained by the extrapolation in this study is about 9 m in the xinqingfeng region which is very close to the 10 m maximum penetration of c band radar for dry snow rignot et al 2001 this might imply that the penetration depth estimation in this study is close to the real penetration depth thus we believe that the impact of the x band penetration depth is not enough to subvert the current results 6 2 comparison with previous mass balance studies with regard to the glacier mass balance our result of 0 16 0 05 m w e a in the whole study region for 2000 2015 is comparable to the icesat based estimate of phan et al 2017 0 03 0 47 m a for 2003 2009 when considering the error bars but clearly disagrees with that of neckel et al 2014 0 77 0 35 m w e a for 2003 2009 despite the fact that our study period is twice as long furthermore for the same or similar study period a detailed comparison of our results with those of brun et al 2017 2000 2016 shows that the differences of the mass balance are between 0 03 and 0 03 m w e a for individual sampling regions and only 0 01 m w e a for the whole regions table 4 this indicates that the two results are compatible given the error bounds in addition due to that brun et al s 2017 results are not affected by the radar penetration depths the comparison also confirms our speculation with respect to the limited impact of the x band penetration depth in this study in addition through a comparison of the pattern of the glacier elevation change between brun et al 2017 and this study we can speculate that this study region likely lies in a transition zone from negative to near zero or positive mass balance for the whole of the kunlun mountains this is because the glaciers from the yulanggangri ice cap toward the west along the kunlun mountains have shown a positive mass balance see fig 2a in brun et al 2017 this can also be confirmed by the findings of neckel et al 2014 and phan et al 2017 6 3 comparison of different regression models for lake water level extrapolation to further validate the effectiveness and reliability of our models used to extrapolate water level we re estimated the water level in 2000 and 2015 by utilizing the first order and second order polynomial fit of the lake area versus the lake water level respectively meanwhile with the cryosat 2 observation in 2014 as the reference we made a comparison for all results in table 5 we can see that if only from the angle of the model selection the second order polynomial model for the two lakes seems to be preferable as its coefficient of determination r2 is larger than others nevertheless the final results show that for 2015 the estimated water levels based on the second order model are 3 46 m lexiewudan lake and 8 35 m kekexili lake higher than the reference value respectively clearly such significant water level change within one year is impossible and the estimates are totally erroneous this can be confirmed by comparing optical images which shows only a weak expansion in these two lakes for 2014 2015 in contrast the results calculated by the two linear models overall are comparable to the reference water level for example in lexiewudan lake the differences between the extrapolated water level and the reference data are 0 13 m and 0 15 m respectively which are lower than the average rate of 0 50 m a for 2003 2014 this may be caused by the systematic bias between the icesat and cryosat 2 datasets fig 5 meanwhile the difference of 0 02 m between the estimated results suggests that the performance of the two linear model is similar in this lake however it should be highlighted that the extrapolation accuracy of our linear model is higher with a relatively low uncertainty e g 0 45 m versus 0 73 m table 5 this is because in the same conditions the increase in the number of independent observations can enhance the robustness and reliability of the model prediction similarly for kekexili lake the differences of the estimated results versus reference water level are 1 22 m and 0 68 m respectively given the latter is very close to the rate of water level rise of 0 50 m a for 2007 2014 our result is more reasonable and reliable meanwhile this also indicates that our model is optimal at least in this lake as another linear model using the lake area and the water level as parameters generates an overestimated result in addition with regard to the lake water level estimation in 2000 considering the performance of our models discussed above we believe that our results are more accurate in spite of the lack of reference data in conclusion the models of lake water level extrapolation we used are effective and the results can be considered as reliable and acceptable 6 4 analysis of the contribution of glacier meltwater and the potential driving forces of lake changes in this study with regard to the contribution of glacier meltwater to lake expansion since we did not consider the mass loss caused by the evaporation and sublimation process in the glacier systems and the transfer wastage i e evaporation percolation loss in the process of runoff flow our results represent a maximum contribution or an upper bound this means that in the lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake basins the contributions from glacier mass loss were no more than 9 9 and 11 1 between 2000 and 2015 respectively revealing a limited impact on lake water storage change if we assume a glacier runoff coefficient of 0 6 wu et al 2014a then the contributions are only 5 9 and 6 66 the estimates are comparable to the findings for the central tibetan plateau lei et al 2013 li et al 2017a tong et al 2016 despite the conditions of each lake basin being different e g the ratio of glacier area to lake area and the ratio of basin area to lake area for example based on the same method as this study lei et al 2013 reported that the glacier mass loss for 1999 2010 accounted for about 11 7 28 7 and 11 4 of the lake water level rise for seling co lake nam co lake and pung co lake respectively updated results obtained by physical based models revealed that the glacier mass loss accounted for only about 10 of the water level rise in nam co lake for 1961 2015 li et al 2017a and 5 in seling co lake for 1979 2013 tong et al 2016 in addition for the whole endorheic basin of the qtp zhang et al 2017 revealed that the contribution of glacier mass loss to lake volume increase is only 13 from the 1970s to 2015 which is basically consistent with our estimates for the variation of the lakes in this study region meteorological data suggested that both the annual precipitation and annual mean air temperature exhibited an increasing trend for 1960 2010 e g at a rate of 0 79 c 10 a and 18 84 mm 10 a respectively jiang et al 2012 while the potential evaporation showed a decrease of 1 10 mm a for 1970 2011 yao et al 2013 the increased precipitation and decreased evaporation were considered to be the main causes of the lake water level rise yao et al 2013 nevertheless some recent studies have shown that the dominant driving forcing behind the lake growth is merely the increased precipitation tong et al 2016 yang et al 2017 lei et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 for instance in seling co lake the precipitation induced runoff accounts for 82 of the increase in the mean annual water input tong et al 2016 on the whole plateau scale the increased net precipitation increase accounts for 74 of lake storage increase while the contribution of the permafrost thaw recharge is only 12 zhang et al 2017 based on these we can speculate that the increased precipitation may be the decisive driving force of lake growth in this study region 7 conclusion in this study based on the geodetic method we calculated the region wide glacier mass balance for 2000 2015 16 in the central kunlun kekexili region including seven sample regions using spot 6 7 stereo imagery and the srtm dem the results reflect a heterogeneous pattern at the sub region spatial scale the most significant glacier mass loss at rates of 0 22 0 10 and 0 21 0 10 m w e a occurred in the malan and xinqingfeng mountains respectively moreover except for the yulanggangri ice cap with a near zero mass balance of 0 01 0 11 m w e a the other regions i e jinyanggangri ice cap and the wuxuefeng and central kunlun mountains experienced slight or moderate mass loss with a mass balance range of 0 04 0 09 m w e a to 0 16 0 10 m w e a the area weighted glacier mass balance is 0 16 0 05 m w e a for the whole region in addition we evaluated the water storage change of two glacier fed closed lakes for 2000 2015 based on the function relationship between water level change and area change the results showed that the water storage of lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake increased by 1 82 0 14 km3 and 1 90 0 38 km3 respectively meanwhile within the two lake basins the water lost from the glaciers was 0 18 0 03 km3 and 0 21 0 04 km3 indicating that the contributions of glacier mass loss to lake expansion were no more than 9 9 and 11 1 in lexiewudan lake and kekexili lake respectively from a quantitative point of view this demonstrates that glacier meltwater is not the dominant influencing factor for the lake expansion in

6691,the forecasted runoff is an important input data for the daily operation of hydropower station and the forecast accuracy directly affects its operation efficiency however the forecasting error is inevitable and it is influenced by the input the structural parameters and many human factors it is not only random but also has great fuzziness therefore it is very important to study the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error and reveal its fuzzy distribution law to guide the actual operation of hydropower station in view of this this paper has carried out research work in the following two aspects at the theoretical level in order to make the establishment of fuzzy set more objective and scientific based on different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion which can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice at the practical level in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error a quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is proposed based on the hamming closeness cauchy distribution normal distribution and cusp γ distribution taking the jinxi hydropower station of yalong river basin as the research object the fuzzy membership functions of the fuzzy sets of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals are calculated and optimized by the proposed method the results show that the optimized cusp γ distribution can fit the actual data points better compared with cauchy distribution and normal distribution and its average closeness can reach 0 979 so the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals is well realized which provides a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation keywords runoff forecasting error fuzziness membership function fuzzy closeness 1 introduction in recent years with the continuous development of forecasting models and computer technology various models applied to hydrological forecasting have been gradually developed and improved combined with the advantages of other related disciplines a comprehensive forecasting method has been formed in which the weather numerical forecasting model the land atmosphere coupling model and the hydrometeorological remote sensing correlation analysis are contained chen and singh 2018 li et al 2018 and it greatly improves the accuracy of hydrological forecasting so that the result can reflect the future runoff situation better and be more effectively used in the reservoir operation decision biao et al 2016 however due to the inevitability of forecasting error the decision making of reservoir operation will be ultimately affected by this error jiang et al 2018a li et al 2018 although there are many uncertainties in the whole process of reservoir operation the runoff forecasting error is the most important uncertain factor which leads to the operation risk so it has great significance to study the uncertainty law of the runoff forecasting error previous studies have done in depth discussions on the stochastic characteristics of runoff forecasting and its error chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2018b and have made many achievements for example hossain 2004 developed a remote sensing rainfall error model to characterize the error structure in rainfall and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework is implemented for quantification of hydrologic modeling uncertainty montanari and brath 2004 presented a technique for assessing the uncertainty of rainfall runoff simulations that makes use of a meta gaussian approach to estimate the probability distribution of the model error habib et al 2008 implemented an observation based empirical approach to analyze different characteristics of the total radar rainfall estimation error tachikawa et al 2010 modelled an error structure of real time rainfall prediction and simulated the predicted rainfall fields according to the characteristics of the prediction error structure associated with all other possible sources of error biondi and luca 2013 estimated the predictive uncertainty of future streamflow through the bayesian integration of two separate processors honti et al 2013 proposed a statistical error model that can account for the effect of various uncertainty sources present in conceptual rainfall runoff modeling studies zhou and guo 2014 implemented the variable kernel estimation for deriving the inflow forecasting error density and simulated the synthetic inflow incorporating forecasting error by monte carlo simulation liu et al 2015 analyzed the frequency distribution characteristics of flood forecasting error samples at different lead times and found that the absolute errors of the forecasts at various lead times follow normal distributions yazdi et al 2015 proposed a stochastic methodology to provide the uncertainty band of the rainfall runoff model and to calculate the probability of acceptable forecasts through the bayesian inference jiang et al 2017 derived the annual runoff distribution by integrating the multivariate joint probability density function and the derived distribution performs well in fitting distributions of the annual runoffs however as we known the hydrological forecasting model is affected by input uncertainty its own structure uncertainty parameter uncertainty and many other artificial uncertainties it is very complex and difficult to be described accurately cheng et al 2015 thus in a runoff forecasting the forecasting error is influenced by many objective and subjective factors huang et al 2014 and its size does not have a definite limit in quantity it not only has randomness but also has a lot of fuzziness that the forecasted value of runoff falls into a certain range hosseini and mahjouri 2018 as shown in fig 1 which is drawn by the actual data of the case in this paper therefore the single study of the randomness of hydrological forecasting error cannot fully express the uncertainty of error at present the researches on runoff forecasting error are mostly focused on their stochastic characteristics and are mainly studied by method of probability theory and statistics andrade et al 2001 zhu et al 2017 there are few studies on their fuzziness characteristics jacquin and shamseldin 2006 ren et al 2013 chavoshi et al 2013 in order to describe the forecasting error comprehensively we have to study the fuzzy uncertainties and distribution laws of runoff forecasting error through the fuzzy theory fuzziness is the uncertainty expressed in the state of matter and categories casper et al 2007 the method of fuzzy set analysis is a kind of mathematical method which used to describe the fuzziness of things and its relationship with certainty in fuzzy analysis fuzzy set and membership function are equivalent establishing the fuzzy sets mean to determine the membership functions of fuzzy sets the essence of fuzzy analysis is the algebraic computation process of numerical values between membership functions or between membership functions and real numbers wang 2011 therefore the establishment of appropriate membership function is very important for the effective application of fuzzy analysis theory to practical problems and the essence of studying the fuzzy distribution law and establishing the fuzzy set is to determine the membership function in fuzzy set theory membership grade is the cornerstone and the membership function is the key to describe fuzziness so the estimation of membership function is the critical step in the application of fuzzy set in general the membership function cannot be obtained directly and some experiments and investigations must be carried out to obtain them whether the membership function can effectively reflect objective facts will directly affect its application effect so the research of how to determine the membership function is of great significance in practice there is no absolutely right construction method for membership function and all the construction methods of membership function are influenced by people s subjective intention to some extent however processed through some scientific ways they can be used to construct the membership function and effectively reflect objective facts in dealing with practical fuzzy problems it is necessary to determine the appropriate method of constructing membership function according to the specific requirements of actual background and people s experience and many achievements in this field have been obtained by scholars jiang et al 2015 for example dash et al 1998 devised a learning algorithm for updating the connecting weights as well as the structure of the membership function of the network lacroix et al 1998 developed a procedure for the determination of fuzzy membership functions based on data acquired from experts and the overall procedure appears to be appropriate for rapidly finding the membership functions by combining the heuristics and evolutionary programming scheme yang and huang 1998 solved the problem of determining the best partition of fuzzy spaces and associated fuzzy membership functions focus on optimizing the fuzzy membership function and consequence parameter mori and itagaki 2004 proposed a fuzzy inference neural network based method for short term load forecasting in electric power systems according to the analytical structure of fuzzy controller and immune algorithm huang et al 2009 presented a new method about the design and optimization of membership function li et al 2018 designed a new hyper plane shaped clustering fuzzy membership function to identify the antecedent membership function parameters by adopting a novel t s fuzzy model identification method many research results show that due to the limitations of people in knowing things they usually can only obtain an approximate membership function when constructing the fuzzy membership function in the face of a large number of optional fuzzy functions most of them have difficulties in the selection and have some subjective disadvantages in addition it can be seen from the above description that there are many achievements in the study of fuzzy membership function of forecasting error especially in the research of power load forecasting yang et al 2004 wei et al 2005 but the research results on the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error are few and the study of fuzzy membership function optimization on runoff forecasting error is almost blank in view of this this paper firstly introduces the commonly used construction methods of membership function and based on the analysis of practicability advantages and disadvantages of various methods an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion the theoretical innovation of this optimization model is that it can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice so that the process of establishing the fuzzy set is more objective and scientific in addition at the practical level in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error a new method of constructing the membership function of runoff forecasting error based on the proposed overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed in case study this paper takes the jinxi hydropower station in the yalong river basin of china as the research object and combining the obtained runoff forecasting data and the measured data the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution laws of the runoff forecasting error under the different flow intervals are realized through the proposed method in fuzzy environment the research results of this paper can provide a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation and improve the ability of dispatchers to control the risk of reservoir operation and improve the utilization efficiency of water resources 2 methodologies 2 1 commonly used membership function nowadays there are many kinds of construction methods of membership function that have been put forward and applied including fuzzy distribution method faye et al 2003 fuzzy statistics method güler et al 2012 analytic hierarchy process method sener and sener 2015 expert subjective judgment method parent and bernier 2003 fuzzy collection algorithm young et al 2015 etc in this paper the fuzzy distribution method is used if the fuzzy set is defined on the real number domain r or a subset of r then the membership function of fuzzy set becomes the fuzzy distribution function the fuzzy distribution method is to apply some current fuzzy distributions based on the nature of the problem and determine the parameters contained in the distribution according to the measured data in practical problems the membership functions of many fuzzy sets can be obtained by slightly modifying the commonly used fuzzy distribution functions therefore the fuzzy distribution method is a common method in determining the fuzzy membership function three types of fuzzy distribution are contained in the fuzzy distribution method i e intermediate type fuzzy distribution positive skew fuzzy distribution and negative skew fuzzy distribution this paper mainly studies the fuzzy distribution of runoff forecasting error and according to the previous studies the error of runoff forecasting usually belongs to the intermediate type fuzzy distribution so several commonly used intermediate type fuzzy distributions are introduced here as shown below 2 1 1 cusp γ distribution 1 a x e k x a x a e k x a x a where a k is a constant respectively and k 0 from the cusp γ distribution represented by formula 1 it can be seen that it is made up of two exponential functions i e a x ek x a and a x e k x a which are symmetrical at x a the value of parameter a reflects the central position of cusp γ distribution with the increase of x the value of a x gradually increases when x a and the parameter k reflects the increasing speed of the a x at this time with the increase of x the value of a x gradually decreases when x a and the parameter k reflects the decreasing speed of the a x at this time the intersection point of the two exponential functions is at x a where the value of a x is 1 which is the maximum value of fuzzy membership that is the so called cusp point by adjusting the values of parameters k and a the cusp γ distribution can be used to fit many kinds of fuzzy variables with intermediate symmetry such as the runoff forecasting error 2 1 2 normal distribution 2 a x e k x a 2 where a k is a constant respectively parameter k can reflect the variance of data series to a certain extent that is the degree of data dispersion the parameter a represents the mean value of data series 2 1 3 cauchy distribution 3 a x 1 1 a x b c where a is a constant and a 0 c is a positive even number b is the location parameter that defines the peak position of the function distribution for other fuzzy distributions such as the rectangular distribution trapezoidal distribution etc the readers can refer to the literature by kacker and lawrence 2009 2 2 fuzzy distribution method based on the optimal closeness criteria closeness is a measure of the degree of proximity of two fuzzy sets in fuzzy mathematics the closer the two fuzzy sets are the better the closeness of the two fuzzy sets is the commonly used closeness criteria includes the hamming closeness bookstein et al 2001 euclidean closeness yuzugullu et al 2013 ayeldeen et al 2015 max min closeness kundu 1998 khan et al 2015 and lattice closeness li et al 2011 etc different form of closeness criteria has different advantages and disadvantages in practical application it should be chosen according to the specific conditions in general the hamming closeness is relatively simple and practical and it can be selected firstly fu et al 2007 the lattice closeness is more convenient in manual calculation and it is often used in fuzzy pattern recognition dai et al 2016 the expressions of the two closeness can be expressed as follows 2 2 1 hamming closeness 4 σ h a b 1 1 n i 1 n μ a x i μ b x i where μ a and μ b is respectively the fuzzy membership function of the fuzzy sets a and b σh is the hamming closeness of fuzzy sets a and b n is the number of discretized data points 2 2 2 lattice closeness 5 σ l a b a b 1 a b 2 where a b is called the inner product of a and b and a b is called the external product of a and b that is 6 a b x x μ a x i μ b x i a b x x μ a x i μ b x i nowadays fuzzy distribution method is the most commonly used method to construct the membership functions and some practical and measured data will be used in constructing the membership function liu et al 2016 by this method however if the studied object is a new thing and the experience is not rich there will be great subjectivity in choosing the suitable fuzzy distribution function and determining its parameters especially when the shape of the distribution functions is close such as the cusp γ distribution and normal distribution in addition the same type of fuzzy membership function should be used if the fuzzy distribution method is used to construct the fuzzy membership functions of multiple fuzzy sets on the same domain which also brings difficulties to the actual choice of fuzzy membership function in the process of constructing fuzzy membership function the measured data itself reflects a fuzzy set and the theoretical fuzzy distribution with the determined parameters is also a fuzzy set so the fuzzy distribution method is essentially to use a convenient theoretical fuzzy set to replace the fuzzy set reflected by the measured data the higher the closeness of the two fuzzy sets is the better the objective facts can be reflected in view of this an overall optimization framework of fuzzy distribution method is proposed in this paper by coupling the optimal closeness criterion different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method the basic principle of the optimal closeness criterion based fuzzy distribution method can be briefly described as follow firstly select several three or four potential fuzzy distribution functions according to the practical experience then for each fuzzy set on the same domain construct the membership function by each selected fuzzy distribution function with the measured data and determine the parameters of the membership function based on the optimal closeness criterion then each selected fuzzy distribution function can obtain a comprehensive closeness for all the fuzzy sets finally take the fuzzy distribution function with the best comprehensive closeness as the final membership function of the fuzzy sets the parameters of the determined membership function of each fuzzy set can also be obtained at the same time the merits of this method are that it can select a reasonable fuzzy distribution and determine the parameters of the fuzzy distribution by applying the optimal closeness criterion when constructing the membership function and it can effectively eliminate the adverse subjectivity that the fuzzy distribution method will produce if it is used alone besides it can not only make full use of the guiding role of practical experience but also effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice it has the characteristics of unbiasedness and objectivity the flowchart of the optimal closeness criterion based fuzzy distribution method is shown in fig 2 in fig 2 the a 1 a 2 am are the fuzzy sets or spaces whose optimal membership functions on the same domain need to be determined and in the actual calculation the measured data on each fuzzy set is used to replace them in order to find the optimal theoretical membership function distribution the b 1 x b 2 x bn x are the selected distribution functions based on the practical experience and measured data and they can be any of the aforementioned cusp γ distribution normal distribution cauchy distribution rectangular distribution or trapezoidal distribution etc on the same domain although the final membership function parameters can be inconsistent for different fuzzy sets the form of membership function should be the same this is why for any fuzzy distribution function bn x in fig 2 the proposed method needs to traverse the different fuzzy sets am m 1 2 m on the same domain so that to obtain a series of the closeness σ am bmn m 1 2 m based on this a comprehensive closeness σ a bn of bn x can be calculated on the fuzzy sets am m 1 2 m so for different bn n 1 2 n different σ a bn n 1 2 n on the fuzzy sets am m 1 2 m can be obtained one of them is the largest and the bn corresponding to the largest σ a b and its related function parameters are what we wanted 2 3 fuzzy membership function determination method for runoff forecasting error in order to express the runoff forecasting error comprehensively the fuzzy uncertainty of forecasting error should be considered in this paper the runoff forecasting error is regarded as a fuzzy variable and the runoff forecasting errors under different flow intervals are regarded as a fuzzy set and the optimal closeness criterion based fuzzy distribution method is used to construct the membership function of the fuzzy set of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals the membership function of fuzzy variable is essential similar to the meaning of probability density function of random variable that is to describe the degree of object belonging to a certain feature therefore the occurrence probability of the variable can be used to determine the membership value that is if the occurrence frequency of an event is high the corresponding membership value of this event is also large based on this for the analysis of the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error we firstly classify the flow into different intervals according to the measured data and use the error data to count the occurrence frequency of different forecasting errors in each flow interval and then determine the membership value of the fuzzy set of runoff forecasting error according to the frequency and let the membership value of the forecasting error with the highest probability in each flow interval equal to 1 and the final membership function of the fuzzy set of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals can be determined based on the optimal closeness criterion considering the general distribution of the measured data of runoff forecasting error the normal distribution cusp γ distribution and cauchy distribution are selected as the feasible fuzzy distribution functions and the simple and practical hamming closeness is selected as the evaluation criteria in determining the parameters of the distribution function the parameter a in the normal distribution and cusp γ distribution and the parameter b in the cauchy distribution correspond to the points with the maximum membership value in the measured data the parameter k in the normal distribution and cusp γ distribution and the parameters a and c in the cauchy distribution are determined by the optimization method based on the optimal closeness criterion the specific steps of determining the fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment are summarized as follows step1 classify the flow into different flow intervals according to the measured data and get the different flow frequency pm m 1 2 m and the corresponding average flow qm step2 for any frequency pm count the measured error data points of this flow frequency and divide the error interval into multiple zones with the same step length and count the number of errors occurring in each zone and let the membership value of the center point of the zone which has the largest number of error data points in all zones equal to 1 and the membership values of other zones can be determined by the ratio of the number of error data points to this zone as shown in fig 3 step3 determine the membership function of runoff forecasting error of this frequency by the normal distribution and the parameter a can be determined by the maximum membership value point and the parameter k can be obtained by the optimal closeness criterion based optimization algorithm and the closeness σm1 can be obtained at the same time step4 determine the membership function of runoff forecasting error of this frequency by the cusp γ distribution and the parameter a can be determined by the maximum membership value point and the parameter k can be obtained by the optimal closeness criterion based optimization algorithm and the closeness σm2 can be obtained at the same time step5 determine the membership function of runoff forecasting error of this frequency by the cauchy distribution and the parameter b can be determined by the maximum membership value point and the parameters a and c can be obtained by the optimal closeness criterion based optimization algorithm and the closeness σm3 can be obtained at the same time step6 by repeating step2 to step5 the membership functions the corresponding parameters and closeness σm1 σm2 σm3 of each frequency can be obtained where m 1 m 2 m 3 1 2 m and calculate the comprehensive closeness of each fuzzy distribution respectively i e σ1 σ2 σ3 step7 the final optimal membership function of runoff forecasting error under different flow frequency can be obtained according to the comprehensive closeness of the three predefined distribution function for the parameter optimization method mentioned in step3 step4 and step5 because the parameters to be optimized are few only one parameter k in cusp γ and normal distribution and two parameters a and c in the cauchy distribution the method of traversing search with fixed step is adopted in the parameter optimization this method only needs to determine the search range and step length jiang et al 2017 and the optimization effect is good when there are a few parameters and the random problem of random search algorithm can be avoided and the optimal solution can be found 3 case study 3 1 basic data yalong river is the first major tributary of jinsha river there are twenty two planed hydropower stations on the main stream at present the development of the hydropower resources of yalong river downstream is completed and five hydropower stations have been put into operation i e jinxi jindong guandi ertan and tonzhilin the jinxi hydropower station has an annual regulation performance and it is the dominant station of the downstream stream whose operation technology and level can directly determine the hydropower generation benefit of the whole downstream cascade reservoirs thus jinxi hydropower station is selected as the research object in this paper the location of this station is shown in fig 4 the normal water level of this station is 1880 m the dead water level is 1800 m the installed capacity is 3600 mw the guarantee output is 1086 mw and the annual average discharge at the dam site is 1220 m3 s the long series measured and forecasted hourly flow are available from the beginning operation of this hydropower station june 2013 to july 2017 which has a total of about 35 600 data points i e an average of 24 data points per day from june 2013 to july 2017 12 measured data and 12 corresponding forecasted data in each day the runoff is forecasted by the xin anjiang model bao 1986 chen and zhu 2005 in which the runoff is divided into surface runoff subsurface runoff and underground runoff in forecasting moreover in the forecasting process the arcgis software is used to extract the underlying surface information of the river basin and the channel water movement calculation is carried out by muskingum method barbetta et al 2011 the rainfall is calculated by the superposition of the watershed unit and the tyson polygon douinot et al 2017 since different flow levels generally have different error distributions before the fuzzy analysis of runoff forecasting error the incoming flow need to be divided into different levels based on the long series of measured and forecasted data through the measured runoff data it can be found that the maximum runoff of jinxi hydropower station is about 5500 m3 s and the minimum runoff is about 100 m3 s so the 0 5600 m3 s can be as the feasible range to implement grade division in addition according to the actual distribution of the data points of forecasting error it is found that the number of data points below 400 m3 s and above 4400 m3 s are very few so the interval where the flow below 400 m3 s and above 4400 m3 s is as an interval respectively for the rest the flow is divided by taking 200 m3 s as the discrete step and the total flow levels is 22 the result of runoff division is shown in table 1 it needs to be reminded that if the ranges below 400 m3 s and above 4400 m3 s are still divided by the step length of 200 m3 s the data points in each flow interval of these ranges will be less especially for the range above 4400 m3 s so that the error will be very large in calculating the closeness of the discrete points and the theoretical curve even the results are unbelievable besides this study does not focus on flood problems so there is no need to specially study the peak flow in the range above 4400 m3 s 3 2 results and discussion in this paper the fuzzy quantitative method of runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is used to study the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error in jinxi hydropower station and the proposed fuzzy distribution method based on the optimal closeness criterion is used to construct the membership function of the fuzzy set of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals the optimal closeness and the parameters of the membership function of each fuzzy set on the error interval 1 0 1 0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 4 and 0 2 0 2 are calculated respectively the statistical results of the average closeness of each distribution function and each error interval on all flow levels are shown in table 2 from the table 2 it can be seen that with the reduction of the range of the error interval the closeness value of the three methods gradually decrease and the error interval with the maximum closeness value is 1 1 and the error interval with the minimum closeness is 0 2 0 2 the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the abscissa value of the highest point of membership function of runoff forecasting error is close to 0 and the smaller the error interval in the calculation is the more the actual points will be close to the highest point of the membership function therefore if the error interval is small the membership values of the data points in this interval are relative large and the absolute difference between the theoretical value and the actual point is corresponding large according to the calculation formula of hamming closeness the comprehensive closeness will be smaller at this time therefore compared with the four different error intervals the membership function calculated on the error interval 1 0 1 0 is more reasonable it not only has the best comprehensive closeness but also covers almost all the measured error data points in seeking and optimizing the membership function which has better reliability and representativeness for the error interval 1 1 the optimal parameters of the three theoretical membership functions and their closeness to the actual data points under different flow intervals are shown in table 3 the traversing search method with fixed step is adopted in the parameter optimization and the optimal objective function is the maximum closeness from table 3 it can be seen that the corresponding parameters i e a and k vary greatly for different flow intervals especially for the parameter k this is mainly due to the difference of input data that is in the fuzzy analysis of the forecasting error in different flow intervals the forecasting error sequences used are different which makes the optimal parameters obtained by the optimization model are different for different flow intervals the variations of fuzzy closeness of the three fuzzy membership functions on all the flow intervals are shown in fig 5 in this fig 5 there are three curves which respectively corresponding to the variation of fuzzy closeness of cusp γ distribution solid black line cauchy distribution dotted line and normal distribution another dotted line from the fig 5 it can be seen that the overall closeness of cusp γ distribution is the best at the top position in the three methods the cauchy distribution is the second and the normal distribution is relatively poor at the lowest position so from the point of view of position the difference of the three curves is obvious besides the average closeness of cusp γ distribution is 0 976 that of cauchy distribution is 0 971 and that of normal distribution is 0 970 although the average closeness of the three distributions does not differ much the cusp γ distribution still has the highest overall closeness therefore the cusp γ distribution is the best in these three distributions either on the graph or on the statistical mean value of closeness thus the cusp γ distribution can be taken as the theoretical fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error the fitting situations of the cusp γ distribution in some flow intervals such as 800 q 1000 1000 q 1200 are shown in fig 6 from which it can be found that the fitting degree between the theoretical value and actual value is very good in addition through the comparison of the actual data points and the theoretical curves it is found that in most cases the fitting degree between the theoretical curves and actual values is very good however in a few cases such as the q 400 and 3400 q 3600 although their optimal closeness of cusp γ distribution can reach 0 958 and 0 964 respectively their fitting situations are not good their fitting graphs are shown in fig 7 from which it can be clearly seen that by dividing the data points into two parts at the highest point of the curve the theoretical curves fit well with the actual values in the left part while it is poorly fitted in the right part the reason for this phenomenon is that the runoff forecasting errors on the left side and the right side have different distribution characteristics in this flow interval which means that they are not symmetrical about the highest point of membership while the selected three intermediate type fuzzy distribution functions are symmetrical about the highest point of membership therefore some improvements can be made to the right part in view of this this paper divides the actual data points into the left part and right part at the highest point of membership and the fitting of the left part and right part is respectively carried out in order to obtain better closeness and related parameters in the same way select the four forecasting error intervals i e 1 0 1 0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 4 and 0 2 0 2 to carry out the calculation and analysis and the results are shown in table 4 for the convenience of comparison the results before and after the division are both provided in table 4 and the difference between them is provided too from table 4 it can be seen that ① for the divided calculation the same as the undivided calculation with the reduction of the range of the error interval the closeness value of the three methods gradually decrease and the error interval with the maximum closeness value is 1 1 and the error interval with the minimum closeness is 0 2 0 2 ② for different methods and different error intervals the closeness of the divided calculation is larger than that of the undivided calculation which shows that the divided calculation of the left side and right side can improve the overall closeness similarly for the error interval 1 1 the results after the divided calculation are shown in table 5 the parameter a of normal distribution and cusp γ distribution is the same as that in table 3 so it is not provided in this table the parameter c of cauchy distribution is 2 in different flow intervals so it is not provided in this table too after the divided calculation the variations of fuzzy closeness of the three fuzzy membership functions on all the flow intervals are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be seen that after the divided calculation whether it s the left data points or the right data points the overall closeness of cusp γ distribution is the best in the three methods that of cauchy distribution is the second and that of normal distribution is relatively poor which means that the priority of the three methods after the divided calculation is consistent with that before the divided calculation similarly taking the flow intervals q 400 and 3400 q 3600 as the examples after the divided calculation the fitting situations of actual data points and three theoretical curves are shown in fig 9 compared with fig 7 and fig 9 it is obvious that the fitting effect of theoretical values and actual values of divided calculation are better than the undivided calculation especially in the right part in the two cases i e q 400 and 3400 q 3600 the closeness increased from 0 958 and 0 964 to 0 977 and 0 971 respectively this result shows that the divided calculation can obtain a better membership function which is closer to the measured data at the same time it also indicates that the actual forecasting error data is characterized by asymmetry in some cases therefore in the study of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error it is more reasonable to derive the membership function by dividing the data points into the left part and right part at the highest point of membership function the obtainment of the optimal membership function of runoff forecasting error is the basis of the fuzzy risk analysis for the hydropower station operation after obtaining the optimal membership function how to combine the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error into reservoir operation is the key to realize the forecasting error based risk analysis of reservoir operation in fuzzy environment taking the power generation risk analysis of hydropower station operation near the boundary as an example it can be summarized by fig 10 briefly in fig 10 the credibility theory is used to carry out the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station near boundary operation based on the optimal membership function and through this framework of coupling application different near boundary operation risks can be analyzed and calculated for the hydropower station by the simulation calculation the high risk area and low risk area of hydropower station in the operation can be identified which can provide a strong support for the operators to avoid the high risk situations and toward the low risk situations when making the power generation plans in the actual production so that to effectively avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station and improve the efficiency of water resources utilization for more details about the coupling application of forecasting error and reservoir operation risk analysis readers may refer to the literature by jiang et al 2018c 4 conclusions in this paper in view of the mathematical description of the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error a fuzzy membership function optimization model based on the optimal closeness criterion is proposed and a fuzzy quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is obtained based on the hamming closeness the cauchy distribution the normal distribution and the cusp γ distribution taking the jinxi hydropower station in the yalong river basin as an example the following conclusions are drawn 1 compared with the cauchy distribution and the normal distribution the cusp γ distribution can fit the actual data points better and realize the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error under different flow levels and the average closeness can reach 0 979 2 through the dividing at the highest point of the membership function the actual data points are divided into two parts and the curve fitting is carried out respectively the results of the divided calculation are better than the undivided calculation and the closeness is improved to a certain extent under the three fuzzy membership functions and different error intervals 3 through the analysis of the results of case study it can be concluded that the proposed fuzzy membership function optimization model based on the optimal closeness criterion can be well applied to derive and optimize the fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals of jinxi hydropower station is well realized 4 however although some progress has been made on the study of the fuzziness of forecasting error in this paper the quantification of fuzzy distribution of runoff forecasting error is only the basis of fuzzy risk analysis for the hydropower station operation so there is still a lot of work to be done in the future for example more case studies on the coupling application of forecasting error and reservoir operation risk analysis need to be carried out to further verify the rationality of the proposed method and its

6691,the forecasted runoff is an important input data for the daily operation of hydropower station and the forecast accuracy directly affects its operation efficiency however the forecasting error is inevitable and it is influenced by the input the structural parameters and many human factors it is not only random but also has great fuzziness therefore it is very important to study the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error and reveal its fuzzy distribution law to guide the actual operation of hydropower station in view of this this paper has carried out research work in the following two aspects at the theoretical level in order to make the establishment of fuzzy set more objective and scientific based on different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion which can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice at the practical level in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error a quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is proposed based on the hamming closeness cauchy distribution normal distribution and cusp γ distribution taking the jinxi hydropower station of yalong river basin as the research object the fuzzy membership functions of the fuzzy sets of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals are calculated and optimized by the proposed method the results show that the optimized cusp γ distribution can fit the actual data points better compared with cauchy distribution and normal distribution and its average closeness can reach 0 979 so the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals is well realized which provides a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation keywords runoff forecasting error fuzziness membership function fuzzy closeness 1 introduction in recent years with the continuous development of forecasting models and computer technology various models applied to hydrological forecasting have been gradually developed and improved combined with the advantages of other related disciplines a comprehensive forecasting method has been formed in which the weather numerical forecasting model the land atmosphere coupling model and the hydrometeorological remote sensing correlation analysis are contained chen and singh 2018 li et al 2018 and it greatly improves the accuracy of hydrological forecasting so that the result can reflect the future runoff situation better and be more effectively used in the reservoir operation decision biao et al 2016 however due to the inevitability of forecasting error the decision making of reservoir operation will be ultimately affected by this error jiang et al 2018a li et al 2018 although there are many uncertainties in the whole process of reservoir operation the runoff forecasting error is the most important uncertain factor which leads to the operation risk so it has great significance to study the uncertainty law of the runoff forecasting error previous studies have done in depth discussions on the stochastic characteristics of runoff forecasting and its error chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2018b and have made many achievements for example hossain 2004 developed a remote sensing rainfall error model to characterize the error structure in rainfall and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework is implemented for quantification of hydrologic modeling uncertainty montanari and brath 2004 presented a technique for assessing the uncertainty of rainfall runoff simulations that makes use of a meta gaussian approach to estimate the probability distribution of the model error habib et al 2008 implemented an observation based empirical approach to analyze different characteristics of the total radar rainfall estimation error tachikawa et al 2010 modelled an error structure of real time rainfall prediction and simulated the predicted rainfall fields according to the characteristics of the prediction error structure associated with all other possible sources of error biondi and luca 2013 estimated the predictive uncertainty of future streamflow through the bayesian integration of two separate processors honti et al 2013 proposed a statistical error model that can account for the effect of various uncertainty sources present in conceptual rainfall runoff modeling studies zhou and guo 2014 implemented the variable kernel estimation for deriving the inflow forecasting error density and simulated the synthetic inflow incorporating forecasting error by monte carlo simulation liu et al 2015 analyzed the frequency distribution characteristics of flood forecasting error samples at different lead times and found that the absolute errors of the forecasts at various lead times follow normal distributions yazdi et al 2015 proposed a stochastic methodology to provide the uncertainty band of the rainfall runoff model and to calculate the probability of acceptable forecasts through the bayesian inference jiang et al 2017 derived the annual runoff distribution by integrating the multivariate joint probability density function and the derived distribution performs well in fitting distributions of the annual runoffs however as we known the hydrological forecasting model is affected by input uncertainty its own structure uncertainty parameter uncertainty and many other artificial uncertainties it is very complex and difficult to be described accurately cheng et al 2015 thus in a runoff forecasting the forecasting error is influenced by many objective and subjective factors huang et al 2014 and its size does not have a definite limit in quantity it not only has randomness but also has a lot of fuzziness that the forecasted value of runoff falls into a certain range hosseini and mahjouri 2018 as shown in fig 1 which is drawn by the actual data of the case in this paper therefore the single study of the randomness of hydrological forecasting error cannot fully express the uncertainty of error at present the researches on runoff forecasting error are mostly focused on their stochastic characteristics and are mainly studied by method of probability theory and statistics andrade et al 2001 zhu et al 2017 there are few studies on their fuzziness characteristics jacquin and shamseldin 2006 ren et al 2013 chavoshi et al 2013 in order to describe the forecasting error comprehensively we have to study the fuzzy uncertainties and distribution laws of runoff forecasting error through the fuzzy theory fuzziness is the uncertainty expressed in the state of matter and categories casper et al 2007 the method of fuzzy set analysis is a kind of mathematical method which used to describe the fuzziness of things and its relationship with certainty in fuzzy analysis fuzzy set and membership function are equivalent establishing the fuzzy sets mean to determine the membership functions of fuzzy sets the essence of fuzzy analysis is the algebraic computation process of numerical values between membership functions or between membership functions and real numbers wang 2011 therefore the establishment of appropriate membership function is very important for the effective application of fuzzy analysis theory to practical problems and the essence of studying the fuzzy distribution law and establishing the fuzzy set is to determine the membership function in fuzzy set theory membership grade is the cornerstone and the membership function is the key to describe fuzziness so the estimation of membership function is the critical step in the application of fuzzy set in general the membership function cannot be obtained directly and some experiments and investigations must be carried out to obtain them whether the membership function can effectively reflect objective facts will directly affect its application effect so the research of how to determine the membership function is of great significance in practice there is no absolutely right construction method for membership function and all the construction methods of membership function are influenced by people s subjective intention to some extent however processed through some scientific ways they can be used to construct the membership function and effectively reflect objective facts in dealing with practical fuzzy problems it is necessary to determine the appropriate method of constructing membership function according to the specific requirements of actual background and people s experience and many achievements in this field have been obtained by scholars jiang et al 2015 for example dash et al 1998 devised a learning algorithm for updating the connecting weights as well as the structure of the membership function of the network lacroix et al 1998 developed a procedure for the determination of fuzzy membership functions based on data acquired from experts and the overall procedure appears to be appropriate for rapidly finding the membership functions by combining the heuristics and evolutionary programming scheme yang and huang 1998 solved the problem of determining the best partition of fuzzy spaces and associated fuzzy membership functions focus on optimizing the fuzzy membership function and consequence parameter mori and itagaki 2004 proposed a fuzzy inference neural network based method for short term load forecasting in electric power systems according to the analytical structure of fuzzy controller and immune algorithm huang et al 2009 presented a new method about the design and optimization of membership function li et al 2018 designed a new hyper plane shaped clustering fuzzy membership function to identify the antecedent membership function parameters by adopting a novel t s fuzzy model identification method many research results show that due to the limitations of people in knowing things they usually can only obtain an approximate membership function when constructing the fuzzy membership function in the face of a large number of optional fuzzy functions most of them have difficulties in the selection and have some subjective disadvantages in addition it can be seen from the above description that there are many achievements in the study of fuzzy membership function of forecasting error especially in the research of power load forecasting yang et al 2004 wei et al 2005 but the research results on the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error are few and the study of fuzzy membership function optimization on runoff forecasting error is almost blank in view of this this paper firstly introduces the commonly used construction methods of membership function and based on the analysis of practicability advantages and disadvantages of various methods an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion the theoretical innovation of this optimization model is that it can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice so that the process of establishing the fuzzy set is more objective and scientific in addition at the practical level in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error a new method of constructing the membership function of runoff forecasting error based on the proposed overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed in case study this paper takes the jinxi hydropower station in the yalong river basin of china as the research object and combining the obtained runoff forecasting data and the measured data the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution laws of the runoff forecasting error under the different flow intervals are realized through the proposed method in fuzzy environment the research results of this paper can provide a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation and improve the ability of dispatchers to control the risk of reservoir operation and improve the utilization efficiency of water resources 2 methodologies 2 1 commonly used membership function nowadays there are many kinds of construction methods of membership function that have been put forward and applied including fuzzy distribution method faye et al 2003 fuzzy statistics method güler et al 2012 analytic hierarchy process method sener and sener 2015 expert subjective judgment method parent and bernier 2003 fuzzy collection algorithm young et al 2015 etc in this paper the fuzzy distribution method is used if the fuzzy set is defined on the real number domain r or a subset of r then the membership function of fuzzy set becomes the fuzzy distribution function the fuzzy distribution method is to apply some current fuzzy distributions based on the nature of the problem and determine the parameters contained in the distribution according to the measured data in practical problems the membership functions of many fuzzy sets can be obtained by slightly modifying the commonly used fuzzy distribution functions therefore the fuzzy distribution method is a common method in determining the fuzzy membership function three types of fuzzy distribution are contained in the fuzzy distribution method i e intermediate type fuzzy distribution positive skew fuzzy distribution and negative skew fuzzy distribution this paper mainly studies the fuzzy distribution of runoff forecasting error and according to the previous studies the error of runoff forecasting usually belongs to the intermediate type fuzzy distribution so several commonly used intermediate type fuzzy distributions are introduced here as shown below 2 1 1 cusp γ distribution 1 a x e k x a x a e k x a x a where a k is a constant respectively and k 0 from the cusp γ distribution represented by formula 1 it can be seen that it is made up of two exponential functions i e a x ek x a and a x e k x a which are symmetrical at x a the value of parameter a reflects the central position of cusp γ distribution with the increase of x the value of a x gradually increases when x a and the parameter k reflects the increasing speed of the a x at this time with the increase of x the value of a x gradually decreases when x a and the parameter k reflects the decreasing speed of the a x at this time the intersection point of the two exponential functions is at x a where the value of a x is 1 which is the maximum value of fuzzy membership that is the so called cusp point by adjusting the values of parameters k and a the cusp γ distribution can be used to fit many kinds of fuzzy variables with intermediate symmetry such as the runoff forecasting error 2 1 2 normal distribution 2 a x e k x a 2 where a k is a constant respectively parameter k can reflect the variance of data series to a certain extent that is the degree of data dispersion the parameter a represents the mean value of data series 2 1 3 cauchy distribution 3 a x 1 1 a x b c where a is a constant and a 0 c is a positive even number b is the location parameter that defines the peak position of the function distribution for other fuzzy distributions such as the rectangular distribution trapezoidal distribution etc the readers can refer to the literature by kacker and lawrence 2009 2 2 fuzzy distribution method based on the optimal closeness criteria closeness is a measure of the degree of proximity of two fuzzy sets in fuzzy mathematics the closer the two fuzzy sets are the better the closeness of the two fuzzy sets is the commonly used closeness criteria includes the hamming closeness bookstein et al 2001 euclidean closeness yuzugullu et al 2013 ayeldeen et al 2015 max min closeness kundu 1998 khan et al 2015 and lattice closeness li et al 2011 etc different form of closeness criteria has different advantages and disadvantages in practical application it should be chosen according to the specific conditions in general the hamming closeness is relatively simple and practical and it can be selected firstly fu et al 2007 the lattice closeness is more convenient in manual calculation and it is often used in fuzzy pattern recognition dai et al 2016 the expressions of the two closeness can be expressed as follows 2 2 1 hamming closeness 4 σ h a b 1 1 n i 1 n μ a x i μ b x i where μ a and μ b is respectively the fuzzy membership function of the fuzzy sets a and b σh is the hamming closeness of fuzzy sets a and b n is the number of discretized data points 2 2 2 lattice closeness 5 σ l a b a b 1 a b 2 where a b is called the inner product of a and b and a b is called the external product of a and b that is 6 a b x x μ a x i μ b x i a b x x μ a x i μ b x i nowadays fuzzy distribution method is the most commonly used method to construct the membership functions and some practical and measured data will be used in constructing the membership function liu et al 2016 by this method however if the studied object is a new thing and the experience is not rich there will be great subjectivity in choosing the suitable fuzzy distribution function and determining its parameters especially when the shape of the distribution functions is close such as the cusp γ distribution and normal distribution in addition the same type of fuzzy membership function should be used if the fuzzy distribution method is used to construct the fuzzy membership functions of multiple fuzzy sets on the same domain which also brings difficulties to the actual choice of fuzzy membership function in the process of constructing fuzzy membership function the measured data itself reflects a fuzzy set and the theoretical fuzzy distribution with the determined parameters is also a fuzzy set so the fuzzy distribution method is essentially to use a convenient theoretical fuzzy set to replace the fuzzy set reflected by the measured data the higher the closeness of the two fuzzy sets is the better the objective facts can be reflected in view of this an overall optimization framework of fuzzy distribution method is proposed in this paper by coupling the optimal closeness criterion different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method the basic principle of the optimal closeness criterion based fuzzy distribution method can be briefly described as follow firstly select several three or four potential fuzzy distribution functions according to the practical experience then for each fuzzy set on the same domain construct the membership function by each selected fuzzy distribution function with the measured data and determine the parameters of the membership function based on the optimal closeness criterion then each selected fuzzy distribution function can obtain a comprehensive closeness for all the fuzzy sets finally take the fuzzy distribution function with the best comprehensive closeness as the final membership function of the fuzzy sets the parameters of the determined membership function of each fuzzy set can also be obtained at the same time the merits of this method are that it can select a reasonable fuzzy distribution and determine the parameters of the fuzzy distribution by applying the optimal closeness criterion when constructing the membership function and it can effectively eliminate the adverse subjectivity that the fuzzy distribution method will produce if it is used alone besides it can not only make full use of the guiding role of practical experience but also effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice it has the characteristics of unbiasedness and objectivity the flowchart of the optimal closeness criterion based fuzzy distribution method is shown in fig 2 in fig 2 the a 1 a 2 am are the fuzzy sets or spaces whose optimal membership functions on the same domain need to be determined and in the actual calculation the measured data on each fuzzy set is used to replace them in order to find the optimal theoretical membership function distribution the b 1 x b 2 x bn x are the selected distribution functions based on the practical experience and measured data and they can be any of the aforementioned cusp γ distribution normal distribution cauchy distribution rectangular distribution or trapezoidal distribution etc on the same domain although the final membership function parameters can be inconsistent for different fuzzy sets the form of membership function should be the same this is why for any fuzzy distribution function bn x in fig 2 the proposed method needs to traverse the different fuzzy sets am m 1 2 m on the same domain so that to obtain a series of the closeness σ am bmn m 1 2 m based on this a comprehensive closeness σ a bn of bn x can be calculated on the fuzzy sets am m 1 2 m so for different bn n 1 2 n different σ a bn n 1 2 n on the fuzzy sets am m 1 2 m can be obtained one of them is the largest and the bn corresponding to the largest σ a b and its related function parameters are what we wanted 2 3 fuzzy membership function determination method for runoff forecasting error in order to express the runoff forecasting error comprehensively the fuzzy uncertainty of forecasting error should be considered in this paper the runoff forecasting error is regarded as a fuzzy variable and the runoff forecasting errors under different flow intervals are regarded as a fuzzy set and the optimal closeness criterion based fuzzy distribution method is used to construct the membership function of the fuzzy set of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals the membership function of fuzzy variable is essential similar to the meaning of probability density function of random variable that is to describe the degree of object belonging to a certain feature therefore the occurrence probability of the variable can be used to determine the membership value that is if the occurrence frequency of an event is high the corresponding membership value of this event is also large based on this for the analysis of the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error we firstly classify the flow into different intervals according to the measured data and use the error data to count the occurrence frequency of different forecasting errors in each flow interval and then determine the membership value of the fuzzy set of runoff forecasting error according to the frequency and let the membership value of the forecasting error with the highest probability in each flow interval equal to 1 and the final membership function of the fuzzy set of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals can be determined based on the optimal closeness criterion considering the general distribution of the measured data of runoff forecasting error the normal distribution cusp γ distribution and cauchy distribution are selected as the feasible fuzzy distribution functions and the simple and practical hamming closeness is selected as the evaluation criteria in determining the parameters of the distribution function the parameter a in the normal distribution and cusp γ distribution and the parameter b in the cauchy distribution correspond to the points with the maximum membership value in the measured data the parameter k in the normal distribution and cusp γ distribution and the parameters a and c in the cauchy distribution are determined by the optimization method based on the optimal closeness criterion the specific steps of determining the fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment are summarized as follows step1 classify the flow into different flow intervals according to the measured data and get the different flow frequency pm m 1 2 m and the corresponding average flow qm step2 for any frequency pm count the measured error data points of this flow frequency and divide the error interval into multiple zones with the same step length and count the number of errors occurring in each zone and let the membership value of the center point of the zone which has the largest number of error data points in all zones equal to 1 and the membership values of other zones can be determined by the ratio of the number of error data points to this zone as shown in fig 3 step3 determine the membership function of runoff forecasting error of this frequency by the normal distribution and the parameter a can be determined by the maximum membership value point and the parameter k can be obtained by the optimal closeness criterion based optimization algorithm and the closeness σm1 can be obtained at the same time step4 determine the membership function of runoff forecasting error of this frequency by the cusp γ distribution and the parameter a can be determined by the maximum membership value point and the parameter k can be obtained by the optimal closeness criterion based optimization algorithm and the closeness σm2 can be obtained at the same time step5 determine the membership function of runoff forecasting error of this frequency by the cauchy distribution and the parameter b can be determined by the maximum membership value point and the parameters a and c can be obtained by the optimal closeness criterion based optimization algorithm and the closeness σm3 can be obtained at the same time step6 by repeating step2 to step5 the membership functions the corresponding parameters and closeness σm1 σm2 σm3 of each frequency can be obtained where m 1 m 2 m 3 1 2 m and calculate the comprehensive closeness of each fuzzy distribution respectively i e σ1 σ2 σ3 step7 the final optimal membership function of runoff forecasting error under different flow frequency can be obtained according to the comprehensive closeness of the three predefined distribution function for the parameter optimization method mentioned in step3 step4 and step5 because the parameters to be optimized are few only one parameter k in cusp γ and normal distribution and two parameters a and c in the cauchy distribution the method of traversing search with fixed step is adopted in the parameter optimization this method only needs to determine the search range and step length jiang et al 2017 and the optimization effect is good when there are a few parameters and the random problem of random search algorithm can be avoided and the optimal solution can be found 3 case study 3 1 basic data yalong river is the first major tributary of jinsha river there are twenty two planed hydropower stations on the main stream at present the development of the hydropower resources of yalong river downstream is completed and five hydropower stations have been put into operation i e jinxi jindong guandi ertan and tonzhilin the jinxi hydropower station has an annual regulation performance and it is the dominant station of the downstream stream whose operation technology and level can directly determine the hydropower generation benefit of the whole downstream cascade reservoirs thus jinxi hydropower station is selected as the research object in this paper the location of this station is shown in fig 4 the normal water level of this station is 1880 m the dead water level is 1800 m the installed capacity is 3600 mw the guarantee output is 1086 mw and the annual average discharge at the dam site is 1220 m3 s the long series measured and forecasted hourly flow are available from the beginning operation of this hydropower station june 2013 to july 2017 which has a total of about 35 600 data points i e an average of 24 data points per day from june 2013 to july 2017 12 measured data and 12 corresponding forecasted data in each day the runoff is forecasted by the xin anjiang model bao 1986 chen and zhu 2005 in which the runoff is divided into surface runoff subsurface runoff and underground runoff in forecasting moreover in the forecasting process the arcgis software is used to extract the underlying surface information of the river basin and the channel water movement calculation is carried out by muskingum method barbetta et al 2011 the rainfall is calculated by the superposition of the watershed unit and the tyson polygon douinot et al 2017 since different flow levels generally have different error distributions before the fuzzy analysis of runoff forecasting error the incoming flow need to be divided into different levels based on the long series of measured and forecasted data through the measured runoff data it can be found that the maximum runoff of jinxi hydropower station is about 5500 m3 s and the minimum runoff is about 100 m3 s so the 0 5600 m3 s can be as the feasible range to implement grade division in addition according to the actual distribution of the data points of forecasting error it is found that the number of data points below 400 m3 s and above 4400 m3 s are very few so the interval where the flow below 400 m3 s and above 4400 m3 s is as an interval respectively for the rest the flow is divided by taking 200 m3 s as the discrete step and the total flow levels is 22 the result of runoff division is shown in table 1 it needs to be reminded that if the ranges below 400 m3 s and above 4400 m3 s are still divided by the step length of 200 m3 s the data points in each flow interval of these ranges will be less especially for the range above 4400 m3 s so that the error will be very large in calculating the closeness of the discrete points and the theoretical curve even the results are unbelievable besides this study does not focus on flood problems so there is no need to specially study the peak flow in the range above 4400 m3 s 3 2 results and discussion in this paper the fuzzy quantitative method of runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is used to study the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error in jinxi hydropower station and the proposed fuzzy distribution method based on the optimal closeness criterion is used to construct the membership function of the fuzzy set of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals the optimal closeness and the parameters of the membership function of each fuzzy set on the error interval 1 0 1 0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 4 and 0 2 0 2 are calculated respectively the statistical results of the average closeness of each distribution function and each error interval on all flow levels are shown in table 2 from the table 2 it can be seen that with the reduction of the range of the error interval the closeness value of the three methods gradually decrease and the error interval with the maximum closeness value is 1 1 and the error interval with the minimum closeness is 0 2 0 2 the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the abscissa value of the highest point of membership function of runoff forecasting error is close to 0 and the smaller the error interval in the calculation is the more the actual points will be close to the highest point of the membership function therefore if the error interval is small the membership values of the data points in this interval are relative large and the absolute difference between the theoretical value and the actual point is corresponding large according to the calculation formula of hamming closeness the comprehensive closeness will be smaller at this time therefore compared with the four different error intervals the membership function calculated on the error interval 1 0 1 0 is more reasonable it not only has the best comprehensive closeness but also covers almost all the measured error data points in seeking and optimizing the membership function which has better reliability and representativeness for the error interval 1 1 the optimal parameters of the three theoretical membership functions and their closeness to the actual data points under different flow intervals are shown in table 3 the traversing search method with fixed step is adopted in the parameter optimization and the optimal objective function is the maximum closeness from table 3 it can be seen that the corresponding parameters i e a and k vary greatly for different flow intervals especially for the parameter k this is mainly due to the difference of input data that is in the fuzzy analysis of the forecasting error in different flow intervals the forecasting error sequences used are different which makes the optimal parameters obtained by the optimization model are different for different flow intervals the variations of fuzzy closeness of the three fuzzy membership functions on all the flow intervals are shown in fig 5 in this fig 5 there are three curves which respectively corresponding to the variation of fuzzy closeness of cusp γ distribution solid black line cauchy distribution dotted line and normal distribution another dotted line from the fig 5 it can be seen that the overall closeness of cusp γ distribution is the best at the top position in the three methods the cauchy distribution is the second and the normal distribution is relatively poor at the lowest position so from the point of view of position the difference of the three curves is obvious besides the average closeness of cusp γ distribution is 0 976 that of cauchy distribution is 0 971 and that of normal distribution is 0 970 although the average closeness of the three distributions does not differ much the cusp γ distribution still has the highest overall closeness therefore the cusp γ distribution is the best in these three distributions either on the graph or on the statistical mean value of closeness thus the cusp γ distribution can be taken as the theoretical fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error the fitting situations of the cusp γ distribution in some flow intervals such as 800 q 1000 1000 q 1200 are shown in fig 6 from which it can be found that the fitting degree between the theoretical value and actual value is very good in addition through the comparison of the actual data points and the theoretical curves it is found that in most cases the fitting degree between the theoretical curves and actual values is very good however in a few cases such as the q 400 and 3400 q 3600 although their optimal closeness of cusp γ distribution can reach 0 958 and 0 964 respectively their fitting situations are not good their fitting graphs are shown in fig 7 from which it can be clearly seen that by dividing the data points into two parts at the highest point of the curve the theoretical curves fit well with the actual values in the left part while it is poorly fitted in the right part the reason for this phenomenon is that the runoff forecasting errors on the left side and the right side have different distribution characteristics in this flow interval which means that they are not symmetrical about the highest point of membership while the selected three intermediate type fuzzy distribution functions are symmetrical about the highest point of membership therefore some improvements can be made to the right part in view of this this paper divides the actual data points into the left part and right part at the highest point of membership and the fitting of the left part and right part is respectively carried out in order to obtain better closeness and related parameters in the same way select the four forecasting error intervals i e 1 0 1 0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 4 and 0 2 0 2 to carry out the calculation and analysis and the results are shown in table 4 for the convenience of comparison the results before and after the division are both provided in table 4 and the difference between them is provided too from table 4 it can be seen that ① for the divided calculation the same as the undivided calculation with the reduction of the range of the error interval the closeness value of the three methods gradually decrease and the error interval with the maximum closeness value is 1 1 and the error interval with the minimum closeness is 0 2 0 2 ② for different methods and different error intervals the closeness of the divided calculation is larger than that of the undivided calculation which shows that the divided calculation of the left side and right side can improve the overall closeness similarly for the error interval 1 1 the results after the divided calculation are shown in table 5 the parameter a of normal distribution and cusp γ distribution is the same as that in table 3 so it is not provided in this table the parameter c of cauchy distribution is 2 in different flow intervals so it is not provided in this table too after the divided calculation the variations of fuzzy closeness of the three fuzzy membership functions on all the flow intervals are shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be seen that after the divided calculation whether it s the left data points or the right data points the overall closeness of cusp γ distribution is the best in the three methods that of cauchy distribution is the second and that of normal distribution is relatively poor which means that the priority of the three methods after the divided calculation is consistent with that before the divided calculation similarly taking the flow intervals q 400 and 3400 q 3600 as the examples after the divided calculation the fitting situations of actual data points and three theoretical curves are shown in fig 9 compared with fig 7 and fig 9 it is obvious that the fitting effect of theoretical values and actual values of divided calculation are better than the undivided calculation especially in the right part in the two cases i e q 400 and 3400 q 3600 the closeness increased from 0 958 and 0 964 to 0 977 and 0 971 respectively this result shows that the divided calculation can obtain a better membership function which is closer to the measured data at the same time it also indicates that the actual forecasting error data is characterized by asymmetry in some cases therefore in the study of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error it is more reasonable to derive the membership function by dividing the data points into the left part and right part at the highest point of membership function the obtainment of the optimal membership function of runoff forecasting error is the basis of the fuzzy risk analysis for the hydropower station operation after obtaining the optimal membership function how to combine the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error into reservoir operation is the key to realize the forecasting error based risk analysis of reservoir operation in fuzzy environment taking the power generation risk analysis of hydropower station operation near the boundary as an example it can be summarized by fig 10 briefly in fig 10 the credibility theory is used to carry out the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station near boundary operation based on the optimal membership function and through this framework of coupling application different near boundary operation risks can be analyzed and calculated for the hydropower station by the simulation calculation the high risk area and low risk area of hydropower station in the operation can be identified which can provide a strong support for the operators to avoid the high risk situations and toward the low risk situations when making the power generation plans in the actual production so that to effectively avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station and improve the efficiency of water resources utilization for more details about the coupling application of forecasting error and reservoir operation risk analysis readers may refer to the literature by jiang et al 2018c 4 conclusions in this paper in view of the mathematical description of the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error a fuzzy membership function optimization model based on the optimal closeness criterion is proposed and a fuzzy quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is obtained based on the hamming closeness the cauchy distribution the normal distribution and the cusp γ distribution taking the jinxi hydropower station in the yalong river basin as an example the following conclusions are drawn 1 compared with the cauchy distribution and the normal distribution the cusp γ distribution can fit the actual data points better and realize the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error under different flow levels and the average closeness can reach 0 979 2 through the dividing at the highest point of the membership function the actual data points are divided into two parts and the curve fitting is carried out respectively the results of the divided calculation are better than the undivided calculation and the closeness is improved to a certain extent under the three fuzzy membership functions and different error intervals 3 through the analysis of the results of case study it can be concluded that the proposed fuzzy membership function optimization model based on the optimal closeness criterion can be well applied to derive and optimize the fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals of jinxi hydropower station is well realized 4 however although some progress has been made on the study of the fuzziness of forecasting error in this paper the quantification of fuzzy distribution of runoff forecasting error is only the basis of fuzzy risk analysis for the hydropower station operation so there is still a lot of work to be done in the future for example more case studies on the coupling application of forecasting error and reservoir operation risk analysis need to be carried out to further verify the rationality of the proposed method and its

total volume of stemflow is dependent on the rainfall depth threshold required for stemflow initiation and the rate and continuity of flow once stemflow has begun see park and hattori 2002 carlyle moses and schooling 2015 mckee and carlyle moses 2017 greater insight into the influence of storm meteorology and or tree characteristics have on stemflow volume may be accomplished by investigating the temporal dynamics of this understory precipitation input at the intra storm time scale levia 2004 van stan et al 2011 van stan et al 2016 cayuela et al 2018 the common method of measuring stemflow involves affixing halved tubing around the bole of a tree forming a collar which then captures stemflow and routes it to a storage reservoir for subsequent measurement this collar reservoir method has changed little since this water input was first quantified over a century ago ebermayer 1873 zon 1927 see horton 1919 and is limited in that it only generates a single storm total stemflow volume as such no insight into the storm conditions leading up to stemflow initiation or how this flux varies in response to changing storm conditions can be deduced using this measurement methodology in attempt to resolve the intra storm dynamics of stemflow generation both tipping bucket rain gauges and flow meters have been utilized e g van stan et al 2011 cayuela et al 2018 shimizu et al 2018 these gauges offer the ability to collect valuable data regarding stemflow generation throughout an event however they suffer from systematic mechanical errors due to the rate of water delivery to the bucket device thus requiring calibration calder and kidd 1978 ziegler et al 2009 iida et al 2018 random errors including the clogging of the gauge outflow orifice to the bucket mechanism sevruk 1996 shedekar et al 2016 keim and link 2018 moderate temporal resolutions typically 5 minutes iida et al 2012 and intuitively the relatively high expense of tipping bucket gauges limits the number of trees that can be sampled additionally since the time lag between the start of stemflow and the first tip can only be crudely estimated using tipping bucket rain and flow gauges determining the timing of stemflow initiation and the threshold rainfall depth required for that flow initiation lacks precision when these gauge types are used this study develops a stemflow monitoring system that can provide high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of stemflow rate as well as the depth of rainfall required for stemflow to begin the design and deployment of a single sensor capable of measuring volumetric flow rate of stemflow at a frequency of 0 1 hz a significant increase in temporal resolution compared to storm scale or even 5 minute averages is described the relatively low cost and autonomous nature of the sensor allows for a greater number of trees to be sampled on a given budget compared to using tipping bucket gauges and when compared to the collar reservoir method a more efficient post storm measurement stemflow additionally the introduced sensor allows for the discreet measurement of storm stemflow over multiple events something not possible with the collar reservoir method 2 methods the stemflow sensor deployed in this work was constructed using low cost readily available electronics components and construction materials the objectives of the study included developing a system which was capable of remote monitoring of stemflow dynamics as well as being scalable to large spatial deployments the system was designed in a manner which allows it to be reproduced adapted or enhanced the sensor node is an autonomous device that can be deployed at the base of a tree to measure the stemflow generated during a rain event based on the rate of change of water depth in a collection vessel over time as illustrated in fig 1 the sensor node is composed of a stemflow collection vessel stilling well and sensor housing stemflow is routed from the tree into the collection vessel via a stemflow collar wrapped around the tree bole the stilling well constructed from 20 cm schedule 40 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs pipe provides a relatively quiescent pool for depth measurements to be made by an ultrasonic rangefinder positioned above the pool the sensor node s electronic components are integrated into a weatherproof sensor housing constructed from a 10x10x10 cm polyvinyl chloride pvc weatherproof junction box e987nr carlton gross automation wi usa located at the top of the stilling well shaft although not illustrated in fig 1 power for the sensor node is provided by a 12 v 20 amp deep cycle battery charged by a 20 w solar panel this power supply is sufficient to power the sensor indefinitely at the latitude where testing of this equipment was performed at the core of the sensor node is an arduino uno microcontroller arduino uno arduino cc ivrea italy a programmable device designed to handle electronic signals from the sensors with minimal processing overhead arduino is an open source hardware project that has created a hardware design and programming interface that is offered to the user community free of cost to construct and or customize preassembled microcontrollers such as the one used in this work can also be purchased not only does the open source philosophy lead to a low cost microcontroller but it also has fostered the growth of a massive user community providing on line resources supporting users with technical information tutorials and electronics design assistance that significantly lowers the barriers to entry when designing electronics d ausilio 2012 fisher and gould 2012 pallugna et al 2013 hund et al 2016 the arduino uno in the sensor system manages data collection by a sensor payload consisting of an ultrasonic rangefinder and a wetness sensor data preprocessing as well as data logging using an sd card and gps for precision time stamping the sensor system employs an ultrasonic rangefinder for stemflow volume measurement because remote sensing is less prone to mechanical failure than methods requiring direct interaction with the collected stemflow the ultrasonic rangefinder hr lv ez3 maxbotix inc mn usa integrated into the sensor system has a minimum measurement distance of 300 mm a measurement resolution of 1 mm and employs an integrated temperature compensation within an operating range of 15 c to 65 c to overcome variations in the speed of sound in air due to variations in temperature the ultrasonic range measurements however are subject to two primary sources of measurement error liquid motion within the collection vessel and environmental sources of ultrasonic noise although the stilling well was used to reduce the motion of stemflow within the collection vessel it did not eliminate all surface variability due to that liquid motion to minimize measurement error due to liquid motion within the stilling well and to address intermittent ultrasonic noise present in the deployment environment raw measurements from the ultrasonic sensor are processed using a mode filter to generate the output measurement of the sensor system the mode filter operates on a 10 second interval during which a sample of 15 raw range measurements are acquired the expected value of the range between the sensor and the liquid surface during the 10 second interval is calculated as the mode of the distribution of the sampled range measurements thus producing a 0 1 hz time series during post processing the expected liquid volume within the collection vessel is estimated from this time series by first calculating the expected liquid depth by subtracting the range measurements from the distance between the rangefinder and the bottom of the stilling well and then applying a depth to volume calibration the ultrasonic rangefinder while effective at monitoring changes in the depth of the liquid in the collection vessel over time it is not capable of detecting the instantaneous onset of stemflow entering the collection vessel nor the very small volumes often associated with the cessation of stemflow for this reason a wetness sensor fc 37 generic manufacture china located at the inlet to the collection vessel is used to estimate the time when water starts and stops flowing into the collection vessel the wetness sensor is supplied with 5 v and connected to a monitored analog input on the arduino through a 10 kω resistor the presence of water on the sensor decreases the voltage measured by the arduino the stemflow initiation and cessation times are inferred during postprocessing from the timeseries of voltage measured by the arduino a gps shield add on adafruit ultimate gps logger shield adafruit industries ny usa which integrates a real time clock module rtc a gps receiver and sd card interface was used to store data and maintain accurate time and date stamps the gps operated at an update frequency of 1 hz command and control of the gps module was managed using the adafruit gps library in order to simplify timekeeping seconds were occasionally rounded based on the millisecond value returned by the gps rounded seconds do not compound and the imprecision in time stamps never exceeds 500 ms a depth to volume calibration of the sensor system was performed prior to deployment the calibration procedure consisted of adding 5 l of water to a bucket in increments of 100 ml every 1 min after each 100 ml addition the depth of the water was estimated from sensor system range measurement the calibration procedure was repeated 10 times the data collected during the calibration procedure are illustrated in fig 2 which reveals that there is a strong linear relationship between range and volume which was modeled by linear regression to produce a depth to volume calibration curve for the sensor system this calibration curve indicates that each 1 mm increase in water depth within the bucket corresponds to a 53 ml increase in volume with a residual error of 23 ml additionally the y intercept of the calibration curve reveals that first 100 ml is not detected by the ultrasonic range measurement which is likely attributed to the slightly convex surface of the bottom of the 19 l bucket used for the collection vessel 3 case study 3 1 study tree and sensor system deployment the performance of the sensor system developed in this study for capturing intra storm dynamics of stemflow generation was evaluated by monitor the stemflow generated by an ornamental juvenile green ash fraxinus pennsylvanica marshall tree located on the thompson rivers university campus in kamloops british columbia canada 50 40 25 2 n 120 21 49 7 w elevation of 499 m above mean sea level the ash tree selected for this study stands alone and is separated from potential obstructions e g other trees or buildings by a minimum horizontal distance equal to twice the height of the potential obstruction the tree s height and diameter at breast height dbh during the study period were 7 4 m and 10 8 cm respectively given the tree size and the typical precipitation patterns of kamloops this tree is expected to generate moderate stemflow during rainfall events schooling and carlyle moses 2015 a meteorological station u30 nrc sys c onset computer corp ma usa with a tipping bucket rain gauge tb4 hyquest solutions liverpool nsw aus was deployed within 40 m of the tree in an open clearing the tipping bucket rain gauge with a resolution of 0 1 mm tip 1 was sited in observance of appropriate setbacks from nearby obstructions the location of the instrumented ash tree and the meteorological station and tipping bucket rain gauge are illustrated in fig 3 to ensure temporal consistency the internal clocks on the meteorological station and the sensor system were synchronized to the internet clock of the sensor system measurements of stemflow and corresponding meteorological data were made over a two month period extending from may 4 to july 4 2016 inclusive the deployed sensor system is depicted in fig 4 stemflow from the tree was collected by a stemflow collar wrapped twice around the tree at approximately 1 5 m above ground level the stemflow collar was constructed from a length of flexible corrugated pvc tubing that was cut in half prior to being fastened to the tree once attached the portion of the collar abutting the tree was covered with silicone caulk to ensure a water tight joint the end of the collar was attached to an unmodified short length of the same tubing which directed stemflow into the collection vessel the collection vessel used in this study was a standard 19 l high density polyethylene hdpe construction bucket a large hdpe storage tote was used to contain the collection vessel and a box containing the lead acid battery powering the sensor system the tote was covered with a plywood lid to which the solar panel was mounted and through which the 1 m long stilling well protruded all connections between the stilling well and the plywood lid were sealed using electrical duct seal putty 3 2 rainfall and stemflow characteristics over the study period during the two month study period a total of 80 4 mm of rain fell being distributed over 17 events mean 4 7 mm median 3 7 mm ranging from event depths of 0 2 mm june 11 to 14 3 mm 26 27 may table 1 the cumulative manually measured stemflow volume was 10 150 l stemflow was not observed for those rain events whose depths were 1 3 mm the relationship between stemflow volume s f l and rain depth p g mm for those events 1 3 mm was found to be linear fig 5 with the equation of the line being 1 s f 0 173 p g 0 271 r 2 0 532 n 11 from eq 1 the threshold rain depth required for stemflow initiation is estimated at 1 6 mm while the mean stemflow rate once flow was initiated across these 11 events is estimated at 0 173 l mm 1 of rain however the results from the sensor for four storms suggests that both the threshold rain depth and mean event flow rate are highly dynamic with the threshold rain depth ranging from 0 9 to 3 7 mm and the event mean stemflow rate varying from 0 009 to 0 444 l mm 1 of rain see table 1 3 3 in depth evaluation of the stemflow sensor system during a single event the may 4 event was selected as an exemplar of the potential of the sensing system developed in this study for this event the sensor node performed as expected with negligible errors it also happened to be an event of significance due to the low stemflow initiation rainfall depth 0 9 mm as compared to other events the sensor continued to perform as expected for the following three events unexpected errors with time stamps and anomalies in the ultrasonic data invalidated many of the following storms the may 21 event demonstrated the anomalous measurements of the ultrasonic sensor table 1 shows that the sensor grossly overestimated the volume of stemflow this error stemmed from a combination of low water volume the sensor is imprecise at volumes under 114 ml environmental noise and improper alignment of the sensor housing it was periodically measuring the distance to the wall of the stilling well these errors were addressed however but not until the after the field season was completed the may 4 event delivered a total of 5 0 mm of rainfall over 4 93 h the hyetograph measured by the on site rain gauge is illustrated in fig 6 and shows that the peak 5 minute rainfall intensity 13 5 mm h 1 during this storm occurred 2 80 h after the rain began the storm start time was estimated based on wetness sensors attached to the meteorological station data from the wetness sensor integrated into the sensor system are plotted in fig 7 as a time series consisting of measurements taken at 10 s intervals assuming the first drop in voltage recorded by the wetness sensor indicates stemflow initiation these data suggest that stemflow initiates approximately 50 min into the event after a total of 0 9 mm of rain had fallen observed fluctuations in the voltage drop recorded by the stemflow sensor are likely due to changes in stemflow rate and or splashing of stemflow as it was routed into the collection vessel prior to analysis the ultrasonic range measurements from the sensor system were processed by kalman smoothing to further reduce noise in the range time series following smoothing stemflow volumes were computed from the range time series using the distance to volume calibration developed prior to deployment the cumulative stemflow volume derived from this procedure is plotted alongside the cumulative rainfall volume measured by the tipping bucket rain gauge in fig 8 from fig 8 stemflow appears to follow the same general pattern as rainfall albeit with stemflow initiating approximately 1 h into the event and ultimately ending within 20 min of rainfall cessation towards the end of the storm the stemflow curve appears to take a slight negative slope indicating a loss of liquid in the collection vessel this phenomenon is likely due to variation in the range measurements from the ultrasonic rangefinder the total volume of stemflow collected by the sensor 2 101 l 23 ml during the event was estimated using the volume measured by the sensor system when stemflow ceased cessation indicated by the wetness sensor integrated into the sensor system physical measurement of the volume of liquid within the stemflow collection vessel after the may 4 storm revealed a total volume of 1 820 l indicating good agreement between the remotely sensed measurement of the sensor system and a physical measurement of the same quantity 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the stemflow sensor the may 4 2016 event was chosen to demonstrate the type of process questions that are enabled by data collected utilizing the stemflow sensing system developed in this work the wetness sensor was not used to infer the stemflow cessation time because once wetted the wetness sensor must dry off completely e g via evaporation before it will return to a 5 v measurement given its high temporal resolution and ability to identify stemflow initiation and approximate cessation times the data collected by the stemflow monitoring system developed in this work presents an opportunity to link stemflow dynamics to meteorological conditions such as wind speed and direction monitored by a nearby meteorological station understanding how storm dynamics affect stemflow is valuable when modelling how a given plant canopy will affect the water budget of a localized region such as the base of a tree tanaka et al 1996 levia and germer 2015 meteorological factors such as rainfall inclination drop size and velocity wind direction and velocity and rainfall intensity all affect initiation cessation and volume of stemflow germer et al 2010 van stan et al 2011 van stan et al 2014 carlyle moses and schooling 2015 the stemflow sensing system developed in this work provides 10 second resolution stemflow measurements which have the potential to improve models attempting to forecast stemflow dynamics based on meteorological drivers for example based on the sensor system deployed in the case study it was determined that although stemflow initiation lagged approximately 1 h behind the rainfall the dynamics of the stemflow were found to exhibit a similar temporal pattern as the rainfall that generated it and the stemflow ceased within 20 minutes of the end of the event increases in spatial resolution are also needed to better model the influence of storm dynamics upon stemflow common practices such as manual measurements are labor intensive making them difficult to scale up to a larger sample of trees while maintaining the ability to collect data in a timely manner increasing spatial resolution of stemflow data by instrumenting a larger sample of trees could potentially open further avenues of inquiry into such questions as the effects of topography canopy density influences or physiological variations across a species electromechanical sensors e g tipping bucket gauges currently used to monitor stemflow do reduce the labor required to monitor a larger sample of trees however at a significant financial cost the sensing system developed in this work was designed to not only reduce the total labor required to scale to a larger sample of trees but to also do so at a low cost approaching this project from a maker point of view will allow it to be adopted and used more widely while replication and improvement are core tenets of scientific research the maker approach to design and production is instrumental in opening the project to an audience beyond the academic community hobbyist grade electronics are widely available and affordable allowing for the overall cost of the platform to remain low approximately 350 cad 270 usd at present time per system lower costs allow for more sensor systems to be deployed which increases the potential spatial resolution of the data collected additionally the design of the sensor system components may open opportunities for citizen participation in future studies 4 2 future directions the authors have completed work to further improve the stemflow sensing system incorporating a radio transmitter into each sensing node and a stand alone internet gateway node which will allow for near real time monitoring of study sites under this design a number of individual sensor nodes are able to communicate wirelessly over large distances up to 1 km with clear line of sight by relaying data between one another via a mesh network this relay of data allows for individual sensors to be placed beyond the range of the gateway node so long as they are able to communicate with at least one other sensor node the gateway node consists of an inexpensive single board computer which collates measurement data from the network adds timestamp information and transmits it over the internet to a central repository the gateway node also serves as a command and control point for the sensors measurement accuracy and precision have not been affected by these changes to the system initial trials using the wireless system have been promising however further trials are needed to ensure stability this expansion of the system will allow for much larger spatial coverage and real time remote monitoring the cost of the radio transmitter is roughly equivalent to that of the gps in the sensor nodes as reported previously making them similarly costed for deployment additional costs with the expanded system will come from the cost of the gateway node and network infrastructure 5 conclusion the stemflow sensing system developed and evaluated in this work overcomes key challenges of current stemflow measurement methods by leveraging contactless measurement in the sensing system design the sensing system can increase the temporal resolution of stemflow measurements beyond what is available from tipping bucket gauges the resulting time series of stemflow volumes has a measurement frequency of 10 seconds which may be able to be reduced by optimizing the data pre processing that was implemented on the sensor system s arduino with the addition of networking technology the sensing system can potentially stream data to a web repository in near real time via the internet this would permit remote monitoring of the health of the network and scheduling field work for remote deployments which can significantly reduce personnel costs finally by taking advantage of the low cost electronic components and substantial on line resources supporting the maker movement the sensor system developed here can be constructed and deployed for substantially less cost than could a similarly sized network of tipping bucket gauges as evidenced in the case study data collected by a large deployment of the sensing system developed in this work has the potential to provide the high spatial and temporal resolution data necessary to explore the role of tree and storm structure in partitioning rainfall destined for terrestrial and atmospheric sinks in vegetated environments research that is

total volume of stemflow is dependent on the rainfall depth threshold required for stemflow initiation and the rate and continuity of flow once stemflow has begun see park and hattori 2002 carlyle

the temporal dynamics of this understory precipitation input at the intra storm time scale levia 2004 van stan et al 2011 van stan et al 2016 cayuela et al 2018 the common method of measuring stemflow involves affixing halved tubing around the bole of a tree forming a collar which then captures stemflow and routes it to a storage reservoir for subsequent measurement this collar reservoir method has changed little since this water input was first quantified over a century ago ebermayer 1873 zon 1927 see horton 1919 and is limited in that it only generates a single storm total stemflow volume as such no insight into the storm conditions leading up to stemflow initiation or how this flux varies in response to changing storm conditions can be deduced using this measurement methodology in attempt to resolve the intra storm dynamics of stemflow generation both tipping bucket rain gauges and flow meters have been utilized e g van stan et al 2011 cayuela et al 2018 shimizu et al 2018 these gauges offer the ability to collect valuable data regarding stemflow generation throughout an event however they suffer from systematic mechanical errors due to the rate of water delivery to the bucket device thus requiring calibration calder and kidd 1978 ziegler et al 2009 iida et al 2018 random errors including the clogging of the gauge outflow orifice to the bucket mechanism sevruk 1996 shedekar et al 2016 keim and link 2018 moderate temporal resolutions typically 5 minutes iida et al 2012 and intuitively the relatively high expense of tipping bucket gauges limits the number of trees that can be sampled additionally since the time lag between the start of stemflow and the first tip can only be crudely estimated using tipping bucket rain and flow gauges determining the timing of stemflow initiation and the threshold rainfall depth required for that flow initiation lacks precision when these gauge types are used this study develops a stemflow monitoring system that can provide high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of stemflow rate as well as the depth of rainfall required for stemflow to begin the design and deployment of a single sensor capable of measuring volumetric flow rate of stemflow at a frequency of 0 1 hz a significant increase in temporal resolution compared to storm scale or even 5 minute averages is described the relatively low cost and autonomous nature of the sensor allows for a greater number of trees to be sampled on a given budget compared to using tipping bucket gauges and when compared to the collar reservoir method a more efficient post storm measurement stemflow additionally the introduced sensor allows for the discreet measurement of storm stemflow over multiple events something not possible with the collar reservoir method 2 methods the stemflow sensor deployed in this work was constructed using low cost readily available electronics components and construction materials the objectives of the study included developing a system which was capable of remote monitoring of stemflow dynamics as well as being scalable to large spatial deployments the system was designed in a manner which allows it to be reproduced adapted or enhanced the sensor node is an autonomous device that can be deployed at the base of a tree to measure the stemflow generated during a rain event based on the rate of change of water depth in a collection vessel over time as illustrated in fig 1 the sensor node is composed of a stemflow collection vessel stilling well and sensor housing stemflow is routed from the tree into the collection vessel via a stemflow collar wrapped around the tree bole the stilling well constructed from 20 cm schedule 40 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs pipe provides a relatively quiescent pool for depth measurements to be made by an ultrasonic rangefinder positioned above the pool the sensor node s electronic components are integrated into a weatherproof sensor housing constructed from a 10x10x10 cm polyvinyl chloride pvc weatherproof junction box e987nr carlton gross automation wi usa located at the top of the stilling well shaft although not illustrated in fig 1 power for the sensor node is provided by a 12 v 20 amp deep cycle battery charged by a 20 w solar panel this power supply is sufficient to power the sensor indefinitely at the latitude where testing of this equipment was performed at the core of the sensor node is an arduino uno microcontroller arduino uno arduino cc ivrea italy a programmable device designed to handle electronic signals from the sensors with minimal processing overhead arduino is an open source hardware project that has created a hardware design and programming interface that is offered to the user community free of cost to construct and or customize preassembled microcontrollers such as the one used in this work can also be purchased not only does the open source philosophy lead to a low cost microcontroller but it also has fostered the growth of a massive user community providing on line resources supporting users with technical information tutorials and electronics design assistance that significantly lowers the barriers to entry when designing electronics d ausilio 2012 fisher and gould 2012 pallugna et al 2013 hund et al 2016 the arduino uno in the sensor system manages data collection by a sensor payload consisting of an ultrasonic rangefinder and a wetness sensor data preprocessing as well as data logging using an sd card and gps for precision time stamping the sensor system employs an ultrasonic rangefinder for stemflow volume measurement because remote sensing is less prone to mechanical failure than methods requiring direct interaction with the collected stemflow the ultrasonic rangefinder hr lv ez3 maxbotix inc mn usa integrated into the sensor system has a minimum measurement distance of 300 mm a measurement resolution of 1 mm and employs an integrated temperature compensation within an operating range of 15 c to 65 c to overcome variations in the speed of sound in air due to variations in temperature the ultrasonic range measurements however are subject to two primary sources of measurement error liquid motion within the collection vessel and environmental sources of ultrasonic noise although the stilling well was used to reduce the motion of stemflow within the collection vessel it did not eliminate all surface variability due to that liquid motion to minimize measurement error due to liquid motion within the stilling well and to address intermittent ultrasonic noise present in the deployment environment raw measurements from the ultrasonic sensor are processed using a mode filter to generate the output measurement of the sensor system the mode filter operates on a 10 second interval during which a sample of 15 raw range measurements are acquired the expected value of the range between the sensor and the liquid surface during the 10 second interval is calculated as the mode of the distribution of the sampled range measurements thus producing a 0 1 hz time series during post processing the expected liquid volume within the collection vessel is estimated from this time series by first calculating the expected liquid depth by subtracting the range measurements from the distance between the rangefinder and the bottom of the stilling well and then applying a depth to volume calibration the ultrasonic rangefinder while effective at monitoring changes in the depth of the liquid in the collection vessel over time it is not capable of detecting the instantaneous onset of stemflow entering the collection vessel nor the very small volumes often associated with the cessation of stemflow for this reason a wetness sensor fc 37 generic manufacture china located at the inlet to the collection vessel is used to estimate the time when water starts and stops flowing into the collection vessel the wetness sensor is supplied with 5 v and connected to a monitored analog input on the arduino through a 10 kω resistor the presence of water on the sensor decreases the voltage measured by the arduino the stemflow initiation and cessation times are inferred during postprocessing from the timeseries of voltage measured by the arduino a gps shield add on adafruit ultimate gps logger shield adafruit industries ny usa which integrates a real time clock module rtc a gps receiver and sd card interface was used to store data and maintain accurate time and date stamps the gps operated at an update frequency of 1 hz command and control of the gps module was managed using the adafruit gps library in order to simplify timekeeping seconds were occasionally rounded based on the millisecond value returned by the gps rounded seconds do not compound and the imprecision in time stamps never exceeds 500 ms a depth to volume calibration of the sensor system was performed prior to deployment the calibration procedure consisted of adding 5 l of water to a bucket in increments of 100 ml every 1 min after each 100 ml addition the depth of the water was estimated from sensor system range measurement the calibration procedure was repeated 10 times the data collected during the calibration procedure are illustrated in fig 2 which reveals that there is a strong linear relationship between range and volume which was modeled by linear regression to produce a depth to volume calibration curve for the sensor system this calibration curve indicates that each 1 mm increase in water depth within the bucket corresponds to a 53 ml increase in volume with a residual error of 23 ml additionally the y intercept of the calibration curve reveals that first 100 ml is not detected by the ultrasonic range measurement which is likely attributed to the slightly convex surface of the bottom of the 19 l bucket used for the collection vessel 3 case study 3 1 study tree and sensor system deployment the performance of the sensor system developed in this study for capturing intra storm dynamics of stemflow generation was evaluated by monitor the stemflow generated by an ornamental juvenile green ash fraxinus pennsylvanica marshall tree located on the thompson rivers university campus in kamloops british columbia canada 50 40 25 2 n 120 21 49 7 w elevation of 499 m above mean sea level the ash tree selected for this study stands alone and is separated from potential obstructions e g other trees or buildings by a minimum horizontal distance equal to twice the height of the potential obstruction the tree s height and diameter at breast height dbh during the study period were 7 4 m and 10 8 cm respectively given the tree size and the typical precipitation patterns of kamloops this tree is expected to generate moderate stemflow during rainfall events schooling and carlyle moses 2015 a meteorological station u30 nrc sys c onset computer corp ma usa with a tipping bucket rain gauge tb4 hyquest solutions liverpool nsw aus was deployed within 40 m of the tree in an open clearing the tipping bucket rain gauge with a resolution of 0 1 mm tip 1 was sited in observance of appropriate setbacks from nearby obstructions the location of the instrumented ash tree and the meteorological station and tipping bucket rain gauge are illustrated in fig 3 to ensure temporal consistency the internal clocks on the meteorological station and the sensor system were synchronized to the internet clock of the sensor system measurements of stemflow and corresponding meteorological data were made over a two month period extending from may 4 to july 4 2016 inclusive the deployed sensor system is depicted in fig 4 stemflow from the tree was collected by a stemflow collar wrapped twice around the tree at approximately 1 5 m above ground level the stemflow collar was constructed from a length of flexible corrugated pvc tubing that was cut in half prior to being fastened to the tree once attached the portion of the collar abutting the tree was covered with silicone caulk to ensure a water tight joint the end of the collar was attached to an unmodified short length of the same tubing which directed stemflow into the collection vessel the collection vessel used in this study was a standard 19 l high density polyethylene hdpe construction bucket a large hdpe storage tote was used to contain the collection vessel and a box containing the lead acid battery powering the sensor system the tote was covered with a plywood lid to which the solar panel was mounted and through which the 1 m long stilling well protruded all connections between the stilling well and the plywood lid were sealed using electrical duct seal putty 3 2 rainfall and stemflow characteristics over the study period during the two month study period a total of 80 4 mm of rain fell being distributed over 17 events mean 4 7 mm median 3 7 mm ranging from event depths of 0 2 mm june 11 to 14 3 mm 26 27 may table 1 the cumulative manually measured stemflow volume was 10 150 l stemflow was not observed for those rain events whose depths were 1 3 mm the relationship between stemflow volume s f l and rain depth p g mm for those events 1 3 mm was found to be linear fig 5 with the equation of the line being 1 s f 0 173 p g 0 271 r 2 0 532 n 11 from eq 1 the threshold rain depth required for stemflow initiation is estimated at 1 6 mm while the mean stemflow rate once flow was initiated across these 11 events is estimated at 0 173 l mm 1 of rain however the results from the sensor for four storms suggests that both the threshold rain depth and mean event flow rate are highly dynamic with the threshold rain depth ranging from 0 9 to 3 7 mm and the event mean stemflow rate varying from 0 009 to 0 444 l mm 1 of rain see table 1 3 3 in depth evaluation of the stemflow sensor system during a single event the may 4 event was selected as an exemplar of the potential of the sensing system developed in this study for this event the sensor node performed as expected with negligible errors it also happened to be an event of significance due to the low stemflow initiation rainfall depth 0 9 mm as compared to other events the sensor continued to perform as expected for the following three events unexpected errors with time stamps and anomalies in the ultrasonic data invalidated many of the following storms the may 21 event demonstrated the anomalous measurements of the ultrasonic sensor table 1 shows that the sensor grossly overestimated the volume of stemflow this error stemmed from a combination of low water volume the sensor is imprecise at volumes under 114 ml environmental noise and improper alignment of the sensor housing it was periodically measuring the distance to the wall of the stilling well these errors were addressed however but not until the after the field season was completed the may 4 event delivered a total of 5 0 mm of rainfall over 4 93 h the hyetograph measured by the on site rain gauge is illustrated in fig 6 and shows that the peak 5 minute rainfall intensity 13 5 mm h 1 during this storm occurred 2 80 h after the rain began the storm start time was estimated based on wetness sensors attached to the meteorological station data from the wetness sensor integrated into the sensor system are plotted in fig 7 as a time series consisting of measurements taken at 10 s intervals assuming the first drop in voltage recorded by the wetness sensor indicates stemflow initiation these data suggest that stemflow initiates approximately 50 min into the event after a total of 0 9 mm of rain had fallen observed fluctuations in the voltage drop recorded by the stemflow sensor are likely due to changes in stemflow rate and or splashing of stemflow as it was routed into the collection vessel prior to analysis the ultrasonic range measurements from the sensor system were processed by kalman smoothing to further reduce noise in the range time series following smoothing stemflow volumes were computed from the range time series using the distance to volume calibration developed prior to deployment the cumulative stemflow volume derived from this procedure is plotted alongside the cumulative rainfall volume measured by the tipping bucket rain gauge in fig 8 from fig 8 stemflow appears to follow the same general pattern as rainfall albeit with stemflow initiating approximately 1 h into the event and ultimately ending within 20 min of rainfall cessation towards the end of the storm the stemflow curve appears to take a slight negative slope indicating a loss of liquid in the collection vessel this phenomenon is likely due to variation in the range measurements from the ultrasonic rangefinder the total volume of stemflow collected by the sensor 2 101 l 23 ml during the event was estimated using the volume measured by the sensor system when stemflow ceased cessation indicated by the wetness sensor integrated into the sensor system physical measurement of the volume of liquid within the stemflow collection vessel after the may 4 storm revealed a total volume of 1 820 l indicating good agreement between the remotely sensed measurement of the sensor system and a physical measurement of the same quantity 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the stemflow sensor the may 4 2016 event was chosen to demonstrate the type of process questions that are enabled by data collected utilizing the stemflow sensing system developed in this work the wetness sensor was not used to infer the stemflow cessation time because once wetted the wetness sensor must dry off completely e g via evaporation before it will return to a 5 v measurement given its high temporal resolution and ability to identify stemflow initiation and approximate cessation times the data collected by the stemflow monitoring system developed in this work presents an opportunity to link stemflow dynamics to meteorological conditions such as wind speed and direction monitored by a nearby meteorological station understanding how storm dynamics affect stemflow is valuable when modelling how a given plant canopy will affect the water budget of a localized region such as the base of a tree tanaka et al 1996 levia and germer 2015 meteorological factors such as rainfall inclination drop size and velocity wind direction and velocity and rainfall intensity all affect initiation cessation and volume of stemflow germer et al 2010 van stan et al 2011 van stan et al 2014 carlyle moses and schooling 2015 the stemflow sensing system developed in this work provides 10 second resolution stemflow measurements which have the potential to improve models attempting to forecast stemflow dynamics based on meteorological drivers for example based on the sensor system deployed in the case study it was determined that although stemflow initiation lagged approximately 1 h behind the rainfall the dynamics of the stemflow were found to exhibit a similar temporal pattern as the rainfall that generated it and the stemflow ceased within 20 minutes of the end of the event increases in spatial resolution are also needed to better model the influence of storm dynamics upon stemflow common practices such as manual measurements are labor intensive making them difficult to scale up to a larger sample of trees while maintaining the ability to collect data in a timely manner increasing spatial resolution of stemflow data by instrumenting a larger sample of trees could potentially open further avenues of inquiry into such questions as the effects of topography canopy density influences or physiological variations across a species electromechanical sensors e g tipping bucket gauges currently used to monitor stemflow do reduce the labor required to monitor a larger sample of trees however at a significant financial cost the sensing system developed in this work was designed to not only reduce the total labor required to scale to a larger sample of trees but to also do so at a low cost approaching this project from a maker point of view will allow it to be adopted and used more widely while replication and improvement are core tenets of scientific research the maker approach to design and production is instrumental in opening the project to an audience beyond the academic community hobbyist grade electronics are widely available and affordable allowing for the overall cost of the platform to remain low approximately 350 cad 270 usd at present time per system lower costs allow for more sensor systems to be deployed which increases the potential spatial resolution of the data collected additionally the design of the sensor system components may open opportunities for citizen participation in future studies 4 2 future directions the authors have completed work to further improve the stemflow sensing system incorporating a radio transmitter into each sensing node and a stand alone internet gateway node which will allow for near real time monitoring of study sites under this design a number of individual sensor nodes are able to communicate wirelessly over large distances up to 1 km with clear line of sight by relaying data between one another via a mesh network this relay of data allows for individual sensors to be placed beyond the range of the gateway node so long as they are able to communicate with at least one other sensor node the gateway node consists of an inexpensive single board computer which collates measurement data from the network adds timestamp information and transmits it over the internet to a central repository the gateway node also serves as a command and control point for the sensors measurement accuracy and precision have not been affected by these changes to the system initial trials using the wireless system have been promising however further trials are needed to ensure stability this expansion of the system will allow for much larger spatial coverage and real time remote monitoring the cost of the radio transmitter is roughly equivalent to that of the gps in the sensor nodes as reported previously making them similarly costed for deployment additional costs with the expanded system will come from the cost of the gateway node and network infrastructure 5 conclusion the stemflow sensing system developed and evaluated in this work overcomes key challenges of current stemflow measurement methods by leveraging contactless measurement in the sensing system design the sensing system can increase the temporal resolution of stemflow measurements beyond what is available from tipping bucket gauges the resulting time series of stemflow volumes has a measurement frequency of 10 seconds which may be able to be reduced by optimizing the data pre processing that was implemented on the sensor system s arduino with the addition of networking technology the sensing system can potentially stream data to a web repository in near real time via the internet this would permit remote monitoring of the health of the network and scheduling field work for remote deployments which can significantly reduce personnel costs finally by taking advantage of the low cost electronic components and substantial on line resources supporting the maker movement the sensor system developed here can be constructed and deployed for substantially less cost than could a similarly sized network of tipping bucket gauges as evidenced in the case study data collected by a large deployment of the sensing system developed in this work has the potential to provide the high spatial and temporal resolution data necessary to explore the role of tree and storm structure in partitioning rainfall destined for terrestrial and atmospheric sinks in vegetated environments research that is

6693,surface water supply for a watershed relies on local water generated from precipitation and water connections with other watersheds these connections are confined by topography and infrastructure and respond diversely to stressors such as climate change population growth increasing energy and water demands this study presents an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections i e stream flows inter basin water transfers water withdrawals and return flows among the 2099 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc 8 watersheds across the conterminous united states the framework is then applied to investigate the potential impacts of changes in climate and water use on regional water availability and water stress the ratio of demand to supply our projections suggest that highly water stressed areas may expand from 14 to 18 and the stressed population would increase from 19 to 24 by 2070 2099 climate change mitigation practices e g energy structure reform technology innovation could largely offset these trends by reducing demand and enhancing supply at the watershed scale the spatially inhomogeneous responses to future changes suggest that regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations due to the redistribution of water resources and diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies in different source areas however the detrimental future changes e g depleting river discharges larger demands of water withdrawal may aggravate conflicts over water rights among regions and challenge our current water infrastructure system this study provides new insights into the critical role of regional water connectivity in water supply security and highlights the increasing need for integrated monitoring and management of water resources at various spatial levels in a changing world keywords water stress water connectivity climate change upstream flow water transfer water consumption 1 introduction changing environments and growing populations have stressed water resources both globally and in the united states foti et al 2012 kiguchi et al 2015 scherer et al 2015 a measure commonly used to quantify water stress is the ratio of water demand i e offstream water use to water supply i e water resources available to humans richey et al 2015 sun et al 2008 water stress is constantly changing with environmental and anthropogenic dynamics such as the changes in population vörösmarty et al 2000 economy and energy structure moore et al 2015 water use efficiency maupin et al 2014 and magnitude and variability of river discharges sagarika et al 2014 climate change poses an additional threat to water resources security there is evidence that the warming climate enhances evapotranspiration et and causes surface drying and subsequent depletion in water storage on the surface of the earth duan et al 2016 jackson et al 2005 water demand on the other hand could also be sensitive to climate change and the associated changes in environment such as the rising temperature sailor and pavlova 2003 increasing co2 concentration elliott et al 2014 and intensified drought döll et al 2015 sun et al 2015a it is becoming increasingly important to assess the vulnerability of water supply to global change so that management strategies can be developed to cope with a highly uncertain future alcamo et al 2000 ipcc 2014 watershed level surface water supply consists of local water i e surface and shallow subsurface runoff generated within each watershed that equals the difference between precipitation and et at a multi annual scale and the amount of water accumulated from upstream river networks or transferred by artificial aqueducts compared to water resources generated from local precipitation the non local waters are not only restricted by the topography and infrastructure but also susceptible to environmental changes and human activities in source areas e g drought water contamination consumptive use although there have been a few studies assessing water stress in the u s under future climate little attention has been paid to the role of water connectivity among regions some of the previous studies weighed water demand against supply at large basin scale e g the u s was divided into 98 basins in foti et al 2012 and 99 basins in blanc et al 2014 coarse scale evaluation tends to underestimate stress by averaging the withdrawals and supply data oki et al 2001 vörösmarty et al 2000 and the water movement in hydrologically connected areas is also masked given the lack of local control over upstream flow some recent studies projected water availability and stress from a local perspective for example devineni et al 2015 used local precipitation at the county level to estimate renewable water supply and evaluated water stress as the ratio of water deficit i e demand minus supply to average rainfall roy et al 2012 estimated renewable regional water supply with the available precipitation defined as the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration these studies have shown merits in improving spatiotemporal resolutions and accounting for uncertainties with more sophisticated risk assessment approaches however the potential variations in water exchange among different areas were not considered and consequently the impact of climate change on water stress could be over or under estimated this study aims to establish an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections among the 2099 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc 8 watersheds http water usgs gov gis huc html across the conterminous united states conus and use it to investigate regional water availability and water stress in historical and future scenarios specifically our goal is 1 to investigate the role of water connections among watersheds i e stream flows in river channels artificial water transfers water withdrawals and return flows in distributing water supply 2 to project the responses of water stress to climate change socioeconomic status associated with climate change and mitigation practices over the course of the 21st century and 3 to examine the relative importance of driving factors from demand and supply aspects in impacting water stress at a high spatial resolution 2 methods 2 1 hydrologic unit system and water connections the hydrologic unit system developed by the united states geological survey usgs includes six levels of hydrologic units each unit is identified by a unique code consisting of two to twelve digits the first level of classification divides the conus into 18 2 digit huc areas which are commonly referred to as water resource regions wrrs fig 1 a these regions can be further divided into 2099 8 digit huc watersheds the full lists and boundaries of hydrologic units at different levels can be found in the watershed boundary dataset https datagateway nrcs usda gov the geospatial attributes of streams at different levels can be obtained from the national hydrography dataset http nhd usgs gov data html we assumed that the outlet of each watershed i e the inlet of the next downstream watershed was the exiting reach with the greatest cumulative drainage area within the watershed and thus identified a total of 18 777 upstream downstream connections among huc 8 watersheds caldwell et al 2012 emanuel et al 2015 we categorized the 2099 huc 8 watersheds into four types to specify the potential sources of water supply duan et al 2018 1 headwater watershed including 907 43 watersheds that are connected to downstream only 2 midstream watershed including 779 37 watersheds that are connected to both upstream and downstream 3 terminus watershed including 94 5 watersheds that are connected to upstream only 4 isolated watershed including 319 15 watersheds that are not connected to either upstream or downstream it can be assumed that only midstream and terminus watersheds would receive natural flows from upstream an addition of 228 artificial connections were identified based on historical inter basin water transfers ibts reported by petsch 1985 and mooty and jeffcoat 1986 a total of 22 billion m3 water per year has been transferred based on records from 1973 to 1982 which only accounts for 1 of total water supply in the entire conus duan et al 2018 however these ibts ranging from 500 m3 to 4 billion m3 per year have played an important role in securing regional water supply e g san joaquin and colorado transfers for southern california delaware hudson transfer for new york city and have widely impacted streamflow in areas downstream of the watersheds supplying receiving ibts fig 1b 2 2 projection of water supply water supply was simulated dynamically at huc 8 scale based on hydro climatic modeling and the water connections among watersheds first hydrologic processes within each watershed was modeled under historical and future climate scenarios second water demand and consumptive use were projected at each county by water use sectors and rescaled to huc

sensing products of et and ecosystem productivity sun et al 2011 sun et al 2015b suggest that wassi can achieve an acceptable modeling accuracy with respect of both water and carbon fluxes at broad

approaches and results of water balance components derived from these climate datasets can be found in a previous study duan et al 2017b 2 2 2 streamflow routing and regional water supply the total available surface water supply total flow tf for a watershed was simulated as 1 tf l f i 1 n uf i i 1 n u wc i i b t where local flow lf equals the runoff generated within the target watershed which can be interpreted as precipitation p minus et and changes in soil moisture sm and hydrologically connected snowpack sp 2 lf p e t d s m d t d s p d t i 1 n uf i is the sum of runoff accumulated from all the connected upstream watersheds while i 1 n u wc i represents the sum of water consumption in these watersheds that equals water withdrawals minus return flows water withdrawals and consumptive uses were assumed to occur uniformly in each watershed the residuals of upstream flow after consumptive uses were assumed to be discharged simultaneously to surface water at the inlet of the next downstream watershed in the cases that the accumulated streamflow cannot meet the demand the actual water withdrawal was set to equal the maximum water availability and consumptive use and the return flow discharged to downstream were downsized with the same ratio the watersheds supplying ibts were assumed to meet the need of water transfer before local withdrawal magnitudes of the ibts were also reduced to the maximum water availability in the cases of water deficit and the same ratio was implemented for all the transfers if a watershed was supplying ibts to multiple watersheds the regulations of dams and reservoirs were not included in this study because most of these facilities are operated on seasonal or monthly basis while this study aims to provide a long term projection at annual and decadal scales 2 3 projection of water withdrawal and consumption projection of future water demand was based on the extrapolation of past trends and the estimates of demographic economic and climatic forces on water uses national water use data from 1950 to 2010 by 5 year interval county level data is available from 1985 to 2010 were obtained from the usgs water census reports

three sectors accounted for 84 of the total surface freshwater withdrawal in the conus i e 50 thermoelectric 28 irrigation and 6 domestic maupin et al 2014 county level withdrawal and consumption in the other sectors including livestock aquaculture industrial and mining were included but were assumed to remain at the same levels as 2010 through the 21st century the ratios of surface freshwater withdrawal to total water withdrawal i e surface freshwater plus groundwater and saline water were assumed to remain constant 2 3 1 domestic use per capita domestic water use in the u s has been relatively stable since 1990 maupin et al 2014 but the total domestic water demand is likely to further increase if population grows in this study per capita domestic water withdrawal and consumption in each county were assumed to remain at the same levels as in 2010 domestic uses in the future were estimated by multiplying the per capita use in 2010 by the population projected for the period of 2010 2100 the proportions of public and self supplied domestic uses were also assumed to be constant over time population projections in the 3109 counties over the conus were obtained from the

b1 global environmental sustainability and b2 local environmental sustainability outputs under b1 and a2 scenarios which are comparable to the emission scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 used in the fifth ipcc report were used to represent the low and high population projections respectively 2 3 2 thermoelectric use thermoelectric water demand was estimated as total thermoelectric power generation

by 32 until 2030 and an extension of tax credits for renewable energy currently under review https www epa gov economic and cost analysis air pollution regulations regulatory impact analysis review clean power the power generation data for each emm region was linearly extrapolated forward from 2041 to 2099 using the average rates of change in 2010 2040 the regional data was then disaggregated to huc 8 watersheds based on two assumptions roy et al 2012 1 the increase decrease in power generation only occurs in watersheds with existing thermoelectric plants and 2 the same changing rate against the 2010 level is applied to all the watersheds within each emm region we did not consider the additional impact of climate warming on electricity demand for air conditioning because 1 the electricity demand did not show a clear correlation with climatic drivers at the national scale according to the eia datasets and 2 future behavioral responses to climate change may be largely affected by the evolving air conditioning technology and market saturation sailor 2001 sailor and pavlova 2003 water use per kwh has been decreasing in recent decades due to the improvement of technology especially the movement from once through or open loop to recirculation or closed loop cooling system once through cooling accounted for 94 of total water withdrawals and 47 of power generation in 2010 while plants with recirculation systems generated the other 53 power with only 6 withdrawal maupin et al 2014 this decreasing trend in per kwh withdrawal is likely to continue in the foreseeable future as industry regulations will continue to encourage cooling systems with lower withdrawal requirements however it should be noted that the water consumption of a recirculation system is generally larger than that of a once through system higher consumption is expected under future scenarios with a larger share of power plants converting to a recirculation system even though water withdrawal is projected to decrease feeley et al 2008 the projections conducted by the national energy technology laboratory netl 2011 suggested that total water consumption would increase between 2010 and 2035 under all of the five scenarios accounting for different additions and retirements of thermoelectric generating capacity and cooling systems including once through recirculation and dry cooling systems we used the average changing rates of water withdrawal per kwh and water consumption per unit withdrawal under these five scenarios to represent the future changes from 2010 to 2035 and extrapolated these trends forward to 2099 by emm region similar to the disaggregation of power generation the same changing rates against the baseline level in 2010 was applied to all the watersheds with existing thermoelectric plants within each emm region 2 3 3 irrigation use irrigation water demand was calculated as irrigated area multiplying irrigation use per unit area i e irrigation efficiency considering the changing needs for agricultural crops and the increasing evaporative demand caused by warming future irrigation water demand wi is estimated by the changes against the 2010

to represent the potential changes in irrigated area a and irrigation efficiency η without the impact of climate change as 4 α a η a 2010 η 2010 irrigated area and irrigation efficiency are affected by a complex mixture of socioeconomic factors such as agricultural policies irrigation technology and crop market due to the lack of local level information on these factors we used the wrr level projections suggested by brown et al 2013 and assumed that changes in irrigated area and irrigation water demand would only occur in watersheds with existing irrigated agriculture based on the historical records of irrigated area irrigation water withdrawal and distribution of irrigation systems e g surface flood sprinkler and micro irrigation from the usgs brown et al 2013 extrapolated the past trends and developed two sets of estimates for the east wrr 1 9 and west wrr 10 18 of the conus the majority of the total irrigation withdrawals occurred in 17 western states e g nebraska california idaho where annual precipitation was less than 20 in maupin et al 2014 irrigated area in the west is projected to continue the decreasing trend begun in the 1980s the improvements in irrigation efficiency have caused a notable decline in the irrigation withdrawals both in the west and for the entire conus sprinkler and drip irrigation have already been widely used in the west but finer micro irrigation techniques or new methods may be developed as a response to the aggravated water deficit in a warmer future in the east irrigated area is projected to continue to increase but at a decreasing rate and sprinkler and drip systems are expected to gradually replace surface flooding in humid states the combination of the changes in irrigated area and irrigation efficiency will cause the α coefficient to decrease in the west but increase in the east inet is estimated by the difference between evaporative demand and supply döll 2002 döll and siebert 2002 as 5 i net k c p e t

month growing season from april to september the mean monthly p and pet during the growing season were used to estimate pe and inet the future changes in plant species and cropping structure and the potential lengthening shortening of the growing season caused by climate change were not considered the impact of changing irrigation methods on irrigation water consumption is not entirely clear and difficult to quantify without on site observations however there has been rising concern that the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies e g from flood to drip which requires less water to be withdrawn could also cause larger consumptive rates and reduce valuable return flows ward and pulido velazquez 2008 for example hu et al 2017 found a strong inverse linear correlation r 0 99 p 0 01 between irrigation return flow coefficient return flow water applied and irrigation efficiency in an experimental cotton plantation therefore we assumed that water consumption per unit area would remain at the same levels as in 2010 in irrigated areas i e water consumption per unit withdrawal would increase accordingly as the updates of irrigation system decrease withdrawal per unit area 2 4 water stress evaluation 2 4 1 stress indices and classification two indices of water stress were used to address the sufficiency of local and non local water resources in meeting water demand duan et al 2018 local water stress lws defined as the ratio of wd to lf global water stress gws defined as the ratio of wd to tf water stress is usually considered high when the ratio of withdrawal to supply exceeds 0 4 due to the concern that water demands for instream uses such as navigation hydropower generation and ecological and environmental demands should also be met oki et al 2001 richey et al 2015 vörösmarty et al 2000 we here further define three levels of stress using 0 4 as the threshold value including unstressed represents a condition without water stress that local water resource alone can suffice the demand identified if lws 0 4 upstream stressed represents a condition that sufficient water supply is dependent on the availability of upstream water or water transferred though artificial aqueducts identified if lws 0 4 gws 0 4 overstressed represents a condition with high water stress even when water supply is complemented by upstream water or transferred water identified if gws 0 4 2 4 2 scenarios of water stress we reconciled the datasets of population electricity generation climate and water uses from different sources to provide a projection of future water demand supply and stress at the huc 8 level although the underlying assumptions of these datasets are not entirely consistent they are all closely related to climate change and the associated mitigation measures we focused on two future scenarios of water stress in our analysis table 1 1 intermediate stress is driven by population under b1 climate under rcp4 5 and power generation with the cpp and 2 high stress hs driven by population under a2 climate under rcp8 5 and power generation without the cpp the is and hs scenarios represent a future with and without climate change mitigation strategies respectively the average ibt magnitudes derived from the data in 1973 1982 were used through all of the time periods under both future scenarios the historical scenario 1981 2010 based on the prism climate data and usgs water use census reports was used as a benchmark for identifying changes in the future 2 4 3 attribution of potential changes in water stress the potential changes in gws are attributed to the impacts of water demand wd and total water supply tf as 7 δ g w s 1 tf δ w d wd tf 2 δ t f wd tf 3 δ t f 2 where δgws is the change in the ratio of wd tf 1 tf δ w d is the contribution of wd change the sum of the second and third terms on the right side of the equation is the contribution of tf change feng and fu 2013 the demand contribution is further attributed to water use sectors of domestic thermoelectric and irrigation while the supply contribution is attributed to changes in local flow lf upstream flow uf and upstream water consumption uwc by their weights in tf change 3 results 3 1 projected changes in water demand supply and stress 3 1 1 national scale the conus population is projected to increase from 310 to 392 and 669 million under the sres b1 and a2 scenarios by 2099 respectively consequently domestic water demand fig 2 a is projected to increase from 2 1010 to 2 7 1010 is and 4 9 1010 m3 hs from 2011 to 2099 with a quarter of the withdrawn water being consumed fig 2b thermoelectric power generation is projected to drop between 2010 and early 2020s due to the growing role of renewable energy e g solar wind geothermal the decreasing trend is expected to continue under the cpp scenario and result in a reduction in thermoelectric withdrawal from 1 4 1011 2011 to 1 1 1011 m3 2099 fig 2c however under the scenario without the cpp the total thermoelectric water use is likely to increase again after 2020s because of the increasing electricity demand and exceed the 2010 level in the 2070s in spite of the decreasing per kwh withdrawal water consumption in the thermoelectric sector fig 2d will increase from 9 109 in 2011 to 1 1 1010 m3 in 2099 with the cpp as a result of the rising consumption rate whereas a more significant increase by 5 109 m3 from 9 109 to 1 4 1010 m3 is projected under the scenario without the cpp projections of irrigation use fig 2e show highly diverse variations among the climate models multi model means under rcp4 5 suggest relatively smaller changes in irrigation withdrawal and consumption fluctuating around 9 1010 m3 and 5 1010 m3 respectively meanwhile clear increasing trends are projected under rcp8 5 with withdrawal and consumption reaching 1 4 1011 m3 and 7 1010 m3 by the end of this century combining the projected changes in domestic thermoelectric and irrigation withdrawals total water demand in the conus fig 3 a is projected to increase from 3 2 1011 m3 in 2010 to 3 8 1011 m3 in 2099 under the hs scenario conversely a notable reduction by 0 5 1011 m3 in total demand is expected under the is scenario due to the decrease in thermoelectric withdrawal on the other hand total water supply the sum of annual lf over the conus fig 3b derived from the ensemble mean of multiple climate models shows a slight decrease under both is 3 108 m3 yr 1 r2 0 01 and hs 1 109 m3 yr 1 r2 0 11 judging by the multi decadal average in 2070 2099 significantly larger demand 7 6 1010 m3 yr 1 and smaller supply 8 0 1010 m3 yr 1 are projected under the hs than that under the is it should be kept in mind that these multi model means can only represent hydrologic responses to the averaged climate forcings in the future the natural climate fluctuations and the uncertainties in climate models lead to large variability in annual water supply and demand e g supply and demand respectively vary between 1 4 3 2 1012 m3 and 2 4 4 7 1011 m3 in 2099 overall water stress ratio of total demand to total supply fig 3c is projected to change divergently under the two future scenarios results of multi model means suggest that water stress is likely to fall between 0 13 and 0 15 in most of the years under the is scenario 6 10 5 yr 1 r2 0 03 however a pronounced rise from 0 15 in 2011 to 0 19 in 2099 is expected under the hs scenario 5 10 4 yr 1 r2 0 67 driven by the increasing demand and decreasing supply the highest stress over 0 39 was found in the projections based on the bcc csm1 1 m climate model these differences between the results under the is and hs scenarios suggest that the implementation of emission mitigation measures including the cpp program and other socio economic developments associated with sres and rcp scenarios would largely alleviate water stress from both demand and supply aspects 3 1 2 watershed scale fig 4 shows the spatial variation of multi decadal changes in water demand wd and supply tf from 1981 to 2010 to 2070 2099 multi model mean and consensus among the climate models were used to evaluate the future changes and associated uncertainties an increase or decrease is considered significant i e high consensus when results derived from over 80 of the climate models agree on the changing sign under the is a significant decrease in wd will occur in over half of all the watersheds while an increase is projected to scatter in another one fifth of the watersheds areas with an increasing wd are expected to expand significantly to cover one third of the conus under the hs tf change shows extensive decreases in the western and central regions wrr 10 18 and high consensus is found in 864 and 850 out of the 2099 watersheds under the is and hs scenarios significant increases in tf are mainly found in the east wrr 1 6 and pacific coast wrr 17 pacific northwest and cover 17 23 of the conus high consensus on gws change fig 5 a c is projected in 1520 587 increases and 933 decreases and 1472 833 increases and 639 decreases watersheds under the is and hs scenarios respectively under the is decreasing gws covers a majority of the eastern conus while a significant increase can be mainly found in the west the coverage of increasingly stressed area is expected to be clearly larger under the hs and fewer decreases in stress are also projected in the east in particular a noticeable shift from increase to decrease in tf and from decrease to increase in gws can be found across the south wrr 12 texas gulf and southeast wrr 3 south atlantic gulf wrr 8 lower mississippi when comparing hs to is we also compared the results of water stress interpreted by gws and lws to quantify the benefits of water produced upstream and water artificially transferred across the country fig 5d f in the historical period 12 more land area of the conus would face high stress if only local water was available a total of 743 and 951 increasingly stressed watersheds are identified by lws under the is and hs scenarios respectively which are 27 and 14 more than that by gws such results demonstrate the role of upstream water and transferred water in reducing the sensitivity of stress to future changes particularly the potential stress escalations in the western regions 3 2 contributions of the driving factors we further analyzed the contributions of demand i e domestic thermoelectric irrigation and supply i e lf uf uwc factors in altering gws from 1981 to 2010 to 2070 2099 for each watershed changes in domestic demand fig 6 a b caused by population growth and migration are identified as the largest contributor in 12 under is and 15 under hs of the conus area mostly distributed in southern california wrr 18 and the southwest wrr 12 texas gulf wrr 13 rio grande wrr 15 lower colorado the changing thermoelectric demand fig 6c d is projected to increase stress in the east wrr 1 6 and the south wrr 8 lower mississippi wrr 11 arkansas white red wrr 12 texas gulf while alleviating stress across the rest of the country domestic and thermoelectric demands tend to dominate stress changes in densely populated areas such as the metropolitan areas in texas wrr 12 and atlantic coastal regions wrr 1 3 these two driving factors are expected to be the largest in 32 34 of the conus that accounts for up to 60 64 of the population under the future scenarios future changes in irrigation water use fig 6e f are projected to aggravate stress in the east but alleviate stress in a large part of the west as intensified water shortage may lead to decrease in irrigated area and more investment in irrigation techniques in the dry west however there is still notable increase in irrigation demand across most of the country under the hs scenario lf change induced by local climate change fig 7 a b is expected to be the major cause of water stress escalation in the west wrr 10 18 and stress alleviation in the atlantic coast wrr 2 3 accounting for 24 25 of the conus 10 17 of the population the effects of lf are enhanced by the consequent changes in uf fig 7c d in watersheds involved with the river networks generally driving water stress to increase and decrease in the west and east of mississippi respectively uf change driven by the combined effects of climate change in upstream areas is recognized as the most influential factor in 15 16 of the area 9 of the population that mostly distributed across large river basins in the west such as the missouri arkansas rio grande gila and colorado rivers contrary to the impact of uf change uwc drives water stress to increase in the east as a result of the increasing water withdrawals but will counterbalance the stress escalation widely across the river basins in the west of mississippi including missouri mississippi arkansas canadian red brazos pecos rio grande and gila river basins as thermoelectric and irrigation water uses are projected to decrease in 24 29 of these watersheds 1 2 in area which is mostly scattered across the arkansas canadian and brazos river basins wrr 10 12 uwc is projected to be the most influential factor we summarized the relative importance of the driving factors in water stress change across the watersheds by the four categories of hydrologic connectivity i e headwater midstream terminus and isolated based on the multi model mean results fig 8 on average water demand contribution ranges from 55 in midstream watersheds to 70 in isolated watersheds with irrigation being the largest contributing sector across all the categories 23 32 in terms of water supply lf accounts for 30 39 of stress change in headwater and isolated watersheds meanwhile uf change is the most influential factor 21 28 for water supply in midstream and terminus watersheds followed by lf 7 10 and uwc 4 7 such results demonstrate the critical role of upstream water in securing water supply in midstream or terminus watersheds along large rivers where changes in upstream climate and water consumption could exert a much larger impact on water stress than changes in local climate a similar pattern of the six factors relative importance is projected for the two future scenarios even though much higher stress is expected in the hs scenario 3 3 changes in stress level and coverages areas that relied on non local water for adequate freshwater supply defined as upstream stressed in this study covered 10 14 of the conus through the baseline period 1981 2010 meanwhile the areal extant of overstressed areas where high water stress was observed even when water supply is complemented by upstream flows or ibts varied widely between 9 and 20 from wet years to dry years the ranges derived from the multiple climate models also suggest that much larger uncertainty is involved in the projection of overstressed coverage 5 39 than that of upstream stressed 6 15 fig 9 judging by the ensemble means of multiple gcms there will be little change in the overall stress coverage under is yet an evident expansion through this century under hs on multi decadal basis 12 and 14 of the conus area 15 and 19 of the population were identified as upstream stressed and overstressed in the baseline period the mean coverage of stressed areas is expected to remain stable in 2070 2099 under is with only a slight increase in overstressed area 15 in the meantime under hs the total stressed area is projected to reach 30 with the overstressed coverage expanding to 18 in area and 24 in population to identify the hotspot areas with potential increases or decreases in water stress level fig 10 we investigated the spatial distribution of mean multi decadal changes across the 2099 huc 8 watersheds and the consensus among results derived from different climate models areas expected to endure higher stress levels i e from unstressed to upstream stressed from upstream stressed to overstressed or directly from unstressed to overstressed are mainly distributed in the central and western conus across wrr 10 17 especially in missouri wrr 10 arkansas white red wrr 11 texas gulf wrr 12 upper colorado wrr 14 and great basin wrr 16 under hs higher stress level is also projected to occur in a few watersheds in the east on the other hand areas shifting to lower stress levels are mostly distributed in the northeast wrr 2 mid atlantic the midwest wrr 5 ohio wrr 7 upper mississippi wrr 10 missouri and the southeast wrr 3 south atlantic gulf wrr 6 tennessee in total there are 133 and 192 watersheds facing increased stress levels under the is and hs scenarios and high consensus among climate models can be found in 60 and 102 of them respectively table 2 the spatial pattern suggests that 80 87 of the transitions to overstressed are likely to occur in headwater and isolated watersheds where water supply is generally more sensitive to climate change due to the limited water source area conversely terminus watersheds are usually endowed with large amounts of upstream water and thus they are more resilient to future changes with only 4 5 shifts 2 3 with high consensus between the states of unstressed and upstream stressed expected diverse changes are expected among the midstream watersheds although the total number of midstream watersheds facing higher stress is close to that of headwater watersheds less than half of them are expected to reach the level of overstressed while the rest are increasing from unstressed to upstream stressed the projected future changes will also challenge the efficiency of current ibt projects the stress escalations in watersheds receiving ibt water table 3 particularly for a few headwater and isolated watersheds where only local water is available in the natural state indicate an increasing need for transferred water in these areas more shifts to the overstressed status 9 12 are projected in watersheds supplying ibt water the higher stress levels in these source areas are likely to compromise their capability of providing water and even trigger new conflicts over water rights 4 discussion this study aimed to explore the diverse responses of regional water demand and supply to multiple stressors and provide a reference for water planning and management in a changing world our results suggest that previous projections without concern for water connectivity among regions devineni et al 2015 foti et al 2012 roy et al 2012 could be misleading in spite of the spatial differences water supply in the conus is generally more resilient to climate change and increases in water use when non local water is taken into account this is not only because of the additional water supplies but also due to the possibly inhomogeneous changes in runoff generation and water uses in the water source areas for example the negative effects of decreasing upstream flow caused by climate change could be partially neutralized or even overwhelmed by the decreasing upstream water uses in some western basins it is important for water managers to understand that the status of water connectivity among regions are not always stationary over time climate change may cause a depletion in upstream water flows and larger evaporation loss during water uses while the increases in population energy demand and irrigation area will impact the quantity and quality of water available for downstream areas current legal systems governing water allocation and water rights e g riparian rights in the east and prior appropriation in the west across the country have been developed based on historical information on water availability and demand the extensive changes in the future e g depleting river discharge larger withdrawal demand lower water level in water intake points will impose new challenges on the existing systems and the supporting infrastructure efficient water management will require a more specific identification of the potential sources of water and an integrated monitoring of their variations and the driving factors mcnulty et al 2018 this study contributes to our understanding of the critical role of water connectivity to water supply security in the u s and can help policy makers and stakeholders to better adapt to the future nevertheless long term projections are usually developed under a series of assumptions and thus inevitably involve various uncertainties in the datasets and results for simplicity the analysis presented in this paper is limited to a few of the most important factors we here address the uncertainties and limitations inherent to the projections of water demand consumption and supplies thermoelectric and irrigation are by far the largest water use sectors and are also the major sources of uncertainty in the projections of water withdrawal and consumption we estimated future thermoelectric withdrawal based on historical trends and extrapolation of the eia s projections future shifts in energy policy and technology innovation may cause more complex changes in electricity demand energy structure and water use efficiency for example renewable energy production such as biofuels biodiesel and ethanol is expected to increase as an alternative to thermoelectric power elcock 2010 which could bring in new water requirements for irrigation and exacerbate water stress hejazi et al 2015 carbon capture and storage ccs technology is increasingly implemented to curb greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel power plants rao and rubin 2002 and the operation of plants with ccs facility also requires extra water uses besides large uncertainties are involved in the responses of irrigation areas cropping patterns and irrigation methods to various climatic political e g agricultural policies and subsidies and economic e g agricultural product markets land prices forces elliott et al 2014 wada et al 2011 webber et al 2016 it is still challenging to incorporate all the driving factors and forecast irrigation water demand and consumption rates for a specific time or location the projection of water yield and streamflow dynamics is another major source of uncertainty milly et al 2005 besides the preset assumptions involved in the emission scenarios structure and parameters of climate model hydrologic model and downscaling approach all contribute to the uncertainties to various extents as hydro climatic simulations are conducted in different contexts or at different spatiotemporal scales bae et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 duan and mei 2014 giuntoli et al 2015 kay et al 2009 in particular two caveats should be noted when interpreting our results 1 water loss in aqueducts and reservoirs water projects including reservoirs dams and aqueducts are designed to redistribute water resources spatially and temporally for securing water supply in dry areas or dry seasons however a considerable amount of water could be lost in the process through evaporation and leakage the magnitude of loss depends on many factors including background climate topography and river morphology as well as the design investment and maintenance of the infrastructure more information needs to be collected from local levels to account for the effects of these potential water losses 2 interactions between surface water and deep groundwater in this evaluation we have focused on surface water while groundwater was excluded from both the demand and supply aspects however the enhanced interactions between surface water and groundwater caused by human activities could add to the uncertainty in our results for example water loss to deep aquifer storage in the processes of streamflow routing water transfers and return flows from irrigation water uses might compromise the availability of upstream water for many downstream areas in addition alternative water resources e g saline water groundwater rainfall harvest and reclaimed water will become more common in the future and the withdrawals and discharges of these waters could also alter the terrestrial water balance and storage döll et al 2012 in future studies improved national datasets of water management especially the consumptive uses and return flows in different sectors and updates of inter basin transfers and better representations of the integrated water cycles driven by climate change and human activities are needed to reduce uncertainties 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the potential responses of surface water supply stress to future climatic and socioeconomic changes in the conus by explicitly including watershed level natural and artificial water connectivity we explored the distinct roles of water withdrawal consumptive use and local and non local water sources in water supply in despite of the considerable uncertainty spreads two main conclusions can be drawn first climate change mitigation practices could alleviate water stress from both the aspects of water demand and water supply the implementation of emission mitigation measures including the clean power plan program and other socio economic developments associated with the sres and rcp scenarios would lead to a reduction in total water demand by 21 7 6 1010 m3 yr and an increase in total water supply by 4 8 0 1010 m3 yr estimated by the multi model means in 2070 2099 consequently the coverage of highly stressed area is expected to remain relatively stable by 2070 2099 with mitigation measures but to expand from 14 to 18 from 19 to 24 by population in a future without mitigation second water connectivity among watersheds can significantly buffer the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic changes on regional water stress we show that upstream water and transferred water not only significantly relieved stress in 12 of the conus in the historical period but could also reduce the sensitivity of stress levels to future changes spatial patterns suggest that watersheds relying solely on local water resource are more vulnerable to climate change and more likely to face severe stress escalation water stress in watersheds receiving water from upstream or from transferred water can be alleviated by complementary non local water and also partly be offset by the diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies from different source areas this study raises questions about the potential over or under estimation of climate change impact on water supply stress where water connectivity among regions is not properly considered further studies on the nonstationary role of water connectivity to water supply security and the interactions among multiple environmental and anthropogenic stressors are warranted to better adapt to the changing world

6693,surface water supply for a watershed relies on local water generated from precipitation and water connections with other watersheds these connections are confined by topography and infrastructure and respond diversely to stressors such as climate change population growth increasing energy and water demands this study presents an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections i e stream flows inter basin water transfers water withdrawals and return flows among the 2099 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc 8 watersheds across the conterminous united states the framework is then applied to investigate the potential impacts of changes in climate and water use on regional water availability and water stress the ratio of demand to supply our projections suggest that highly water stressed areas may expand from 14 to 18 and the stressed population would increase from 19 to 24 by 2070 2099 climate change mitigation practices e g energy structure reform technology innovation could largely offset these trends by reducing demand and enhancing supply at the watershed scale the spatially inhomogeneous responses to future changes suggest that regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations due to the redistribution of water resources and diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies in different source areas however the detrimental future changes e g depleting river discharges larger demands of water withdrawal may aggravate conflicts over water rights among regions and challenge our current water infrastructure system this study provides new insights into the critical role of regional water connectivity in water supply security and highlights the increasing need for

stress is constantly changing with environmental and anthropogenic dynamics such as the changes in population vörösmarty et al 2000 economy and energy structure moore et al 2015 water use efficiency maupin et al 2014 and magnitude and variability of river discharges sagarika et al 2014 climate change poses an additional threat to water resources security there is evidence that the warming climate enhances evapotranspiration et and causes surface drying and subsequent depletion in water storage on the surface of the earth duan et al 2016 jackson et al 2005 water demand on the other hand could also be sensitive to climate change and the associated changes in environment such as the rising temperature sailor and pavlova 2003 increasing co2 concentration elliott et al 2014 and intensified drought döll et al 2015 sun et al 2015a it is becoming increasingly important to assess the vulnerability of water supply to global change so that management strategies can be developed to cope with a highly uncertain future alcamo et al 2000 ipcc 2014 watershed level surface water supply consists of local water i e surface and shallow subsurface runoff generated within each watershed that equals the difference between precipitation and et at a multi annual scale and the amount of water accumulated from upstream river networks or transferred by artificial aqueducts compared to water resources generated from local precipitation the non local waters are not only restricted by the topography and infrastructure but also susceptible to environmental changes and human activities in source areas e g drought water contamination consumptive use although there have been a few studies assessing water stress in the u s under future climate little attention has been paid to the role of water connectivity among regions some of the previous studies weighed water demand against supply at large basin scale e g the u s was divided into 98 basins in foti et al 2012 and 99 basins in blanc et al 2014 coarse scale evaluation tends to underestimate stress by averaging the withdrawals and supply data oki et al 2001 vörösmarty et al 2000 and the water movement in hydrologically connected areas is also masked given the lack of local control over upstream flow some recent studies projected water availability and stress from a local perspective for example devineni et al 2015 used local precipitation at the county level to estimate renewable water supply and evaluated water stress as the ratio of water deficit i e demand minus supply to average rainfall roy et al 2012 estimated renewable regional water supply with the available precipitation defined as the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration these studies have shown merits in improving spatiotemporal resolutions and accounting for uncertainties with more sophisticated risk assessment approaches however the potential variations in water exchange among different areas were not considered and consequently the impact of climate change on water stress could be over or under estimated this study aims to establish an integrative simulation and evaluation framework that incorporates the natural and anthropogenic water connections among the 2099 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc 8 watersheds http water usgs gov gis huc html across the conterminous united states conus and use it to investigate regional water availability and water stress in historical and future scenarios specifically our goal is 1 to investigate the role of water connections among watersheds i e stream flows in river channels artificial water transfers water withdrawals and return flows in distributing water supply 2 to project the responses of water stress to climate change socioeconomic status associated with climate change and mitigation practices over the course of the 21st century and 3 to examine the relative importance of driving factors from demand and supply aspects in impacting water stress at a high spatial resolution 2 methods 2 1 hydrologic unit system and water connections the hydrologic unit system developed by the united states geological survey usgs includes six levels of hydrologic units each unit is identified by a unique code consisting of two to twelve digits the first level of classification divides the conus into 18 2 digit huc areas which are commonly referred to as water resource regions wrrs fig 1 a these regions can be further divided into 2099 8 digit huc watersheds the full lists and boundaries of hydrologic units at different levels can be found in the watershed boundary dataset https datagateway nrcs usda gov the geospatial attributes of streams at different levels can be obtained from the national hydrography dataset http nhd usgs gov data html we assumed that the outlet of each watershed i e the inlet of the next downstream watershed was the exiting reach with the greatest cumulative drainage area within the watershed and thus identified a total of 18 777 upstream downstream connections among huc 8 watersheds caldwell et al 2012 emanuel et al 2015 we categorized the 2099 huc 8 watersheds into four types to specify the potential sources of water supply duan et al 2018 1 headwater watershed including 907 43 watersheds that are connected to downstream only 2 midstream watershed including 779 37 watersheds that are connected to both upstream and downstream 3 terminus watershed including 94 5 watersheds that are connected to upstream only 4 isolated watershed including 319 15 watersheds that are not connected to either upstream or downstream it can be assumed that only midstream and terminus watersheds would receive natural flows from upstream an addition of 228 artificial connections were identified based on historical inter basin water transfers ibts reported by petsch 1985 and mooty and jeffcoat 1986 a total of 22 billion m3 water per year has been transferred based on records from 1973 to 1982 which only accounts for 1 of total water supply in the entire conus duan et al 2018 however these ibts ranging from 500 m3 to 4 billion m3 per year have played an important role in securing regional water supply e g san joaquin and colorado transfers for southern california delaware hudson transfer for new york city and have widely impacted streamflow in areas downstream of the watersheds supplying receiving ibts fig 1b 2 2 projection of water supply water supply was simulated dynamically at huc 8 scale based on hydro climatic modeling and the water connections among watersheds first hydrologic processes within each watershed was modeled under historical and future climate scenarios second water demand and consumptive use were projected at each county by water use sectors and rescaled to huc 8 level and then water withdrawals return flows and ibts were implemented into the streamflow routing procedure to estimate regional water availability 2 2 1 watershed water balance the huc 8 level water balance was modeled with a previously validated monthly hydrologic model the water supply stress index model wassi wassi was developed to capture land cover specific large scale water balance in the conus i e the processes of snowpack melt accumulation soil moisture accounting evapotranspiration and runoff generation caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011 sun et al 2008 it has been widely used in the u s duan et al 2017a africa mcnulty et al 2016 and china liu et al 2013 the extensive validation with usgs measured streamflow caldwell et al 2015 duan et al 2017b sun et al 2015b and remote sensing products of et and ecosystem productivity sun et al 2011 sun et al 2015b suggest that wassi can achieve an acceptable modeling accuracy with respect of both water and carbon fluxes at broad spatial scales two climate datasets were used to drive the hydrologic model 1 monthly precipitation and temperature for the historical period of 1961 2010 from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism dataset http prism oregonstate edu daly et al 2008 and 2 monthly precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and specific humidity from the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca datasets the macav2 livneh dataset available at http maca northwestknowledge net abatzoglou and brown 2012 livneh et al 2013 the maca data includes downscaled and bias corrected climate from 20 global climate models gcms of the fifth phase of the coupled model inter comparison project cmip5 it spans from 1950 to 2099 to include the experiments of historical representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp8 5 which correspond to the climate forcings i e greenhouse gases emissions aerosols land use feedbacks etc observed in the history and projected in a future with the radiative forcing reaching 4 5 and 8 5 w m 2 in 2100 equivalent to 650 ppm and 1370 ppm co2 respectively ipcc 2014 moss et al 2010 more details of the modeling approaches and results of water balance components derived from these climate datasets can be found in a previous study duan et al 2017b 2 2 2 streamflow routing and regional water supply the total available surface water supply total flow tf for a watershed was simulated as 1 tf l f i 1 n uf i i 1 n u wc i i b t where local flow lf equals the runoff generated within the target watershed which can be interpreted as precipitation p minus et and changes in soil moisture sm and hydrologically connected snowpack sp 2 lf p e t d s m d t d s p d t i 1 n uf i is the sum of runoff accumulated from all the connected upstream watersheds while i 1 n u wc i represents the sum of water consumption in these watersheds that equals water withdrawals minus return flows water withdrawals and consumptive uses were assumed to occur uniformly in each watershed the residuals of upstream flow after consumptive uses were assumed to be discharged simultaneously to surface water at the inlet of the next downstream watershed in the cases that the accumulated streamflow cannot meet the demand the actual water withdrawal was set to equal the maximum water availability and consumptive use and the return flow discharged to downstream were downsized with the same ratio the watersheds supplying ibts were assumed to meet the need of water transfer before local withdrawal magnitudes of the ibts were also reduced to the maximum water availability in the cases of water deficit and the same ratio was implemented for all the transfers if a watershed was supplying ibts to multiple watersheds the regulations of dams and reservoirs were not included in this study because most of these facilities are operated on seasonal or monthly basis while this study aims to provide a long term projection at annual and decadal scales 2 3 projection of water withdrawal and consumption projection of future water demand was based on the extrapolation of past trends and the estimates of demographic economic and climatic forces on water uses national water use data from 1950 to 2010 by 5 year interval county level data is available from 1985 to 2010 were obtained from the usgs water census reports available at http water usgs gov watuse data we here focus on the potential changes in the thermoelectric irrigation and domestic including self supplied and public delivered sectors in 2010 these three sectors accounted for 84 of the total surface freshwater withdrawal in the conus i e 50 thermoelectric 28 irrigation and 6 domestic maupin et al 2014 county level withdrawal and consumption in the other sectors including livestock aquaculture industrial and mining were included but were assumed to remain at the same levels as 2010 through the 21st century the ratios of surface freshwater withdrawal to total water withdrawal i e surface freshwater plus groundwater and saline water were assumed to remain constant 2 3 1 domestic use per capita domestic water use in the u s has been relatively stable since 1990 maupin et al 2014 but the total domestic water demand is likely to further increase if population grows in this study per capita domestic water withdrawal and consumption in each county were assumed to remain at the same levels as in 2010 domestic uses in the future were estimated by multiplying the per capita use in 2010 by the population projected for the period of 2010 2100 the proportions of public and self supplied domestic uses were also assumed to be constant over time population projections in the 3109 counties over the conus were obtained from the integrated climate and land use scenarios iclus v1 3 datasets that compiled by the u s environmental protection agency epa https www epa gov iclus iclus downloads this projection links demographic models with the climate and land use changes from the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc special report on emissions scenarios sres of social economic and demographic storylines the total population in the conus is projected to increase from 310 million in 2010 to 402 688 million in 2100 among the sres scenarios a1 rapid economic growth a2 regionally oriented economic development b1 global environmental sustainability and b2 local environmental sustainability outputs under b1 and a2 scenarios which are comparable to the emission scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 used in the fifth ipcc report were used to represent the low and high population projections respectively 2 3 2 thermoelectric use thermoelectric water demand was estimated as total thermoelectric power generation multiplying per kwh water use the electric power projections in 2010 2040 were obtained from the annual energy outlook provided by the energy information administration eia of u s department of energy doe 2016 the outputs include electricity generated in the fossil fuels and nuclear power plants in the 22 electricity market module emm regions in the conus under two reference scenarios with and without complying with the clean power plan cpp the cpp is a u s epa program issued under the clean air act 42 u s c 7401 which requires a reduction in carbon emission from current fossil fuel plants by 32 until 2030 and an extension of tax credits for renewable energy currently under review https www epa gov economic and cost analysis air pollution regulations regulatory impact analysis review clean power the power generation data for each emm region was linearly extrapolated forward from 2041 to 2099 using the average rates of change in 2010 2040 the regional data was then disaggregated to huc 8 watersheds based on two assumptions roy et al 2012 1 the increase decrease in power generation only occurs in watersheds with existing thermoelectric plants and 2 the same changing rate against the 2010 level is applied to all the watersheds within each emm region we did not consider the additional impact of climate warming on electricity demand for air conditioning because 1 the electricity demand did not show a clear correlation with climatic drivers at the national scale according to the eia datasets and 2 future behavioral responses to climate change may be largely affected by the evolving air conditioning technology and market saturation sailor 2001 sailor and pavlova 2003 water use per kwh has been decreasing in recent decades due to the improvement of technology especially the movement from once through or open loop to recirculation or closed loop cooling system once through cooling accounted for 94 of total water withdrawals and 47 of power generation in 2010 while plants with recirculation systems generated the other 53 power with only 6 withdrawal maupin et al 2014 this decreasing trend in per kwh withdrawal is likely to continue in the foreseeable future as industry regulations will continue to encourage cooling systems with lower withdrawal requirements however it should be noted that the water consumption of a recirculation system is generally larger than that of a once through system higher consumption is expected under future scenarios with a larger share of power plants converting to a recirculation system even though water withdrawal is projected to decrease feeley et al 2008 the projections conducted by the national energy technology laboratory netl 2011 suggested that total water consumption would increase between 2010 and 2035 under all of the five scenarios accounting for different additions and retirements of thermoelectric generating capacity and cooling systems including once through recirculation and dry cooling systems we used the average changing rates of water withdrawal per kwh and water consumption per unit withdrawal under these five scenarios to represent the future changes from 2010 to 2035 and extrapolated these trends forward to 2099 by emm region similar to the disaggregation of power generation the same changing rates against the baseline level in 2010 was applied to all the watersheds with existing thermoelectric plants within each emm region 2 3 3 irrigation use irrigation water demand was calculated as irrigated area multiplying irrigation use per unit area i e irrigation efficiency considering the changing needs for agricultural crops and the increasing evaporative demand caused by warming future irrigation water demand wi is estimated by the changes against the 2010 level as 3 wi α w i 2010 i net i n e t 2010 where inet is net irrigation water demand per unit area and inet inet2010 indicates its change caused by climate change the correction coefficient α is used to represent the potential changes in irrigated area a and irrigation efficiency η without the impact of climate change as 4 α a η a 2010 η 2010 irrigated area and irrigation efficiency are affected by a complex mixture of socioeconomic factors such as agricultural policies irrigation technology and crop market due to the lack of local level information on these factors we used the wrr level projections suggested by brown et al 2013 and assumed that changes in irrigated area and irrigation water demand would only occur in watersheds with existing irrigated agriculture based on the historical records of irrigated area irrigation water withdrawal and distribution of irrigation systems e g surface flood sprinkler and micro irrigation from the usgs brown et al 2013 extrapolated the past trends and developed two sets of estimates for the east wrr 1 9 and west wrr 10 18 of the conus the majority of the total irrigation withdrawals occurred in 17 western states e g nebraska california idaho where annual precipitation was less than 20 in maupin et al 2014 irrigated area in the west is projected to continue the decreasing trend begun in the 1980s the improvements in irrigation efficiency have caused a notable decline in the irrigation withdrawals both in the west and for the entire conus sprinkler and drip irrigation have already been widely used in the west but finer micro irrigation techniques or new methods may be developed as a response to the aggravated water deficit in a warmer future in the east irrigated area is projected to continue to increase but at a decreasing rate and sprinkler and drip systems are expected to gradually replace surface flooding in humid states the combination of the changes in irrigated area and irrigation efficiency will cause the α coefficient to decrease in the west but increase in the east inet is estimated by the difference between evaporative demand and supply döll 2002 döll and siebert 2002 as 5 i net k c p e t p e if p e t p e i net 0 if p e t p e where pet is potential evapotranspiration calculated with the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 kc is a crop coefficient which is set to 1 as we are not differentiating crop types brown et al 2013 pe is effective precipitation representing the fraction of precipitation and snowmelt that is available to crop and does not run off pe is estimated with a simplified empirical relationship with precipitation p the usda soil conservation method smith 1992 as 6 pe p 125 0 2 p 125 if p 250 mm month pe 125 0 1 p if p 250 mm month we assumed a constant 6 month growing season from april to september the mean monthly p and pet during the growing season were used to estimate pe and inet the future changes in plant species and cropping structure and the potential lengthening shortening of the growing season caused by climate change were not considered the impact of changing irrigation methods on irrigation water consumption is not entirely clear and difficult to quantify without on site observations however there has been rising concern that the adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies e g from flood to drip which requires less water to be withdrawn could also cause larger consumptive rates and reduce valuable return flows ward and pulido velazquez 2008 for example hu et al 2017 found a strong inverse linear correlation r 0 99 p 0 01 between irrigation return flow coefficient return flow water applied and irrigation efficiency in an experimental cotton plantation therefore we assumed that water consumption per unit area would remain at the same levels as in 2010 in irrigated areas i e water consumption per unit withdrawal would increase accordingly as the updates of irrigation system decrease withdrawal per unit area 2 4 water stress evaluation 2 4 1 stress indices and classification two indices of water stress were used to address the sufficiency of local and non local water resources in meeting water demand duan et al 2018 local water stress lws defined as the ratio of wd to lf global water stress gws defined as the ratio of wd to tf water stress is usually considered high when the ratio of withdrawal to supply exceeds 0 4 due to the concern that water demands for instream uses such as navigation hydropower generation and ecological and environmental demands should also be met oki et al 2001 richey et al 2015 vörösmarty et al 2000 we here further define three levels of stress using 0 4 as the threshold value including unstressed represents a condition without water stress that local water resource alone can suffice the demand identified if lws 0 4 upstream stressed represents a condition that sufficient water supply is dependent on the availability of upstream water or water transferred though artificial aqueducts identified if lws 0 4 gws 0 4 overstressed represents a condition with high water stress even when water supply is complemented by upstream water or transferred water identified if gws 0 4 2 4 2 scenarios of water stress we reconciled the datasets of population electricity generation climate and water uses from different sources to provide a projection of future water demand supply and stress at the huc 8 level although the underlying assumptions of these datasets are not entirely consistent they are all closely related to climate change and the associated mitigation measures we focused on two future scenarios of water stress in our analysis table 1 1 intermediate stress is driven by population under b1 climate under rcp4 5 and power generation with the cpp and 2 high stress hs driven by population under a2 climate under rcp8 5 and power generation without the cpp the is and hs scenarios represent a future with and without climate change mitigation strategies respectively the average ibt magnitudes derived from the data in 1973 1982 were used through all of the time periods under both future scenarios the historical scenario 1981 2010 based on the prism climate data and usgs water use census reports was used as a benchmark for identifying changes in the future 2 4 3 attribution of potential changes in water stress the potential changes in gws are attributed to the impacts of water demand wd and total water supply tf as 7 δ g w s 1 tf δ w d wd tf 2 δ t f wd tf 3 δ t f 2 where δgws is the change in the ratio of wd tf 1 tf δ w d is the contribution of wd change the sum of the second and third terms on the right side of the equation is the contribution of tf change feng and fu 2013 the demand contribution is further attributed to water use sectors of domestic thermoelectric and irrigation while the supply contribution is attributed to changes in local flow lf upstream flow uf and upstream water consumption uwc by their weights in tf change 3 results 3 1 projected changes in water demand supply and stress 3 1 1 national scale the conus population is projected to increase from 310 to 392 and 669 million under the sres b1 and a2 scenarios by 2099 respectively consequently domestic water demand fig 2 a is projected to increase from 2 1010 to 2 7 1010 is and 4 9 1010 m3 hs from 2011 to 2099 with a quarter of the withdrawn water being consumed fig 2b thermoelectric power generation is projected to drop between 2010 and early 2020s due to the growing role of renewable energy e g solar wind geothermal the decreasing trend is expected to continue under the cpp scenario and result in a reduction in thermoelectric withdrawal from 1 4 1011 2011 to 1 1 1011 m3 2099 fig 2c however under the scenario without the cpp the total thermoelectric water use is likely to increase again after 2020s because of the increasing electricity demand and exceed the 2010 level in the 2070s in spite of the decreasing per kwh withdrawal water consumption in the thermoelectric sector fig 2d will increase from 9 109 in 2011 to 1 1 1010 m3 in 2099 with the cpp as a result of the rising consumption rate whereas a more significant increase by 5 109 m3 from 9 109 to 1 4 1010 m3 is projected under the scenario without the cpp projections of irrigation use fig 2e show highly diverse variations among the climate models multi model means under rcp4 5 suggest relatively smaller changes in irrigation withdrawal and consumption fluctuating around 9 1010 m3 and 5 1010 m3 respectively meanwhile clear increasing trends are projected under rcp8 5 with withdrawal and consumption reaching 1 4 1011 m3 and 7 1010 m3 by the end of this century combining the projected changes in domestic thermoelectric and irrigation withdrawals total water demand in the conus fig 3 a is projected to increase from 3 2 1011 m3 in 2010 to 3 8 1011 m3 in 2099 under the hs scenario conversely a notable reduction by 0 5 1011 m3 in total demand is expected under the is scenario due to the decrease in thermoelectric withdrawal on the other hand total water supply the sum of annual lf over the conus fig 3b derived from the ensemble mean of multiple climate models shows a slight decrease under both is 3 108 m3 yr 1 r2 0 01 and hs 1 109 m3 yr 1 r2 0 11 judging by the multi decadal average in 2070 2099 significantly larger demand 7 6 1010 m3 yr 1 and smaller supply 8 0 1010 m3 yr 1 are projected under the hs than that under the is it should be kept in mind that these multi model means can only represent hydrologic responses to the averaged climate forcings in the future the natural climate fluctuations and the uncertainties in climate models lead to large variability in annual water supply and demand e g supply and demand respectively vary between 1 4 3 2 1012 m3 and 2 4 4 7 1011 m3 in 2099 overall water stress ratio of total demand to total supply fig 3c is projected to change divergently under the two future scenarios results of multi model means suggest that water stress is likely to fall between 0 13 and 0 15 in most of the years under the is scenario 6 10 5 yr 1 r2 0 03 however a pronounced rise from 0 15 in 2011 to 0 19 in 2099 is expected under the hs scenario 5 10 4 yr 1 r2 0 67 driven by the increasing demand and decreasing supply the highest stress over 0 39 was found in the projections based on the bcc csm1 1 m climate model these differences between the results under the is and hs scenarios suggest that the implementation of emission mitigation measures including the cpp program and other socio economic developments associated with sres and rcp scenarios would largely alleviate water stress from both demand and supply aspects 3 1 2 watershed scale fig 4 shows the spatial variation of multi decadal changes in water demand wd and supply tf from 1981 to 2010 to 2070 2099 multi model mean and consensus among the climate models were used to evaluate the future changes and associated uncertainties an increase or decrease is considered significant i e high consensus when results derived from over 80 of the climate models agree on the changing sign under the is a significant decrease in wd will occur in over half of all the watersheds while an increase is projected to scatter in another one fifth of the watersheds areas with an increasing wd are expected to expand significantly to cover one third of the conus under the hs tf change shows extensive decreases in the western and central regions wrr 10 18 and high consensus is found in 864 and 850 out of the 2099 watersheds under the is and hs scenarios significant increases in tf are mainly found in the east wrr 1 6 and pacific coast wrr 17 pacific northwest and cover 17 23 of the conus high consensus on gws change fig 5 a c is projected in 1520 587 increases and 933 decreases and 1472 833 increases and 639 decreases watersheds under the is and hs scenarios respectively under the is decreasing gws covers a majority of the eastern conus while a significant increase can be mainly found in the west the coverage of increasingly stressed area is expected to be clearly larger under the hs and fewer decreases in stress are also projected in the east in particular a noticeable shift from increase to decrease in tf and from decrease to increase in gws can be found across the south wrr 12 texas gulf and southeast wrr 3 south atlantic gulf wrr 8 lower mississippi when comparing hs to is we also compared the results of water stress interpreted by gws and lws to quantify the benefits of water produced upstream and water artificially transferred across the country fig 5d f in the historical period 12 more land area of the conus would face high stress if only local water was available a total of 743 and 951 increasingly stressed watersheds are identified by lws under the is and hs scenarios respectively which are 27 and 14 more than that by gws such results demonstrate the role of upstream water and transferred water in reducing the sensitivity of stress to future changes particularly the potential stress escalations in the western regions 3 2 contributions of the driving factors we further analyzed the contributions of demand i e domestic thermoelectric irrigation and supply i e lf uf uwc factors in altering gws from 1981 to 2010 to 2070 2099 for each watershed changes in domestic demand fig 6 a b caused by population growth and migration are identified as the largest contributor in 12 under is and 15 under hs of the conus area mostly distributed in southern california wrr 18 and the southwest wrr 12 texas gulf wrr 13 rio grande wrr 15 lower colorado the changing thermoelectric demand fig 6c d is projected to increase stress in the east wrr 1 6 and the south wrr 8 lower mississippi wrr 11 arkansas white red wrr 12 texas gulf while alleviating stress across the rest of the country domestic and thermoelectric demands tend to dominate stress changes in densely populated areas such as the metropolitan areas in texas wrr 12 and atlantic coastal regions wrr 1 3 these two driving factors are expected to be the largest in 32 34 of the conus that accounts for up to 60 64 of the population under the future scenarios future changes in irrigation water use fig 6e f are projected to aggravate stress in the east but alleviate stress in a large part of the west as intensified water shortage may lead to decrease in irrigated area and more investment in irrigation techniques in the dry west however there is still notable increase in irrigation demand across most of the country under the hs scenario lf change induced by local climate change fig 7 a b is expected to be the major cause of water stress escalation in the west wrr 10 18 and stress alleviation in the atlantic coast wrr 2 3 accounting for 24 25 of the conus 10 17 of the population the effects of lf are enhanced by the consequent changes in uf fig 7c d in watersheds involved with the river networks generally driving water stress to increase and decrease in the west and east of mississippi respectively uf change driven by the combined effects of climate change in upstream areas is recognized as the most influential factor in 15 16 of the area 9 of the population that mostly distributed across large river basins in the west such as the missouri arkansas rio grande gila and colorado rivers contrary to the impact of uf change uwc drives water stress to increase in the east as a result of the increasing water withdrawals but will counterbalance the stress escalation widely across the river basins in the west of mississippi including missouri mississippi arkansas canadian red brazos pecos rio grande and gila river basins as thermoelectric and irrigation water uses are projected to decrease in 24 29 of these watersheds 1 2 in area which is mostly scattered across the arkansas canadian and brazos river basins wrr 10 12 uwc is projected to be the most influential factor we summarized the relative importance of the driving factors in water stress change across the watersheds by the four categories of hydrologic connectivity i e headwater midstream terminus and isolated based on the multi model mean results fig 8 on average water demand contribution ranges from 55 in midstream watersheds to 70 in isolated watersheds with irrigation being the largest contributing sector across all the categories 23 32 in terms of water supply lf accounts for 30 39 of stress change in headwater and isolated watersheds meanwhile uf change is the most influential factor 21 28 for water supply in midstream and terminus watersheds followed by lf 7 10 and uwc 4 7 such results demonstrate the critical role of upstream water in securing water supply in midstream or terminus watersheds along large rivers where changes in upstream climate and water consumption could exert a much larger impact on water stress than changes in local climate a similar pattern of the six factors relative importance is projected for the two future scenarios even though much higher stress is expected in the hs scenario 3 3 changes in stress level and coverages areas that relied on non local water for adequate freshwater supply defined as upstream stressed in this study covered 10 14 of the conus through the baseline period 1981 2010 meanwhile the areal extant of overstressed areas where high water stress was observed even when water supply is complemented by upstream flows or ibts varied widely between 9 and 20 from wet years to dry years the ranges derived from the multiple climate models also suggest that much larger uncertainty is involved in the projection of overstressed coverage 5 39 than that of upstream stressed 6 15 fig 9 judging by the ensemble means of multiple gcms there will be little change in the overall stress coverage under is yet an evident expansion through this century under hs on multi decadal basis 12 and 14 of the conus area 15 and 19 of the population were identified as upstream stressed and overstressed in the baseline period the mean coverage of stressed areas is expected to remain stable in 2070 2099 under is with only a slight increase in overstressed area 15 in the meantime under hs the total stressed area is projected to reach 30 with the overstressed coverage expanding to 18 in area and 24 in population to identify the hotspot areas with potential increases or decreases in water stress level fig 10 we investigated the spatial distribution of mean multi decadal changes across the 2099 huc 8 watersheds and the consensus among results derived from different climate models areas expected to endure higher stress levels i e from unstressed to upstream stressed from upstream stressed to overstressed or directly from unstressed to overstressed are mainly distributed in the central and western conus across wrr 10 17 especially in missouri wrr 10 arkansas white red wrr 11 texas gulf wrr 12 upper colorado wrr 14 and great basin wrr 16 under hs higher stress level is also projected to occur in a few watersheds in the east on the other hand areas shifting to lower stress levels are mostly distributed in the northeast wrr 2 mid atlantic the midwest wrr 5 ohio wrr 7 upper mississippi wrr 10 missouri and the southeast wrr 3 south atlantic gulf wrr 6 tennessee in total there are 133 and 192 watersheds facing increased stress levels under the is and hs scenarios and high consensus among climate models can be found in 60 and 102 of them respectively table 2 the spatial pattern suggests that 80 87 of the transitions to overstressed are likely to occur in headwater and isolated watersheds where water supply is generally more sensitive to climate change due to the limited water source area conversely terminus watersheds are usually endowed with large amounts of upstream water and thus they are more resilient to future changes with only 4 5 shifts 2 3 with high consensus between the states of unstressed and upstream stressed expected diverse changes are expected among the midstream watersheds although the total number of midstream watersheds facing higher stress is close to that of headwater watersheds less than half of them are expected to reach the level of overstressed while the rest are increasing from unstressed to upstream stressed the projected future changes will also challenge the efficiency of current ibt projects the stress escalations in watersheds receiving ibt water table 3 particularly for a few headwater and isolated watersheds where only local water is available in the natural state indicate an increasing need for transferred water in these areas more shifts to the overstressed status 9 12 are projected in watersheds supplying ibt water the higher stress levels in these source areas are likely to compromise their capability of providing water and even trigger new conflicts over water rights 4 discussion this study aimed to explore the diverse responses of regional water demand and supply to multiple stressors and provide a reference for water planning and management in a changing world our results suggest that previous projections without concern for water connectivity among regions devineni et al 2015 foti et al 2012 roy et al 2012 could be misleading in spite of the spatial differences water supply in the conus is generally more resilient to climate change and increases in water use when non local water is taken into account this is not only because of the additional water supplies but also due to the possibly inhomogeneous changes in runoff generation and water uses in the water source areas for example the negative effects of decreasing upstream flow caused by climate change could be partially neutralized or even overwhelmed by the decreasing upstream water uses in some western basins it is important for water managers to understand that the status of water connectivity among regions are not always stationary over time climate change may cause a depletion in upstream water flows and larger evaporation loss during water uses while the increases in population energy demand and irrigation area will impact the quantity and quality of water available for downstream areas current legal systems governing water allocation and water rights e g riparian rights in the east and prior appropriation in the west across the country have been developed based on historical information on water availability and demand the extensive changes in the future e g depleting river discharge larger withdrawal demand lower water level in water intake points will impose new challenges on the existing systems and the supporting infrastructure efficient water management will require a more specific identification of the potential sources of water and an integrated monitoring of their variations and the driving factors mcnulty et al 2018 this study contributes to our understanding of the critical role of water connectivity to water supply security in the u s and can help policy makers and stakeholders to better adapt to the future nevertheless long term projections are usually developed under a series of assumptions and thus inevitably involve various uncertainties in the datasets and results for simplicity the analysis presented in this paper is limited to a few of the most important factors we here address the uncertainties and limitations inherent to the projections of water demand consumption and supplies thermoelectric and irrigation are by far the largest water use sectors and are also the major sources of uncertainty in the projections of water withdrawal and consumption we estimated future thermoelectric withdrawal based on historical trends and extrapolation of the eia s projections future shifts in energy policy and technology innovation may cause more complex changes in electricity demand energy structure and water use efficiency for example renewable energy production such as biofuels biodiesel and ethanol is expected to increase as an alternative to thermoelectric power elcock 2010 which could bring in new water requirements for irrigation and exacerbate water stress hejazi et al 2015 carbon capture and storage ccs technology is increasingly implemented to curb greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel power plants rao and rubin 2002 and the operation of plants with ccs facility also requires extra water uses besides large uncertainties are involved in the responses of irrigation areas cropping patterns and irrigation methods to various climatic political e g agricultural policies and subsidies and economic e g agricultural product markets land prices forces elliott et al 2014 wada et al 2011 webber et al 2016 it is still challenging to incorporate all the driving factors and forecast irrigation water demand and consumption rates for a specific time or location the projection of water yield and streamflow dynamics is another major source of uncertainty milly et al 2005 besides the preset assumptions involved in the emission scenarios structure and parameters of climate model hydrologic model and downscaling approach all contribute to the uncertainties to various extents as hydro climatic simulations are conducted in different contexts or at different spatiotemporal scales bae et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 duan and mei 2014 giuntoli et al 2015 kay et al 2009 in particular two caveats should be noted when interpreting our results 1 water loss in aqueducts and reservoirs water projects including reservoirs dams and aqueducts are designed to redistribute water resources spatially and temporally for securing water supply in dry areas or dry seasons however a considerable amount of water could be lost in the process through evaporation and leakage the magnitude of loss depends on many factors including background climate topography and river morphology as well as the design investment and maintenance of the infrastructure more information needs to be collected from local levels to account for the effects of these potential water losses 2 interactions between surface water and deep groundwater in this evaluation we have focused on surface water while groundwater was excluded from both the demand and supply aspects however the enhanced interactions between surface water and groundwater caused by human activities could add to the uncertainty in our results for example water loss to deep aquifer storage in the processes of streamflow routing water transfers and return flows from irrigation water uses might compromise the availability of upstream water for many downstream areas in addition alternative water resources e g saline water groundwater rainfall harvest and reclaimed water will become more common in the future and the withdrawals and discharges of these waters could also alter the terrestrial water balance and storage döll et al 2012 in future studies improved national datasets of water management especially the consumptive uses and return flows in different sectors and updates of inter basin transfers and better representations of the integrated water cycles driven by climate change and human activities are needed to reduce uncertainties 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the potential responses of surface water supply stress to future climatic and socioeconomic changes in the conus by explicitly including watershed level natural and artificial water connectivity we explored the distinct roles of water withdrawal consumptive use and local and non local water sources in water supply in despite of the considerable uncertainty spreads two main conclusions can be drawn first climate change mitigation practices could alleviate water stress from both the aspects of water demand and water supply the implementation of emission mitigation measures including the clean power plan program and other socio economic developments associated with the sres and rcp scenarios would lead to a reduction in total water demand by 21 7 6 1010 m3 yr and an increase in total water supply by 4 8 0 1010 m3 yr estimated by the multi model means in 2070 2099 consequently the coverage of highly stressed area is expected to remain relatively stable by 2070 2099 with mitigation measures but to expand from 14 to 18 from 19 to 24 by population in a future without mitigation second water connectivity among watersheds can significantly buffer the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic changes on regional water stress we show that upstream water and transferred water not only significantly relieved stress in 12 of the conus in the historical period but could also reduce the sensitivity of stress levels to future changes spatial patterns suggest that watersheds relying solely on local water resource are more vulnerable to climate change and more likely to face severe stress escalation water stress in watersheds receiving water from upstream or from transferred water can be alleviated by complementary non local water and also partly be offset by the diverse changes in consumptive uses and water supplies from different source areas this study raises questions about the potential over or under estimation of climate change impact on water supply stress where water connectivity among regions is not properly considered further studies on the nonstationary role of water connectivity to water supply security and the interactions among multiple environmental and anthropogenic stressors are warranted to better adapt to the changing world

6694,the lancang river lr in china the upper portion of the mekong river which is among the world s most important transboundary rivers originates on the tibetan plateau and provides important freshwater resources for living agriculture industry and hydropower generation for millions of people downstream the natural flow regime of the lr is critical to sustain native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity however it has been changing due to the combined effect of climate change and human activities accurate quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on changes in the flow regime is a prerequisite for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection this study aims to evaluate climate and human induced impacts on the lr during 1980 2014 a distributed hydrological model crest snow combined with remote sensing and streamflow data and the budyko framework were jointly used to address this scientific question during three time windows determined by the mann kendall test and the history of dam construction results show that compared with the baseline period 1980 1986 when no dam was constructed significant changes 6 in mean annual streamflow occurred during 1987 2014 particularly after 2008 when the construction of the largest hydropower plant nuozhadu in the mekong river basin began climatic change contributed 57 to streamflow changes during the transition period 1987 2007 whereas human activities contributed 95 during the post impact period 2008 2014 at the seasonal scale climatic variation plays a more significant role during the dry season december may with precipitation the most important factor among climate variables whereas human activities contributed more during the wet season june november benefiting the downstream areas through mitigating floods among human activities reservoir construction is a dominant factor affecting streamflow over agricultural industrial and domestic water uses the findings of this study enhance our understanding of hydrological changes in the lr basin that may impact the lower mekong river serve as a basis for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection and highlight the need for considering reservoir operation strategies in streamflow projections in similar basins globally under climate change scenarios keywords streamflow

i e china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam with a total length of 4 350 km and a drainage area of 795 000 km2 mrc 2010 the lancang river lr in china i e the upper portion of the mr originates on the tibetan plateau tp and flows through qinghai tibet and yunnan provinces the lr provides important freshwater resources for domestic agricultural industrial uses and hydropower to china and downstream countries the natural flow regime of the lr is critical to native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in rivers poff et al 1997 in addition an improved understanding of the hydrology of the basin is the scientific foundation on integrated water resources management carlisle et al 2010 commission 2009 and on modeling potential changes in the streamflow of the lr in the future both climate change and human activities have exerted significant pressure on the lr first runoff from the tp tends to be sensitive to climate change as a result of changing precipitation and snow and glacier melting processes due to climate warming chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018 huang et al 2018a lauri et al 2012 long et al 2014 lutz et al 2014 tang et al 2018 second growing population leads to increased water resource and energy demands that may subsequently result in extensive hydropower exploitation in both the mainstream and tributaries of the lr pokhrel et al 2018 quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on the streamflow of the lr is therefore fundamental to water resource management and environmental protection and therefore has received considerable attention from the scientific community immerzeel et al 2009 jeelani et al 2012 räsänen et al 2017 recent studies associated with the impact of hydropower generation mainly focused on historical changes in streamflow of the lower mr cochrane et al 2014 lu et al 2014 mohammed et al 2018 räsänen et al 2012 räsänen et al 2017 lu et al 2014 and räsänen et al 2017 examined changes in river discharge at the chiang saen gauging station in northern thailand since 1960 whereas li et al 2017a used streamflow observations at five gauging stations along the mainstream of the mr to assess the alteration of flow regimes over the period of 1960 2014 these studies mostly compared the streamflow before and after dam construction based on streamflow observations and confirmed the significant effect of cascade reservoirs upstream however discrepancies of the findings exist due to different study periods and changes in the intra annual streamflow distribution lu et al 2014 found a 9 decrease in discharge at the chiang saen gauging station in august but a 15 increase in discharge in july over the post dam period 1992 2010 than that over the pre dam period 1960 1991 but räsänen et al 2017 found an increase of 121 187 in discharge during mar may and a decrease of 32 46 in discharge during july august in 2014 compared with the mean discharge over the period 1960 1990 at the chiang saen gauging station mohammed et al 2018 explored the variability in streamflow of the lower mr by examining changes in the upper mr inflow using a hydrological model moreover several studies simulated the effects of projected climate change scenarios and reservoir operation strategies on streamflow for example ngo et al 2016 applied the soil water assessment tool swat and water evaluation and planning weap models to the tributaries of the lower mr in vietnam and cambodia for the future period 2010 2100 to assess the impacts of different reservoir operation strategies on flow regimes wang et al 2017 adopted the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm to study the combined effect on floods in the mr basin from 2010 to 2099 indicating that reservoir operation could mitigate the effect of flood intensification caused by climate change before 2060 despite recent efforts the impacts of climate change and human activities on the streamflow of the lr have remained inadequately assessed first few studies quantified climate and human impacts on the historical streamflow of the lr tang et al 2014 used a back propagation artificial neural network bp ann model and concluded that human activities exerted a larger impact on streamflow changes in the lr than climatic variations 54 6 and 45 4 respectively during 1986 2008 second as mentioned above the lr has been less studied than the mr or only studied over a short time period tang et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 the lr originates at elevations of over 5100 m on the tp with its runoff sensitive to climate change as a result of snow and glacier melting immerzeel et al 2009 lutz et al 2014 assessing the hydrological impacts of climate change over the lr basin thus requires more sophisticated hydrological models with a snow and glacier module and adopts a multiple dataset calibration method to ensure both accurate simulation of streamflow and a reasonable contribution of snow and glacier meltwater to total runoff finger et al 2015 the overall objective of this study was therefore to quantify climate and human induced impacts on changes in streamflow of the lr during the period 1980 2014 to achieve this objective we relied on the coupled routing and excess storage crest model wang et al 2011 coupled with a snow and glacier melting module chen et al 2017 termed crest snow hereafter and streamflow observations at the yunjinghong gauging station at the outlet of the lr basin to generate historical natural streamflow we analyzed interannual seasonal and monthly changes in streamflow and quantified the contributions from climatic and anthropogenic effects in addition we partitioned the impacts of human activities during 1980 2010 based on a global monthly gridded 0 5 sectoral water withdrawal dataset huang et al 2018b the findings advance our understanding of hydrological changes in the lr basin and highlight the role of reservoir construction and operation in influencing streamflow regimes this study can serve as a basis for examining climate and human impacts on streamflow for dammed rivers and provide reference for projecting future streamflow changes particularly for snow fed rivers that are dictated by reservoir operation 2 study area the lr is located within the domain 22 05 33 40 n and 93 50 101 30 e in southwest china fig 1 with a total length of 2 140 km and a drainage area of 142 000 km2 long et al 2014 it has a complex terrain with a mean elevation of 3 300 m and an elevation difference of 5 500 m decreasing from the northwest to the southeast the lr features a humid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 735 mm based on a 35 year record 1980 2014 of the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa product shen and xiong 2016 the westerlies and indian monsoon bring abundant moisture and rainfall over the lr basin from june to september which accounts for nearly 70 of the annual rainfall correspondingly streamflow in the lr also exhibits strong seasonality with 70 of the annual discharge and the peak discharge normally occurring between august and september jacobs 2002 the unique geographical features and the large energy demand in yunnan province and eastern china have contributed to the burgeoning development of hydropower plants in the lr basin chen et al 2010 hennig et al 2013 the six largest dams storage capacity 1 hundred million m3 on the mainstream were included in our analysis with their detailed information listed in table 1 3 data and methods 3 1 data streamflow observations at the yunjinghong gauging station for the time period 1980 2014 were obtained from the china hydrology data project http depts washington edu shuiwen henck et al 2011 and local water resources administrations snow water equivalent swe was estimated based on a snow depth product from the environmental and ecological science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn che et al 2008 dai et al 2015 2012 and snow density calculated using in situ measured snow depth and snow pressure chen et al 2017 here the discharge and swe dataset were jointly used to calibrate crest snow and partial discharge data were used to validate the hydrological model the cgdpa precipitation product developed by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration was generated using rainfall measurements of 2400 national gauges and the climatological optimal interpolation oi algorithm shen and xiong 2016 http cdc nmic cn other meteorological data including daily time series of maximum mean and minimum air temperatures dew point temperature and pressure were obtained from the era interim product the latest global atmospheric reanalysis produced by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf both cgdpa and era meteorological data were converted from a resolution of 0 25 to a resolution of 0 0625 using the nearest neighbor method for driving the hydrological model daily temperature dew point temperature and pressure estimates for the period 1980 2014 were used to calculate wet bulb temperature and force crest snow era interim temperature estimates were used to estimate potential evapotranspiration according to the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 with the parameters adjusted to be applicable to southwest china hu et al 2011 the digital elevation model dem provided by nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm at a spatial resolution of 0 0083 was used to delineate the lr basin boundary and derive flow direction and flow accumulation for use in crest snow huang et al 2018b generated a global monthly gridded 0 5 sectoral water withdrawal dataset for the period 1971 2010 using various sources of reported data and some spatial and temporal statistical downscaling algorithms this dataset comprises six water use sectors including irrigation living electricity generation cooling of thermal power plants livestock mining and manufacturing and was used here to partition the effects of human activities on streamflow 3 2 methodology 3 2 1 crest snow hydrologic model the coupled routing and excess storage crest model wang et al 2011 is a distributed hydrological model jointly developed by the university of oklahoma and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa servir project team http www servir net the crest model computes infiltration and runoff using the variable infiltration capacity curve updated from the xinanjiang model zhao 1992 and vic model liang et al 1996 and simulates sub grid cell routing in a study basin employing linear reservoirs which results in more accurate streamflow simulations than that using old routing methods shen et al 2016 wang et al 2011 crest has been coupled with a snow and glacier melting module based on the temperature index method chen et al 2017 in which wet bulb temperature was used in this study to partition total precipitation into solid and liquid phases because precipitating droplets e g rain sleet and snow have a temperature closer to wet bulb temperature than air temperature ding et al 2014 crest snow was set up at a spatial resolution of 0 0625 7 km at the equator to simulate daily streamflow at the yungjinghong gauging station on the lr the performance of the model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient with logarithmic values lognse correlation coefficient r and relative differences bias nse has been widely used to measure the overall performance of the hydrological model whereas lognse could better assess the simulation of low flows de vos and rientjes 2008 bias is defined as the sum of the difference between simulated and observed runoff divided by the sum of observed runoff 3 2 2 identification of streamflow break points the mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 was used to identify the break point of streamflow time series at the yunjinghong gauging station for the period 1980 2014 the intersection point approaches year 2008 corresponding to the year when the construction of the largest reservoir nuozhadu on the lr started and the river was intercepted the first reservoir on the lr manwan was under construction since 1987 based on the history of dam construction and trends in streamflow we divided the historical 35 year period 1980 2014 into three time windows 1 the baseline period 1980 1986 when no dam was constructed 2 the transition period 1987 2007 when small dams were constructed but there was no significant change in the trend of streamflow and 3 the post impact period 2008 2014 when large dams were constructed and significant changes on streamflow were observed daily streamflow observations during the baseline period were used to calibrate the model whereas streamflow observations during the transition period were used to validate the model because the streamflow did not significantly change during the transition period 3 2 3 contribution of climate change and human activities both climate change and human activities can alter the flow regime of the lr in this study crest snow and a method based on the budyko hypothesis were used to evaluate these impacts the total change in observed streamflow δ q can be attributed to the combined impacts of climate change δ q cc and human activities δ q ha 1 δ q δ q cc δ q ha o i o 0 where o i and o 0 are the observed mean annual streamflow m3 s for the assessment period transition or post impact period and the baseline period respectively streamflow simulation using crest snow represents the impacts of variability in precipitation and temperature that reflects a changing climate system on the flow regime crest snow was used to generate natural streamflow in response to climate change and variability the climate induced change in streamflow can be calculated as follows 2 δ q cc r i r 0 where r i is the simulated annual streamflow for the assessment period m3 s and r 0 is the simulated annual streamflow for the baseline period m3 s thus the human induced streamflow change can be calculated as the difference between δ q and δ q c c 3 δ q ha δ q δ q cc we defined i cc and i ha as the contributions of climate change and human activities to the total streamflow change 4 i cc δ q cc δ q cc δ q ha 100 i ha δ q ha δ q cc δ q ha 100 eqs 1 4 are also appropriate for seasonal analysis of contributions of climate change and human activities during wet season june november and dry season december may or monthly analysis the budyko framework has been widely used to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes guo et al 2015 li et al 2011 li et al 2017a in this study we decomposed the climate and human impacts based on the budyko hypothesis at the annual timescale to make a cross validation with our estimates from crest snow we adopted the ture pike equation pike 1964 and quantified the climate induced change δ q c c of streamflow 5 e p 1 2 0 5 6 e 0 p 7 δ q cc q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 where the climate dryness index is the ratio of the mean annual potential evapotranspiration e 0 to the mean annual precipitation p for the long term annual water balance soil water storage change is assumed to be negligible and the actual mean annual evapotranspiration e can be expressed as e p q in eq 5 3 2 4 partitioning effects of water use five water use sectors including irrigation living livestock mining and manufacturing of the global monthly gridded 0 5 sectoral water withdrawal dataset unit mm and dead reservoir capacity data listed in table 1 were used to partition the effects of human activities on the flow regime of the lr for the period 1980 2010 annual water use was calculated by spatially averaging water use values across all grid cells within the lr basin and then summing monthly values to obtain annual average values streamflow variation caused by each type of water use sectors was calculated using the mean annual water use value during the period 1987 2010 minus that during the baseline period 1980 1986 dead reservoir storage is referred to as water in a reservoir that cannot be drained by gravity through a dam s outlet works spillway or power plant intake we summed the dead reservoir storages of the completed reservoirs during 1987 2010 table 1 and converted the volumetric values into millimeters based on the drainage area of the lr basin for the convenience of comparison the total dead reservoir storage was used to characterize the streamflow change caused by reservoir construction 4 results 4 1 crest snow model simulations table 2 shows monthly performance metrics of the simulation with crest snow for the calibration period the nse and bias values were found to be 0 73 and 0 1 respectively for the validation period the nse and bias values were 0 53 and 0 12 some overestimates of streamflow were found particularly for the high peaks of 1992 1994 and 2006 as seen from fig 2 and we postulated that it might result from the overestimated precipitation estimates used in this study previous studies suggested that hydrological modeling with nse 0 50 can be considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 here crest snow for the overall period 1980 2007 showed satisfactory performance in terms of both nse 0 57 and r 0 85 the calibrated parameters were therefore considered suited to simulate natural streamflow note that low flows were simulated better than peak flows during the overall period with a higher lognse value 0 73 than nse 0 57 this is largely due to the impact of precipitation input we used meteorological data including precipitation potential evapotranspiration air temperature and wet bulb temperature for the later decades as input to simulate the historical natural streamflow for the transition period 1987 2007 and the post impact period 2008 2014 the results and analyses are presented in the following section 4 2 trend analysis of hydrological variables during 1980 2014 during 1980 2014 the proportional contribution of snowmelt to total basin discharge was relatively low 2 in the lr basin the impact of glacier meltwater on runoff was even lower 0 2 due to the very limited glacier coverage within the study basin fig 1 the simulation results therefore suggest that rainfall is the dominant factor affecting runoff in the lr basin because of the relatively low contributions of snow and glacier meltwater to total runoff time series of annual mean precipitation observed streamflow and simulated natural streamflow from 1980 to 2014 were shown in fig 3 both precipitation and simulated natural streamflow increased at a rate of 0 98 mm yr2 not significant and the simulated natural streamflow increased at a rate of 0 70 mm yr2 not significant natural runoff was simulated using the parameters calibrated for the baseline period and was assumed to have been influenced only by climate change which was also demonstrated by the high r value 0 91 between precipitation and the simulated natural streamflow note that during the period 1980 2014 mean annual temperature of the lr basin was rising at a rate of 0 023 c yr p 0 01 and snow and glacier meltwater increased at a rate of 0 064 mm yr2 p 0 05 however the observed streamflow exhibited a decreasing trend at a rate of 2 96 mm yr2 p 0 1 due to the combined effect of both climate change and human activities as seen from fig 3 the discrepancies between the observed streamflow and natural streamflow enlarged since 1987 due to reservoir construction demonstrating the nonnegligible impact of human activities on the flow regime of the lr at the seasonal scale the observed and simulated streamflow also showed considerable changes during the transition and post impact periods compared with the historical streamflow during the baseline period dashed lines in fig 4 show the observed streamflow at the yunjinghong gauging station for all three periods the dry season streamflow december may was lowest in the baseline period during the transition period the dry season streamflow showed a slight increase whereas the wet season streamflow june november showed little changes during the post impact period streamflow in both dry and wet seasons showed significant changes 20 and 40 compared with that during the baseline period which may be caused by reservoir construction and filling monthly simulated natural streamflow at the yunjinghong gauging station over the three periods is shown in fig 4 using solid lines the natural streamflow changed little in the wet season during the three periods in addition the observed streamflow deviated considerably from the simulated natural streamflow i e with large reservoir construction during the period 2008 2014 before year 2008 the difference between the observed and simulated natural discharge was apparently smaller at the monthly scale the observed streamflow showed a decrease of 40 56 in june september but an increase of 11 50 in march may on the mean discharge over the post impact period than that over the baseline period however the dam construction did not affect the timing of the peak flow that was still in august also the trend in low flows did not change with the february march low discharge period preceded by high discharge in january and followed by a sudden decline in march fig 5 shows time series of observed streamflow during the baseline period and during the first year after each of the six hydropower plants table 1 was put into operation the reservoir operation in the wet season became increasingly significant with more reservoirs built over time except 1994 because there was a severe drought in the lr basin around 1994 xu 2018 the inset in fig 5 shows that the effect of reservoirs on the dry season streamflow was not significant except 2013 when the dry season streamflow was almost highest among all years compared due to the completion of the nuozhadu reservoir räsänen et al 2017 made a comparison of observed streamflow of 2010 2014 to observed streamflow of a baseline period 1960 1990 at chiang sean in thailand nakhon phanom in vietnam and kratie in cambodia gauging stations in 2013 when all the reservoirs in the lr basin were completed the wet season streamflow at chiang saen was lower than that during the baseline period which applies to yunjinghong in our study however streamflow in july august and september of 2013 at nakhon phanom and kratie was even higher than that during the baseline period we could therefore infer that reservoirs constructed in the lr basin has a certain impact on streamflow in thailand but has a less impact on streamflow in vietnam and cambodia 4 3 quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities compared to the baseline period 1980 1986 when no dam was constructed significant changes 6 in mean annual streamflow occurred from 1987 to 2014 particularly after 2008 when streamflow decreased by 26 8 compared with the baseline period the contributions of climate change and human activities to changes in streamflow accounted for 57 and 43 for the transition time period 1987 2007 and 5 and 95 for the post impact period 2008 2014 respectively table 3 compared with the baseline period 1980 1986 during the transition time period only two large reservoirs manwan and dachaoshan were built with a total dead reservoir storage of 7 3 mm whereas two other reservoirs jinghong and xiaowan were still under construction the impact of human activities was therefore smaller than that of climate variation during this period indicating that reservoir construction and operations did not significantly impact the flow regime of the lr basin during the transition period during the post impact period all the six reservoirs were built including the reservoir with the largest annual regulation nuozhadu and the total dead storage capacity increased to 118 4 mm the construction of large reservoirs has led to a rapid increase in the impact of human activities on streamflow table 3 shows the contributions of climate change and human activities in each period after the reservoir was built during 1987 1996 manwan was the only reservoir on the lr and then dachaoshan was built and put into operation during 1997 2004 during 2005 2007 both xiaowan and jinghong were under construction and nuozhadu and gongguoqiao started to be built and put into operation during 2008 2012 all the reservoirs were completed during 2013 2014 it was found that first with increasing total dead storage of reservoirs on the lr the impact of human activities on streamflow was increasingly important second the impact of human activities was stronger when the time lag between the activation period of two reservoirs was shorter for example the impact of human activities was 52 3 during 1997 2004 when there was only one reservoir under construction it became 64 6 during 2005 2007 when two reservoirs were under construction and even raised to 90 5 during 2008 2012 when four reservoirs were built together the impact of human activities on streamflow slightly reduced during 2013 2014 when all reservoirs were put into operation and there was no need to fill dead water storage of reservoirs in addition to the simulation performed by the hydrological model the budyko framework was also used to separate the effects of climate change and human activities at the annual scale as shown in table 4 the contributions of climate change and human activities to the changes in streamflow accounted for 63 and 37 for the transition time period 1987 2007 and 1 and 99 for the post impact period 2008 2014 respectively the difference between the two methods was approximately within 6 at the seasonal scale during the transition period human activities accounted for 61 of wet season streamflow changes whereas climatic variation accounted for 60 of dry season streamflow changes similarly during the post impact period human activities accounted for 80 during the wet season whereas climate change accounted for 60 during the dry season these findings indicate that human activities had a relatively larger contribution during the wet season whereas climate change was the dominant factor affecting the dry season streamflow during the wet season human activities contributed more in the post impact period providing benefits to the lower reaches with regard to flood control for example the flood control standard of the jinghong reservoir increased from 20 years to 100 years after the completion of the nuozhadu reservoir at the monthly scale during the transition period the streamflow was mostly influenced by climate change except july august and october fig 6 the contribution of climatic variation in march was greatest accounting for 67 of the streamflow changes snow and glacier meltwater in spring march may increased by 39 compared with the baseline period and contributed to 4 5 of the spring streamflow therefore the change in streamflow was mainly attributed to the change in precipitation during the post impact period human activities contributed more to the changes in streamflow for most of months except february may and november fig 6 the contribution of human activities in june was greatest accounting for 97 of the streamflow changes this is consistent with the trends illustrated above that human activities were the dominant factor affecting changes in streamflow as the total reservoir dead storage capacity increased during the post impact period and human activities mainly affected the streamflow during the wet season 4 4 separating effects of human activities not only reservoir construction and operation but also other human interventions such as human water withdrawal changes and land cover changes might affect the flow regime of the lr fig 7 shows annual mean water withdrawal time series including irrigation livestock manufacturing domestic and mining and dead storage capacity of reservoirs in the lr basin the proportion of irrigation livestock manufacturing domestic and mining water use in total streamflow during the baseline period was 6 0 6 0 2 0 1 and 0 01 respectively it was found that irrigation the largest component of water withdrawal in the lr basin exhibited a decreasing trend whereas manufacturing and domestic water withdrawal was almost doubled and water withdrawal for other purposes remained almost steady under the impacts of human activities streamflow reduced by 50 mm in the lr basin during 1987 2010 compared with the baseline period water withdrawal was only increased by 0 8 mm compared with the baseline period that accounts for 1 6 of the streamflow change while the dead reservoir storage increased by 44 mm that accounts for 88 of the streamflow change the land cover in the mrb changed by only 0 57 during 2000 2010 implying that the land use change was not a significant factor affecting the streamflow among human activities li et al 2017a consequently we can draw a conclusion that reservoir construction was the primary factor among human activities that impacted the flow regime during 1987 2010 5 discussion this study evaluated annual seasonal and monthly changes in streamflow and attributed the changes to climate change and human activities in the lr basin over the time period 1980 2014 by applying the crest snow hydrological model and using long term streamflow observations at the yunjinghong gauging station crest snow was calibrated for both streamflow and snow allowing more reliable quantification of climate change impacts on streamflow runoff from the tp tends to be sensitive to climate change as a result of snow and glacier melting immerzeel et al 2009 jeelani et al 2012 finger et al 2015 indicated that use of streamflow alone can lead to unrealistic glacier mass balances and snow cover evolution the dual calibration with both streamflow and snow water equivalent performed in our study was therefore more appropriate to assess hydrological dynamics though it would cause a certain loss in streamflow simulation performance impacts of reservoir operations in the lr basin can be examined by looking at changes in streamflow between the baseline period 1980 1986 and the assessment period 1987 2014 in our study we found that reservoirs stored water during the wet season with streamflow decreased by 10 during the wet season of 1987 2014 compared with that of 1980 1986 and released water during the dry season with a 10 increase in streamflow our findings were consistent with the recent assessment on hydrological alterations at the chiang saen gauging station li et al 2017a räsänen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 such reservoir operations could bring great benefits to the downstream with increasing dry season flows supplementing water resources for irrigation and reducing wet season flows mitigating flood risks downstream for example influenced by the super el nino during the dry season of 2016 all countries in the lr mr basin suffered drought of varied degrees the chinese government implemented an emergency water supply to the mr by releasing water from the jinghong reservoir which effectively alleviated the drought condition in the lower reaches li et al 2017b however the building of large dams may cause geological damage affect fish migration and cost immense manpower material and financial resources pokhrel et al 2018 evaluation of effects of dams on rivers requires an integrated consideration of various factors such as hydrology ecology and economy as well regarding the attribution of changes in streamflow to climate change and human activities we compared our estimates with two published studies tang et al 2014 analyzed the contributions in the lr basin during 1956 2008 and found that climatic variation contributed more during the wet season whereas human activities contributed more during the dry season in contrary to our findings note that their study calibrated and validated streamflow at the monthly scale as opposed to the daily scale performed in our study the bp ann model they used to simulate the natural streamflow may not well reflect the underlying mechanisms and hydrological processes different time periods of these analyses may also be one of the reasons for the different findings in addition li et al 2017a used the budyko hypothesis to partition the effects of climate change and human activities on the streamflow changes and concluded that climate change contributed to 82 of the total streamflow change during the transition period 1992 2009 whereas human activities contributed to 62 of the total change during the post impact period 2010 2015 in the upper mrb with the basin outlet located at chiang saen which was highly consistent with our results furthermore the contribution of human activities was found to have decreased from 95 at yunjinghong to 62 at chiang saen the chiang saen gauging station in thailand is on the south of the yunjinghong gauging station with a warmer climate and much more precipitation some research showed that not only precipitation but also interval inflow between the yunjinghong and chiang saen gauging stations were important components of streamflow at the chiang saen station he et al 2006 it was therefore implied that precipitation is the main source of freshwater resources for the lower mrb and the impact of dam operations on the lr would become less important downstream still different study periods and analysis approaches may have induced some discrepancies in the results there are also limitations in this study the precipitation data that we used has some uncertainties precipitation is the primary forcing in hydrological models the lr originating on the tp at over 5100 m elevations has sparse in situ observations so the quality of the cgdpa precipitation product used in this study may be degraded relative to regions with denser observational networks in eastern and central china although some studies pan et al 2010 wang et al 2017 demonstrated that remote sensing precipitation products can be used to effectively simulate hydrological processes in basins including the mrb the currently available remote sensing products could not cover such a long time period from 1980 to 2014 more accurate precipitation products at higher spatial resolutions are expected to improve the model performance in the future also crest snow showed some degraded reproduction of the observed streamflow during the baseline period 1980 1986 fig 2 these inaccuracies might be associated with uncertainties in precipitation and calibration of the model parameters leading to uncertainties in differentiating the climate and human induced streamflow changes this study was conducted over the time period 1980 2014 when there were only six large reservoirs built on the mainstream of the lr the total dead reservoir storage of the six existing reservoirs represents 40 of the annual streamflow at the yunjinghong gauging station the magnitude of streamflow at yungjinghong would recover to a state prior to dam construction in the future if there is no filling of dead reservoir storage and water use does not largely increase there is a further need for estimating future impacts of climate change and hydropower development in the lr basin to provide a basis for water resources management especially for transboundary river management 6 conclusion this study aims to estimate streamflow changes caused by climate change and human activities in the lr basin over a historical 35 year period 1980 2014 using the crest snow hydrological model and streamflow observations at the yunjinghong gauging station crest snow was calibrated with streamflow and snow water equivalent data based on the history of dam construction and the intercept break point determined by the mann kendall test the 35 year period was partitioned into three time windows for our analysis and the contributions of climate change and human activities were investigated at annual seasonal and monthly scales the major findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 a significant change 6 in mean annual streamflow occurred during 1987 2014 compared with that of the baseline period especially after year 2008 when the largest hydropower plant nuozhadu in the mrb began to build increased streamflow during the dry season and decreased streamflow during the wet season were found 2 compared with the baseline period 1980 1986 climatic change and human activities contributed 57 and 43 to the streamflow changes for the transition time period 1987 2007 and 5 and 95 for the post impact period 2008 2014 respectively reservoir construction was the most significant factor affecting streamflow among human activities including agricultural industrial and domestic water uses 3 at the seasonal scale climatic variation contributed more during the dry season and precipitation change was the dominant factor that resulted in streamflow changes human activities were the dominant factor leading to streamflow changes during the wet season mainly through reservoir filling streamflow released from the reservoirs during the dry season could benefit irrigation and the reduced wet season discharge could mitigate food risks downstream overall this study can serve as a basis for understanding hydrological changes in dammed rivers and provide reference for water resources management for the transboundary lr mr basin projections of future runoff under climate change scenarios should consider reservoir construction and operation strategies and more research is needed to understand implications of the streamflow changes in the dammed river on hydropower generation ecosystems and society acknowledgement this study is supported by the

6694,the lancang river lr in china the upper portion of the mekong river which is among the world s most important transboundary rivers originates on the tibetan plateau and provides important freshwater resources for living agriculture industry and hydropower generation for millions of people downstream the natural flow regime of the lr is critical to sustain native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity however it has been changing due to the combined effect of climate change and human activities accurate quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on changes in the flow regime is a prerequisite for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection this study aims to evaluate climate and human induced impacts on the lr during 1980 2014 a distributed hydrological model crest snow combined with remote sensing and streamflow data and the budyko framework were jointly used to address this scientific question during three time windows determined by the mann kendall test and the history of dam construction results show that compared with the baseline period 1980 1986 when no dam was constructed significant changes 6 in mean annual streamflow occurred during 1987 2014 particularly after 2008 when the construction of the largest hydropower plant nuozhadu in the mekong river basin began climatic change contributed 57 to streamflow changes during the transition period 1987 2007 whereas human activities contributed 95 during the post impact period 2008 2014 at the seasonal scale climatic variation plays a more significant role during the dry season december may with precipitation the most important factor among climate variables whereas human activities contributed more during the wet season june november benefiting the downstream areas through mitigating floods among human activities reservoir construction is a dominant factor affecting streamflow over agricultural industrial and domestic water uses the findings of this study enhance our understanding of hydrological changes in the lr basin that may impact the lower mekong river serve as a basis for water resources and hydropower exploitation and environmental protection and highlight the need for considering reservoir operation strategies in streamflow projections in similar basins globally under climate change scenarios keywords streamflow

originates on the tibetan plateau tp and flows through qinghai tibet and yunnan provinces the lr provides important freshwater resources for domestic agricultural industrial uses and hydropower to china and downstream countries the natural flow regime of the lr is critical to native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in rivers poff et al 1997 in addition an improved understanding of the hydrology of the basin is the scientific foundation on integrated water resources management carlisle et al 2010 commission 2009 and on modeling potential changes in the streamflow of the lr in the future both climate change and human activities have exerted significant pressure on the lr first runoff from the tp tends to be sensitive to climate change as a result of changing precipitation and snow and glacier melting processes due to climate warming chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018 huang et al 2018a lauri et al 2012 long et al 2014 lutz et al 2014 tang et al 2018 second growing population leads to increased water resource and energy demands that may subsequently result in extensive hydropower exploitation in both the mainstream and tributaries of the lr pokhrel et al 2018 quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on the streamflow of the lr is therefore fundamental to water resource management and environmental protection and therefore has received considerable attention from the scientific community immerzeel et al 2009 jeelani et al 2012 räsänen et al 2017 recent studies associated with the impact of hydropower generation mainly focused on historical changes in streamflow of the lower mr cochrane et al 2014 lu et al 2014 mohammed et al 2018 räsänen et al 2012 räsänen et al 2017 lu et al 2014 and räsänen et al 2017 examined changes in river discharge at the chiang saen gauging station in northern thailand since 1960 whereas li et al 2017a used streamflow observations at five gauging stations along the mainstream of the mr to assess the alteration of flow regimes over the period of 1960 2014 these studies mostly compared the streamflow before and after dam construction based on streamflow observations and confirmed the significant effect of cascade reservoirs upstream however discrepancies of the findings exist due to different study periods and changes in the intra annual streamflow distribution lu et al 2014 found a 9 decrease in discharge at the chiang saen gauging station in august but a 15 increase in discharge in july over the post dam period 1992 2010 than that over the pre dam period 1960 1991 but räsänen et al 2017 found an increase of 121 187 in discharge during mar may and a decrease of 32 46 in discharge during july august in 2014 compared with the mean discharge over the period 1960 1990 at the chiang saen gauging station mohammed et al 2018 explored the variability in streamflow of the lower mr by examining changes in the upper mr inflow using a hydrological model moreover several studies simulated the effects of projected climate change scenarios and reservoir operation strategies on streamflow for example ngo et al 2016 applied the soil water assessment tool swat and water evaluation and planning weap models to the tributaries of the lower mr in vietnam and cambodia for the future period 2010 2100 to assess the impacts of different reservoir operation strategies on flow regimes wang et al 2017 adopted the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm to study the combined effect on floods in the mr basin from 2010 to 2099 indicating that reservoir operation could mitigate the effect of flood intensification caused by climate change before 2060 despite recent efforts the impacts of climate change and human activities on the streamflow of the lr have remained inadequately assessed first few studies quantified climate and human impacts on the historical streamflow of the lr tang et al 2014 used a back propagation artificial neural network bp ann model and concluded that human activities exerted a larger impact on streamflow changes in the lr than climatic variations 54 6 and 45 4 respectively during 1986 2008 second as mentioned above the lr has been less studied than the mr or only studied over a short time period tang et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 the lr originates at elevations of over 5100 m on the tp with its runoff sensitive to climate change as a result of snow and glacier melting immerzeel et al 2009 lutz et al 2014 assessing the hydrological impacts of climate change over the lr basin thus requires more sophisticated hydrological models with a snow and glacier module and adopts a multiple dataset calibration method to ensure both accurate simulation of streamflow and a reasonable contribution of snow and glacier meltwater to total runoff finger et al 2015 the overall objective of this study was therefore to quantify climate and human induced impacts on changes in streamflow of the lr during the period 1980 2014 to achieve this objective we relied on the coupled routing and excess storage crest model wang et al 2011 coupled with a snow and glacier melting module chen et al 2017 termed crest snow hereafter and streamflow observations at the yunjinghong gauging station at the outlet of the lr basin to generate historical natural streamflow we analyzed interannual seasonal and monthly changes in streamflow and quantified the contributions from climatic and anthropogenic effects in addition we partitioned the impacts of human activities during 1980 2010 based on a global monthly gridded 0 5 sectoral water withdrawal dataset huang et al 2018b the findings advance our understanding of hydrological changes in the lr basin and highlight the role of reservoir construction and operation in influencing streamflow regimes this study can serve as a basis for examining climate and human impacts on streamflow for dammed rivers and provide reference for projecting future streamflow changes particularly for snow fed rivers that are dictated by reservoir operation 2 study area the lr is located within the domain 22 05 33 40 n and 93 50 101 30 e in southwest china fig 1 with a total length of 2 140 km and a drainage area of 142 000 km2 long et al 2014 it has a complex terrain with a mean elevation of 3 300 m and an elevation difference of 5 500 m decreasing from the northwest to the southeast the lr features a humid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 735 mm based on a 35 year record 1980 2014 of the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa product shen and xiong 2016 the westerlies and indian monsoon bring abundant moisture and rainfall over the lr basin from june to september which accounts for nearly 70 of the annual rainfall correspondingly streamflow in the lr also exhibits strong seasonality with 70 of the annual discharge and the peak discharge normally occurring between august and september jacobs 2002 the unique geographical features and the large energy demand in yunnan province and eastern china have contributed to the burgeoning development of hydropower plants in the lr basin chen et al 2010 hennig et al 2013 the six largest dams storage capacity 1 hundred million m3 on the mainstream were included in our analysis with their detailed information listed in table 1 3 data and methods 3 1 data streamflow observations at the yunjinghong gauging station for the time period 1980 2014 were obtained from the china hydrology data project http depts washington edu shuiwen henck et al 2011 and local water resources administrations snow water equivalent swe was estimated based on a snow depth product from the environmental and ecological science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn che et al 2008 dai et al 2015 2012 and snow density calculated using in situ measured snow depth and snow pressure chen et al 2017 here the discharge and swe dataset were jointly used to calibrate crest snow and partial discharge data were used to validate the hydrological model the cgdpa precipitation product developed by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration was generated using rainfall measurements of 2400 national gauges and the climatological optimal interpolation oi algorithm shen and xiong 2016 http cdc nmic cn other meteorological data including daily time series of maximum mean and minimum air temperatures dew point temperature and pressure were obtained from the era interim product the latest global atmospheric reanalysis produced by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf both cgdpa and era meteorological data were converted from a resolution of 0 25 to a resolution of 0 0625 using the nearest neighbor method for driving the hydrological model daily temperature dew point temperature and pressure estimates for the period 1980 2014 were used to calculate wet bulb temperature and force crest snow era interim temperature estimates were used to estimate potential evapotranspiration according to the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 with the parameters adjusted to be applicable to southwest china hu et al 2011 the digital elevation model dem provided by nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm at a spatial resolution of 0 0083 was used to delineate the lr basin boundary and derive flow direction and flow accumulation for use in crest snow huang et al 2018b generated a global monthly gridded 0 5 sectoral water withdrawal dataset for the period 1971 2010 using various sources of reported data and some spatial and temporal statistical downscaling algorithms this dataset comprises six water use sectors including irrigation living electricity generation cooling of thermal power plants livestock mining and manufacturing and was used here to partition the effects of human activities on streamflow 3 2 methodology 3 2 1 crest snow hydrologic model the coupled routing and excess storage crest model wang et al 2011 is a distributed hydrological model jointly developed by the university of oklahoma and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa servir project team http www servir net the crest model computes infiltration and runoff using the variable infiltration capacity curve updated from the xinanjiang model zhao 1992 and vic model liang et al 1996 and simulates sub grid cell routing in a study basin employing linear reservoirs which results in more accurate streamflow simulations than that using old routing methods shen et al 2016 wang et al 2011 crest has been coupled with a snow and glacier melting module based on the temperature index method chen et al 2017 in which wet bulb temperature was used in this study to partition total precipitation into solid and liquid phases because precipitating droplets e g rain sleet and snow have a temperature closer to wet bulb temperature than air temperature ding et al 2014 crest snow was set up at a spatial resolution of 0 0625 7 km at the equator to simulate daily streamflow at the yungjinghong gauging station on the lr the performance of the model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient with logarithmic values lognse correlation coefficient r and relative differences bias nse has been widely used to measure the overall performance of the hydrological model whereas lognse could better assess the simulation of low flows de vos and rientjes 2008 bias is defined as the sum of the difference between simulated and observed runoff divided by the sum of observed runoff 3 2 2 identification of streamflow break points the mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 was used to identify the break point of streamflow time series at the yunjinghong gauging station for the period 1980 2014 the intersection point approaches year 2008 corresponding to the year when the construction of the largest reservoir nuozhadu on the lr started and the river was intercepted the first reservoir on the lr manwan was under construction since 1987 based on the history of dam construction and trends in streamflow we divided the historical 35 year period 1980 2014 into three time windows 1 the baseline period 1980 1986 when no dam was constructed 2 the transition period 1987 2007 when small dams were constructed but there was no significant change in the trend of streamflow and 3 the post impact period 2008 2014 when large dams were constructed and significant changes on streamflow were observed daily streamflow observations during the baseline period were used to calibrate the model whereas streamflow observations during the transition period were used to validate the model because the streamflow did not significantly change during the transition period 3 2 3 contribution of climate change and human activities both climate change and human activities can alter the flow regime of the lr in this study crest snow and a method based on the budyko hypothesis were used to evaluate these impacts the total change in observed streamflow δ q can be attributed to the combined impacts of climate change δ q cc and human activities δ q ha 1 δ q δ q cc δ q ha o i o 0 where o i and o 0 are the observed mean annual streamflow m3 s for the assessment period transition or post impact period and the baseline period respectively streamflow simulation using crest snow represents the impacts of variability in precipitation and temperature that reflects a changing climate system on the flow regime crest snow was used to generate natural streamflow in response to climate change and variability the climate induced change in streamflow can be calculated as follows 2 δ q cc r i r 0 where r i is the simulated annual streamflow for the assessment period m3 s and r 0 is the simulated annual streamflow for the baseline period m3 s thus the human induced streamflow change can be calculated as the difference between δ q and δ q c c 3 δ q ha δ q δ q cc we defined i cc and i ha as the contributions of climate change and human activities to the total streamflow change 4 i cc δ q cc δ q cc δ q ha 100 i ha δ q ha δ q cc δ q ha 100 eqs 1 4 are also appropriate for seasonal analysis of contributions of climate change and human activities during wet season june november and dry season december may or monthly analysis the budyko framework has been widely used to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes guo et al 2015 li et al 2011 li et al 2017a in this study we decomposed the climate and human impacts based on the budyko hypothesis at the annual timescale to make a cross validation with our estimates from crest snow we adopted the ture pike equation pike 1964 and quantified the climate induced change δ q c c of streamflow 5 e p 1 2 0 5 6 e 0 p 7 δ q cc q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 where the climate dryness index is the ratio of the mean annual potential evapotranspiration e 0 to the mean annual precipitation p for the long term annual water balance soil water storage change is assumed to be negligible and the actual mean annual evapotranspiration e can be expressed as e p q in eq 5 3 2 4 partitioning effects of water use five water use sectors including irrigation living livestock mining and manufacturing of the global monthly gridded 0 5 sectoral water withdrawal dataset unit mm and dead reservoir capacity data listed in table 1 were used to partition the effects of human activities on the flow regime of the lr for the period 1980 2010 annual water use was calculated by spatially averaging water use values across all grid cells within the lr basin and then summing monthly values to obtain annual average values streamflow variation caused by each type of water use sectors was calculated using the mean annual water use value during the period 1987 2010 minus that during the baseline period 1980 1986 dead reservoir storage is referred to as water in a reservoir that cannot be drained by gravity through a dam s outlet works spillway or power plant intake we summed the dead reservoir storages of the completed reservoirs during 1987 2010 table 1 and converted the volumetric values into millimeters based on the drainage area of the lr basin for the convenience of comparison the total dead reservoir storage was used to characterize the streamflow change caused by reservoir construction 4 results 4 1 crest snow model simulations table 2 shows monthly performance metrics of the simulation with crest snow for the calibration period the nse and bias values were found to be 0 73 and 0 1 respectively for the validation period the nse and bias values were 0 53 and 0 12 some overestimates of streamflow were found particularly for the high peaks of 1992 1994 and 2006 as seen from fig 2 and we postulated that it might result from the overestimated precipitation estimates used in this study previous studies suggested that hydrological modeling with nse 0 50 can be considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 here crest snow for the overall period 1980 2007 showed satisfactory performance in terms of both nse 0 57 and r 0 85 the calibrated parameters were therefore considered suited to simulate natural streamflow note that low flows were simulated better than peak flows during the overall period with a higher lognse value 0 73 than nse 0 57 this is largely due to the impact of precipitation input we used meteorological data including precipitation potential evapotranspiration air temperature and wet bulb temperature for the later decades as input to simulate the historical natural streamflow for the transition period 1987 2007 and the post impact period 2008 2014 the results and analyses are presented in the following section 4 2 trend analysis of hydrological variables during 1980 2014 during 1980 2014 the proportional contribution of snowmelt to total basin discharge was relatively low 2 in the lr basin the impact of glacier meltwater on runoff was even lower 0 2 due to the very limited glacier coverage within the study basin fig 1 the simulation results therefore suggest that rainfall is the dominant factor affecting runoff in the lr basin because of the relatively low contributions of snow and glacier meltwater to total runoff time series of annual mean precipitation observed streamflow and simulated natural streamflow from 1980 to 2014 were shown in fig 3 both precipitation and simulated natural streamflow increased at a rate of 0 98 mm yr2 not significant and the simulated natural streamflow increased at a rate of 0 70 mm yr2 not significant natural runoff was simulated using the parameters calibrated for the baseline period and was assumed to have been influenced only by climate change which was also demonstrated by the high r value 0 91 between precipitation and the simulated natural streamflow note that during the period 1980 2014 mean annual temperature of the lr basin was rising at a rate of 0 023 c yr p 0 01 and snow and glacier meltwater increased at a rate of 0 064 mm yr2 p 0 05 however the observed streamflow exhibited a decreasing trend at a rate of 2 96 mm yr2 p 0 1 due to the combined effect of both climate change and human activities as seen from fig 3 the discrepancies between the observed streamflow and natural streamflow enlarged since 1987 due to reservoir construction demonstrating the nonnegligible impact of human activities on the flow regime of the lr at the seasonal scale the observed and simulated streamflow also showed considerable changes during the transition and post impact periods compared with the historical streamflow during the baseline period dashed lines in fig 4 show the observed streamflow at the yunjinghong gauging station for all three periods the dry season streamflow december may was lowest in the baseline period during the transition period the dry season streamflow showed a slight increase whereas the wet season streamflow june november showed little changes during the post impact period streamflow in both dry and wet seasons showed significant changes 20 and 40 compared with that during the baseline period which may be caused by reservoir construction and filling monthly simulated natural streamflow at the yunjinghong gauging station over the three periods is shown in fig 4 using solid lines the natural streamflow changed little in the wet season during the three periods in addition the observed streamflow deviated considerably from the simulated natural streamflow i e with large reservoir construction during the period 2008 2014 before year 2008 the difference between the observed and simulated natural discharge was apparently smaller at the monthly scale the observed streamflow showed a decrease of 40 56 in june september but an increase of 11 50 in march may on the mean discharge over the post impact period than that over the baseline period however the dam construction did not affect the timing of the peak flow that was still in august also the trend in low flows did not change with the february march low discharge period preceded by high discharge in january and followed by a sudden decline in march fig 5 shows time series of observed streamflow during the baseline period and during the first year after each of the six hydropower plants table 1 was put into operation the reservoir operation in the wet season became increasingly significant with more reservoirs built over time except 1994 because there was a severe drought in the lr basin around 1994 xu 2018 the inset in fig 5 shows that the effect of reservoirs on the dry season streamflow was not significant except 2013 when the dry season streamflow was almost highest among all years compared due to the completion of the nuozhadu reservoir räsänen et al 2017 made a comparison of observed streamflow of 2010 2014 to observed streamflow of a baseline period 1960 1990 at chiang sean in thailand nakhon phanom in vietnam and kratie in cambodia gauging stations in 2013 when all the reservoirs in the lr basin were completed the wet season streamflow at chiang saen was lower than that during the baseline period which applies to yunjinghong in our study however streamflow in july august and september of 2013 at nakhon phanom and kratie was even higher than that during the baseline period we could therefore infer that reservoirs constructed in the lr basin has a certain impact on streamflow in thailand but has a less impact on streamflow in vietnam and cambodia 4 3 quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities compared to the baseline period 1980 1986 when no dam was constructed significant changes 6 in mean annual streamflow occurred from 1987 to 2014 particularly after 2008 when streamflow decreased by 26 8 compared with the baseline period the contributions of climate change and human activities to changes in streamflow accounted for 57 and 43 for the transition time period 1987 2007 and 5 and 95 for the post impact period 2008 2014 respectively table 3 compared with the baseline period 1980 1986 during the transition time period only two large reservoirs manwan and dachaoshan were built with a total dead reservoir storage of 7 3 mm whereas two other reservoirs jinghong and xiaowan were still under construction the impact of human activities was therefore smaller than that of climate variation during this period indicating that reservoir construction and operations did not significantly impact the flow regime of the lr basin during the transition period during the post impact period all the six reservoirs were built including the reservoir with the largest annual regulation nuozhadu and the total dead storage capacity increased to 118 4 mm the construction of large reservoirs has led to a rapid increase in the impact of human activities on streamflow table 3 shows the contributions of climate change and human activities in each period after the reservoir was built during 1987 1996 manwan was the only reservoir on the lr and then dachaoshan was built and put into operation during 1997 2004 during 2005 2007 both xiaowan and jinghong were under construction and nuozhadu and gongguoqiao started to be built and put into operation during 2008 2012 all the reservoirs were completed during 2013 2014 it was found that first with increasing total dead storage of reservoirs on the lr the impact of human activities on streamflow was increasingly important second the impact of human activities was stronger when the time lag between the activation period of two reservoirs was shorter for example the impact of human activities was 52 3 during 1997 2004 when there was only one reservoir under construction it became 64 6 during 2005 2007 when two reservoirs were under construction and even raised to 90 5 during 2008 2012 when four reservoirs were built together the impact of human activities on streamflow slightly reduced during 2013 2014 when all reservoirs were put into operation and there was no need to fill dead water storage of reservoirs in addition to the simulation performed by the hydrological model the budyko framework was also used to separate the effects of climate change and human activities at the annual scale as shown in table 4 the contributions of climate change and human activities to the changes in streamflow accounted for 63 and 37 for the transition time period 1987 2007 and 1 and 99 for the post impact period 2008 2014 respectively the difference between the two methods was approximately within 6 at the seasonal scale during the transition period human activities accounted for 61 of wet season streamflow changes whereas climatic variation accounted for 60 of dry season streamflow changes similarly during the post impact period human activities accounted for 80 during the wet season whereas climate change accounted for 60 during the dry season these findings indicate that human activities had a relatively larger contribution during the wet season whereas climate change was the dominant factor affecting the dry season streamflow during the wet season human activities contributed more in the post impact period providing benefits to the lower reaches with regard to flood control for example the flood control standard of the jinghong reservoir increased from 20 years to 100 years after the completion of the nuozhadu reservoir at the monthly scale during the transition period the streamflow was mostly influenced by climate change except july august and october fig 6 the contribution of climatic variation in march was greatest accounting for 67 of the streamflow changes snow and glacier meltwater in spring march may increased by 39 compared with the baseline period and contributed to 4 5 of the spring streamflow therefore the change in streamflow was mainly attributed to the change in precipitation during the post impact period human activities contributed more to the changes in streamflow for most of months except february may and november fig 6 the contribution of human activities in june was greatest accounting for 97 of the streamflow changes this is consistent with the trends illustrated above that human activities were the dominant factor affecting changes in streamflow as the total reservoir dead storage capacity increased during the post impact period and human activities mainly affected the streamflow during the wet season 4 4 separating effects of human activities not only reservoir construction and operation but also other human interventions such as human water withdrawal changes and land cover changes might affect the flow regime of the lr fig 7 shows annual mean water withdrawal time series including irrigation livestock manufacturing domestic and mining and dead storage capacity of reservoirs in the lr basin the proportion of irrigation livestock manufacturing domestic and mining water use in total streamflow during the baseline period was 6 0 6 0 2 0 1 and 0 01 respectively it was found that irrigation the largest component of water withdrawal in the lr basin exhibited a decreasing trend whereas manufacturing and domestic water withdrawal was almost doubled and water withdrawal for other purposes remained almost steady under the impacts of human activities streamflow reduced by 50 mm in the lr basin during 1987 2010 compared with the baseline period water withdrawal was only increased by 0 8 mm compared with the baseline period that accounts for 1 6 of the streamflow change while the dead reservoir storage increased by 44 mm that accounts for 88 of the streamflow change the land cover in the mrb changed by only 0 57 during 2000 2010 implying that the land use change was not a significant factor affecting the streamflow among human activities li et al 2017a consequently we can draw a conclusion that reservoir construction was the primary factor among human activities that impacted the flow regime during 1987 2010 5 discussion this study evaluated annual seasonal and monthly changes in streamflow and attributed the changes to climate change and human activities in the lr basin over the time period 1980 2014 by applying the crest snow hydrological model and using long term streamflow observations at the yunjinghong gauging station crest snow was calibrated for both streamflow and snow allowing more reliable quantification of climate change impacts on streamflow runoff from the tp tends to be sensitive to climate change as a result of snow and glacier melting immerzeel et al 2009 jeelani et al 2012 finger et al 2015 indicated that use of streamflow alone can lead to unrealistic glacier mass balances and snow cover evolution the dual calibration with both streamflow and snow water equivalent performed in our study was therefore more appropriate to assess hydrological dynamics though it would cause a certain loss in streamflow simulation performance impacts of reservoir operations in the lr basin can be examined by looking at changes in streamflow between the baseline period 1980 1986 and the assessment period 1987 2014 in our study we found that reservoirs stored water during the wet season with streamflow decreased by 10 during the wet season of 1987 2014 compared with that of 1980 1986 and released water during the dry season with a 10 increase in streamflow our findings were consistent with the recent assessment on hydrological alterations at the chiang saen gauging station li et al 2017a räsänen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 such reservoir operations could bring great benefits to the downstream with increasing dry season flows supplementing water resources for irrigation and reducing wet season flows mitigating flood risks downstream for example influenced by the super el nino during the dry season of 2016 all countries in the lr mr basin suffered drought of varied degrees the chinese government implemented an emergency water supply to the mr by releasing water from the jinghong reservoir which effectively alleviated the drought condition in the lower reaches li et al 2017b however the building of large dams may cause geological damage affect fish migration and cost immense manpower material and financial resources pokhrel et al 2018 evaluation of effects of dams on rivers requires an integrated consideration of various factors such as hydrology ecology and economy as well regarding the attribution of changes in streamflow to climate change and human activities we compared our estimates with two published studies tang et al 2014 analyzed the contributions in the lr basin during 1956 2008 and found that climatic variation contributed more during the wet season whereas human activities contributed more during the dry season in contrary to our findings note that their study calibrated and validated streamflow at the monthly scale as opposed to the daily scale performed in our study the bp ann model they used to simulate the natural streamflow may not well reflect the underlying mechanisms and hydrological processes different time periods of these analyses may also be one of the reasons for the different findings in addition li et al 2017a used the budyko hypothesis to partition the effects of climate change and human activities on the streamflow changes and concluded that climate change contributed to 82 of the total streamflow change during the transition period 1992 2009 whereas human activities contributed to 62 of the total change during the post impact period 2010 2015 in the upper mrb with the basin outlet located at chiang saen which was highly consistent with our results furthermore the contribution of human activities was found to have decreased from 95 at yunjinghong to 62 at chiang saen the chiang saen gauging station in thailand is on the south of the yunjinghong gauging station with a warmer climate and much more precipitation some research showed that not only precipitation but also interval inflow between the yunjinghong and chiang saen gauging stations were important components of streamflow at the chiang saen station he et al 2006 it was therefore implied that precipitation is the main source of freshwater resources for the lower mrb and the impact of dam operations on the lr would become less important downstream still different study periods and analysis approaches may have induced some discrepancies in the results there are also limitations in this study the precipitation data that we used has some uncertainties precipitation is the primary forcing in hydrological models the lr originating on the tp at over 5100 m elevations has sparse in situ observations so the quality of the cgdpa precipitation product used in this study may be degraded relative to regions with denser observational networks in eastern and central china although some studies pan et al 2010 wang et al 2017 demonstrated that remote sensing precipitation products can be used to effectively simulate hydrological processes in basins including the mrb the currently available remote sensing products could not cover such a long time period from 1980 to 2014 more accurate precipitation products at higher spatial resolutions are expected to improve the model performance in the future also crest snow showed some degraded reproduction of the observed streamflow during the baseline period 1980 1986 fig 2 these inaccuracies might be associated with uncertainties in precipitation and calibration of the model parameters leading to uncertainties in differentiating the climate and human induced streamflow changes this study was conducted over the time period 1980 2014 when there were only six large reservoirs built on the mainstream of the lr the total dead reservoir storage of the six existing reservoirs represents 40 of the annual streamflow at the yunjinghong gauging station the magnitude of streamflow at yungjinghong would recover to a state prior to dam construction in the future if there is no filling of dead reservoir storage and water use does not largely increase there is a further need for estimating future impacts of climate change and hydropower development in the lr basin to provide a basis for water resources management especially for transboundary river management 6 conclusion this study aims to estimate streamflow changes caused by climate change and human activities in the lr basin over a historical 35 year period 1980 2014 using the crest snow hydrological model and streamflow observations at the yunjinghong gauging station crest snow was calibrated with streamflow and snow water equivalent data based on the history of dam construction and the intercept break point determined by the mann kendall test the 35 year period was partitioned into three time windows for our analysis and the contributions of climate change and human activities were investigated at annual seasonal and monthly scales the major findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 a significant change 6 in mean annual streamflow occurred during 1987 2014 compared with that of the baseline period especially after year 2008 when the largest hydropower plant nuozhadu in the mrb began to build increased streamflow during the dry season and decreased streamflow during the wet season were found 2 compared with the baseline period 1980 1986 climatic change and human activities contributed 57 and 43 to the streamflow changes for the transition time period 1987 2007 and 5 and 95 for the post impact period 2008 2014 respectively reservoir construction was the most significant factor affecting streamflow among human activities including agricultural industrial and domestic water uses 3 at the seasonal scale climatic variation contributed more during the dry season and precipitation change was the dominant factor that resulted in streamflow changes human activities were the dominant factor leading to streamflow changes during the wet season mainly through reservoir filling streamflow released from the reservoirs during the dry season could benefit irrigation and the reduced wet season discharge could mitigate food risks downstream overall this study can serve as a basis for understanding hydrological changes in dammed rivers and provide reference for water resources management for the transboundary lr mr basin projections of future runoff under climate change scenarios should consider reservoir construction and operation strategies and more research is needed to understand implications of the streamflow changes in the dammed river on hydropower generation ecosystems and society acknowledgement this study is supported by the
