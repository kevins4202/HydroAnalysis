24830,calibration is essential to reduce the uncertainty caused by model parameters in applying multiple models ensemble however the method to consistently calibrate multiple crop models is still lack to date with the three widely used crop models ceres cropsim and nwheat embedded in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat v 4 7 this study develops a calibration method by

three models show a large variation in simulating wheat maturity date and yield components after using regionally calibrated parameters models ability and consistency in reproducing past wheat growth have been improved furthermore the three model ensemble exhibits better performance than most of the individual models in simulating the phenology and yield the results of this study indicate that a

reproduce and simulate interactions among environments management practices and crop genetic traits sun et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2019 many crop models such as dssat apsim epic have been used to examine the impacts of climate change on crop growth rosenzweig et al 2014 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 asseng et al 2019 analyzing yield gaps maria et al 2018 zu et al 2018 and optimizing crop management practices such as irrigation timing and amount jiang et al 2015 attia et al 2016 nutrient management hammad et al 2018 hoffmann et al 2018 and sowing dates ahmed et al 2016 hunt et al 2019 nevertheless the confidence in model results requires fine tuning of specific model parameters and also an evaluation on the accuracy of a model in reproducing real field observations a procedure known as model s calibration and validation xiong et al 2008 the calibration and validation process can determine to what extent a crop model can reproduce the observations such as crop phenology and yield component in specific environments xiong et al 2008 commonly researches conduct the crop model simulations in specific plots with a single model in these simulations the calibration and validation can be easily applied with detailed inputs related to crop growth and development soil weather and crop management leading to higher accuracy regarding the agreement between simulated and observed results ahmed et al 2016 battisti et al 2017 however upscaling the models to larger geographic scales for example a whole country tends to decrease the efficiency of the calibration and validation due partly to data limitation and lack of widely accepted approach xiong et al 2014a in addition using multiple crop models in ensemble format has become increasingly popular as a means to reduce uncertainty asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 however there are limited studies to date in developing methods to obtain comparable and consistent genetic coefficients across multiple crop models particularly for the simulations at large scales previous studies involving multiple crop models usually only presented simulation outputs with calibration being conducted by separated teams asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 even employed calibrations were included in the paper methods related to the generation of coefficients across multiple models were varying and unclear ahmed et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 according to a survey conducted by the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip issues related to model calibration have been recognized as a significant barrier for multiple models application such as no clear guidelines in calibration for multiple models variations in data required for the calibration the numbers of parameters calibrated and calibrations methods seidel et al 2018 because of these issues developing a transparent consistent and comparable calibration approach across multiple models is essential to facilitate the use of multiple crop models hussain et al 2018 seidel et al 2018 although many studies have used crop models to simulate wheat growth in china xiong et al 2008 xiao and tao 2014 chen et al 2018 sun et al 2018 limited studies were focusing on the calibration applicable for multiple crop models using the data from field observations while for a simulation at the national scale the international maize and wheat improvement center cimmyt developed the concept of crop mega environments mes to target germplasm development and release rajaram et al 2002 mega environments are defined as geographical regions that share similar abiotic and biotic constraints production needs consumer preferences and productivity levels they were initially targeted for wheat breeding and germplasm development rajaram et al 2002 wang et al 2018 and have a distribution covering the entire globe s wheat producing areas the 12 mes which are not necessarily contiguous and frequently transcontinental are largely based on climate indicators and irrigation conditions rajaram et al 2002 previous national wheat simulation studies in china usually use the distribution of agro ecological zones aezs for wheat xiong et al 2008 tao et al 2012 however in comparison to aezs the mes system has a broader application that encompasses the globe rather than countries or regions gbegbelegbe et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the global mes map is publicly available from cimmyt public website 1 1 https data cimmyt org dataset xhtml persistentid hdl 11529 10625 this wide adaptability of me can help scientists compare the genetic coefficient of wheat cultivars in different countries or regions located in the same me more than comparing varieties me can aid scientists in studying the performance of cultivar traits across large regions around the globe some studies have used the mes to calibrate the genetic coefficients across various environments with emphasis on the global scale asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 gbegbelegbe et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however few studies have applied mes to wheat in china although most wheat cultivars grown in china have genetic origins in material developed by cimmyt the objectives of this study are to calibrate wheat cultivar coefficients for three wheat crop models embedded in dssat wheat models and upscale the model application for the whole of china by using the mes system in china the fundamental goal of this study is to develop a transparent consistent and simple calibration approach across multiple models facilitating the multiple models assembly

1 2 2 crop model description the study used the ceres cropsim and nwheat that are embedded in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat v4 7 jones et al 2003 all models run on a daily time step and have been widely used to investigate interactions among cultivars managements and environment asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 ruane et al 2016 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 fronzek et al 2018 the three models simulate crop phenology based on zadok s scheme accumulation of degree days zadoks et al 1974 babel et al 2019 in the simulation environments growth and development processes of wheat such as leaf expansion and biomass accumulation are influenced by environmental factors and nutrient stress jones et al 2003 kassie et al 2016 in addition leaf senescence parameters consisting of maximum or minimum temperatures are included only in nwheat to accelerate the leaf senescence at appropriate phenological stages asseng et al 2004 kassie et al 2016 the models estimate potential biomass yield by using the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation par with a radiation use efficiency parameter and stress factors andarzian et al 2015 kassie et al 2016 gbegbelegbe et al 2017 2 3 data and resources field data on wheat phenological development anthesis and maturity dates and yield components kernel weight and number and grain yield and management practices sowing dates seed rates nutrient and irrigation application rates and dates fig 2 were available from experimental research stations conducted and maintained by the chinese meteorological agency tao et al 2006 kernel weight in this study was as 1000 grain weights and kernel number was as the numbers of the kernel in 10000 m2 for this study long time series field data from 2000 to 2010 were selected to represent recently released cultivars for calibration and validation within each me field data were selected based on the following rules 1 fields were located in the primary production regions for wheat 2 fields in specific years do not endure significant yield damage due to pests weeds or severe weather and 3 all fields in specific years were irrigated and had fertilizers applied to allow each me to have enough data points for both calibration and validation the study randomly selected 50 data consisting of 43 points from 23 sites for calibration with the remaining data comprising of 45 points from 26 sites for validation table s1 observational data for each location geo coordinates and altitude crop phenology sowing emergency jointing anthesis and maturity dates select yield

at 0 083 resolution created by koo and dimes 2013 the 27 soil profiles in hc27 are generated in a compatible format with dssat and apsim the boundary conditions are defined based on soil profiles

combination of three major texture types clay loam sand organic carbon levels high medium low and depths shallow medium deep table s2 2 4 inputs and settings for crop models simulation for regional calibration and validation in mes the weather and soil information were extracted from the 50 50 km grid cells climate data set and the hc27 soil data set respectively based on the longitude and latitude of field experiment sites crop cultivar genetic coefficients of each me for ceres were originally derived from gbegbelegbe et al 2017 then revised based on field experiments and experts knowledge revised cultivar genetic coefficients were changed into the cropsim and nwheat according to their definition and units all sites or grid cells in the same me were assumed to share the same cultivar coefficients all agronomic management data used corresponded precisely to the practices applied in field experimental plots table s1 2 5 model calibration and validation at the regional scale four key crop phenotypes including phonologies of anthesis and maturity durations yield components of kernel weight and kernel number were used for model calibration and validation according to prior studies xiong et al 2008 gbegbelegbe et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 this study selected eight parameters 2 2 ceres p1v optimum vernalizing temperature required for

calibrate the three models the eight parameters were correlated or linked between the models according to their definitions and units in the calibration the models were initialized with the default cultivar genetic parameters then the simulation was repeated with adjusted parameter varying within the specified range by a small interval the value ranges for each parameter were kept similar among the three models to achieve consistent results across the models most parameters explicitly and exclusively corresponded to specific crop physiological processes so the calibration can be conducted separately for parameter group and evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed crop phenotype such as flowering date kernel number the overall calibration for the whole of china followed five steps as follows 1 default simulation this simulation indicates a regional simulation with the original cultivar genetic coefficient combinations preset for the seven mes the original coefficients were obtained from a site specific calibration and validation study for the globe and ceres gbegbelegbe et al 2017 and revised using field experiment data and experts knowledge revised crop coefficients were then translated into the cropsim and nwheat according to their definition and units 2 anthesis date simulation this is the simulation only calibrating flowering related parameters four parameters were calibrated for each wheat model and each of the seven mes ceres p1v2 p1d2 p12 phint2 cropsim vreq2 pps12 p12 phint2 nwheat vsen2 ppsen2 p12 phint2 adjusting the range and step of each parameter for each me and each crop model were shown in table 1 for each me the models were operated across all sites with all possible combinations of the four parameters with the remaining parameters as the default simulation the combinations that reached the least bias between simulated and observed anthesis date across all sites were determined for the me the four parameters interacted with each other and jointly determined the anthesis date leading to many coefficient combinations for one simulated flowering date to optimize the parameters while increasing the mechanism representation we applied a rule to the selection by comparing the wheat vernalization coefficient p1v2 vreq2 vsen2 across the seven mes the value of the vernalization coefficient in me of spring wheat was always smaller than the value in me of facultative wheat and value in me of facultative wheat was smaller than the value in me of winter wheat 3 maturity date simulation this is the same simulation group as the anthesis date simulation but adjusting the parameter of p52 p82 p52 in ceres cropsim and nwheat respectively 4 kernel number simulation same as the simulation group 3 but varying the parameter of g12 g wts2 grno2 in ceres cropsim and nwheat respectively 5 kernel weight simulation this is a simulation group with the combination of two parameters in each wheat model ceres g22 g32 cropsim gwts2 shwts2 nwheat mxfil2 stmmx2 2 6 model performance evaluation statistical indicators including root mean square error rmse eq 1 normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 2 between simulated and measured values mean bias error mbe eq 3 and index of agreement wilmott index wi index eq 4 were used to evaluate the agreement between observed and simulated values the nrmse provides the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the error for example the simulation is considered excellent accuracy with nrmse 10 appropriate accuracy with nrmse from 10 to 20 middle accuracy with nrmse values range from 20 to 30 poor accuracy with nrmse values 30 aghelpour and varshavian 2020 the mbe measures whether the simulated values tended to overestimate mbe 0 or underestimate mbe 0 the observed data the wi value ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 denoting a perfect match between the observed and simulated data in addition 1 1 line was also applied to graphs of simulated vs observed data to indicate the fit performance within the many statistical indexes the minimum root mean square error rmse and its relative term nrmse between observed and simulated values are the key indicators chosen in the study to determine the coefficients and evaluate the model performance parameter angulo et al 2013 seidel et al 2018 1 r m s e i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 n 2 n r m s e r m s e o b s m a x o

samples 3 results 3 1 simulation of wheat phenology and yield with parameters from a site calibration simulated wheat phenology with default parameters exhibited a general overestimation across all mes and for all the three wheat crop models fig 3 4 simulated anthesis dates were overestimated by 16 19 days d with nrmse values 10 fig 3 however there were no significant differences among the three crop models in simulating anthesis date in contrast the difference between the three crop models in simulated maturity dates was prominent especially for me2 fig 4 for example cropsim and nwheat depicted a maturity length of around 400 days in me2 while ceres produced a shorter period of only around 200 days fig 4 the large difference between simulated and observed maturity dates for cropsim and nwheat in me2 led to the low correlation between the simulated and observed maturity dates in the regional simulation with a wi less than 0 6 fig 4 in contrast simulations with default parameters exhibited a general underestimation in yield across the mes and the three models fig 5 simulated yields by the ceres showed the least bias with the nrmse of 21 6 in the calibration and 24 6 in the validation compared to the observation the ceres simulations predicted a lower yield by 499 2 to 237 1 kg ha however simulated yield by nwheat appeared the largest bias with yield underestimation by 2132 6 1451 5 kg ha and the nrmse of 38 8 39 1 for kernel number the ceres produced a slight overestimate by 1 905 2 482 number 10000m2 while the cropsim showed underestimations by 111 675 number 10000m2 fig 6 kernel weight was consistently and largely underestimated by all the three models with nrmse ranging from 36 1 to 57 8 fig 7 the absolute difference between the simulation and observation in kernel weight was smallest for the ceres 7 4 8 0 g while the largest for the nwheat 11 1 13 1 g fig 7 the large underestimation in kernel weight simulation has considerable influence on the estimate of final yield largely resulting in the widespread underestimation of the grain yield even taking into account the possible compensation of overestimation in kernel number by some models such as the ceres 3 2 simulation of wheat phenology and yield with parameters from me based regional calibration table 2 presents the parameter combinations optimized for each me and crop model after the five steps of the regional calibration these parameters led to the least simulation bias over the simulation sites for each me in general the difference in parameter value for any given me between crop models was small particularly for models of ceres and cropsim after the calibration all three models exhibited excellent performance for the simulations of crop phenology this was indicated by the wi close to 1 suggesting the models captured 100 observed variation the small mbe implying no obvious underestimate or overestimate and the nrmse less than 4 in all cases suggesting a minor bias simulated wheat phenology day to anthesis and mature with regionally calibrated parameters in seven mes by the three crop models are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 for the anthesis date the rmse was generally less than 6 d substantially reducing the bias in the default simulation 13 d by 50 the nrmse for the anthesis date averaged across the models and calibration validation datasets was less than 4 corresponding to 8 decrease of bias from the default parameters fig 8 compared to the simulations with default parameters the regional calibration substantially reduced the bias on the maturity date leading to a mean rmse of 5 3 d and nrmse of 3 4 across the three models fig 9 the improvement mainly occurred in the models of cropsim and nwheat in me2 by using parameters calibrated from specific sites all three models especially the cropsim and nwheat predicted an unusual long maturity duration in the me2 because of the cold temperature in this mountainous area although wheat is not the popular crop in this area the significant bias in me2 indicates the uncertainty and weakness of models for use in high altitudes although models defects for representing the cold damages can contribute to the error the regional calibration by including all sites in the procedure can largely reduce the uncertainty and increase the model suitability in this area in contrast the regional calibration imposed limited improvement on the simulations of yield and yield components for the kernel numbers the nrmse ranged from 15 1 23 4 across the models corresponding to around 4 1 12 1 improvement compared to the simulations with default cultivar parameters fig 10 after the calibration the model of nwheat still could not adequately simulate the kernel number while the ceres and cropsim moderately increased the simulation observation fit however the values of wi indicated that crop models simulation on kernel numbers was better than the simulations on kernel weights in all cases simulated kernel weight with calibrated parameters still underestimated the observations by 8 12 4 95 g with a slight improvement in decreasing the underestimation 3 g from the simulations with default parameters fig 11 the nrmse spanned from 29 2 to 42 4 and the wi ranged from 0 35 to 0 53 for the kernel weight simulations this also indicated the poor performance of the models in predicting the kernel weight even after calibration simulation performances in wheat yield across the seven mes and the three models were shown in fig 12 compared to simulations with default parameters the nrmse values decreased by more than 3 model evaluation indices wi 0 60 0 86 mbe 1270 1 100 8 kg ha rmse 1150 8 1966 7 kg ha and nrmse 15 9 27 1 confirmed the accuracy and robustness of all models based on the criteria that nrmse values 20 are good it indicated that ceres and cropsim showed improved performance than nwheat in simulating yield in wheat mes of china 3 3 simulation of wheat phenology and yield with the model ensemble compared to individual models the model ensemble decreased the nrmse of simulation phenology in general for the anthesis date the nrmse of the ensemble was smaller than ceres and cropsim but larger than nwheat fig 13 for maturity date the ensemble predicted a larger nrmse than ceres but smaller than cropsim and nwheat in yield and yield components the model ensemble also tended to reduce the bias comparing to individual models fig 14 for yield the rmse and nrmse in the ensemble were 1226 5 kg ha and 16 9 with validation dataset lower than the value with the model of ceres and nwheat but higher than cropsim for simulated yield components of kernel number and weight the three models existed large variations the nrmse in predicting kernel number and kernel weight were 16 6 and 33 with validation dataset higher than the results by models of ceres and cropsim but lower than the model of nwheat whereas the nrmse in kernel weight was higher than ceres but lower than cropsim and nwheat overall the results implied that model ensemble generally showed higher accuracy than individual models in simulating wheat yield and yield components and could be comparable with the best model 4 discussion 4 1 consistent calibration method across the models even although model ensemble consisting of multiple crop models has become popular recently due to its advantages there are great inconsistencies in practices to calibrate these models resulting in additional uncertainty in the assembly asseng et al 2013 seidel et al 2018 many researchers described their calibration procedures in literature include ceres wheat apsim wheat wofost xiong et al 2008 asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 however these studies used diverse input data different parameters and specific calibration methods contributing to simulation uncertainty in the crop model ensemble asseng et al 2013 seidel et al 2018 gao et al 2020 in addition these studies paid more attention to the differences in model abilities in reproducing observed field data asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 but neglecting the uncertainties arising from the calibration process as crop models are the most significant uncertainty source in the model ensemble asseng et al 2013 increasing the consistency of model parameters across the multiple crop models could be beneficial to increase the simulation certainty related to future climate change impacts on crop growth to this end this study develops a consistent calibration method for three wheat crop models in dssat4 7 and optimizes eight cultivar parameters associated to similar physiological processes across the models xiong et al 2008 gbegbelegbe et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 the eight parameters were divided into four groups related to phenology and yield corresponding to the crop phenotype of anthesis maturity kernel number and kernel weight in the calibration the adjusted range of each parameter was kept similar in order to attain a uniform response in the three crop models table 1 furthermore the determined parameters are not only the combination that obtained the least bias between the observations and simulations but also are comparable across the three models to represent a similar physiological procedure based on this calibration similar parameters across the models were obtained for each me resulting in the small difference between the models in simulated phenology and yield compared to previous regional calibration by using only a single wheat model in china xiong et al 2008 simulated error by using the model ensemble has substantially decreased particularly after the regional calibration and for the simulations of phenology this underscores the advantages of multiple models calibration method and highlights the importance of calibration to assist the application of the multi model method furthermore because the eight parameters in three wheat models used in this study were consistent and comparable the uncertainty resulted from model parameters was likely reduced although this study only chooses three models because they are embedded in the dssat package this calibration method can also be extended to include other wheat models when the models share similar structure and coefficients definition for example many studies have started to include models coming from different development teams like dssat wofost to optimize the agronomic management under climate change rodríguez et al 2019 in addition this study first uses the wheat me classification in china to optimize the model coefficients as the me system characterizes the environment and management heterogeneity for breeding purposes linking models calibration with the me system allows the simulations to provide useful information for breeders such as environment and genotype optimization overall the findings of this study showcase the possibility of calibrating multiple models in a consistent way facilitating the application of multiple models ensemble in climate change impact assessments 4 2 ensemble model performance the crop model ensemble gives valuable information about model accuracy and uncertainty compared to the single model for example it can be used to create new estimators with improved accuracy and consistency in simulating growth dynamics martre et al 2015 based on five crop multimodel ensembles by 25 crop models wallach et al 2018 showed that the ensemble predictors have the higher skill and are better than individual models in various environments and for different responding variables the conclusion was in line with an earlier finding from an ensemble with a small number of models palosuo et al 2011 in this study we showed that the models ensemble was comparable to the outputs of the best individual model for the prediction of wheat phenology and yield in china these findings provide the experiences about multiple models ensemble of wheat in china contributing to the fast increasing multiple model ensembles applications in the future nevertheless multiple model ensemble still subjects to uncertainty from the model parameterization wallach et al 2017 an ensemble with more models means more parameters implying an increased workload for parameterization maiorano et al 2017 in this study we calibrated eight parameters across the three crop models with the same four processes and importantly the parameters were physiologically linked to represent specific phenotype compared to the calibration for a single model our calibration did not significantly increase the computation cost and labor workload but added certainty to the simulations however the efficiency of multiple model calibration was based on the selection of crop models the similarity of the model structure complexity and parameter definitions for example in an ensemble with 15 crop models with contrasting structure and parameters maiorano et al 2017 had to calibrate each model with varying parameters from 3 to 35 substantially increasing the labor costs and the knowledge requirements for modelers to conduct the model ensemble furthermore including contrasting models in the ensemble likely reduces the robustness of the result indicated by the different predictions between the ensembles by different model combinations rodríguez et al 2019 therefore increasing the consistency in the calibration across multiple models through the identification of right models is essential to promote the application of the modeling ensemble 4 3 uncertainties as indicated by previous studies van oijen et al 1999 seidel et al 2018 uncertainty in crop model simulation can arise from three sources 1 model structure 2 input data 3 model parameters structural uncertainty is because models do not include all relevant explanatory variables seidel et al 2018 for example the model ceres and cropsim did not simulate the leaf senescence process adding additional uncertainty in this research a prior study showed that the uncertainty resulted from the model structure was bigger than model parameters wallach et al 2017 although many researches have tried to reduce the uncertainty resulted from model structure seide et al 2018 model structure improvement is always needed with the increasing understandings second crop model inputs are affected by limitations in data availability and high spatial or temporal variability seide et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 showed that better quality spatial input data that closely representing the wider range of growing condiction in the research region would be essential to reduce the uncertainty of crop models in this study the hc27 generic soil profile database koo and dimes 2013 were used due to the unavailability of fine scale digital soil mapping and site specific soil measurements using more detailed gridded soil information might increase model performance reducing the uncertainty arising from the input data third model parameterization is another source of uncertainty wallach et al 2017 previous researches have placed great efforts to explore various genetic coefficients effect on model performance and showed that six was the medium number of calibrated parameters seidel et al 2018 although sensitivity analysis has recommended identifying the most sensitive parameters choosing how many and which parameters to calibrate is still an issue in crop model calibration seidel et al 2018 in this research eight similar parameters in three wheat models were calibrated based on previous experience but may not include all the coefficients that are important to regulate the yield response nevertheless based on the available input data seven wheat mes in china were calibrated and were validated by three wheat crop models with a consistent method following this improved calibration process all models were able to simulate wheat phenology and yield components with a relative certainty for wheat in china this process and result provide the guideline and promise for future studies that apply the multiple wheat crop growth models to wheat mega environments in china and other regions in the world 5 conclusions although ceres wheat cropsim wheat and dssat nwheat models have been widely used limited studies have carried out a consistent calibration of phenology and yield components at a regional scale in consideration of wheat growing mega environments in china here a consistent calibration method was developed to optimize eight genetic parameters for three crop models based on the field observations and the wheat growing mega environments the three models were calibrated synchronously models performances were measured on phenology anthesis and maturity date grain yield components kernel weight and kernel numbers and yield by four statistical indicators after the consistent calibration all three crop models adequately reproduced historical wheat phenology and yield variations the three model ensemble performed better than most individual models overall this study contributes to the modelling community by developing a guideline and providing a consistent method to calibrate multiple crop models in different growing mega environments further research will focus on the improvement of models and make consistent calibration among multiple models more realistic and practical credit author statements huan liu data curation simulation conduction writing original draft preparation diego n l pequeno methodology reviewing and editing ixchel

management practices such as irrigation timing and amount jiang et al 2015 attia et al 2016 nutrient management hammad et al 2018 hoffmann et al 2018 and sowing dates ahmed et al 2016 hunt et al 2019 nevertheless the confidence in model results requires fine tuning of specific model parameters and also an evaluation on the accuracy of a model in reproducing real field observations a procedure known as model s calibration and validation xiong et al 2008 the calibration and validation process can determine to what extent a crop model can reproduce the observations such as crop phenology and yield component in specific environments xiong et al 2008 commonly researches conduct the crop model simulations in specific plots with a single model in these simulations the calibration and validation can be easily applied with detailed inputs related to crop growth and development soil weather and crop management leading to higher accuracy regarding the agreement between simulated and observed results ahmed et al 2016 battisti et al 2017 however upscaling the models to larger geographic scales for example a whole country tends to decrease the efficiency of the calibration and validation due partly to data limitation and lack of widely accepted approach xiong et al 2014a in addition using multiple crop models in ensemble format has become increasingly popular as a means to reduce uncertainty asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 however there are limited studies to date in developing methods to obtain comparable and consistent genetic coefficients across multiple crop models particularly for the simulations at large scales previous studies involving multiple crop models usually only presented simulation outputs with calibration being conducted by separated teams asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 even employed calibrations were included in the paper methods related to the generation of coefficients across multiple models were varying and unclear ahmed et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 according to a survey conducted by the agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip issues related to model calibration have been recognized as a significant barrier for multiple models application such as no clear guidelines in calibration for multiple models variations in data required for the calibration the numbers of parameters calibrated and calibrations methods seidel et al 2018 because of these issues developing a transparent consistent and comparable calibration approach across multiple models is essential to facilitate the use of multiple crop models hussain et al 2018 seidel et al 2018 although many studies have used crop models to simulate wheat growth in china xiong et al 2008 xiao and tao 2014 chen et al 2018 sun et al 2018 limited studies were focusing on the calibration applicable for multiple crop models using the data from field observations while for a simulation at the national scale the international maize and wheat improvement center cimmyt developed the concept of crop mega environments mes to target germplasm development and release rajaram et al 2002 mega environments are defined as geographical regions that share similar abiotic and biotic constraints production needs consumer preferences and productivity levels they were initially targeted for wheat breeding and germplasm development rajaram et al 2002 wang et al 2018 and have a distribution covering the entire globe s wheat producing areas the 12 mes which are not necessarily contiguous and frequently transcontinental are largely based on climate indicators and irrigation conditions rajaram et al 2002 previous national wheat simulation studies in china usually use the distribution of agro ecological zones aezs for wheat xiong et al 2008 tao et al 2012 however in comparison to aezs the mes system has a broader application that encompasses the globe rather than countries or regions gbegbelegbe et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the global mes map is publicly available from cimmyt public website 1 1 https data cimmyt org dataset xhtml persistentid hdl 11529 10625 this wide adaptability of me can help scientists compare the genetic coefficient of wheat cultivars in different countries or regions located in the same me more than comparing varieties me can aid scientists in studying the performance of cultivar traits across large regions around the globe some studies have used the mes to calibrate the genetic coefficients across various environments with emphasis on the global scale asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 gbegbelegbe et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however few studies have applied mes to wheat in china although most wheat cultivars grown in china have genetic origins in material developed by cimmyt the objectives of this study are to calibrate wheat cultivar coefficients for three wheat crop models embedded in dssat wheat models and upscale the model application for the whole of china by using the mes system in china the fundamental goal of this study is to develop a transparent consistent and simple calibration approach across multiple models facilitating the multiple models assembly

daily time step and have been widely used to investigate interactions among cultivars managements and environment asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 ruane et al 2016 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 fronzek et al 2018 the three models simulate crop phenology based on zadok s scheme accumulation of degree days zadoks et al 1974 babel et al 2019 in the simulation environments growth and development processes of wheat such as leaf expansion and biomass accumulation are influenced by environmental factors and nutrient stress jones et al 2003 kassie et al 2016 in addition leaf senescence parameters consisting of maximum or minimum temperatures are included only in nwheat to accelerate the leaf senescence at appropriate phenological stages asseng et al 2004 kassie et al 2016 the models estimate potential biomass yield by using the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation par with a radiation use efficiency parameter and stress factors andarzian et al 2015 kassie et al 2016 gbegbelegbe et

dates seed rates nutrient and irrigation application rates and dates fig 2 were available from experimental research stations conducted and maintained by the chinese meteorological agency tao et al 2006 kernel weight in this study was as 1000 grain weights and kernel number was as the numbers of the kernel in 10000 m2 for this study long time series field data from 2000 to 2010 were selected to represent recently released cultivars for calibration and validation within each me field data were selected based on the following rules 1 fields were located in the primary production regions for wheat 2 fields in specific years do not endure significant yield damage due to pests weeds or severe weather and 3 all fields in specific years were irrigated and had fertilizers applied to allow each me to have enough data points for both calibration and validation the study randomly selected 50 data consisting of 43 points from 23 sites for calibration with the remaining data comprising of 45 points from 26 sites for validation table s1 observational data for each location geo coordinates and altitude crop phenology sowing emergency jointing anthesis and maturity dates select yield

latitude of field experiment sites crop cultivar genetic coefficients of each me for ceres were originally derived from gbegbelegbe et al 2017 then revised based on field experiments and experts knowledge revised cultivar genetic coefficients were changed into the cropsim and nwheat according to their definition and units all sites or grid cells in the same me were assumed to share the same cultivar coefficients all agronomic management data used corresponded precisely to the practices applied in field experimental plots table s1 2 5 model calibration and validation at the regional scale four key crop phenotypes including phonologies of anthesis and maturity durations yield components of kernel weight and kernel number were used for model calibration and validation according to prior studies xiong et al 2008 gbegbelegbe et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 this study selected eight parameters 2 2 ceres p1v optimum vernalizing temperature required for

calibrate the three models the eight parameters were correlated or linked between the models according to their definitions and units in the calibration the models were initialized with the default cultivar genetic parameters then the simulation was repeated with adjusted parameter varying within the specified range by a small interval the value ranges for each parameter were kept similar among the three models to achieve consistent results across the models most parameters explicitly and exclusively corresponded to specific crop physiological processes so the calibration can be conducted separately for parameter group and evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed crop phenotype such as flowering date kernel number the overall calibration for the whole of china followed five steps as follows 1 default simulation this simulation indicates a regional simulation with the original cultivar genetic coefficient combinations preset for the seven mes the original coefficients were obtained from a site specific calibration and validation study for the globe and ceres gbegbelegbe et al 2017 and revised using field experiment data and experts knowledge revised crop coefficients were then translated into the cropsim and nwheat according to their definition and units 2 anthesis date simulation this is the simulation only calibrating flowering related parameters four parameters were calibrated for each wheat model and each of the seven mes ceres p1v2 p1d2 p12 phint2 cropsim vreq2 pps12 p12 phint2 nwheat vsen2 ppsen2 p12 phint2 adjusting the range and step of each parameter for each me and each crop model were shown in table 1 for each me the models were operated across all sites with all possible combinations of the four parameters with the remaining parameters as the default simulation the combinations that reached the least bias between simulated and observed anthesis date across all sites were determined for the me the four parameters interacted with each other and jointly determined the anthesis date leading to many coefficient combinations for one simulated flowering date to optimize the parameters while increasing the mechanism representation we applied a rule to the selection by comparing the wheat vernalization coefficient p1v2 vreq2 vsen2 across the seven mes the value of the vernalization coefficient in me of spring wheat was always smaller than the value in me of facultative wheat and value in me of facultative wheat was smaller than the value in me of winter wheat 3 maturity date simulation this is the same simulation group as the anthesis date simulation but adjusting the parameter of p52 p82 p52 in ceres cropsim and nwheat respectively 4 kernel number simulation same as the simulation group 3 but varying the parameter of g12 g wts2 grno2 in ceres cropsim and nwheat respectively 5 kernel weight simulation this is a simulation group with the combination of two parameters in each wheat model ceres g22 g32 cropsim gwts2 shwts2 nwheat mxfil2 stmmx2 2 6 model performance evaluation statistical indicators including root mean square error rmse eq 1 normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 2 between simulated and measured values mean bias error mbe eq 3 and index of agreement wilmott index wi index eq 4 were used to evaluate the agreement between observed and simulated values the nrmse provides the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the error for example the simulation is considered excellent accuracy with nrmse 10 appropriate accuracy with nrmse from 10 to 20 middle accuracy with nrmse values range from 20 to 30 poor accuracy with nrmse values 30 aghelpour and varshavian 2020 the mbe measures whether the simulated values tended to overestimate mbe 0 or underestimate mbe 0 the observed data the wi value ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 denoting a perfect match between the observed and simulated data in addition 1 1 line was also applied to graphs of simulated vs observed data to indicate the fit performance within the many statistical indexes the minimum root mean square error rmse and its relative term nrmse between observed and simulated values are the key indicators chosen in the study to determine the coefficients and evaluate the model performance parameter angulo et al 2013 seidel et al 2018 1 r m s e i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 n 2 n r m s e r m s e o b s m a x o

mes and for all the three wheat crop models fig 3 4 simulated anthesis dates were overestimated by 16 19 days d with nrmse values 10 fig 3 however there were no significant differences among the three crop models in simulating anthesis date in contrast the difference between the three crop models in simulated maturity dates was prominent especially for me2 fig 4 for example cropsim and nwheat depicted a maturity length of around 400 days in me2 while ceres produced a shorter period of only around 200 days fig 4 the large difference between simulated and observed maturity dates for cropsim and nwheat in me2 led to the low correlation between the simulated and observed maturity dates in the regional simulation with a wi less than 0 6 fig 4 in contrast simulations with default parameters exhibited a general underestimation in yield across the mes and the three models fig 5 simulated yields by the ceres showed the least bias with the nrmse of 21 6 in the calibration and 24 6 in the validation compared to the observation the ceres simulations predicted a lower yield by 499 2 to 237 1 kg ha however simulated yield by nwheat appeared the largest bias with yield underestimation by 2132 6 1451 5 kg ha and the nrmse of 38 8 39 1 for kernel number the ceres produced a slight overestimate by 1 905 2 482 number 10000m2 while the cropsim showed underestimations by 111 675 number 10000m2 fig 6 kernel weight was consistently and largely underestimated by all the three models with nrmse ranging from 36 1 to 57 8 fig 7 the absolute difference between the simulation and observation in kernel weight was smallest for the ceres 7 4 8 0 g while the largest for the nwheat 11 1 13 1 g fig 7 the large underestimation in kernel weight simulation has considerable influence on the estimate of final yield largely resulting in the widespread underestimation of the grain yield even taking into account the possible compensation of overestimation in kernel number by some models such as the ceres 3 2 simulation of wheat phenology and yield with parameters from me based regional calibration table 2 presents the parameter combinations optimized for each me and crop model after the five steps of the regional calibration these parameters led to the least simulation bias over the simulation sites for each me in general the difference in parameter value for any given me between crop models was small particularly for models of ceres and cropsim after the calibration all three models exhibited excellent performance for the simulations of crop phenology this was indicated by the wi close to 1 suggesting the models captured 100 observed variation the small mbe implying no obvious underestimate or overestimate and the nrmse less than 4 in all cases suggesting a minor bias simulated wheat phenology day to anthesis and mature with regionally calibrated parameters in seven mes by the three crop models are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 for the anthesis date the rmse was generally less than 6 d substantially reducing the bias in the default simulation 13 d by 50 the nrmse for the anthesis date averaged across the models and calibration validation datasets was less than 4 corresponding to 8 decrease of bias from the default parameters fig 8 compared to the simulations with default parameters the regional calibration substantially reduced the bias on the maturity date leading to a mean rmse of 5 3 d and nrmse of 3 4 across the three models fig 9 the improvement mainly occurred in the models of cropsim and nwheat in me2 by using parameters calibrated from specific sites all three models especially the cropsim and nwheat predicted an unusual long maturity duration in the me2 because of the cold temperature in this mountainous area although wheat is not the popular crop in this area the significant bias in me2 indicates the uncertainty and weakness of models for use in high altitudes although models defects for representing the cold damages can contribute to the error the regional calibration by including all sites in the procedure can largely reduce the uncertainty and increase the model suitability in this area in contrast the regional calibration imposed limited improvement on the simulations of yield and yield components for the kernel numbers the nrmse ranged from 15 1 23 4 across the models corresponding to around 4 1 12 1 improvement compared to the simulations with default cultivar parameters fig 10 after the calibration the model of nwheat still could not adequately simulate the kernel number while the ceres and cropsim moderately increased the simulation observation fit however the values of wi indicated that crop models simulation on kernel numbers was better than the simulations on kernel weights in all cases simulated kernel weight with calibrated parameters still underestimated the observations by 8 12 4 95 g with a slight improvement in decreasing the underestimation 3 g from the simulations with default parameters fig 11 the nrmse spanned from 29 2 to 42 4 and the wi ranged from 0 35 to 0 53 for the kernel weight simulations this also indicated the poor performance of the models in predicting the kernel weight even after calibration simulation performances in wheat yield across the seven mes and the three models were shown in fig 12 compared to simulations with default parameters the nrmse values decreased by more than 3 model evaluation indices wi 0 60 0 86 mbe 1270 1 100 8 kg ha rmse 1150 8 1966 7 kg ha and nrmse 15 9 27 1 confirmed the accuracy and robustness of all models based on the criteria that nrmse values 20 are good it indicated that ceres and cropsim showed improved performance than nwheat in simulating yield in wheat mes of china 3 3 simulation of wheat phenology and yield with the model ensemble compared to individual models the model ensemble decreased the nrmse of simulation phenology in general for the anthesis date the nrmse of the ensemble was smaller than ceres and cropsim but larger than nwheat fig 13 for maturity date the ensemble predicted a larger nrmse than ceres but smaller than cropsim and nwheat in yield and yield components the model ensemble also tended to reduce the bias comparing to individual models fig 14 for yield the rmse and nrmse in the ensemble were 1226 5 kg ha and 16 9 with validation dataset lower than the value with the model of ceres and nwheat but higher than cropsim for simulated yield components of kernel number and weight the three models existed large variations the nrmse in predicting kernel number and kernel weight were 16 6 and 33 with validation dataset higher than the results by models of ceres and cropsim but lower than the model of nwheat whereas the nrmse in kernel weight was higher than ceres but lower than cropsim and nwheat overall the results implied that model ensemble generally showed higher accuracy than individual models in simulating wheat yield and yield components and could be comparable with the best model 4 discussion 4 1 consistent calibration method across the models even although model ensemble consisting of multiple crop models has become popular recently due to its advantages there are great inconsistencies in practices to calibrate these models resulting in additional uncertainty in the assembly asseng et al 2013 seidel et al 2018 many researchers described their calibration procedures in literature include ceres wheat apsim wheat wofost xiong et al 2008 asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 however these studies used diverse input data different parameters and specific calibration methods contributing to simulation uncertainty in the crop model ensemble asseng et al 2013 seidel et al 2018 gao et al 2020 in addition these studies paid more attention to the differences in model abilities in reproducing observed field data asseng et al 2013 martre et al 2015 but neglecting the uncertainties arising from the calibration process as crop models are the most significant uncertainty source in the model ensemble asseng et al 2013 increasing the consistency of model parameters across the multiple crop models could be beneficial to increase the simulation certainty related to future climate change impacts on crop growth to this end this study develops a consistent calibration method for three wheat crop models in dssat4 7 and optimizes eight cultivar parameters associated to similar physiological processes across the models xiong et al 2008 gbegbelegbe et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 the eight parameters were divided into four groups related to phenology and yield corresponding to the crop phenotype of anthesis maturity kernel number and kernel weight in the calibration the adjusted range of each parameter was kept similar in order to attain a uniform response in the three crop models table 1 furthermore the determined parameters are not only the combination that obtained the least bias between the observations and simulations but also are comparable across the three models to represent a similar physiological procedure based on this calibration similar parameters across the models were obtained for each me resulting in the small difference between the models in simulated phenology and yield compared to previous regional calibration by using only a single wheat model in china xiong et al 2008 simulated error by using the model ensemble has substantially decreased particularly after the regional calibration and for the simulations of phenology this underscores the advantages of multiple models calibration method and highlights the importance of calibration to assist the application of the multi model method furthermore because the eight parameters in three wheat models used in this study were consistent and comparable the uncertainty resulted from model parameters was likely reduced although this study only chooses three models because they are embedded in the dssat package this calibration method can also be extended to include other wheat models when the models share similar structure and coefficients definition for example many studies have started to include models coming from different development teams like dssat wofost to optimize the agronomic management under climate change rodríguez et al 2019 in addition this study first uses the wheat me classification in china to optimize the model coefficients as the me system characterizes the environment and management heterogeneity for breeding purposes linking models calibration with the me system allows the simulations to provide useful information for breeders such as environment and genotype optimization overall the findings of this study showcase the possibility of calibrating multiple models in a consistent way facilitating the application of multiple models ensemble in climate change impact assessments 4 2 ensemble model performance the crop model ensemble gives valuable information about model accuracy and uncertainty compared to the single model for example it can be used to create new estimators with improved accuracy and consistency in simulating growth dynamics martre et al 2015 based on five crop multimodel ensembles by 25 crop models wallach et al 2018 showed that the ensemble predictors have the higher skill and are better than individual models in various environments and for different responding variables the conclusion was in line with an earlier finding from an ensemble with a small number of models palosuo et al 2011 in this study we showed that the models ensemble was comparable to the outputs of the best individual model for the prediction of wheat phenology and yield in china these findings provide the experiences about multiple models ensemble of wheat in china contributing to the fast increasing multiple model ensembles applications in the future nevertheless multiple model ensemble still subjects to uncertainty from the model parameterization wallach et al 2017 an ensemble with more models means more parameters implying an increased workload for parameterization maiorano et al 2017 in this study we calibrated eight parameters across the three crop models with the same four processes and importantly the parameters were physiologically linked to represent specific phenotype compared to the calibration for a single model our calibration did not significantly increase the computation cost and labor workload but added certainty to the simulations however the efficiency of multiple model calibration was based on the selection of crop models the similarity of the model structure complexity and parameter definitions for example in an ensemble with 15 crop models with contrasting structure and parameters maiorano et al 2017 had to calibrate each model with varying parameters from 3 to 35 substantially increasing the labor costs and the knowledge requirements for modelers to conduct the model ensemble furthermore including contrasting models in the ensemble likely reduces the robustness of the result indicated by the different predictions between the ensembles by different model combinations rodríguez et al 2019 therefore increasing the consistency in the calibration across multiple models through the identification of right models is essential to promote the application of the modeling ensemble 4 3 uncertainties as indicated by previous studies van oijen et al 1999 seidel et al 2018 uncertainty in crop model simulation can arise from three sources 1 model structure 2 input data 3 model parameters structural uncertainty is because models do not include all relevant explanatory variables seidel et al 2018 for example the model ceres and cropsim did not simulate the leaf senescence process adding additional uncertainty in this research a prior study showed that the uncertainty resulted from the model structure was bigger than model parameters wallach et al 2017 although many researches have tried to reduce the uncertainty resulted from model structure seide et al 2018 model structure improvement is always needed with the increasing understandings second crop model inputs are affected by limitations in data availability and high spatial or temporal variability seide et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 showed that better quality spatial input data that closely representing the wider range of growing condiction in the research region would be essential to reduce the uncertainty of crop models in this study the hc27 generic soil profile database koo and dimes 2013 were used due to the unavailability of fine scale digital soil mapping and site specific soil measurements using more detailed gridded soil information might increase model performance reducing the uncertainty arising from the input data third model parameterization is another source of uncertainty wallach et al 2017 previous researches have placed great efforts to explore various genetic coefficients effect on model performance and showed that six was the medium number of calibrated parameters seidel et al 2018 although sensitivity analysis has recommended identifying the most sensitive parameters choosing how many and which parameters to calibrate is still an issue in crop model calibration seidel et al 2018 in this research eight similar parameters in three wheat models were calibrated based on previous experience but may not include all the coefficients that are important to regulate the yield response nevertheless based on the available input data seven wheat mes in china were calibrated and were validated by three wheat crop models with a consistent method following this improved calibration process all models were able to simulate wheat phenology and yield components with a relative certainty for wheat in china this process and result provide the guideline and promise for future studies that apply the multiple wheat crop growth models to wheat mega environments in china and other regions in the world 5 conclusions although ceres wheat cropsim wheat and dssat nwheat models have been widely used limited studies have carried out a consistent calibration of phenology and yield components at a regional scale in consideration of wheat growing mega environments in china here a consistent calibration method was developed to optimize eight genetic parameters for three crop models based on the field observations and the wheat growing mega environments the three models were calibrated synchronously models performances were measured on phenology anthesis and maturity date grain yield components kernel weight and kernel numbers and yield by four statistical indicators after the consistent calibration all three crop models adequately reproduced historical wheat phenology and yield variations the three model ensemble performed better than most individual models overall this study contributes to the modelling community by developing a guideline and providing a consistent method to calibrate multiple crop models in different growing mega environments further research will focus on the improvement of models and make consistent calibration among multiple models more realistic and practical credit author statements huan liu data curation simulation conduction writing original draft preparation diego n l pequeno methodology reviewing and editing ixchel

24831,studying the influence of changing environmental conditions on antarctic marine benthic invertebrates is strongly constrained by limited access to the region which poses difficulties to performing long term experimental studies ecological modelling has been increasingly used as a potential alternative to assess the impact of such changes on species distribution or physiological performance among ecological models the dynamic energy budget deb approach represents each individual through four energetic compartments i e reserve structure maturation and reproduction from which energy is allocated in contrasting proportions according to different life stages and to two forcing environmental factors food resources and temperature in this study the example of an abundant coastal limpet nacella concinna strebel 1908 was studied the species is known to have intertidal and subtidal morphotypes genetically similar but physiologically and morphologically contrasting the objectives of this paper are 1 to evaluate the potential of the deb approach and assess whether a deb model can be separately built for the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes based on a field experiment and data from literature and 2 to analyse whether models are contrasting enough to reflect the known physiological and morphological differences between the morphotypes we found only minor differences in temperature corrected parameter values between both populations meaning that the observed differences can be only explained by differences in environmental conditions i e deb considered variables food resources and temperature but also other variables not considered by deb despite the known morphological difference between the populations the difference in shape coefficients was small this study shows that even with the amount of data so far available in the literature deb models can already be applied to some southern ocean case studies but more data are required to accurately model the physiological and morphological differences between individuals keywords ecological modelling southern ocean marine benthic species model relevance model accuracy 1 introduction antarctic regions have faced strong environmental change since the twentieth century recently reviewed in henley et al 2019 with a strong warming in some regions such as in the western antarctic peninsula king et al 2003 vaughan et al 2003 meredith and king 2005 leading to important shifts in sea ice regimes and seasonality including the duration and extent of sea ice cover stammerjohn et al

to species in other regions peck and brey 1996 peck 2002 the limpet nacella concinna strebel 1908 mollusca patellogastropoda is a common and abundant gastropod of shallow marine benthic communities distributed all along the western antarctic peninsula gonzález wevar et al 2011 phylogeny recently reviewed in gonzález wevar et al 2018 it has widely been studied for decades shabica 1971 1976 walker

pattern it is sexually mature after four to six years and has a life span of up to 10 years shabica 1976 picken 1980 brêthes et al 1994 the limpet mainly feeds on microphytobenthos and microalgae shabica 1976 brêthes et al 1994 it spawns free swimming planktonic larvae once a year when water temperature rises in the austral summer shabica 1971 picken 1980 picken and allan 1983 larvae drift in the water column and metamorphose after more than two months stanwell smith and clarke 1998 n concinna does not have a homing behaviour stanwell smith and clarke 1998 weihe and abele 2008 suda et al 2015 and intertidal individuals can either migrate to subtidal areas in winter to escape freezing air temperatures that may drop below 20 c walker 1972 branch 1981 brêthes et al 1994 or shelter in rock cracks and crevices in the intertidal area in the latter case they do not become dormant but have a limited access to microphytobenthos as recently observed around adelaide island obermüller et al 2011 two morphotypes of n concinna have been distinguished an intertidal and a subtidal type with the intertidal type having a taller heavier and thicker shell compared to the subtidal one that is characterized by a lighter and flatter shell beaumont and wei 1991 hoffman et al 2010 initially strebel 1908 and powell 1951 referred to these two morphotypes as the polaris intertidal and concinna types below 4m depth from that point the potential genetic differentiation between the two morphotypes has been investigated some of the studies concluding an absence of genetic distinction wei 1988 beaumont and wei 1991 nolan 1991 while contrarily de aranzamendi et al 2008 reported significant differences based on inter simple sequence repeat issr markers more recently this last method was questioned hoffman et al 2010 and several studies using different markers and populations chwedorzewska et al 2010 hoffman et al 2010 gonzález wevar et al 2011 have concluded an absence of genetic differentiation between the two morphotypes apart from the absence of genetic differences intertidal and subtidal populations strongly contrast in morphology and physiology which has been explained by the prevalence of habitat heterogeneity and strong environmental gradients along rocky shore habitats a common feature also observed in other gastropods johannesson 2003 butlin et al 2008 hoffman et al 2010 for instance in n concinna the higher shell thickness observed in the shallow morphotype was hypothesised to play a role in resistance against crushing pack ice shabica 1971 morley et al 2010 intertidal morphotypes are further resistant to air exposure thanks to higher shells bigger inner volumes relative to their shell circumference a combination that makes them more efficient than subtidal individuals able to store more water and oxygen reducing desiccation risks and delaying the metabolic switch to anaerobic fermentation nolan 1991 weihe and abele 2008 the subtidal morphotype has also proved to be less resistant to cold than the intertidal population waller et al 2006 due to extra production of mucus and stress proteins in intertidal morphotypes clark et al 2008 clark and peck 2009 obermüller et al 2011 and due to diverse metabolic processes that contrast between both populations reviewed in suda et al 2015 the development of ecological models enables precise models to be built that highlight subtle differences in parameters between ecologically similar or closely related species freitas et al 2010 holsman et al 2016 marn et al 2019 lika et al 2020 the idea of building individual specific models for understanding of physiological processes is not new bevelhimer et al 1985 deangelis et al 1994 and grew from the development of computational ecology that resulted in the possibility of generating individual oriented models iom s hogeweg and hesper 1990 deangelis et al 1994 the iom theory relies on the principle that no two biological organisms are exactly alike even when they have identical genes a group of organisms within a population can have contrasting size or physiological performances according to for example food conditions or competition modelling each individual separately therefore constitutes a powerful approach to enhance the understanding of the entire community deangelis et al 1994 in this study due to the known morphological and physiological differences between the morphotypes we first separately built independent deb models for the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes of the limpet n concinna based on field experiment and literature data to assess the potential differences between the models secondly we analyse whether the two model outputs suggest contrasting physiologies between the morphotypes using a method recently developed in deb theory that tries to reduce differences in parameter values that are still consistent with the data lika et al 2020 using this method the augmented loss function we try to merge the information of the two species models into a single one if deb parameters of the two species can be merged it means that the physiological differences between these two species are not strongly different these results finally help assess deb model accuracy giving the amount of data available to build the models in the context of antarctic case studies and help evaluate which type of information is necessary to gather in order to fill model gaps finally the study evaluates if such models are valuable for studying southern ocean organisms in the context of altered environments 2 material and methods 2 1 deb model description deb models are based on an ensemble of rules that allocate energy flows to four main compartments reserve e structure v maturity eh reproduction er according to a set of priorities and the level of complexity i e maturity gained by the organism through time fig 2 kooijman 2010 maturity is treated as information having mass nor energy food is first of all ingested and assimilated p a and energetically stored into a reserve compartment e a fraction of the energy that is mobilised from reserve p c is divided into two branches according to the kappa rule a part of the energy contained in the reserve compartment κ p c is allocated to somatic maintenance and structure growth whereas the second part 1 κ p c contributes to maturity before the puberty threshold or reproduction after the puberty threshold the energy is allocated within and in between these branches by the establishment of some priorities where somatic maintenance p m has priority over growth and maturity maintenance p j has priority over maturity and reproduction during its lifetime the organism allocates energy to maturity which symbolizes its complexity and reaches some life stages at some defined thresholds e h b birth when the organism is capable to feed e h j metamorphosis e h p puberty when it can reproduce after reaching sexual maturity the energy that was formerly allocated to maturity is attributed to the reproduction buffer and the available energy is allocated to the development of gametes different types of deb models have been developed and coded for parameter estimation see frequently updated https github com add my pet debtool m page marques et al 2018 2019 here the abj model was used for n concinna this model considers that growth acceleration occurs between birth and metamorphosis kooijman 2010 mariño et al 2019 the deb model is forced by food availability and temperature temperature acts on metabolic rates following the arrhenius principle see kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 for details a temperature correction factor is applied to each rate that takes into account the lower and higher optimal boundaries of the individual tolerance range food available for ingestion is represented by the functional response f comprised between 0 1 where 0 is starvation condition and 1 very abundant food the parameters of the deb model can be estimated from multiple data on the eco physiology of a species the ones studied in this work are presented in table 1 2 2 data collection and deb calibration deb models were calibrated using zero variate data single data points at defined life stages such as length or weight at sexual maturity number of eggs produced per female and uni variate data relationships between two variables such as oxygen consumption and temperature length weight weight or size time relationships van der meer 2006 guillaumot 2019b data that were collected from the literature table 2 paying attention to the different taxonomic names adopted for the species through time see http www marinespecies org aphia php p taxdetails id 197296 accessed december 2018 to the sampling area to enable the two morphotypes to be distinguished intertidal subtidal and to the environmental conditions under which each dataset was recorded available food resources and temperature data from the literature were supplemented by experiments led by s morley at rothera station adelaïde island western antarctic peninsula in january february 2018 details in appendix a individual shells were brought back to europe and processed with imagery to collect growth ring data appendix b some data are shared between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes due to a lack of information on the morphotypes physiology in the literature table 2 the characteristics of the first developmental life stage when the larvae become able to feed i e age length and weight at birth and the pace of development i e age at puberty maximal observed age are assumed to be identical each data set was characterised by the corresponding temperature and food resources present in the field food resources were represented in the model by a scaled functional response f constrained between 0 and 1 with 0 meaning no food availability and 1 maximal food abundance f parameters were differentiated between the different stations along with temperatures food is very abundant in the field for the limpet and f parameters were therefore kept fixed with values 0 9 food availability from the rothera station was described by pictures taken in the field and was estimated at f 1 signy and anvers islands f was set at 0 9 because physiological traits growth rate maximal size are very close but slightly lower than rothera s observations but no precise information is available for food conditions in the different publications for these stations 2 3 deb parameter estimation and goodness of fit sets of zero and uni variate data supplemented by pseudo data were used to estimate the deb primary parameters pseudo data are extra data coming from different taxa that help calibrate the model estimation similarly to a prior element lika et al 2011a this procedure has similarities with bayesian estimation but are not embedded in a maximum likelihood context since the stochastic component is not modelled before parameter estimation each data set can be subjectively linked by a weight coefficient to quantify the realism of reducing variation in parameter values selected weight coefficients are always selected small enough in order to hardly affect parameter estimation if the information contained in the real data set is sufficient the deb parameters estimation is done by simultaneously estimating each parameter using these empirical and pseudo data by minimizing a loss function eq 1 using the nelder mead simplex method updated and explained in marques et al 2018 2019 the loss function that is minimized is 1 i 1 n j 1 n i w i j n j d i j p i j 2 d i 2 p i 2 where i scans datasets and j points in this dataset dij and pij are respectively the data and the predictions and d i and p i their average values in set i wij are the attributed coefficients n is the number of data sets ni denotes the data in a dataset nj the data in data points the value of the loss function is evaluated for each parameter trial the goodness of fit of each prediction was quantified by the relative error re the mean relative error mre quantifies the overall model performance re corresponds to the sum of the absolute differences between observed and predicted values divided by the predicted values contrarily to the loss function the mre does not take into consideration the weights of the different data marques et al 2018 mre values can have values from 0 to infinity with 0 value meaning that predictions match data exactly 2 4 merging parameters the augmented loss function approach developed by lika et al 2020 is a new extension that enables to compare small variations in parameter values between close species the second term in bold of the following equation eq 2 is the new extension of the symmetric bounded sb loss function 2 f sb i 1 n j 1 n i w i j n j d i j p i j 2 d i 2 p i 2 k 1 n w k var θ k mean θ k 2 where w s are weights d s data p s predictions θ s parameters j scans data points with a data set of n i points n i 1 is allowed i scans the data sets and k the parameters in this second term when wk 0 the parameter θ k between species are different but when increasing wk the parameter θ k tends to be similar between species therefore the augmented loss function method uses this mathematical principle to spot potential differences between parameters of different species first the set of deb parameters are separately estimated for each species and weight coefficients are set to zero then for each parameter the weight coefficient will be step wise increased making the loss function shift as a result if a maximal weight value is reached without sharp changes in the loss function value along the weight increase it means that the parameter value has a minimum variance between species contrarily if the loss function value presents a sharp increase due to the change in weight coefficient it means that the studied parameter should present contrasting values between the related species by applying this method to the case study of an intertidal and subtidal morphotype of the limpet n concinna we aim to evaluate whether there are any differences between both morphotypes caused by differences in parameters or whether these differences are explained only by differences in environmental conditions i e food resources and temperature initially the sets of parameters have been estimated separately for both morphotypes and all weight coefficients are set to zero by step wise increasing the weight coefficient for a particular shared parameter the overall loss function may increase and a common merged deb parameter is reached if a common value of the deb parameter can be found without important increase in mre or loss function values it means that the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes do not significantly differ for this parameter a similar procedure is applied for each deb parameter separately and iteratively in order to have a quick idea of replicability in the results the procedure was replicated five times contrasting in different orders of deb parameters merging appendix c the order of permutation of merged parameters of these five replicates was chosen randomly among the 11 possible solutions changes in mre and loss function values at each weight modification were reported and the predictions of the intertidal subtidal and merged models were compared 3 results 3 1 parameters of deb models deb predictions for the separate intertidal and subtidal models are accurate with mre values lower than 0 2 table 3 average mre value of the amp collection is close to 0 06 relative errors are quite low with the highest values obtained for length gsi data re 0 6089 and 0 8702 for intertidal and subtidal models respectively and time length relationships obtained from the sclerochronology measurements that are highly variable between each measured shell respectively re 0 3645 and 0 5924 for intertidal and subtidal models fig 3 table 3 appendix b in view of the substantial morphological difference between the populations we expected to see a clear difference in the shape coefficient δm we found a slightly larger value of δm for the intertidal morphotype meaning that for the same shell length it has slightly more structure compared to the subtidal one subtidal morphs have a lower energy conductance v as well as double the value of maximum surface area specific assimilation rate p am with respect to the intertidal morphs the ratio of specific assimilation over energy conductance em p am v determines the maximum reserve capacity of a species the fraction of mobilised reserve allocated to soma κ is also bigger 0 9368 for subtidal vs 0 9084 for intertidal type and the intertidal individuals also present a lower value for somatic maintenance rate p m compared to the subtidal ones this highlights contrasts between the morphotypes in energy allocated to maturation along the first life stages e h b e h j and more available energy for growth for the intertidal morphotype that has lower values of somatic maintenance intertidal morphotypes seem to accelerate metabolism with a two fold difference in acceleration factor sm between intertidal and subtidal types respectively 7 862 and 4 049 the maturity threshold to reach puberty e h p is also lower for the intertidal morphotype than the subtidal the mre values of the merged models stay below 0 25 and the value of the loss function for the merged situation is only a little larger than the sum of both populations reflecting that a substantial reduction in the total number of parameters by almost a factor 2 hardly affects the goodness of fit table 3 appendix c deb parameters of the merged models are quite close to the values of the intertidal and subtidal models with p m δm e h p e h b eg and v merged values being almost exactly in between the values of the intertidal and the subtidal morphotypes parameters κ z e h j p am and h a are closer to the intertidal predictions univariate predictions are also extremely close between the two models and the merged model fig 3 with only a small difference for the subtidal model for which the gsi length predictions are higher than the intertidal and merged predictions mainly due to errors in predictions and scatter in the data this higher potential of energy allocation to reproduction can however be linked to the higher e h p values estimated for the subtidal type table 3 3 2 merging process along the merging procedure the loss function and mre values of the model at each step of the merging procedure are observed one step corresponding to the interative increase of the weight coefficient of the studied parameter i e merging step fig 4 changes in loss function and mre values are not that important between the initial step and the final step of the merging procedure fig 4 appendix d respectively from 0 170 to 0 196 and from 0 192 to 0 227 for the mre intertidal and mre subtidal values meaning that merging parameters is possible e h p and δm seem to be the parameters that are the most influencing the model during the merging procedure for both the intertidal and subtidal models and p m seems to further influence the intertidal model 4 discussion 4 1 deb models relevance deb models are powerful tools enabling predictions of the individuals energetic scope for survival growth and reproduction given the considered environmental conditions kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 these mechanistic approaches have been of interest for several years to the marine antarctic community gutt et al 2012 constable et al 2014 gutt et al 2018 and have been increasingly developed during recent years e g agüera et al 2015 agë 2017 goedegebuure et al 2018 henschke et al 2018 this study is based on the example of the limpet nacella concinna and uses data from literature supplemented by experiments conducted in antarctica in february 2018 to build the deb models of the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes of the species the separately produced models were accurate with a reduced error between observations and model predictions except for some scatter among data such as length gsi relationship such accuracy was mainly possible thanks to the important amount of uni variate data that were provided by the complementary experiments conducted in rothera which filled knowledge gaps about reproduction collected more precise length weight relationships to observe the morphological contrasts between intertidal and subtidal individuals and collected more precise information on the limpet s metabolic performance through its development rates and ages depend on temperature here we correct for differences in temperature using an arrhenius relationship however in order to meaningfully compare differences in parameters between species living in different habitats it is useful to standardize all parameters to a common reference temperature tref 20 c this is the standard for presenting and comparing deb parameters across the 2 000 different species in amp when comparing deb parameters estimations of n concinna to those of their temperate counterpart patella vulgata kooijman et al 2017 at tref 20 c we notice clear differences between the species in term of metabolic strategies although the limpets morphology and therefore size and volume are close between the two species close length and predicted shape coefficient δm for n concinna predicted κ is much higher and close to 1 0 9256 vs 0 617 for p vulgata meaning that almost all the energy available in the reserve compartment is allocated to somatic maintenance and growth and only a small amount is available for reproduction this is clearly visible with the ultimate rate of reproduction more than 40 times lower for the antarctic limpet compared to the temperate one the capacity to assimilate resources p am was estimated to be 10 times higher for p vulgata explaining the 2 5 fold lower growth rate for n concinna the two metabolisms also contrast by the fact that p vulgata is predicted to store more reserves than n concinna in similarly abundant food conditions these results are consistent with published experiments where it was shown that rasping rates i e feeding potential were higher for temperate and tropical species than for n concinna morley et al 2014 and that development rates of antarctic marine molluscs are much slower than at higher temperatures peck et al 2007 2016 which could be partially due to the increased costs of protein production in the cold marsh et al 2001 robertson et al 2001 pörtner et al 2007 such examples of comparison of energetic performance between these two species highlight the performance of deb models to be efficiently applied for antarctic case studies and powerful and accurate enough to enhance physiological contrasts even between closely related species as previously discussed in other works van der veer et al 2006 gatti et al 2017 marques et al 2018 marn et al 2019 4 2 comparison between morphotypes in a second step we evaluated if known contrasts in physiological traits between the morphotypes could be highlighted by the modelling approach by simply comparing the two single models we observed minimal energetic contrasts between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes small differences in assimilation rate and ability to store reserves table 3 fig 3 by using the augmented loss function method we tried to merge the models into a single one parameter by parameter to evaluate the contrasts in parameters between the types lika et al 2020 results show that models were merged without generating significant changes in mre and loss function values fig 4 appendix d predictions of the uni variate data are really similar between the three models fig 3 with only minor differences in temperature corrected parameter values between both populations meaning that the observed differences are best explained by differences in environmental conditions temperature and food availability despite the known physiological contrasts in the field the available data did not allow the models to capture these physiological differences between the morphotypes using only the available data scatter distribution of the data used to calibrate the model fig 3 can hide metabolic differences which calls for more experiments to describe the physiology of the different morphotypes using more complete datasets for which all parameters are independent between intertidal and subtidal morphotypes may also help to further constrain the differences in our case study several zero variate data are shared between the intertidal and subtidal models among which age length and weight at birth that control the very beginning of the development the observed results of a two fold difference in metabolism acceleration of intertidal morphotypes compared to subtidal ones sm 8 and 4 for intertidal and subtidal is in fact an artefact caused by common parameters related to birth and puberty stages age length weight indeed specific assimilation at birth for the subtidal is two times larger than that for the intertidal which indicates that subtidal individuals develop faster however according to available data provided in the model puberty is reached at the same time for both types e h p consequently needs to be smaller for the intertidal type to reach puberty at the same age ap and length lp explaining the observed contrasts between the intertidal and subtidal groups improving the completeness of these models would therefore be necessary to enable further detailed conclusions a common approach in biology is to focus on differences between individuals populations and species here we adopt a contrasting strategy in which we force models to determine in what manner the populations are similar in order to quantify in what manner they differ this work is a first step to compare the energetics of both populations and we discovered how given the data they seem more metabolically similar than what their appearance would suggest as first we also highlight some artefacts that come from the quality of the data and the scatter therein new data so new knowledge that fill current knowledge gaps will yield further insight into how the metabolisms of these populations have diverged to adapt to differences in environment the current work is a contribution to understanding the relationship between observations data and metabolism for these two populations 4 3 models drawbacks and improvements apart from data availability a drawback of our model construction is the lack of information about environmental properties that makes comparisons between estimations of the two morphotypes quite difficult to perform in the models we just considered an average temperature for intertidal or subtidal habitats from where the limpets come from but do not add any supplementary detail on environmental contrasts between these habitats nor in the difference of food availability between the morphotypes however contrasting environmental pressures desiccation salinity hydrodynamism and habitat characteristics immersion time substratum type and surrounding physico chemical factors contribute to contrasting adaptative strategies among which morphological adaptation is really important for limpets but have not been integrated into our deb models because it requires more data we do not have vermeij 1973 branch 1981 denny blanchette 2000 sa pinto et al 2008 bouzaza mezali 2013 grandfils 1982 gray hodgson 2003 espinosa et al 2009 desiccation is one of the strongest hypothesis to explain the morphological differences between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes mauro et al 2003 bouzaza mezali 2018 the presence of high upstream shifted apex form for the intertidal morphotypes more exposed to desiccation could help to store more water and absorb more oxygen as described for patella ferruginea branch 1985 paracuellos et al 2003 similarly shell volumes are bigger for the intertidal type and help reduce water loss vermeij 1973 wolcott 1973 branch 1975 branch 1981 but also infer resistance to the effects of ice damage morley et al 2010 differences in the energetic responses of the two morphotypes of n concinna to the difference in mean intertidal 0 45 c and subtidal 0 1 c or the much greater difference in maximum 12 3 versus 1 7 c respectively morley et al 2012 could be a proximate cause of the morphological differences taking into consideration differences between environments is therefore important but strongly lacking in the analysis presented here in our study field data show a slight difference in shell length of 5 and a small difference also in the predicted shape coefficient of 0 45 against 0 39 table 3 for respectively the intertidal and subtidal individuals this indicates very small differences in inner volumes between the studied populations as calculated by the deb meaning that the deb model does not adequately reflect the difference in morphology between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes in the raw data shell heights present a 33 difference between intertidal and subtidal individuals appendix a but shell length was used rather than shell height in the model to characterize the growth structure of the species fine tuning the models with extra shape information could have helped to bring further contrasts between the two models but also requires much more information on shell growth moreover the difference in food availability and quality was hypothetized between the morphotypes when calibrating the model despite food abundance and quality knowledge being responsible for strong contrasts in deb model outputs kooijman 2010 thomas et al 2011 saraiva et al 2012 sarà et al 2013 during winter time the intertidal type seems to have supplementary access to ice algae and microphytobenthos in rock crevices whereas the subtidal type mainly grazes on diatomsfilms growing on encrusing red algae appendix a obermüller et al 2011 but food abundance and quality were assumed for the construction of the models as no data accurate enough were available to characterize the feeding behaviour of the limpets moreover in the case of intertidal type no clear hypothesis is available for their behaviour during winter period as several authors hypothesize either a migration into the subtidal or a dormance period hidden into crevices during the period when ice is covering their habitat brêthes et al 1994 obermüller et al 2011 however this information would be essential to explain how these individuals energetically behave during this period 4 4 potential of the approach this study showed that it is feasible to build a deb model for a marine antarctic species with few available data adding extra information from sampling and experiments during a single expedition in the field considerably increased the accuracy of the model and highlighted some small differences in energy allocation priorities maintenance costs and reproductive potential between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes but the method is then limited by model calibration and data availability since it could not prove that these contrasts are explained by anything else but environmental conditions such deb models would already be sufficient to 1 describe the performance of the species physiological traits in spatially or temporally contrasting environmental conditions kearney et al 2012 teal et al 2012 2 to be upscaled to the population level to assess population structure and density dynamics klanjscek et al 2006 arnould pétré et al this issue or 3 to be integrated into a dynamic network by adding knowledge about interaction with other species ren et al 2010 ren et al 2012 adding some data from extra experiments would easily enable further development of these models for ecophysiological or

2009 rico villa et al 2010 kooijman et al 2011 in this study we wanted to explore whether the amount of data that was available to build these models were sufficient to see the known physiological and morphological differences between the two morphotypes and results show that more data are necessary to conclude we advise the use of deb approach for ecological modelling for antarctic case studies but modellers should be aware of the necessity to calibrate models with accurate data to fine tune results among these data the description of the species habitat is complex information to be integrated into a model and most of the time only partial information is available working in narrow scale areas where habitat is known and described and where experiments can be run might be a good option our study also hightlights the interest of deb models to reuse data from experiments from historical published works from antarctic campaigns and highlights the importance of precisely documenting the associated metadata notably the description of the environment and the conditions in which the limpets are living data that is not always available authors contribution c guillaumot

24831,studying the influence of changing environmental conditions on antarctic marine benthic invertebrates is strongly constrained by limited access to the region which poses difficulties to performing long term experimental studies ecological modelling has been increasingly used as a potential alternative to assess the impact of such changes on species distribution or physiological performance among ecological models the dynamic energy budget deb approach represents each individual through four energetic compartments i e reserve structure maturation and reproduction from which energy is allocated in contrasting proportions according to different life stages and to two forcing environmental factors food resources and temperature in this study the example of an abundant coastal limpet nacella concinna strebel 1908 was studied the species is known to have intertidal and subtidal morphotypes genetically similar but physiologically and morphologically contrasting the objectives of this paper are 1 to evaluate the potential of the deb approach and assess whether a deb model can be separately built for the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes based on a field experiment and data from literature and 2 to analyse whether models are contrasting enough to reflect the known physiological and morphological differences between the morphotypes we found only minor differences in temperature corrected parameter values between both populations meaning that the observed differences can be only explained by differences in environmental conditions i e deb considered variables food resources and temperature but also other variables not considered by deb despite the known morphological difference between the populations the difference in shape coefficients was small this study shows that even with the amount of data so far available in the literature deb models can already be applied to some southern ocean case studies but more data are required to accurately model the physiological and morphological differences between individuals keywords ecological modelling southern ocean marine benthic species model relevance model accuracy 1 introduction antarctic regions have faced strong environmental change since the twentieth century recently reviewed in henley et al 2019 with a strong warming in some regions such as in the western antarctic peninsula king et al 2003 vaughan et al 2003 meredith and king 2005 leading to important shifts in sea ice regimes and seasonality including the duration and extent of sea ice cover stammerjohn et al 2012 turner et al 2016 schofield et al 2017 the increase in the rate of glacier melting has been reported as a cause of important disturbance of the physical currents salinities and biological environment phytoplankton blooms communities meredith and king 2005 schloss et al 2012 bers et al 2013 such changes have a direct impact on marine communities and particularly in coastal marine areas both intertidal and subtidal barnes and peck 2008 smale and barnes 2008 barnes and souster 2011 waller et al 2017 stenni et al 2017 gutt et al 2018 which are places of complex land sea interface and ecological processes the multiple effects of ice retreat and meltwater on nearshore marine habitats have contributed to the expansion of intertidal zones and habitat alteration due to seawater freshening and stratification shifting near shore sedimentation changes in water properties and current dynamics however studying antarctic marine life is challenging not only do the environmental conditions make the region difficult to access and work in but substantial financial and technical constraints make field sampling and experiments difficult to organise e g cold ice duration of daylight kaiser et al 2013 kennicutt et al 2014 2015 xavier et al 2016 gutt et al 2018 however conducting physiological studies of antarctic marine organisms has become urgent as we aim to assess their sensitivity and potential response resilience distribution shift or local extinction to environmental change a key issue for the conservation of marine life and special protected areas kennicutt et al 2014 2015 2019 https www ccamlr org en organisation home page an alternative to completing studies in these environments is the use of modelling approaches data needs interpretation to test hypotheses which involves assumptions that need to be explicit using a modelling approach is therefore a good strategy ecological modelling is used to describe species distribution and assess their

growth and metabolic rates to calibrate the model van der meer 2006 marques et al 2014 application of deb models to antarctic species is increasing they can be easily extracted from the amp collection using the software amptool the matlab command select eco ecozone ms presently gives a list of 37 species where ms stands for marine southern ocean command select eco ecozone ts gives another 3 species for the terrestrial antarctic environment among which the mite alaskozetes antarcticus among the most common and well studied southern ocean benthic invertebrates are the sea star odontaster validus agüera et al 2015 the bivalve laternula elliptica agüera et al 2017 the bivalve adamussium colbecki guillaumot 2019a and the sea urchins sterechinus neumayeri stainthorp and kooijman 2017 and abatus cordatus arnould pétré et al this issue deb models have also been developed for some pelagic species such as the antarctic krill euphausia superba the salp salpa thompsoni jager and ravagnan 2015 henschke et al 2018 and are under development for marine mammals such as the elephant seal mirounga leonina goedegebuure et al 2018 antarctic species have a range of notable physiological traits when compared to their temperate counterparts among others they are physiologically adapted to constant cold temperatures peck et al 2009 morley et al 2009 2014 shifting day length also imposes a marked seasonal feeding behaviour mcclintock 1994 clarke et al 2008 halanych and mahon 2018 and they exhibit slow metabolic and growth rates explaining their longer lifespans and higher longevities compared to species in other regions peck and brey 1996 peck 2002 the limpet nacella concinna strebel 1908 mollusca patellogastropoda is a common and abundant gastropod of shallow marine benthic communities distributed all along the western antarctic peninsula gonzález wevar et al 2011 phylogeny recently reviewed in gonzález wevar et al 2018 it has widely been studied for decades shabica 1971 1976 walker 1972 hargens and shabica 1973 houlihan and allan 1982 peck 1989 clarke 1989 cadée 1999 ansaldo et al 2007 fraser et al 2007 markowska and kidawa 2007 morley et al 2011 2014 suda et al 2015 souster et al 2018 the limpet is found from intertidal rocky shores down to over 100 meters depth powell 1951 walker 1972 it has a 2 5 cm long shell fig 1 that grows only a few millimeters a year with a seasonal pattern it is sexually mature after four to six years and has a life span of up to 10 years shabica 1976 picken 1980 brêthes et al 1994 the limpet mainly feeds on microphytobenthos and microalgae shabica 1976 brêthes et al 1994 it spawns free swimming planktonic larvae once a year when water temperature rises in the austral summer shabica 1971 picken 1980 picken and allan 1983 larvae drift in the water column and metamorphose after more than two months stanwell smith and clarke 1998 n concinna does not have a homing behaviour stanwell smith and clarke 1998 weihe and abele 2008 suda et al 2015 and intertidal individuals can either migrate to subtidal areas in winter to escape freezing air temperatures that may drop below 20 c walker 1972 branch 1981 brêthes et al 1994 or shelter in rock cracks and crevices in the intertidal area in the latter case they do not become dormant but have a limited access to microphytobenthos as recently observed around adelaide island obermüller et al 2011 two morphotypes of n concinna have been distinguished an intertidal and a subtidal type with the intertidal type having a taller heavier and thicker shell compared to the subtidal one that is characterized by a lighter and flatter shell beaumont and wei 1991 hoffman et al 2010 initially strebel 1908 and powell 1951 referred to these two morphotypes as the polaris intertidal and concinna types below 4m depth from that point the potential genetic differentiation between the two morphotypes has been investigated some of the studies concluding an absence of genetic distinction wei 1988 beaumont and wei 1991 nolan 1991 while contrarily de aranzamendi et al 2008 reported significant differences based on inter simple sequence repeat issr markers more recently this last method was questioned hoffman et al 2010 and several studies using different markers and populations chwedorzewska et al 2010 hoffman et al 2010 gonzález wevar et al 2011 have concluded an absence of genetic differentiation between the two morphotypes apart from the absence of genetic differences intertidal and subtidal populations strongly contrast in morphology and physiology which has been explained by the prevalence of habitat heterogeneity and strong environmental gradients along rocky shore habitats a common feature also observed in other gastropods johannesson 2003 butlin et al 2008 hoffman et al 2010 for instance in n concinna the higher shell thickness observed in the shallow morphotype was hypothesised to play a role in resistance against crushing pack ice shabica 1971 morley et al 2010 intertidal morphotypes are further resistant to air exposure thanks to higher shells bigger inner volumes relative to their shell circumference a combination that makes them more efficient than subtidal individuals able to store more water and oxygen reducing desiccation risks and delaying the metabolic switch to anaerobic fermentation nolan 1991 weihe and abele 2008 the subtidal morphotype has also proved to be less resistant to cold than the intertidal population waller et al 2006 due to extra production of mucus and stress proteins in intertidal morphotypes clark et al 2008 clark and peck 2009 obermüller et al 2011 and due to diverse metabolic processes that contrast between both populations reviewed in suda et al 2015 the development of ecological models enables precise models to be built that highlight subtle differences in parameters between ecologically similar or closely related species freitas et al 2010 holsman et al 2016 marn et al 2019 lika et al 2020 the idea of building individual specific models for understanding of physiological processes is not new bevelhimer et al 1985 deangelis et al 1994 and grew from the development of computational ecology that resulted in the possibility of generating individual oriented models iom s hogeweg and hesper 1990 deangelis et al 1994 the iom theory relies on the principle that no two biological organisms are exactly alike even when they have identical genes a group of organisms within a population can have contrasting size or physiological performances according to for example food conditions or competition modelling each individual separately therefore constitutes a powerful approach to enhance the understanding of the entire community deangelis et al 1994 in this study due to the known morphological and physiological differences between the morphotypes we first separately built independent deb models for the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes of the limpet n concinna based on field experiment and literature data to assess the potential differences between the models secondly we analyse whether the two model outputs suggest contrasting physiologies between the morphotypes using a method recently developed in deb theory that tries to reduce differences in parameter values that are still consistent with the data lika et al 2020 using this method the augmented loss function we try to merge the information of the two species models into a single one if deb parameters of the two species can be merged it means that the physiological differences between these two species are not strongly different these results finally help assess deb model accuracy giving the amount of data available to build the models in the context of antarctic case studies and help evaluate which type of information is necessary to gather in order to fill model gaps finally the study evaluates if such models are valuable for studying southern ocean organisms in the context of altered environments 2 material and methods 2 1 deb model description deb models are based on an ensemble of rules that allocate energy flows to four main compartments reserve e structure v maturity eh reproduction er according to a set of priorities and the level of complexity i e maturity gained by the organism through time fig 2 kooijman 2010 maturity is treated as information having mass nor energy food is first of all ingested and assimilated p a and energetically stored into a reserve compartment e a fraction of the energy that is mobilised from reserve p c is divided into two branches according to the kappa rule a part of the energy contained in the reserve compartment κ p c is allocated to somatic maintenance and structure growth whereas the second part 1 κ p c contributes to maturity before the puberty threshold or reproduction after the puberty threshold the energy is allocated within and in between these branches by the establishment of some priorities where somatic maintenance p m has priority over growth and maturity maintenance p j has priority over maturity and reproduction during its lifetime the organism allocates energy to maturity which symbolizes its complexity and reaches some life stages at some defined thresholds e h b birth when the organism is capable to feed e h j metamorphosis e h p puberty when it can reproduce after reaching sexual maturity the energy that was formerly allocated to maturity is attributed to the reproduction buffer and the available energy is allocated to the development of gametes different types of deb models have been developed and coded for parameter estimation see frequently updated https github com add my pet debtool m page marques et al 2018 2019 here the abj model was used for n concinna this model considers that growth acceleration occurs between birth and metamorphosis kooijman 2010 mariño et al 2019 the deb model is forced by food availability and temperature temperature acts on metabolic rates following the arrhenius principle see kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 for details a temperature correction factor is applied to each rate that takes into account the lower and higher optimal boundaries of the individual tolerance range food available for ingestion is represented by the functional response f comprised between 0 1 where 0 is starvation condition and 1 very abundant food the parameters of the deb model can be estimated from multiple data on the eco physiology of a species the ones studied in this work are presented in table 1 2 2 data collection and deb calibration deb models were calibrated using zero variate data single data points at defined life stages such as length or weight at sexual maturity number of eggs produced per female and uni variate data relationships between two variables such as oxygen consumption and temperature length weight weight or size time relationships van der meer 2006 guillaumot 2019b data that were collected from the literature table 2 paying attention to the different taxonomic names adopted for the species through time see http www marinespecies org aphia php p taxdetails id 197296 accessed december 2018 to the sampling area to enable the two morphotypes to be distinguished intertidal subtidal and to the environmental conditions under which each dataset was recorded available food resources and temperature data from the literature were supplemented by experiments led by s morley at rothera station adelaïde island western antarctic peninsula in january february 2018 details in appendix a individual shells were brought back to europe and processed with imagery to collect growth ring data appendix b some data are shared between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes due to a lack of information on the morphotypes physiology in the literature table 2 the characteristics of the first developmental life stage when the larvae become able to feed i e age length and weight at birth and the pace of development i e age at puberty maximal observed age are assumed to be identical each data set was characterised by the corresponding temperature and food resources present in the field food resources were represented in the model by a scaled functional response f constrained between 0 and 1 with 0 meaning no food availability and 1 maximal food abundance f parameters were differentiated between the different stations along with temperatures food is very abundant in the field for the limpet and f parameters were therefore kept fixed with values 0 9 food availability from the rothera station was described by pictures taken in the field and was estimated at f 1 signy and anvers islands f was set at 0 9 because physiological traits growth rate maximal size are very close but slightly lower than rothera s observations but no precise information is available for food conditions in the different publications for these stations 2 3 deb parameter estimation and goodness of fit sets of zero and uni variate data supplemented by pseudo data were used to estimate the deb primary parameters pseudo data are extra data coming from different taxa that help calibrate the model estimation similarly to a prior element lika et al 2011a this procedure has similarities with bayesian estimation but are not embedded in a maximum likelihood context since the stochastic component is not modelled before parameter estimation each data set can be subjectively linked by a weight coefficient to quantify the realism of reducing variation in parameter values selected weight coefficients are always selected small enough in order to hardly affect parameter estimation if the information contained in the real data set is sufficient the deb parameters estimation is done by simultaneously estimating each parameter using these empirical and pseudo data by minimizing a loss function eq 1 using the nelder mead simplex method updated and explained in marques et al 2018 2019 the loss function that is minimized is 1 i 1 n j 1 n i w i j n j d i j p i j 2 d i 2 p i 2 where i scans datasets and j points in this dataset dij and pij are respectively the data and the predictions and d i and p i their average values in set i wij are the attributed coefficients n is the number of data sets ni denotes the data in a dataset nj the data in data points the value of the loss function is evaluated for each parameter trial the goodness of fit of each prediction was quantified by the relative error re the mean relative error mre quantifies the overall model performance re corresponds to the sum of the absolute differences between observed and predicted values divided by the predicted values contrarily to the loss function the mre does not take into consideration the weights of the different data marques et al 2018 mre values can have values from 0 to infinity with 0 value meaning that predictions match data exactly 2 4 merging parameters the augmented loss function approach developed by lika et al 2020 is a new extension that enables to compare small variations in parameter values between close species the second term in bold of the following equation eq 2 is the new extension of the symmetric bounded sb loss function 2 f sb i 1 n j 1 n i w i j n j d i j p i j 2 d i 2 p i 2 k 1 n w k var θ k mean θ k 2 where w s are weights d s data p s predictions θ s parameters j scans data points with a data set of n i points n i 1 is allowed i scans the data sets and k the parameters in this second term when wk 0 the parameter θ k between species are different but when increasing wk the parameter θ k tends to be similar between species therefore the augmented loss function method uses this mathematical principle to spot potential differences between parameters of different species first the set of deb parameters are separately estimated for each species and weight coefficients are set to zero then for each parameter the weight coefficient will be step wise increased making the loss function shift as a result if a maximal weight value is reached without sharp changes in the loss function value along the weight increase it means that the parameter value has a minimum variance between species contrarily if the loss function value presents a sharp increase due to the change in weight coefficient it means that the studied parameter should present contrasting values between the related species by applying this method to the case study of an intertidal and subtidal morphotype of the limpet n concinna we aim to evaluate whether there are any differences between both morphotypes caused by differences in parameters or whether these differences are explained only by differences in environmental conditions i e food resources and temperature initially the sets of parameters have been estimated separately for both morphotypes and all weight coefficients are set to zero by step wise increasing the weight coefficient for a particular shared parameter the overall loss function may increase and a common merged deb parameter is reached if a common value of the deb parameter can be found without important increase in mre or loss function values it means that the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes do not significantly differ for this parameter a similar procedure is applied for each deb parameter separately and iteratively in order to have a quick idea of replicability in the results the procedure was replicated five times contrasting in different orders of deb parameters merging appendix c the order of permutation of merged parameters of these five replicates was chosen randomly among the 11 possible solutions changes in mre and loss function values at each weight modification were reported and the predictions of the intertidal subtidal and merged models were compared 3 results 3 1 parameters of deb models deb predictions for the separate intertidal and subtidal models are accurate with mre values lower than 0 2 table 3 average mre value of the amp collection is close to 0 06 relative errors are quite low with the highest values obtained for length gsi data re 0 6089 and 0 8702 for intertidal and subtidal models respectively and time length relationships obtained from the sclerochronology measurements that are highly variable between each measured shell respectively re 0 3645 and 0 5924 for intertidal and subtidal models fig 3 table 3 appendix b in view of the substantial morphological difference between the populations we expected to see a clear difference in the shape coefficient δm we found a slightly larger value of δm for the intertidal morphotype meaning that for the same shell length it has slightly more structure compared to the subtidal one subtidal morphs have a lower energy conductance v as well as double the value of maximum surface area specific assimilation rate p am with respect to the intertidal morphs the ratio of specific assimilation over energy conductance em p am v determines the maximum reserve capacity of a species the fraction of mobilised reserve allocated to soma κ is also bigger 0 9368 for subtidal vs 0 9084 for intertidal type and the intertidal individuals also present a lower value for somatic maintenance rate p m compared to the subtidal ones this highlights contrasts between the morphotypes in energy allocated to maturation along the first life stages e h b e h j and more available energy for growth for the intertidal morphotype that has lower values of somatic maintenance intertidal morphotypes seem to accelerate metabolism with a two fold difference in acceleration factor sm between intertidal and subtidal types respectively 7 862 and 4 049 the maturity threshold to reach puberty e h p is also lower for the intertidal morphotype than the subtidal the mre values of the merged models stay below 0 25 and the value of the loss function for the merged situation is only a little larger than the sum of both populations reflecting that a substantial reduction in the total number of parameters by almost a factor 2 hardly affects the goodness of fit table 3 appendix c deb parameters of the merged models are quite close to the values of the intertidal and subtidal models with p m δm e h p e h b eg and v merged values being almost exactly in between the values of the intertidal and the subtidal morphotypes parameters κ z e h j p am and h a are closer to the intertidal predictions univariate predictions are also extremely close between the two models and the merged model fig 3 with only a small difference for the subtidal model for which the gsi length predictions are higher than the intertidal and merged predictions mainly due to errors in predictions and scatter in the data this higher potential of energy allocation to reproduction can however be linked to the higher e h p values estimated for the subtidal type table 3 3 2 merging process along the merging procedure the loss function and mre values of the model at each step of the merging procedure are observed one step corresponding to the interative increase of the weight coefficient of the studied parameter i e merging step fig 4 changes in loss function and mre values are not that important between the initial step and the final step of the merging procedure fig 4 appendix d respectively from 0 170 to 0 196 and from 0 192 to 0 227 for the mre intertidal and mre subtidal values meaning that merging parameters is possible e h p and δm seem to be the parameters that are the most influencing the model during the merging procedure for both the intertidal and subtidal models and p m seems to further influence the intertidal model 4 discussion 4 1 deb models relevance deb models are powerful tools enabling predictions of the individuals energetic scope for survival growth and reproduction given the considered environmental conditions kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 these mechanistic approaches have been of interest for several years to the marine antarctic community gutt et al 2012 constable et al 2014 gutt et al 2018 and have been increasingly developed during recent years e g agüera et al 2015 agë 2017 goedegebuure et al 2018 henschke et al 2018 this study is based on the example of the limpet nacella concinna and uses data from literature supplemented by experiments conducted in antarctica in february 2018 to build the deb models of the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes of the species the separately produced models were accurate with a reduced error between observations and model predictions except for some scatter among data such as length gsi relationship such accuracy was mainly possible thanks to the important amount of uni variate data that were provided by the complementary experiments conducted in rothera which filled knowledge gaps about reproduction collected more precise length weight relationships to observe the morphological contrasts between intertidal and subtidal individuals and collected more precise information on the limpet s metabolic performance through its development rates and ages depend on temperature here we correct for differences in temperature using an arrhenius relationship however in order to meaningfully compare differences in parameters between species living in different habitats it is useful to standardize all parameters to a common reference temperature tref 20 c this is the standard for presenting and comparing deb parameters across the 2 000 different species in amp when comparing deb parameters estimations of n concinna to those of their temperate counterpart patella vulgata kooijman et al 2017 at tref 20 c we notice clear differences between the species in term of metabolic strategies although the limpets morphology and therefore size and volume are close between the two species close length and predicted shape coefficient δm for n concinna predicted κ is much higher and close to 1 0 9256 vs 0 617 for p vulgata meaning that almost all the energy available in the reserve compartment is allocated to somatic maintenance and growth and only a small amount is available for reproduction this is clearly visible with the ultimate rate of reproduction more than 40 times lower for the antarctic limpet compared to the temperate one the capacity to assimilate resources p am was estimated to be 10 times higher for p vulgata explaining the 2 5 fold lower growth rate for n concinna the two metabolisms also contrast by the fact that p vulgata is predicted to store more reserves than n concinna in similarly abundant food conditions these results are consistent with published experiments where it was shown that rasping rates i e feeding potential were higher for temperate and tropical species than for n concinna morley et al 2014 and that development rates of antarctic marine molluscs are much slower than at higher temperatures peck et al 2007 2016 which could be partially due to the increased costs of protein production in the cold marsh et al 2001 robertson et al 2001 pörtner et al 2007 such examples of comparison of energetic performance between these two species highlight the performance of deb models to be efficiently applied for antarctic case studies and powerful and accurate enough to enhance physiological contrasts even between closely related species as previously discussed in other works van der veer et al 2006 gatti et al 2017 marques et al 2018 marn et al 2019 4 2 comparison between morphotypes in a second step we evaluated if known contrasts in physiological traits between the morphotypes could be highlighted by the modelling approach by simply comparing the two single models we observed minimal energetic contrasts between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes small differences in assimilation rate and ability to store reserves table 3 fig 3 by using the augmented loss function method we tried to merge the models into a single one parameter by parameter to evaluate the contrasts in parameters between the types lika et al 2020 results show that models were merged without generating significant changes in mre and loss function values fig 4 appendix d predictions of the uni variate data are really similar between the three models fig 3 with only minor differences in temperature corrected parameter values between both populations meaning that the observed differences are best explained by differences in environmental conditions temperature and food availability despite the known physiological contrasts in the field the available data did not allow the models to capture these physiological differences between the morphotypes using only the available data scatter distribution of the data used to calibrate the model fig 3 can hide metabolic differences which calls for more experiments to describe the physiology of the different morphotypes using more complete datasets for which all parameters are independent between intertidal and subtidal morphotypes may also help to further constrain the differences in our case study several zero variate data are shared between the intertidal and subtidal models among which age length and weight at birth that control the very beginning of the development the observed results of a two fold difference in metabolism acceleration of intertidal morphotypes compared to subtidal ones sm 8 and 4 for intertidal and subtidal is in fact an artefact caused by common parameters related to birth and puberty stages age length weight indeed specific assimilation at birth for the subtidal is two times larger than that for the intertidal which indicates that subtidal individuals develop faster however according to available data provided in the model puberty is reached at the same time for both types e h p consequently needs to be smaller for the intertidal type to reach puberty at the same age ap and length lp explaining the observed contrasts between the intertidal and subtidal groups improving the completeness of these models would therefore be necessary to enable further detailed conclusions a common approach in biology is to focus on differences between individuals populations and species here we adopt a contrasting strategy in which we force models to determine in what manner the populations are similar in order to quantify in what manner they differ this work is a first step to compare the energetics of both populations and we discovered how given the data they seem more metabolically similar than what their appearance would suggest as first we also highlight some artefacts that come from the quality of the data and the scatter therein new data so new knowledge that fill current knowledge gaps will yield further insight into how the metabolisms of these populations have diverged to adapt to differences in environment the current work is a contribution to understanding the relationship between observations data and metabolism for these two populations 4 3 models drawbacks and improvements apart from data availability a drawback of our model construction is the lack of information about environmental properties that makes comparisons between estimations of the two morphotypes quite difficult to perform in the models we just considered an average temperature for intertidal or subtidal habitats from where the limpets come from but do not add any supplementary detail on environmental contrasts between these habitats nor in the difference of food availability between the morphotypes however contrasting environmental pressures desiccation salinity hydrodynamism and habitat characteristics immersion time substratum type and surrounding physico chemical factors contribute to contrasting adaptative strategies among which morphological adaptation is really important for limpets but have not been integrated into our deb models because it requires more data we do not have vermeij 1973 branch 1981 denny blanchette 2000 sa pinto et al 2008 bouzaza mezali 2013 grandfils 1982 gray hodgson 2003 espinosa et al 2009 desiccation is one of the strongest hypothesis to explain the morphological differences between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes mauro et al 2003 bouzaza mezali 2018 the presence of high upstream shifted apex form for the intertidal morphotypes more exposed to desiccation could help to store more water and absorb more oxygen as described for patella ferruginea branch 1985 paracuellos et al 2003 similarly shell volumes are bigger for the intertidal type and help reduce water loss vermeij 1973 wolcott 1973 branch 1975 branch 1981 but also infer resistance to the effects of ice damage morley et al 2010 differences in the energetic responses of the two morphotypes of n concinna to the difference in mean intertidal 0 45 c and subtidal 0 1 c or the much greater difference in maximum 12 3 versus 1 7 c respectively morley et al 2012 could be a proximate cause of the morphological differences taking into consideration differences between environments is therefore important but strongly lacking in the analysis presented here in our study field data show a slight difference in shell length of 5 and a small difference also in the predicted shape coefficient of 0 45 against 0 39 table 3 for respectively the intertidal and subtidal individuals this indicates very small differences in inner volumes between the studied populations as calculated by the deb meaning that the deb model does not adequately reflect the difference in morphology between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes in the raw data shell heights present a 33 difference between intertidal and subtidal individuals appendix a but shell length was used rather than shell height in the model to characterize the growth structure of the species fine tuning the models with extra shape information could have helped to bring further contrasts between the two models but also requires much more information on shell growth moreover the difference in food availability and quality was hypothetized between the morphotypes when calibrating the model despite food abundance and quality knowledge being responsible for strong contrasts in deb model outputs kooijman 2010 thomas et al 2011 saraiva et al 2012 sarà et al 2013 during winter time the intertidal type seems to have supplementary access to ice algae and microphytobenthos in rock crevices whereas the subtidal type mainly grazes on diatomsfilms growing on encrusing red algae appendix a obermüller et al 2011 but food abundance and quality were assumed for the construction of the models as no data accurate enough were available to characterize the feeding behaviour of the limpets moreover in the case of intertidal type no clear hypothesis is available for their behaviour during winter period as several authors hypothesize either a migration into the subtidal or a dormance period hidden into crevices during the period when ice is covering their habitat brêthes et al 1994 obermüller et al 2011 however this information would be essential to explain how these individuals energetically behave during this period 4 4 potential of the approach this study showed that it is feasible to build a deb model for a marine antarctic species with few available data adding extra information from sampling and experiments during a single expedition in the field considerably increased the accuracy of the model and highlighted some small differences in energy allocation priorities maintenance costs and reproductive potential between the intertidal and subtidal morphotypes but the method is then limited by model calibration and data availability since it could not prove that these contrasts are explained by anything else but environmental conditions such deb models would already be sufficient to 1 describe the performance of the species physiological traits in spatially or temporally contrasting environmental conditions kearney et al 2012 teal et al 2012 2 to be upscaled to the population level to assess population structure and density dynamics klanjscek et al 2006 arnould pétré et al this issue or 3 to be integrated into a dynamic network by adding knowledge about interaction with other species ren et al 2010 ren et al 2012 adding some data from extra experiments would easily enable further development of these models for ecophysiological or ecotoxicological applications muller and nisbet 1997 pouvreau et al 2006 peeters et al 2010 sarà et al 2011 or to improve knowledge about development stages behaviour or reproduction pecquerie et al 2009 rico villa et al 2010 kooijman et al 2011 in this study we wanted to explore whether the amount of data that was available to build these models were sufficient to see the known physiological and morphological differences between the two morphotypes and results show that more data are necessary to conclude we advise the use of deb approach for ecological modelling for antarctic case studies but modellers should be aware of the necessity to calibrate models with accurate data to fine tune results among these data the description of the species habitat is complex information to be integrated into a model and most of the time only partial information is available working in narrow scale areas where habitat is known and described and where experiments can be run might be a good option our study also hightlights the interest of deb models to reuse data from experiments from historical published works from antarctic campaigns and highlights the importance of precisely documenting the associated metadata notably the description of the environment and the conditions in which the limpets are living data that is not always available authors contribution c guillaumot

24832,the purpose of the study was to develop calibrate and validate a comprehensive phenological model for the spatiotemporal simulation of the seasonal development of the six toothed spruce bark beetle pityogenes chalcographus chapy the validation dataset was acquired through monitoring of the bark beetle s phenology at eight sites in slovenia in 2017 and 2018 along with air and bark temperature measurements the predictions were made using air temperature from the inca system integrated nowcasting through comprehensive analysis which is used to calculate the effective bark temperature for beetle development since the biology of p chalcographus is poorly studied a sensitivity analysis was used to pinpoint the most important model parameters the first order main effect was the highest for the lower developmental threshold dtl while the second order interaction total effect was the highest for the optimum temperature to dtl was calibrated with an iterative procedure and the best result with the lowest mean absolute error mae was achieved at 7 4 c effective temperatures in the range between to and the upper developmental threshold were calculated with a nonlinear function whose parameters were appropriately calibrated the spring date threshold when the model calculation starts was calibrated with an iterative procedure and set at 9th march which had the minimum mae the onset of norway spruce infestation in spring was estimated using a lower threshold of 15 6 c for flight activity and a mean thermal sum of 216 5 degree days dd from 9th march onward the observed mean thermal sum required for total development of filial beetles was 652 8 22 7 c while the predicted mean thermal sum was 635 4 31 4 c re emergence of parental beetles occurred when 52 7 of the minimum thermal sum for total development was reached the relative duration of the egg larval and combination of the pupal and teneral adult developmental stages was 9 4 58 2 and 32 4 respectively mass swarming concluded in the end of august when daylength was lower than 13 6 h which was determined with the independent dataset of 1 017 pheromone traps the diapause initiation at a daylength 13 6 h is included in the model as an assumption successful hibernation of established broods is predicted by assessing the developmental stage of initiated generations at the 31st december for validation we compared the timing of phenological events in the field with predicted events using both 30 minute recorded data at study sites in the field and hourly data from the inca the time of spring swarming was estimated with a mae of 5 6 days the onset of infestation was predicted with a mae of 6 0 days the predicted onset of emergence of filial beetles was estimated with a mae of 2 1 days additionally chapy simulates the number of generations chapy was successfully incorporated into two publicly available web applications development of the model revealed several knowledge gaps in p chalcographus phenology thus providing opportunities for further research of the second most damaging bark beetle of norway spruce in central europe and for further improvement of the chapy model potential applications of the model for monitoring and management of p chalcographus are discussed keywords six toothed spruce bark beetle insect outbreak population dynamics voltinism ecological modelling pheromone trap trap tree monitoring 1 introduction the six toothed spruce bark beetle pityogenes chalcographus linnaeus 1761 coleoptera curculionidae scolytinae is a widely distributed forest pest in europe infesting mainly norway spruce picea abies l h karst and also some other native european and introduced north american conifers avtziz et al 2010 hedgren 2004 kacprzyk 2012 schwerdtfeger 1929 p chalcographus is commonly regarded as the second most important insect pest of norway spruce in central europe after european spruce bark beetle ips typographus linnaeus 1758 coleoptera scolytinae göthlin et al 2000 hedgren 2004 hedgren et al 2003 kula and ząbecki 2006 p chalcographus preferably attacks either young spruce trees or the tops and branches of older spruce trees usually after they have suffered from previous damage caused by drought pollutants or simultaneous attack by the i typographus göthlin et al 2000 hedgren 2004 schroeder 2013 zúbrik et al 2008 the relatively good capacity of p chalcographus for host plant shifting and dispersal bertheau et al 2012 bertheau et al 2009 together with global climatic changes that negatively affect the health status of norway spruce stands may result in increasing occurrence of population outbreaks of this pest in the future avtziz et al 2010 heliövaara and peltonen 1999 ogris and jurc 2010 verkaik et al 2009 phenology models play an important role in insect ecology and pest management berec et al 2013 damos and savopoulou soultani 2012 depinay et al 2004 otero et al 2008 they are indispensable tools for predicting swarming periods thus allowing timely deployment of monitoring e g by pheromone traps or trap trees baier et al 2007 ogris et al 2019 also phenology models enable us to discern sister generations that are hard to recognize in the field and frequently disregarded in studies of bark beetle population dynamics e g fahse and heurich 2011 despite their significant contribution to population size wermelinger and seifert 1999 simulation models that aim to predict bark beetle dynamics at a specific location to a sufficient degree of accuracy should thus take sister generations into account berec et al 2013 additionally phenology models tell us to what extent the diapausing bark beetles develop which is an important factor in determining the probability that they will survive winter additionally to assess the likelihood of mass outbreaks in time appropriate monitoring tools need to accurately predict the actual developmental process of the bark beetle population and the number of bark beetle generations per year such a tool or model would need to address the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bark beetle population and its temperature dependant phenology including timing and the number of all filial and sister generations although basic information on voltinism and the phenology of p chalcographus is known coeln et al 1996 führer and chen 1979 lobinger 1994 zumr 1982 a phenology model is missing in contrast for i typographus a comprehensive phenology model called phenips has been developed and used in several countries in central europe baier et al 2012 baier et al 2007 berec et al 2013 phenips predicts spatiotemporal dynamics including the number and timing of all filial and sister generations and the actual developmental process of the i typographus population phenips was validated calibrated for a new geographical region slovenia and appropriately changed through this process the rity 2 model was developed ogris et al 2019 rity 2 was successfully incorporated into two web applications that serve as tools for the timely deployment of pheromone traps and trap trees for monitoring of i typographus population abundance ogris 2018a b the purpose of this study was to develop calibrate and validate a phenology model of p chalcographus we used rity 2 as a framework on which we developed a phenological model called chapy acronym for chalcographus pityogenes 2 material and methods 2 1 area description approximately 58 of slovenia is covered with forests zgs 2018b although slovenia is relatively small in area it is comprised of the alpine pre alpine dinaric pre dinaric pre pannonian and pre mediterranean biogeographical regions all of which have their own climatic conditions and typical forest habitat types zupančič et al 1987 the most common tree species is european beech fagus sylvatica l followed by norway spruce norway spruce is most abundant in the alpine pre alpine dinaric and pre dinaric regions in the last twenty years slovenia has experienced two large epidemic periods of spruce bark beetle outbreaks de groot and ogris 2019 one period started in 2003 during extremely warm and dry climatic conditions and this epidemic period continued until 2008 after this period sanitary felling was higher than that in the period before the 2003 drought the years 2012 and 2013 were very dry and there was a noticeable increase in sanitary felling of norway spruce because of bark beetles however in 2014 there was a large scale ice storm that affected 9 3 mio m3 of trees zgs 2018b although a larger proportion of deciduous trees were affected than coniferous trees nagel et al 2016 many spruce trees were damaged de groot et al 2018 this could be one of the reasons why sanitary felling increased dramatically because of bark beetle outbreaks de groot et al 2018 between 2014 and 2017 7 1 mio m3 of norway spruce were sanitary felled due to bark beetles as a response to the damage caused by the ice storm in 2014 zgs 2018c in december 2017 2 2 mio m3 of trees were felled by a catastrophic windthrow event which damaged mostly conifers 90 zgs 2018a therefore there is an increased risk of p chalcographus outbreaks which is a common occurrence after such events göthlin et al 2000 kacprzyk 2012 2 2 modelling workflow the modelling procedure was performed in the following order 1 field studies were set up to acquire data for model validation and calibration 2 a sensitivity analysis of daily effective thermal sum was performed 3 calibration of the model parameters 3 1 calibration of the lower developmental threshold 3 2 calibration of the effective temperature above the optimal temperature 3 3 calibration of the spring date threshold from which calculation of the model is initiated 3 4 calibration of the end of mass swarming 4 model validation 4 1 validation of daily and cumulative effective thermal sums 4 2 validation of maximum air temperature at which flight activity initiates 4 3 validation of thermal sums needed for onset of swarming and onset of tree colonization 4 4 validation of brood development rate 4 5 validation of duration of developmental stages 4 6 validation of re emergence of parental beetles i e development of sister broods 2 3 field studies field experiments were conducted on the same study sites used for rity 2 ogris et al 2019 at the southern edge of the kamnik savinja alps in 2017 in the south eastern hills of the ljubljana marshes in the dinaric alps in 2018 and in the vicinity of lake bled in 2018 the timing of spring swarming of p chalcographus was recorded during two consecutive years 2017 2018 using flight barrier traps witatrap witasek pflanzenschutz gmbh feldkirchen in kärnten austria baited with chalcoprax basf se ludwigshafen germany the traps one per site were placed at four sites in 2017 vodice kamnik brode and prevala and five sites in 2018 medvedica turjak erjavčev laz mokrc and vorenčkojca at different elevations table 1 we counted the number of captured beetles at two to three day intervals to observe the onset of tree colonization and brood development we used eight trap logs pruned trap trees at eight different sites in 2017 and 2018 one trap log per site table 1 the length of the trap logs ranged from 12 8 to 35 0 m average 28 2 m and diameter at breast height ranged from 21 to 46 cm average 35 cm the trap logs were placed under the canopy in shade to half shade conditions we inspected every trap log for the possible presence of overwintering beetles no entrance holes were found in freshly felled logs at weekly intervals newly bored entrance holes were identified by fresh frass and marked with coloured tacks and numbered consecutively at the same time breeding systems under the marked entrance holes were inspected by removing pieces of bark the most advanced developmental stage of offspring was recorded as soon as the brood reached the pupal stage two to three chunks with different onsets of infestation length 40 70 cm were removed from the trap log and transferred into two plant growth chambers rk 1000 ch kambič d o o semič slovenia for daily observation of emerging filial beetles in the first plant growth chamber logs were kept at 23 0 0 3 c 70 relative humidity and long day photoperiods of 16 h light and 8 h dark settings in the second chamber were identical except for temperature which was set to 28 0 0 3 c the actual temperature and relative humidity in each of the plant growth chambers were recorded with two sensors at 30 min interval voltcraft dl 120th conrad electronic se germany daily observation of emerging filial beetles at two different temperatures in plant growth chambers effectively doubled the sample size and enabled validation of the cumulative thermal sum of effective temperatures for the total development of p chalcographus with high accuracy relative air humidity and air temperature at the pheromone trap and trap log sites were recorded at 30 min intervals using sht21 sensors sensirion ag switzerland placed into a solar radiation shield 2 m above the ground likewise we recorded bark temperature at 30 min intervals at the crown base of each trap log at four positions around the trunk top bottom and lateral sides using thermistor sensors ntcle305e4103sb vishay intertechnology inc all sensors were connected to a compact and multi purpose ftp data logger laboratory for electronic devices slovenian forestry institute slovenia the data were transferred automatically via gprs signal and were thus available in real time using the eemis sfi web application ames d o o and slovenian forestry institute slovenia 2 4 modelling temperatures the climatic model used was identical to that used for rity 2 ogris et al 2019 the same procedures for air temperature and bark temperature were used for chapy eqs a 1 a 6 however there were differences in the calculation of daily effective thermal sums the air temperature 2 m above the ground was measured at every study site every 30 min as explained in section 2 3 in the application of the chapy model interpolated air temperature from the inca system was used haiden et al 2011 kann et al 2012 ogris 2017a b analysis and nowcasting contains several meteorological parameters of which we used only air temperature 2 m above the ground the update frequency of air temperature from the inca system is one hour minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures from the inca system were used in the chapy model the linear regression models for minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures in the forest stand were calculated using measured air temperature in the forest stands from study sites as the target variable and interpolated air temperature from the inca system as the source variable estimates of minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures in the forest stand were then calculated using the appropriate regression coefficients eqs a 1 a 3 ogris et al 2019 we recorded the bark temperature at the crown base of each of the eight trap logs at four positions around the trunk top bottom and lateral sides at a time interval of 30 min to estimate daily minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures we used linear regression analysis with observed air temperature as the source variable and measured bark temperature as the target variable estimates of minimum mean and maximum daily bark temperatures in the forest stand were then calculated using the appropriate regression coefficients eqs a 4 a 6 ogris et al 2019 the daily and cumulative effective thermal sums for bark beetle development were calculated from the difference between the daily mean bark temperature and the lower developmental threshold dtl within the range of dtl and optimum temperature to to avoid overestimating the effective thermal sum at bark temperatures between to and the upper developmental threshold dtu we corrected the estimated daily thermal sums by calculating the effective bark temperature sum of a nonlinear model eq 5 the daily and cumulative effective thermal sums were calculated the daily effective thermal sum was calculated from the observed bark temperature recorded every 30 min for validation of the thermal sums we used the estimated bark temperature calculated by the formulas available from rity 2 eqs a 4 a 6 ogris et al 2019 the cumulative effective thermal sum was calculated over the entire study period of measuring effective bark temperatures in the field 2 5 sensitivity analysis of the daily effective thermal sum two different sensitivity indexes describing the proportion of variance of the procedure for calculation of effective temperature y explained by the variation of a given parameter xi were calculated using the sobol jansen method implemented in the sensitivity package of the r software program iooss et al 2019 the sobol jansen method implements monte carlo estimation of the variance based method for sensitivity analysis proposed by sobol 1993 and later improved by jansen 1999 and saltelli et al 2010 more precisely these functions allow the estimation of the first order main effect and total effect indices from the variance decomposition the main effect index is defined as 1 s i v a r x i e x i y x i v a r y with 2 i 1 n s i 1 s i 0 y is the prediction and xi is the ith parameter of the procedure for calculation of effective temperature dtl to dtu the notation x i indicates the set of all variables except xi the numerator represents the contribution of the main effect of xi to the variation in the output i e the effect of varying xi alone but average over variations in other input parameters si is standardized by the total variance to provide the fractional contribution of each parameter i the total effect index is defined as 3 s t i e x i v a r x i y x i v a r y 1 v a r x i e x i y x i v a r y with 4 i 1 n s t i 1 s t i 0 sti measures the contribution of xi to the variation in the output including all variances caused by its interactions with any other input variables with the sensitivity analysis we tested main and total effect on the variance of the three parameters for calculating effective temperature i e dtl to and dtu the sensitivity analysis was performed with 12 000 parameter combinations we used uniform distribution for two random samples n 2 000 the bounds of the sampling distributions were dtl 3 0 11 0 to 28 0 36 0 dtu 36 1 42 0 the sensitivity analysis of the procedure for calculation of effective temperature was tested on the interval of air temperature 0 44 0 the sensitivity analysis was performed with 3 000 bootstrap replicates 2 6 model calibration 2 6 1 lower development threshold the lower temperature threshold for the movement of p chalcographus was found to be 8 c zumr 1982 usually each developmental stage has its own lower developmental threshold wermelinger and seifert 1998 phenips and rity 2 use average dtl from egg to pupae baier et al 2007 ogris et al 2019 therefore we assumed the possibility that the dtl for development from egg to adult of p chalcographus could be different than the dtl for the movement of adult beetles 8 c the most appropriate dtl was chosen with an iteration procedure where the lowest mean absolute error mae of predicted emergence of filial beetles from trap logs was observed dtl was sought in the range from 3 0 to 11 0 c at 0 1 c increments 2 6 2 spring swarming onset of infestation and end of mass swarming to predict the onset of spring swarming and infestation we compared the observed onset of trap catches and trap log infestation with the observed thermal conditions for flight activity additionally the observed onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization by p chalcographus was compared with the cumulative thermal sum of maximum air temperatures above dtl accumulated from the latest date onwards using estimated temperature data according to slovenian records the onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization can already occur in the beginning of march jurc 2008 ogris 2012 therefore accumulation of the thermal sum must begin before that we used an iterative procedure to identify the latest date to start calculation of the cumulative thermal sum for the onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization ogris et al 2019 we chose the date that produced the lowest mae of the predicted onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization we calibrated end of mass swarming in late summer with an independent dataset of 1 017 flight barrier theysohn traps monitored by slovenia forest service in the period from 2015 to 2019 at least at 11 day intervals gis and zgs 2020 ogris 2012 2020 95 4 of traps were equipped with a pheromone product pc ecolure fytofarm ltd bratislava slovak republic while the rest had chalcoprax basf se ludwigshafen germany because the traps were monitored at different intervals and different dates the data was harmonized and averaged to ten to eleven day periods from the beginning of april to the end of october 2 6 3 brood development in order to describe the relation between the developmental rate of p chalcographus and temperature we used both a linear function with only dtl see equation a 7 and a nonlinear function as proposed by wermelinger and seifert 1998 for i typographus and calibrated for p chalcographus effective temperatures for development from the egg stage to the emergence of mature filial beetles were adapted using to dtl and dtu to and dtu were not known for p chalcographus at the time of the study dtu was set with the help of a database of thermal requirements for insects and mites jarošík et al 2011 2012 the dtu for species of the curculionidae family is 39 4 c this dtu was used by chapy to our knowledge to for p chalcographus has not yet been studied we assumed that to is similar to i typographus wermelinger and seifert 1998 and i duplicatus davídková and doležal 2019 therefore we considered 30 0 c as to the effective temperature teff was estimated using the nonlinear function of the modified logan model lactin et al 1995 logan et al 1976 with the assumption that the relative developmental rate increases linearly within the range of dtl and to and that the relative developmental rate is equal to 1 at to for temperatures outside the lower and upper temperature thresholds t dtl and t dtu teff was set to zero the effective temperature within the range between to and dtu was calculated with the nonlinear function of the modified logan model whose parameters were estimated iteratively by means of nonlinear regression analysis within the range of dtl and dtu a thermal sum of 518 598 dd is required for the total development of p chalcographus harding et al 1986 the upper limit of this range was used as a reference value for comparison k 598 dd relative thermal sums for the egg larval pupal and maturation feeding stages are not known for p chalcographus therefore we assumed that the relative proportions are similar to i typographus wermelinger and seifert 1998 egg 10 larvae 40 pupae 10 and maturation feeding 40 respectively a study performed by harding et al 1986 recorded re emergence therefore formation of sister broods is also included in the calculation of the phenology model sister broods or re emergence is a phenomenon common to the spruce bark beetle and several other species of the scolytinae subfamily davídková and doležal 2017 after mating the female deposits the first brood it may then re emerge and after regeneration feeding re enter the same or a different tree to produce one or more so called sister broods anderbrant and löfqvist 1988 wermelinger and seifert 1999 a conceptual diagram summarizing the main steps of the chapy model calculation is presented in fig 1 a detailed description of the model computation along with the formulae is given in appendix a 2 7 model validation to determine the accuracy of the phenological model we compared the effective thermal sum computed with eqs a 7 a 9 using 30 min recorded bark temperatures at the date of imago emergence with k for validation of the predicted onset of emergence of filial beetles calculated from the inca data we compared the estimated effective thermal sum at the date of emergence predicted by the model with k the development rate was calculated with the min avg and max scenarios according to the btmin btavg and btmax effective bark temperatures respectively eqs a 4 a 9 the onset of swarming and infestation was always calculated using corrected daily maximum air temperatures from the inca atmax eqs a 10 and a 11 onset of swarming was additionally validated with independent dataset of 22 flight barrier theysohn traps equipped with a pheromone product pc ecolure tubus fytofarm ltd bratislava slovak republic those pheromone traps were monitored by slovenia forest service during 2015 2020 at least once per week similarly onset of infestation was additionally validated with independent dataset of 78 trap trees that were monitored at least once per week by slovenia forest service gis and zgs 2020 ogris 2012 2020 2 8 statistics and data management statistical analyses were performed using the r software environment for statistical computing r core team 2018 wherein the following packages were used sensitivity iooss et al 2019 rodbc ripley and lapsley 2017 desctools signorell et al 2018 and raster hijmans 2016 linear relations were analysed using linear regression analysis for nonlinear relations the nls nonlinear least squares procedure was used a one sample kolmogorov smirnov test was applied to verify normal distribution of test variables pairs of means were compared using the paired sample t test deviations of the mean of a single variable from a specified test value were tested by the one sample t test we used microsoft sql server 2016 as a database for modelling and calculation of thermal sums for predicting phenological events graphs were drawn with microsoft excel for office 365 16 0 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis of the effective temperature the first order main effect explained in total 8 0 of the output variation where dtl had the highest and dtu the lowest effect fig 2 the rest of the variation was explained by air temperature the second order interaction total effect explained in total 30 4 of the variation of the parameters on the predictions of the effective temperature where dtl explained nearly the same level of variance as the first order effect dtu had an even smaller influence on the output variation and to had the greatest interaction effect among the parameters and a substantial increase in comparison to the first order effect 3 2 model calibration 3 2 1 lower development threshold the procedure for calculation of effective temperature includes three parameters dtl to and dtu the observed temperatures in the field and the growth chambers were not greater than to thus calibration of to and dtu was not possible due to lack of data therefore only dtl was calibrated while to and dtu were assumed as already explained in the methods section the most appropriate dtl was chosen with the iteration procedure where the lowest mae of the predicted emergence of filial beetles from trap logs was observed low maes below 2 28 days were achieved in the range between 6 1 and 8 3 c the lowest mae with the lowest standard error was achieved at 7 4 c which was chosen as the dtl fig 3 a steep increase in mae was observed above 8 3 c and below 4 5 c 3 2 2 effective temperature above optimum temperature the effective temperature within the range between to and dtu was calculated with eq 5 the parameters α β γ and tmax were estimated iteratively by means of nonlinear regression analysis within the range of dtl and dtu fig 4 5 t eff t o d t l exp α t exp α t max t max t β γ where α 0 031 β 5 3 γ 1 25 tmax 41 97 teff 0 when t dtl and t dtu 3 2 3 spring date threshold of the model calculation factors other than the lower air temperature threshold for flight activity atmax 16 8 c lobinger 1994 zumr 1982 might influence the start of reproductive activities in the spring we assumed that the thermal sum determines the onset of swarming and infestation the earliest onset of swarming occurred at the brode and kamnik locations on 20 03 2017 therefore the accumulation of thermal sum had to start before that date the lowest mean absolute error for prediction of the onset of swarming and infestation was determined with an iterative procedure ogris et al 2019 the latest lowest mae was achieved on 9th march fig 5 which was chosen as the spring date threshold of the model calculation 3 2 4 end of mass swarming mean number of beetles caught in the pheromone traps gradually decreased from middle of july to the beginning of september fig 6 a linear relationship between the mean daylength and the mean number of caught beetles per ten to eleven day periods from the middle of july to the beginning of september was found with very high correlation coefficient r 0 986 fig 7 in september at daylength below 13 6 h a very low number of beetles were caught on average 807 in the traps even though atmax was sufficiently high for swarming 22 1 26 4 c fig 6 in october no swarming was recorded because atmax was below the flight temperature 15 6 c we concluded that swarming of p chalcographus beetles in the late summer was mainly limited by daylength while maximum air temperature had only a minor effect at daylength below 13 6 h finally we included daylength limit of 13 6 h into the model as a threshold for end of swarming in the late summer additionally the same pattern was found in the spring i e mass swarming started when the mean daylength was greater than 13 5 h fig 6 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 daily effective thermal sum the estimated daily effective thermal sum showed a mae of 1 01 dd and a root mean square error rmse of 1 34 dd for mean bark temperature the correlation between the estimated and observed daily thermal sums was relatively high for mean bark temperature with r2 0 86 and was significant p 0 001 the modelled cumulative effective thermal sum for the whole study period showed a mae of 72 6 dd and a rmse of 80 3 dd for mean bark temperature table 2 an average observed bteff was 5 7 dd per day therefore mae of 72 6 dd resulted in an average error of 12 8 days during an average study period of 91 6 days the variability explained between the estimated and observed cumulative thermal sums was low r2 0 086 and not significant p 0 244 mean cumulative observed and estimated thermal sums of mean bark temperature did not differ significantly t 0 726 p 0 4913 estimated cumulative thermal sums were underestimated by 21 2 dd for mean bark temperature the confidence interval for the ratio between the estimated and observed thermal sums was 96 4 13 2 3 3 2 spring swarming and onset of infestation bark beetles were captured in pheromone traps when the daily mean maximum air temperature atmax exceeded 17 3 c our observations indicate that p chalcographus initiated flight activity at a daily minimum observed atmax of 13 0 c which corresponds to the estimated daily maximum air temperature of 15 6 c the latter was used as the threshold for the phenological model calculation see appendix a major flight the first day with a catch 100 individuals than that of the last counting occurred on days when atmax was above 20 9 c the first attacks of p chalcographus on trap logs in spring were observed at a mean atmax of 21 3 2 3 c initial infestation of trap trees occurred 6 40 days after the initial swarming table 3 the longest gap of 40 days between the onset of swarming and onset of infestation occurred at the highest location prevala locations with a lower elevation had a lower delay of initial infestation after the onset of swarming i e 6 23 days table 1 and table 3 our observations indicate that flight activity was initiated when the thermal sum atmax 7 4 c accumulated from 9th march onwards was on average 80 5 26 2 dd the first colonization of trap logs was observed when the thermal sum reached 216 5 52 0 dd table 3 a variance of these results expressed through confidence interval can be partially explained with an interval of monitoring which was a source of uncertainty two to three day intervals with an average teff 3 6 dd represented an uncertainty up to 10 9 dd while seven day intervals with an average teff 5 6 dd represented an uncertainty up to 39 2 dd fig 8 using the accumulated thermal sum in combination with flight activity and date threshold the onset of spring swarming was estimated with a mae of 5 6 days and the onset of trap log colonization in spring was estimated with a mae of 6 0 days table 3 furthermore both onset of spring swarming and onset of infestation were estimated with a similar mae of 5 8 days with the independent dataset of 22 pheromone traps and 78 trap trees the difference between the observed and predicted onset of swarming of nine pheromone traps was 11 days earlier at minimum and 14 days later at maximum the difference between the observed and predicted onset of infestation of eight trap logs was 11 days earlier at minimum and 10 days later at maximum table 3 3 3 3 brood development all eight trap logs felled in 2017 and 2018 were colonized by p chalcographus table 3 eight trap logs were monitored until the emergence of filial beetles and altogether 18 sample chunks were monitored in growth chambers at two constant temperatures 23 c and 28 c every day with different onsets of infestation table s1 for validation of the brood development rate we compared the observed onset of emergence of filial beetles with the thermal sum of 30 min measured bark temperatures at four positions around the trunk eqs a 7 a 9 using the same calculation procedure of harding et al 1986 including different dtl 8 0 c provided by zumr 1982 for comparison we used the reference value k 598 dd provided by harding et al 1986 which used different dtl 8 c from ours dtl 7 4 c to make this comparison we had to use the same calculation procedure along the same dtl 8 c the thermal sum at the time of emergence was not significantly different from the test value k 598 dd for both observed emergence and predicted emergence from hourly and daily data p 0 05 table 4 the mean deviations of the calculated thermal sum from the required thermal sum 598 dd ranged from 15 3 to 25 3 dd for hourly data and 6 9 to 11 1 dd for daily data table 4 therefore daily air temperature was used to calculate the phenological model following the chapy calculation procedure appendix a the observed mean thermal sum for the total development of filial beetles was 652 8 22 7 c table s1 the predicted mean thermal sum for the total development of filial beetles was 635 4 31 4 c the observed mean thermal sum was not significantly different from the predicted mean thermal sum for the total development of filial beetles t 1 1881 d f 17 p 0 251 the implementation of the chapy model uses the inca dataset as model input thus the predicted thermal sum of 635 4 dd was used as the thermal sum required for total development from egg to mature beetle model parameter k see appendix a the predicted emergence of filial beetles was estimated with a mae of 2 11 days with a minimum of nine days too early and four days too late the deviation of the estimated emergence from the observed data had high correlation with the estimated thermal sum and was significant r2 0 985 p 0 001 the duration of three developmental stages was observed i e egg larval and a combination of the pupal and teneral adult stages the relative durations of the developmental stages of p chalcographus were calculated with regard to k the mean duration of the egg larval and combination of the pupal and teneral adult developmental stages was 9 4 58 2 and 32 4 respectively table 5 in accordance with the reference values wermelinger and seifert 1998 the mean difference for the duration of the egg stage was 0 6 shorter the larval stage was 18 2 longer and the combination of the pupal teneral adult stage was 17 6 shorter table 5 the duration of developmental stages in the phenology model was calculated with adjusted mean values egg 10 larvae 60 pupae 10 teneral adult maturation feeding 20 see appendix a 3 3 4 re emergence the earliest time of re emergence of parental beetles was observed 43 days after trap log colonization at the prevala location the relative thermal sum at the time of re emergence of parental beetles was on average 69 2 4 8 with a minimum of 56 1 calculated from daily observed bark temperatures table s1 the relative thermal sum expressed as a percentage of the thermal sum required for total development at the time of re emergence was on average 68 0 4 6 with a minimum of 52 7 according to the estimated bark temperature these results are based on the daily observations in the two plant growth chambers the minimum observed time of re emergence of parental beetles is more likely correct than the average value thus for modelling the re emergence of parental beetles we used a relative thermal sum of 50 i e 317 7 dd which is an approximation of the observed minimum see eq a 13 4 discussion we validated several aspects of chapy the modelled and actual timing of spring swarming onset of infestation re emergence of parental beetles completion of the first filial generation and the duration of developmental stages we found remarkable agreement between the daily effective thermal sums of modelled and measured mean bark temperatures ogris et al 2019 thus air temperature data from the inca were able to quite accurately predict effective thermal sum cumulative thermal sums were generally slightly underestimated using accumulated thermal sum in combination with flight activity and date threshold the onset of spring swarming and infestation was estimated with a relatively low mean absolute error re emergence of parental beetles was observed at approximately half of the relative thermal sum required for total development the thermal sum at the time of emergence was not significantly different from the reference value for both observed and predicted emergence from hourly and daily data the estimated and observed developmental rates were not always comparable between observations and predictions especially for higher elevations therefore chapy was calculated according to the three scenarios to encompass all possible outcomes eqs a 1 a 6 in this study we used the rity 2 model ogris et al 2019 which is based on the phenips model baier et al 2007 as the framework for modelling p chalcographus and the chapy model was the result rity 2 was substantially changed to reflect the phenology of p chalcographus 1 the effective bark temperature between to and dtu was calculated with new sets of parameters for the non linear function eq 5 a 8 2 the date threshold for spring swarming was found with an iterative procedure to be 9th march 3 the limiting atmax for the onset of swarming was set to 15 6 c 4 the onset of swarming was calculated with a thermal sum of 80 5 dd eq a 10 5 the onset of infestation was calculated with a thermal sum of 216 5 dd eq a 11 6 the necessary thermal sum for total development k was set to 635 4 dd eq a 12 and 7 preimaginal development was set at a relative thermal sum of 80 of the thermal sum required for total development during the chapy validation process several knowledge gaps in the phenology of p chalcographus were identified therefore several assumptions were made for key elements in the biology of the six toothed spruce bark beetle 1 t o was assumed to be 30 0 c 2 dtu was assumed to be 39 4 c 3 dtl for each developmental stage is missing however in our study it was found that a dtl of 7 4 c had the lowest mae of predicted emergence of filial beetles and it was assumed that 7 4 c represents a mean dtl for development of p chalcographus from egg to mature beetle 4 the date threshold for calculation of the onset of swarming was searched with an iterative procedure and it was assumed to be 9th march 5 the daylength limit for the onset of a new filial or sister brood was assumed to be at 13 6 h on the basis of monitoring of 1 017 pheromone traps eqs a 13 a 15 the daylength threshold was assumed solely on the swarming data without verifying if diapause actually initiated furthermore diapause initiation is implemented in a very strict manner where only daylength 13 6 h is considered even though it probably could also be influenced by temperature führer and chen 1979 however according to our study swarming is substantially dropped after the daylength 13 6 h even though the temperatures were favourable for flight activity 6 the model calculation continues into a winter and it is concluded by 31st december as brood development might continue during winter at temperatures above dtl štefková et al 2017 however winter mortality might be slightly underestimated and number of generations slightly overestimated in the case of an early frost period e g in november and later in december 7 since solid data on the thermal sum of effective bark temperatures for each developmental stage is missing duration thresholds for each developmental stage were set according to our recorded data 8 since the adult stage is the most widespread overwintering stage koštál et al 2014 it is assumed that preimaginal stages of p chalcographus do not survive winter all these assumptions could have a substantial impact on chapy output each of these assumptions represents an ideal opportunity for further research on the phenology of p chalcographus and the further improvement of chapy the first priority would be finding an observed optimum temperature which had the greatest total effect in the sensitivity analysis among the parameters for the predictions of the effective temperatures fig 2 the next priority would be finding actual relationship between daylength limit and temperature for the diapause initiation as this might have considerable effect on part of model outputs e g number of generations daily and cumulative estimated thermal sums fitted less well for chapy than for rity 2 supposedly due to the assumed optimum temperature for which the total effect was high according to the sensitivity analysis the estimated cumulative thermal sum of effective bark temperatures was underestimated by 3 6 chapy and 2 5 rity 2 therefore the observed development rate was usually slightly faster than modelled the validation for the study sites at lower elevations showed quite good agreement between predicted and observed cumulative thermal sums while the higher locations had greater error of predicted cumulative thermal sum this pattern was supported by the high correlation that was found between the deviation of estimated emergence from observed data and estimated thermal sum this rule could indicate that locations at higher elevations might need a higher cumulative thermal sum for the total development of filial beetles nevertheless further research is needed to prove this hypothesis in this study we observed the re emergence of parental beetles that established a sister brood in contrast lekander and lindelöw 1977 found no indication of a sister brood in sweden and according to histological examinations by zumr and soldan 1981 p chalcographus has only one reproductive cycle and dies after oviposition however there is increasing evidence that at least one sister brood does occur in central european p chalcographus populations according to our observations see table s1 and several other studies harding et al 1986 kacprzyk and bednarz 2015 kasumović 2016 these contradictory observations about the existence of a sister brood demand further research to clarify this phenomenon in p chalcographus we assume that geographic latitude daylength temperature variation and genetic differences between populations of p chalcographus might play a considerable role furthermore our study had a small sample consisting of nine pheromone traps and only eight trap logs felled at different locations with different elevations aspects and slopes table 1 we were therefore not able to fully capture the overall variability of the spatiotemporal dynamics of p chalcographus in slovenia we believe that a larger sample encompassing all biogeographical regions in slovenia equally would give somewhat different thresholds and parameters of chapy following the same calibration procedures chapy can be used at any location however regional specific thresholds need to be calibrated and validated to reflect the specific conditions of the region chapy was implemented into two public web applications in slovenian only the first is point based and produces a chart of relative thermal sums of the predicted development of p chalcographus according to the min avg and max scenarios for any location in slovenia ogris 2019c the second web application is raster based and produces several maps of the predicted development of p chalcographus for the whole slovenia ogris 2019d on the map we can observe time series for the development of bark beetle developmental stages for several filial and sister broods onset of spring swarming onset of infestation of different broods and number of filial and sister broods the source codes for both applications are publicly available ogris 2019a b potential applications of chapy for monitoring and management of p chalcographus are numerous in our case chapy is used along with rity 2 to improve the efficiency of bark beetle monitoring it is incorporated into an automatic e messaging system that informs 14 regional and 69 local units of the slovenia forest service about the predicted onset of swarming and completion of first filial generation ogris et al 2019 i e the key dates for evaluation of the p chalcographus population abundance at the trap location when the catch in the trap from the beginning of spring swarming until the end of the first generation exceeds 20 000 beetles an outbreak is imminent and an attack on healthy host trees can be expected rs 2009 once the risk threshold has been exceeded several control strategies can be applied i e increasing the number of the traps mass trapping setting up trap trees conducting a more careful survey of spruce forests and eventually cutting recently attacked trees via sanitation programmes faccoli and stergulc 2004 2006 jurc et al 2017 schroeder 2013 all these actions are carried out to keep p chalcographus populations at endemic levels thus avoiding outbreaks and subsequent damage that could be caused by i typographus furthermore the utilization of detailed data on air temperature for modelling bark temperatures provides a precise monitoring of the actual state of bark beetle development at the specific model grid cell chapy simulates the maximum number of generations at each model grid cell what can be used for assessing the likelihood of outbreaks and their potential impacts at the regional scale the last but not the least the model can be used for long term assessment of the climate change effects while modelling the change in maximum number of generations at different temperature scenarios 5 conclusions the chapy model includes the prediction of the time of spring swarming onset of infestation re emergence of parental beetles and the number and emergence time of filial and sister broods as several model parameters were missing a sensitivity analysis was performed and model parameters were calibrated to best fit the observed data to validate the model we compared the recorded air temperature bark temperature flight activity and developmental progress in trap logs at various altitudes and relief aspects with phenological events predicted by the model additionally independent datasets of pheromone traps and trap logs were used to validate onset of spring swarming onset of infestation and end of mass swarming in late summer the result is a validated calibrated and implemented chapy model the sensitivity analysis validation and calibration procedure of chapy showed that the phenological model quite accurately simulates the seasonal dynamics of p chalcographus populations the model was successfully incorporated into publicly available web tools to our knowledge chapy is the first comprehensive phenological model for p chalcographus and thus contributes to progress in ecological modelling nevertheless chapy is based on several assumptions that provide opportunities for further phenology research on the second most damaging spruce bark beetle in central europe and thus further improvement of the model 6 credit author statement nikica ogris conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources data curation writing original

24832,the purpose of the study was to develop calibrate and validate a comprehensive phenological model for the spatiotemporal simulation of the seasonal development of the six toothed spruce bark beetle pityogenes chalcographus chapy the validation dataset was acquired through monitoring of the bark beetle s phenology at eight sites in slovenia in 2017 and 2018 along with air and bark temperature measurements the predictions were made using air temperature from the inca system integrated nowcasting through comprehensive analysis which is used to calculate the effective bark temperature for beetle development since the biology of p chalcographus is poorly studied a sensitivity analysis was used to pinpoint the most important model parameters the first order main effect was the highest for the lower developmental threshold dtl while the second order interaction total effect was the highest for the optimum temperature to dtl was calibrated with an iterative procedure and the best result with the lowest mean absolute error mae was achieved at 7 4 c effective temperatures in the range between to and the upper developmental threshold were calculated with a nonlinear function whose parameters were appropriately calibrated the spring date threshold when the model calculation starts was calibrated with an iterative procedure and set at 9th march which had the minimum mae the onset of norway spruce infestation in spring was estimated using a lower threshold of 15 6 c for flight activity and a mean thermal sum of 216 5 degree days dd from 9th march onward the observed mean thermal sum required for total development of filial beetles was 652 8 22 7 c while the predicted mean thermal sum was 635 4 31 4 c re emergence of parental beetles occurred when 52 7 of the minimum thermal sum for total development was reached the relative duration of the egg larval and combination of the pupal and teneral adult developmental stages was 9 4 58 2 and 32 4 respectively mass swarming concluded in the end of august when daylength was lower than 13 6 h which was determined with the independent dataset of 1 017 pheromone traps the diapause initiation at a daylength 13 6 h is included in the model as an assumption successful hibernation of established broods is predicted by assessing the developmental stage of initiated generations at the 31st december for validation we compared the timing of phenological events in the field with predicted events using both 30 minute recorded data at study sites in the field and hourly data from the inca the time of spring swarming was estimated with a mae of 5 6 days the onset of infestation was predicted with a mae of 6 0 days the predicted onset of emergence of filial beetles was estimated with a mae of 2 1 days additionally chapy simulates the number of generations chapy was successfully incorporated into two publicly available web applications development of the model revealed several knowledge gaps in p chalcographus phenology thus providing opportunities for further research of the second most damaging bark beetle of norway spruce in central europe and for further improvement of the chapy model

the relatively good capacity of p chalcographus for host plant shifting and dispersal bertheau et al 2012 bertheau et al 2009 together with global climatic changes that negatively affect the health status of norway spruce stands may result in increasing occurrence of population outbreaks of this pest in the future avtziz et al 2010 heliövaara and peltonen 1999 ogris and jurc 2010 verkaik et al

for predicting swarming periods thus allowing timely deployment of monitoring e g by pheromone traps or trap trees baier et al 2007 ogris et al 2019 also phenology models enable us to discern sister

population size wermelinger and seifert 1999 simulation models that aim to predict bark beetle dynamics at a specific location to a sufficient degree of accuracy should thus take sister generations into account berec et al 2013 additionally phenology models tell us to what extent the diapausing bark beetles develop which is an important factor in determining the probability that they will survive winter additionally to assess the likelihood of mass outbreaks in time appropriate monitoring tools need to accurately predict the actual developmental process of the bark beetle population and the number of bark beetle generations per year such a tool or model would need to address the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bark beetle population and its temperature dependant phenology including timing and the number of all filial and sister generations although basic information on voltinism and the phenology of p chalcographus is known coeln et al 1996 führer and chen 1979 lobinger 1994 zumr 1982 a phenology model is missing in contrast for i typographus a comprehensive phenology model called phenips has been developed and used in several countries in central europe

comprised of the alpine pre alpine dinaric pre dinaric pre pannonian and pre mediterranean biogeographical regions all of which have their own climatic conditions and typical forest habitat types zupančič et al 1987 the most common tree species is european beech fagus sylvatica l followed by norway spruce norway spruce is most abundant in the alpine pre alpine dinaric and pre dinaric regions in the last twenty years slovenia has experienced two large epidemic periods of spruce bark beetle outbreaks de groot and ogris 2019 one period started in 2003 during extremely warm and dry climatic conditions and this epidemic period continued until 2008 after this period sanitary felling was higher than that in the period before the 2003 drought the years 2012 and 2013 were very dry and there was a noticeable increase in sanitary felling of norway spruce because of bark beetles however in 2014 there was a large scale ice storm that affected 9 3 mio m3 of trees zgs 2018b although a larger proportion of deciduous trees were affected than coniferous trees nagel et al 2016 many spruce trees were damaged de groot et al 2018 this could be one of the reasons why sanitary felling increased dramatically because of bark beetle outbreaks de groot et al 2018 between 2014 and 2017 7 1 mio m3 of norway spruce were sanitary felled due to bark beetles as a response to the damage caused by the ice storm in 2014 zgs 2018c in december 2017 2 2 mio m3 of trees were felled by a catastrophic windthrow event which damaged mostly conifers 90 zgs 2018a therefore there is an increased risk of p chalcographus outbreaks which is a common occurrence after such events göthlin et al 2000 kacprzyk 2012 2 2 modelling workflow the modelling procedure was performed in the following order 1 field

at the southern edge of the kamnik savinja alps in 2017 in the south eastern hills of the ljubljana marshes in the dinaric alps in 2018 and in the vicinity of lake bled in 2018 the timing of spring swarming of p chalcographus was recorded during two consecutive years 2017 2018 using flight barrier traps witatrap witasek pflanzenschutz gmbh feldkirchen in kärnten austria baited with chalcoprax basf se ludwigshafen germany the traps one per site were placed at four sites in 2017 vodice kamnik brode and prevala and five sites in 2018 medvedica turjak erjavčev laz mokrc and vorenčkojca at different elevations table 1 we counted the number of captured beetles at two to three day intervals to observe the onset of tree colonization and brood development we used eight trap logs pruned trap trees at eight different sites in 2017 and 2018 one trap log per site table 1 the length of the trap logs ranged from 12 8 to 35 0 m average 28 2 m and diameter at breast height ranged from 21 to 46 cm average 35 cm the trap logs were placed under the canopy in shade to half shade conditions we inspected every trap log for the possible presence of overwintering beetles no entrance holes were found in freshly felled logs at weekly intervals newly bored entrance holes were identified by fresh frass and marked with coloured tacks and numbered consecutively at the same time breeding systems under the marked entrance holes were inspected by removing pieces of bark the most advanced developmental stage of offspring was recorded as soon as the brood reached the pupal stage two to three chunks with different onsets of infestation length 40 70 cm were removed from the trap log and transferred into two plant growth chambers rk 1000 ch kambič d o o semič slovenia for daily observation of emerging filial beetles in the first plant growth chamber logs were kept at 23 0 0 3 c 70 relative humidity and long day photoperiods of 16 h light and 8 h dark settings in the second chamber were identical except for temperature which was set to 28 0 0 3 c the actual temperature and relative humidity in each of the plant growth chambers were recorded with two sensors at 30 min interval voltcraft dl 120th conrad electronic se germany daily observation of emerging filial beetles at two different temperatures in plant growth chambers effectively doubled the sample size and enabled validation of the cumulative thermal sum of effective temperatures for the total development of p chalcographus with high accuracy relative air humidity and air temperature at the pheromone trap and trap log sites were recorded at 30 min intervals using sht21 sensors sensirion ag switzerland placed into a solar radiation shield 2 m above the ground likewise we recorded bark temperature at 30 min intervals at the crown base of each trap log at four positions around the trunk top bottom and lateral sides using thermistor sensors ntcle305e4103sb vishay intertechnology inc all sensors were connected to a compact and multi purpose ftp data logger laboratory for electronic devices slovenian forestry institute slovenia the data were transferred automatically via gprs signal and were thus available in real time using the eemis sfi web application ames d o o and slovenian forestry institute slovenia 2 4 modelling temperatures the climatic model used was identical to that used for rity 2 ogris et al 2019 the same procedures for air temperature and bark temperature were used for chapy eqs a 1 a 6 however there were differences in the calculation of daily effective thermal sums the air temperature 2 m above the ground was measured at every study site every 30 min as explained in section 2 3 in the application of the chapy model interpolated air temperature from the inca system was used haiden et al 2011 kann et al 2012 ogris 2017a b analysis and nowcasting contains several meteorological parameters of which we used only air temperature 2 m above the ground the update frequency of air temperature from the inca system is one hour minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures from the inca system were used in the chapy model the linear regression models for minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures in the forest stand were calculated using measured air temperature in the forest stands from study sites as the target variable and interpolated air temperature from the inca system as the source variable estimates of minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures in the forest stand were then calculated using the appropriate regression coefficients eqs a 1 a 3 ogris et al 2019 we recorded the bark temperature at the crown base of each of the eight trap logs at four positions around the trunk top bottom and lateral sides at a time interval of 30 min to estimate daily minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures we used linear regression analysis with observed air temperature as the source variable and measured bark temperature as the target variable estimates of minimum mean and maximum daily bark temperatures in the forest stand were then calculated using the appropriate regression coefficients eqs a 4 a 6 ogris et al 2019 the daily and cumulative effective thermal sums for bark beetle development were calculated from the difference between the daily mean bark temperature and the lower developmental threshold dtl within the range of dtl and optimum temperature to to avoid overestimating the effective thermal sum at bark temperatures between to and the upper developmental threshold dtu we corrected the estimated daily thermal sums by calculating the effective bark temperature sum of a nonlinear model eq 5 the daily and cumulative effective thermal sums were calculated the daily effective thermal sum was calculated from the observed bark temperature recorded every 30 min for validation of the thermal sums we used the estimated bark temperature calculated by the formulas available from rity 2 eqs a 4 a 6 ogris et al 2019 the cumulative effective thermal sum was calculated over the entire study period of measuring effective bark temperatures in the field 2 5 sensitivity analysis of the daily effective thermal sum two different sensitivity indexes describing the proportion of variance of the procedure for calculation of effective temperature y explained by the variation of a given parameter xi were calculated using the sobol jansen method implemented in the sensitivity package of the r software program iooss et al 2019 the sobol jansen method implements monte carlo estimation of the variance based method for sensitivity analysis proposed by sobol 1993 and later improved by jansen 1999 and saltelli et al 2010 more precisely these functions allow the estimation of the first order main effect and total effect indices from the variance decomposition the main effect index is defined as 1 s i v a r x i e x i y x i v a r y with 2 i 1 n s i 1 s i 0 y is the prediction and xi is the ith parameter of the procedure for calculation of effective temperature dtl to dtu the notation x i indicates the set of all variables except xi the numerator represents the contribution of the main effect of xi to the variation in the output i e the effect of varying xi alone but average over variations in other input parameters si is standardized by the total variance to provide the fractional contribution of each parameter i the total effect index is defined as 3 s t i e x i v a r x i y x i v a r y 1 v a r x i e x i y x i v a r y with 4 i 1 n s t i 1 s t i 0 sti measures the contribution of xi to the variation in the output including all variances caused by its interactions with any other input variables with the sensitivity analysis we tested main and total effect on the variance of the three parameters for calculating effective temperature i e dtl to and dtu the sensitivity analysis was performed with 12 000 parameter combinations we used uniform distribution for two random samples n 2 000 the bounds of the sampling distributions were dtl 3 0 11 0 to 28 0 36 0 dtu 36 1 42 0 the sensitivity analysis of the procedure for calculation of effective temperature was tested on the interval of air temperature 0 44 0 the sensitivity analysis was performed with 3 000 bootstrap replicates 2 6 model calibration 2 6 1 lower development threshold the lower temperature threshold for the movement of p chalcographus was found to be 8 c zumr 1982 usually each developmental stage has its own lower developmental threshold wermelinger and seifert 1998 phenips and rity 2 use average dtl from egg to pupae baier et al 2007 ogris et al 2019 therefore we assumed the possibility that the dtl for development from egg to adult of p chalcographus could be different than the dtl for the movement of adult beetles 8 c the most appropriate dtl was chosen with an iteration procedure where the lowest mean absolute error mae of predicted emergence of filial beetles from trap logs was observed dtl was sought in the range from 3 0 to 11 0 c at 0 1 c increments 2 6 2 spring swarming onset of infestation and end of mass swarming to predict the onset of spring swarming and infestation we compared the observed onset of trap catches and trap log infestation with the observed thermal conditions for flight activity additionally the observed onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization by p chalcographus was compared with the cumulative thermal sum of maximum air temperatures above dtl accumulated from the latest date onwards using estimated temperature data according to slovenian records the onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization can already occur in the beginning of march jurc 2008 ogris 2012 therefore accumulation of the thermal sum must begin before that we used an iterative procedure to identify the latest date to start calculation of the cumulative thermal sum for the onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization ogris et al 2019 we chose the date that produced the lowest mae of the predicted onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization we calibrated end of mass swarming in late summer with an independent dataset of 1 017 flight barrier theysohn traps monitored by slovenia forest service in the period from 2015 to 2019 at least at 11 day intervals gis and zgs 2020 ogris 2012 2020 95 4 of traps were equipped with a pheromone product pc ecolure fytofarm ltd bratislava slovak republic while the rest had chalcoprax basf se ludwigshafen germany because the traps were monitored at different intervals and different dates the data was harmonized and averaged to ten to eleven day periods from the beginning of april to the end of october 2 6 3 brood development in order to describe the relation between the developmental rate of p chalcographus and temperature we used both a linear function with only dtl see equation a 7 and a nonlinear function as proposed by wermelinger and seifert 1998 for i typographus and calibrated for p chalcographus effective temperatures for development from the egg stage to the emergence of mature filial beetles were adapted using to dtl and dtu to and dtu were not known for p chalcographus at the time of the study dtu was set with the help of a database of thermal requirements for insects and mites jarošík et al 2011 2012 the dtu for species of the curculionidae family is 39 4 c this dtu was used by chapy to our knowledge to for p chalcographus has not yet been studied we assumed that to is similar to i typographus wermelinger and seifert 1998 and i duplicatus davídková and doležal 2019 therefore we considered 30 0 c as to the effective temperature teff was estimated using the nonlinear function of the modified logan model lactin et al 1995 logan et al 1976 with the assumption that the relative developmental rate increases linearly within the range of dtl and to and that the relative developmental rate is equal to 1 at to for temperatures outside the lower and upper temperature thresholds t dtl and t dtu teff was set to zero the effective temperature within the range between to and dtu was calculated with the nonlinear function of the modified logan model whose parameters were estimated iteratively by means of nonlinear regression analysis within the range of dtl and dtu a thermal sum of 518 598 dd is required for the total development of p chalcographus harding et al 1986 the upper limit of this range was used as a reference value for comparison k 598 dd relative thermal sums for the egg larval pupal and maturation feeding stages are not known for p chalcographus therefore we assumed that the relative proportions are similar to i typographus wermelinger and seifert 1998 egg 10 larvae 40 pupae 10 and maturation feeding 40 respectively a study performed by harding et al 1986 recorded re emergence therefore formation of sister broods is also included in the calculation of the phenology model sister broods or re emergence is a phenomenon common to the spruce bark beetle and several other species of the scolytinae subfamily davídková and doležal 2017 after mating the female deposits the first brood it may then re emerge and after regeneration feeding re enter the same or a different tree to produce one or more so called sister broods anderbrant and löfqvist 1988 wermelinger and seifert 1999 a conceptual diagram summarizing the main steps of the chapy model calculation is presented in fig 1 a detailed description of the model computation along with the formulae is given in appendix a 2 7 model validation to determine the accuracy of the phenological model we compared the effective thermal sum computed with eqs a 7 a 9 using 30 min recorded bark temperatures at the date of imago emergence with k for validation of the predicted onset of emergence of filial beetles calculated from the inca data we compared the estimated effective thermal sum at the date of emergence predicted by the model with k the development rate was calculated with the min avg and max scenarios according to the btmin btavg and btmax effective bark temperatures respectively eqs a 4 a 9 the onset of swarming and infestation was always calculated using corrected daily maximum air temperatures from the inca atmax eqs a 10 and a 11 onset of swarming was additionally validated with independent dataset of 22 flight barrier theysohn traps equipped with a pheromone product pc ecolure tubus fytofarm ltd bratislava slovak republic those pheromone traps were monitored by slovenia forest service during 2015 2020 at least once per week similarly onset of infestation was additionally validated with independent dataset of 78 trap trees that were monitored at least once per week by slovenia forest service gis and zgs 2020 ogris 2012 2020 2 8 statistics and data management statistical analyses were performed using the r software environment for statistical computing r core team 2018 wherein the following packages were used sensitivity iooss et al 2019 rodbc ripley and lapsley 2017 desctools signorell et al 2018 and raster hijmans 2016 linear relations were analysed using linear regression analysis for nonlinear relations the nls nonlinear least squares procedure was used a one sample kolmogorov smirnov test was applied to verify normal distribution of test variables pairs of means were compared using the paired sample t test deviations of the mean of a single variable from a specified test value were tested by the one sample t test we used microsoft sql server 2016 as a database for modelling and calculation of thermal sums for predicting phenological events graphs were drawn with microsoft excel for office 365 16 0 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis of the effective temperature the first order main effect explained in total 8 0 of the output variation where dtl had the highest and dtu the lowest effect fig 2 the rest of the variation was explained by air temperature the second order interaction total effect explained in total 30 4 of the variation of the parameters on the predictions of the effective temperature where dtl explained nearly the same level of variance as the first order effect dtu had an even smaller influence on the output variation and to had the greatest interaction effect among the parameters and a substantial increase in comparison to the first order effect 3 2 model calibration 3 2 1 lower development threshold the procedure for calculation of effective temperature includes three parameters dtl to and dtu the observed temperatures in the field and the growth chambers were not greater than to thus calibration of to and dtu was not possible due to lack of data therefore only dtl was calibrated while to and dtu were assumed as already explained in the methods section the most appropriate dtl was chosen with the iteration procedure where the lowest mae of the predicted emergence of filial beetles from trap logs was observed low maes below 2 28 days were achieved in the range between 6 1 and 8 3 c the lowest mae with the lowest standard error was achieved at 7 4 c which was chosen as the dtl fig 3 a steep increase in mae was observed above 8 3 c and below 4 5 c 3 2 2 effective temperature above optimum temperature the effective temperature within the range between to and dtu was calculated with eq 5 the parameters α β γ and tmax were estimated iteratively by means of nonlinear regression analysis within the range of dtl and dtu fig 4 5 t eff t o d t l exp α t exp α t max t max t β γ where α 0 031 β 5 3 γ 1 25 tmax 41 97 teff 0 when t dtl and t dtu 3 2 3 spring date threshold of the model calculation factors other than the lower air temperature threshold for flight activity atmax 16 8 c lobinger 1994 zumr 1982 might influence the start of reproductive activities in the spring we assumed that the thermal sum determines the onset of swarming and infestation the earliest onset of swarming occurred at the brode and kamnik locations on 20 03 2017 therefore the accumulation of thermal sum had to start before that date the lowest mean absolute error for prediction of the onset of swarming and infestation was determined with an iterative procedure ogris et al 2019 the latest lowest mae was achieved on 9th march fig 5 which was chosen as the spring date threshold of the model calculation 3 2 4 end of mass swarming mean number of beetles caught in the pheromone traps gradually decreased from middle of july to the beginning of september fig 6 a linear relationship between the mean daylength and the mean number of caught beetles per ten to eleven day periods from the middle of july to the beginning of september was found with very high correlation coefficient r 0 986 fig 7 in september at daylength below 13 6 h a very low number of beetles were caught on average 807 in the traps even though atmax was sufficiently high for swarming 22 1 26 4 c fig 6 in october no swarming was recorded because atmax was below the flight temperature 15 6 c we concluded that swarming of p chalcographus beetles in the late summer was mainly limited by daylength while maximum air temperature had only a minor effect at daylength below 13 6 h finally we included daylength limit of 13 6 h into the model as a threshold for end of swarming in the late summer additionally the same pattern was found in the spring i e mass swarming started when the mean daylength was greater than 13 5 h fig 6 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 daily effective thermal sum the estimated daily effective thermal sum showed a mae of 1 01 dd and a root mean square error rmse of 1 34 dd for mean bark temperature the correlation between the estimated and observed daily thermal sums was relatively high for mean bark temperature with r2 0 86 and was significant p 0 001 the modelled cumulative effective thermal sum for the whole study period showed a mae of 72 6 dd and a rmse of 80 3 dd for mean bark temperature table 2 an average observed bteff was 5 7 dd per day therefore mae of 72 6 dd resulted in an average error of 12 8 days during an average study period of 91 6 days the variability explained between the estimated and observed cumulative thermal sums was low r2 0 086 and not significant p 0 244 mean cumulative observed and estimated thermal sums of mean bark temperature did not differ significantly t 0 726 p 0 4913 estimated cumulative thermal sums were underestimated by 21 2 dd for mean bark temperature the confidence interval for the ratio between the estimated and observed thermal sums was 96 4 13 2 3 3 2 spring swarming and onset of infestation bark beetles were captured in pheromone traps when the daily mean maximum air temperature atmax exceeded 17 3 c our observations indicate that p chalcographus initiated flight activity at a daily minimum observed atmax of 13 0 c which corresponds to the estimated daily maximum air temperature of 15 6 c the latter was used as the threshold for the phenological model calculation see appendix a major flight the first day with a catch 100 individuals than that of the last counting occurred on days when atmax was above 20 9 c the first attacks of p chalcographus on trap logs in spring were observed at a mean atmax of 21 3 2 3 c initial infestation of trap trees occurred 6 40 days after the initial swarming table 3 the longest gap of 40 days between the onset of swarming and onset of infestation occurred at the highest location prevala locations with a lower elevation had a lower delay of initial infestation after the onset of swarming i e 6 23 days table 1 and table 3 our observations indicate that flight activity was initiated when the thermal sum atmax 7 4 c accumulated from 9th march onwards was on average 80 5 26 2 dd the first colonization of trap logs was observed when the thermal sum reached 216 5 52 0 dd table 3 a variance of these results expressed through confidence interval can be partially explained with an interval of monitoring which was a source of uncertainty two to three day intervals with an average teff 3 6 dd represented an uncertainty up to 10 9 dd while seven day intervals with an average teff 5 6 dd represented an uncertainty up to 39 2 dd fig 8 using the accumulated thermal sum in combination with flight activity and date threshold the onset of spring swarming was estimated with a mae of 5 6 days and the onset of trap log colonization in spring was estimated with a mae of 6 0 days table 3 furthermore both onset of spring swarming and onset of infestation were estimated with a similar mae of 5 8 days with the independent dataset of 22 pheromone traps and 78 trap trees the difference between the observed and predicted onset of swarming of nine pheromone traps was 11 days earlier at minimum and 14 days later at maximum the difference between the observed and predicted onset of infestation of eight trap logs was 11 days earlier at minimum and 10 days later at maximum table 3 3 3 3 brood development all eight trap logs felled in 2017 and 2018 were colonized by p chalcographus table 3 eight trap logs were monitored until the emergence of filial beetles and altogether 18 sample chunks were monitored in growth chambers at two constant temperatures 23 c and 28 c every day with different onsets of infestation table s1 for validation of the brood development rate we compared the observed onset of emergence of filial beetles with the thermal sum of 30 min measured bark temperatures at four positions around the trunk eqs a 7 a 9 using the same calculation procedure of harding et al 1986 including different dtl 8 0 c provided by zumr 1982 for comparison we used the reference value k 598 dd provided by harding et al 1986 which used different dtl 8 c from ours dtl 7 4 c to make this comparison we had to use the same calculation procedure along the same dtl 8 c the thermal sum at the time of emergence was not significantly different from the test value k 598 dd for both observed emergence and predicted emergence from hourly and daily data p 0 05 table 4 the mean deviations of the calculated thermal sum from the required thermal sum 598 dd ranged from 15 3 to 25 3 dd for hourly data and 6 9 to 11 1 dd for daily data table 4 therefore daily air temperature was used to calculate the phenological model following the chapy calculation procedure appendix a the observed mean thermal sum for the total development of filial beetles was 652 8 22 7 c table s1 the predicted mean thermal sum for the total development of filial beetles was 635 4 31 4 c the observed mean thermal sum was not significantly different from the predicted mean thermal sum for the total development of filial beetles t 1 1881 d f 17 p 0 251 the implementation of the chapy model uses the inca dataset as model input thus the predicted thermal sum of 635 4 dd was used as the thermal sum required for total development from egg to mature beetle model parameter k see appendix a the predicted emergence of filial beetles was estimated with a mae of 2 11 days with a minimum of nine days too early and four days too late the deviation of the estimated emergence from the observed data had high correlation with the estimated thermal sum and was significant r2 0 985 p 0 001 the duration of three developmental stages was observed i e egg larval and a combination of the pupal and teneral adult stages the relative durations of the developmental stages of p chalcographus were calculated with regard to k the mean duration of the egg larval and combination of the pupal and teneral adult developmental stages was 9 4 58 2 and 32 4 respectively table 5 in accordance with the reference values wermelinger and seifert 1998 the mean difference for the duration of the egg stage was 0 6 shorter the larval stage was 18 2 longer and the combination of the pupal teneral adult stage was 17 6 shorter table 5 the duration of developmental stages in the phenology model was calculated with adjusted mean values egg 10 larvae 60 pupae 10 teneral adult maturation feeding 20 see appendix a 3 3 4 re emergence the earliest time of re emergence of parental beetles was observed 43 days after trap log colonization at the prevala location the relative thermal sum at the time of re emergence of parental beetles was on average 69 2 4 8 with a minimum of 56 1 calculated from daily observed bark temperatures table s1 the relative thermal sum expressed as a percentage of the thermal sum required for total development at the time of re emergence was on average 68 0 4 6 with a minimum of 52 7 according to the estimated bark temperature these results are based on the daily observations in the two plant growth chambers the minimum observed time of re emergence of parental beetles is more likely correct than the average value thus for modelling the re emergence of parental beetles we used a relative thermal sum of 50 i e 317 7 dd which is an approximation of the observed minimum see eq a 13 4 discussion we validated several aspects of chapy the modelled and actual timing of spring swarming onset of infestation re emergence of parental beetles completion of the first filial generation and the duration of developmental stages we found remarkable agreement between the daily effective thermal sums of modelled and measured mean bark temperatures ogris et al 2019 thus air temperature data from the inca were able to quite accurately predict effective thermal sum cumulative thermal sums were generally slightly underestimated using accumulated thermal sum in combination with flight activity and date threshold the onset of spring swarming and infestation was estimated with a relatively low mean absolute error re emergence of parental beetles was observed at approximately half of the relative thermal sum required for total development the thermal sum at the time of emergence was not significantly different from the reference value for both observed and predicted emergence from hourly and daily data the estimated and observed developmental rates were not always comparable between observations and predictions especially for higher elevations therefore chapy was calculated according to the three scenarios to encompass all possible outcomes eqs a 1 a 6 in this study we used the rity 2 model ogris et al 2019 which is based on the phenips model baier et al 2007 as the framework for modelling p chalcographus and the chapy model was the result rity 2 was substantially changed to reflect the phenology of p chalcographus 1 the effective bark temperature between to and dtu was calculated with new sets of parameters for the non linear function eq 5 a 8 2 the date threshold for spring swarming was found with an iterative procedure to be 9th march 3 the limiting atmax for the onset of swarming was set to 15 6 c 4 the onset of swarming was calculated with a thermal sum of 80 5 dd eq a 10 5 the onset of infestation was calculated with a thermal sum of 216 5 dd eq a 11 6 the necessary thermal sum for total development k was set to 635 4 dd eq a 12 and 7 preimaginal development was set at a relative thermal sum of 80 of the thermal sum required for total development during the chapy validation process several knowledge gaps in the phenology of p chalcographus were identified therefore several assumptions were made for key elements in the biology of the six toothed spruce bark beetle 1 t o was assumed to be 30 0 c 2 dtu was assumed to be 39 4 c 3 dtl for each developmental stage is missing however in our study it was found that a dtl of 7 4 c had the lowest mae of predicted emergence of filial beetles and it was assumed that 7 4 c represents a mean dtl for development of p chalcographus from egg to mature beetle 4 the date threshold for calculation of the onset of swarming was searched with an iterative procedure and it was assumed to be 9th march 5 the daylength limit for the onset of a new filial or sister brood was assumed to be at 13 6 h on the basis of monitoring of 1 017 pheromone traps eqs a 13 a 15 the daylength threshold was assumed solely on the swarming data without verifying if diapause actually initiated furthermore diapause initiation is implemented in a very strict manner where only daylength 13 6 h is considered even though it probably could also be influenced by temperature führer and chen 1979 however according to our study swarming is substantially dropped after the daylength 13 6 h even though the temperatures were favourable for flight activity 6 the model calculation continues into a winter and it is concluded by 31st december as brood development might continue during winter at temperatures above dtl štefková et al 2017 however winter mortality might be slightly underestimated and number of generations slightly overestimated in the case of an early frost period e g in november and later in december 7 since solid data on the thermal sum of effective bark temperatures for each developmental stage is missing duration thresholds for each developmental stage were set according to our recorded data 8 since the adult stage is the most widespread overwintering stage koštál et al 2014 it is assumed that preimaginal stages of p chalcographus do not survive winter all these assumptions could have a substantial impact on chapy output each of these assumptions represents an ideal opportunity for further research on the phenology of p chalcographus and the further improvement of chapy the first priority would be finding an observed optimum temperature which had the greatest total effect in the sensitivity analysis among the parameters for the predictions of the effective temperatures fig 2 the next priority would be finding actual relationship between daylength limit and temperature for the diapause initiation as this might have considerable effect on part of model outputs e g number of generations daily and cumulative estimated thermal sums fitted less well for chapy than for rity 2 supposedly due to the assumed optimum temperature for which the total effect was high according to the sensitivity analysis the estimated cumulative thermal sum of effective bark temperatures was underestimated by 3 6 chapy and 2 5 rity 2 therefore the observed development rate was usually slightly faster than modelled the validation for the study sites at lower elevations showed quite good agreement between predicted and observed cumulative thermal sums while the higher locations had greater error of predicted cumulative thermal sum this pattern was supported by the high correlation that was found between the deviation of estimated emergence from observed data and estimated thermal sum this rule could indicate that locations at higher elevations might need a higher cumulative thermal sum for the total development of filial beetles nevertheless further research is needed to prove this hypothesis in this study we observed the re emergence of parental beetles that established a sister brood in contrast lekander and lindelöw 1977 found no indication of a sister brood in sweden and according to histological examinations by zumr and soldan 1981 p chalcographus has only one reproductive cycle and dies after oviposition however there is increasing evidence that at least one sister brood does occur in central european p chalcographus populations according to our observations see table s1 and several other studies harding et al 1986 kacprzyk and bednarz 2015 kasumović 2016 these contradictory observations about the existence of a sister brood demand further research to clarify this phenomenon in p chalcographus we assume that geographic latitude daylength temperature variation and genetic differences between populations of p chalcographus might play a considerable role furthermore our study had a small sample consisting of nine pheromone traps and only eight trap logs felled at different locations with different elevations aspects and slopes table 1 we were therefore not able to fully capture the overall variability of the spatiotemporal dynamics of p chalcographus in slovenia we believe that a larger sample encompassing all biogeographical regions in slovenia equally would give somewhat different thresholds and parameters of chapy following the same calibration procedures chapy can be used at any location however regional specific thresholds need to be calibrated and validated to reflect the specific conditions of the region chapy was implemented into two public web applications in slovenian only the first is point based and produces a chart of relative thermal sums of the predicted development of p chalcographus according to the min avg and max scenarios for any location in slovenia ogris 2019c the second web application is raster based and produces several maps of the predicted development of p chalcographus for the whole slovenia ogris 2019d on the map we can observe time series for the development of bark beetle developmental stages for several filial and sister broods onset of spring swarming onset of infestation of different broods and number of filial and sister broods the source codes for both applications are publicly available ogris 2019a b potential applications of chapy for monitoring and management of p chalcographus are numerous in our case chapy is used along with rity 2 to improve the efficiency of bark beetle monitoring it is incorporated into an automatic e messaging system that informs 14 regional and 69 local units of the slovenia forest service about the predicted onset of swarming and completion of first filial generation ogris et al 2019 i e the key dates for evaluation of the p chalcographus population abundance at the trap location when the catch in the trap from the beginning of spring swarming until the end of the first generation exceeds 20 000 beetles an outbreak is imminent and an attack on healthy host trees can be expected rs 2009 once the risk threshold has been exceeded several control strategies can be applied i e increasing the number of the traps mass trapping setting up trap trees conducting a more careful survey of spruce forests and eventually cutting recently attacked trees via sanitation programmes faccoli and stergulc 2004 2006 jurc et al 2017 schroeder 2013 all these actions are carried out to keep p chalcographus populations at endemic levels thus avoiding outbreaks and subsequent damage that could be caused by i typographus furthermore the utilization of detailed data on air temperature for modelling bark temperatures provides a precise monitoring of the actual state of bark beetle development at the specific model grid cell chapy simulates the maximum number of generations at each model grid cell what can be used for assessing the likelihood of outbreaks and their potential impacts at the regional scale the last but not the least the model can be used for long term assessment of the climate change effects while modelling the change in maximum number of generations at different temperature scenarios 5 conclusions the chapy model includes the prediction of the time of spring swarming onset of infestation re emergence of parental beetles and the number and emergence time of filial and sister broods as several model parameters were missing a sensitivity analysis was performed and model parameters were calibrated to best fit the observed data to validate the model we compared the recorded air temperature bark temperature flight activity and developmental progress in trap logs at various altitudes and relief aspects with phenological events predicted by the model additionally independent datasets of pheromone traps and trap logs were used to validate onset of spring swarming onset of infestation and end of mass swarming in late summer the result is a validated calibrated and implemented chapy model the sensitivity analysis validation and calibration procedure of chapy showed that the phenological model quite accurately simulates the seasonal dynamics of p chalcographus populations the model was successfully incorporated into publicly available web tools to our knowledge chapy is the first comprehensive phenological model for p chalcographus and thus contributes to progress in ecological modelling nevertheless chapy is based on several assumptions that provide opportunities for further phenology research on the second most damaging spruce bark beetle in central europe and thus further improvement of the model 6 credit author statement nikica ogris conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources data curation writing original

24833,understanding interactions between individual animals and their resources is fundamental to ecology agent based models abms offer an opportunity to study how individuals move given the spatial distribution and characteristics of their resources when contrasted with empirical individual resource network data abms can be a powerful method to detect the processes behind observed movement patterns as they allow for a complete and quantitative analysis of the agent to environment relationships here we use the small scale within patch movement of bumblebees bombus pascuorum as a case study to demonstrate how abms can be combined with network statistics to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind the interactions between individuals and their resources we build an abm that explicitly simulates the influence of distance to the nearest flowering plant allowing minimal energy expenditure and maximum time spent foraging plant height and number of flower heads as a proxy of food availability on local foraging decisions of bumblebees the relative importance of these three elements is determined using pattern oriented modelling pom where we confront the network statistics number of visited plants number of interactions nestedness and modularity of a real b pascuorum individual resource network with the emergent patterns of our abm we also explore the model results using spatial analysis the model is able to reproduce the observed network statistics despite the complex behaviour of bumblebees our results show a surprisingly precise match between the structure of the simulated and empirical networks after adjusting a single model parameter controlling the importance of distance to the next plant visited our study illustrates the potential of combining field data abms and individual resource networks for evaluating small scale within patch movement decisions to better understand animal movements in natural habitats we discuss the benefits of our approach when compared to more classical statistical methods and its ability to test various scenarios in a new or altered environment keywords individual resource network bumblebee foraging patterns pattern oriented modelling small scale foraging 1 introduction understanding why animals move as they do when searching for resources is a central question to behavioural biology and a prerequisite for the development of predictive process based movement models such models can increase our understanding of the complexity behind various decisions of mobile organisms which could be used to improve nature management e g boult et al 2018 one way of describing animal movement and foraging is to study the interactions between individuals and their resources examples of such interactions are trophic networks such as food webs boult et al 2018 networks describing the interactions between hosts and parasitoids and plants and pollinators ings et al 2009 the structure of interaction networks can be characterised with the use of several network statistics nestedness for instance describes whether specialist species individuals of the network interact with subsets of the interaction partners of highly connected generalist species bascompte et al 2003 while modularity describes the degree to which a network is organised into sub groups of interacting species individuals olesen et al 2007 hence network statistics can summarize structural features of complex systems consisting of interacting individuals and their resources however network statistics alone cannot explain how the spatial distribution traits and characteristics of the resources can shape network structure furthermore network statistics alone cannot predict how network structure would change in altered environments under the framework of agent based and pattern oriented modelling abm and pom respectively the mechanisms underlying movement decisions of individuals and the resulting interactions with resources can be identified by contrasting resource use patterns observed in nature with the emergent patterns of models railsback and grimm 2012 individual movement can be simulated in a spatially explicit setting and based on fundamental ecological principles such as optimal foraging and learning nabe nielsen et al 2018 railsback and grimm 2012 in pom the models which can reproduce multiple empirically observed patterns potentially include the key processes responsible for animal foraging decisions a key advantage of combining abm and network statistics is the ability to capture emergent properties of animal movement using relatively simple and transparent sets of rules governing individual behaviours coupling this approach with pom can ensure that these rules are based on realistic and ecologically feasible mechanisms here we present a combination of abm pom and network statistics to describe the foraging behaviour of pollinators specifically the bumblebee bombus pascuorum to understand how their movement is related to the within patch distribution and characteristics of plant resources bees are some of the most studied animals regarding small scale movement patterns herascu 2017 kissling et al 2014 pyke 1979 they are ideal study organisms for spatial foraging strategies as their movements can be tracked manually observed in large numbers almost continuously their food resources plants are stationary discrete and spatially explicit and hence constitute a simple modelling environment several modelling approaches have recently been applied to investigate bumblebee foraging at the landscape scale becher et al 2016 crone and williams 2016 häussler et al 2017 specifically the combination of network analysis with abms has already been used to study the influence of landscape level changes such as forest degradation on plant pollinator networks newton et al 2018 yet the small scale within patch foraging of bees has not been subject of modelling bumblebees are categorised as central place foragers which forage from a fixed base i e a nesting place pyke 1984 in the 1970s pyke developed a series of movement rules for bumblebees based on field observations of optimal foraging in an unknown environment one of these rules being that bees have a strong preference for minimising flight distance when choosing successive flowers pyke 1979 1978 subsequent observational and experimental studies focused on optimal foraging in known environments studying the importance of learning in establishing foraging routes lihoreau et al 2011 ohashi et al 2007 thomson 1996 these studies have shown that bees tend to confine their search within small foraging areas in which they may employ traplining i e visiting flowers in a predictable non random order based on memory of resource availability studies of within patch movements have revealed that bees are more likely to visit plants with a high number of flower heads as an indicator of higher nectar content cartar 2004 makino et al 2007 ohashi and yahara 2002 and make frequent visits to plants near the centre of the patch makino et al 2007 bumblebee movement decisions are therefore influenced by the spatial distribution of flowers and their characteristics but the relative importance of these features have not been tested but see dupont et al 2014 the presented model directly simulates the influence of distance to the nearest flowering plant as a proxy of minimising energy expenditure and maximising time spent foraging plant height and number of flower heads as a proxy of food availability to determine the influence of these plant characteristics on local movement choices of bumblebees the relative importance of these characteristics was determined using pom where we used network statistics to compare emergent patterns from the model with those derived from field data the aims of the study are therefore to demonstrate how combining abm and network analysis can help us to understand within patch foraging behaviour of b pascuorum and to what extent their foraging decisions are determined by the spatial setting and characteristics of the plants we hypothesise that 1 distance to the next plant is a key parameter in bumblebee movement decisions since the time spent collecting nectar and hence energy intake is maximised when time spent flying is minimised pyke 1979 2 plant height influences movement behaviour because taller plants are more visible and hence more attractive dupont et al 2014 and 3 the number of flower heads influences foraging decisions because flower rich plants likely offer a higher reward cartar 2004 makino et al 2007 we hypothesise that these selection criteria are key to explain local space and resource use by foraging bumblebees we demonstrate that the combination of abms and network statistics can be a useful tool in a variety of ecological studies and we discuss the benefits of the presented method when compared to traditional statistical analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site study species and collection of empirical data workers of bombus pascuorum hereafter bees fig 2a are common and important pollinators in northern europe including denmark dupont et al 2011a the foraging behaviour of this nest building species consists of several trips between flowering patches and the nest over the day usually within 500 m from the nest knight et al 2005 while at the flowering patch bees move in between flowers to collect nectar they then leave their foraging spot to go back to the nest to unload nectar or to cool down rest in order not to overheat with the increasing weight of carried floral resources heinrich 1979 1975a 1975b resting usually takes place nearby the foraging patch as in local trees after resting or nectar unloading bees return to the foraging patch to continue foraging hagen et al 2011 henriksen 2013 the study site a meadow at moesgaard have denmark 56 0806 n 10 2311 e was bounded on three sides by mixed deciduous forest fig 1 a during the study period marsh thistle cirsium palustre hereafter thistle or plant was by far the most abundant flowering plant in the meadow and it was at peak flowering during the study period 1 9 july 2013 we therefore assumed that thistle was the main food source for the bees and we did not consider other plant species as a potential food source as supported by the observations that b pascuorum workers were the most frequent visitors thistles are among the most nectar rich plants in northern europe baude et al 2016 and we therefore assumed nectar depletion to be unlikely during the study period we marked all spatially distinct flowering thistles within an area of 60 55 meters in the northern part of the meadow following the method described in dupont et al 2014 the exact position of all thistles n 850 fig 1b within the study patch was mapped by measuring the distances of each thistle to at least two geographically fixed points resulting in geographic coordinates for all thistles the maximum height of flowering stems hereafter height and the number of receptive flower heads were also measured for all thistles at the end of the study period 8 9 july a total of 36 thistles without receptive flower heads were excluded from the study the height of the remaining 814 plants ranged from 40 to 178 cm and the number of flower heads per plant varied from 1 to 15 appendix 1 fig a1 at the study site we captured and individually marked a total of 57 b pascuorum workers small number tags opalithplättchen were carefully glued onto the mesothorax so that bee mobility was not impaired bees were then released and allowed to forage at the end of the observation period 15 of the field identified b pascuorum workers were collected for taxonomic verification in the laboratory by an expert all taxonomically verified bees were correctly determined in the field movement patterns of marked bees were monitored simultaneously by three to five observers on six days during the period 1 9 july 2013 between 9 14 16 18 hrs to observe the movement of bees and plant visitation the observers walked around in the patch until encountering a marked bee this marked bee was then followed for as long as possible and the sequence of thistles visited and the total time of the observation period were registered thirty four unique individuals were observed during the study period most of these individuals were observed more than twice and the total number of continuous direct tracking of individuals equalled 170 max 22 tracks per individual bee median for 34 individuals 4 tracks appendix 1 fig a2 an observation was defined as any continuous tracking of the same individual for longer than 10 s max 31 min median 2 21 min fig a2 amounting to a total of 13 9 h of direct tracking of individual bees by all the observers combined over the 6 days to minimise the potential effect of the presence of the observers on the behaviour of bees observers did not move rapidly during tracking did not touch any of the thistles approached by the bees and did not cross the flying path of the tracked individuals the observers were also spread over the study site in order not to affect each other s observations due to low number of observers and relatively small sample size we did not account for a potential observer bias all observers however were given the exact same task which did not involve any subjective evaluation and we hence consider potential bias to be low if any we determined the number of flower heads per plant visited by tracked bees n 49 measurements of 3 individuals bee flight speed and their search perception radius speed was determined by timing individuals from taking off from one plant to landing on the next one in the study patch n 64 measurements of 14 individuals the mean measured value was used in simulations 0 5 m s search radius was obtained based on the travelling distances from one plant to the next in the empirical dataset more than 99 of observed travelling distances between plants were within 10 m n 2216 and we therefore defined search radius as 10 m assuming that this is the distance within which bees can see and detect plants the weather was sunny or overcast with no rain and light to moderate wind with temperatures ranging from 17 30 c during the observation period 2 2 model description the model description is based on odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2020 2010 2 2 1 purpose and patterns the main purpose of the study is to test whether combining spatially explicit abm and network statistics can help us to understand the drivers behind small scale foraging behaviour of bees such as to investigate to what extent their foraging decisions are determined by the spatial setting and characteristics of the plants in order to evaluate whether our model results in realistic behaviour of bees we adopted the pattern oriented modelling approach pom grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2005 wiegand et al 2003 we use four network metrics commonly applied in network ecology the number of plants p visited by the bees during a simulation number of interactions i here defined as unique combinations of thistle and bees nestedness n and modularity m further explained below in addition we calculate the spatial extent of visited plants estimated as kernel utilisation distributions for the model simulations best representing the empirical metrics 3 best indices as well as simulations resulting in poor match and visually compare these twosets with observed kernels see section 2 3 1 simulations and parameterisation for explanation of 3 best indices and appendix 2 for full description of kernel analysis finally we visually compare the plant modules resulting from the same set of simulations as used for the kernels with the observed together these four metrics kernel analysis and visual comparison of the modules represent spatial temporal and behavioural processes and capture the overall size structure and complexity of an ecological network for each simulation we construct bipartite networks with ids of bees in columns and ids of plants in rows and cell entries aij were non zero if bee i visited thistle j and zero otherwise dupont et al 2011b nestedness n is a non random interaction pattern of bipartite networks in which interactions of specialist nodes are a subset of the interactions of generalist nodes bascompte et al 2003 dupont et al 2003 if nested the network has a core of highly connected generalists here generalist nodes can be thistles visited by many bee individuals and or bee individuals that visit many thistles we assess the level of nestedness of the networks using the nodf index almeida neto et al 2008 appendix 2 eq a1 whether the empirical and modelled networks are significantly nested we assess by comparing the observed value against nestedness values from 1000 random matrices created using null model 2 where the interaction probabilities are proportional to the marginal totals as described by bascompte et al 2003 modularity m is the degree to which a network is organised into sub groups of nodes that interact more among themselves than with nodes from other sub groups i e modules olesen et al 2007 appendix 2 eq a2 both modelled and empirical m is calculated with netcarto using the simulated annealing algorithm significance of m is assessed against 100 randomisations of the network the null model implemented in the program conserves the degree distribution of the empirical network guimerà and amaral 2005a 2005b the empirical network which includes p 640 plants and i 1125 interactions is significantly nested n 3 84 p 0 001 and modular m 0 72 p 0 5 10 6 compared to randomised interaction networks 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model is designed to represent the field site and simulations were therefore based on a realistic meadow landscape where the position of individual thistles and the forest edge corresponds to the positions found at the field site fig 1 the simulated landscape is divided into 424 334 grid cells each corresponding to 0 25 m x 0 25 m the model includes the following entities patches grid cells thistles and bees patches and thistles are characterised only by static state variables variable which do not change over model duration and all these state variables are based on direct measurements in the field table 1 the bee agents are characterised by six static state variables id speed individual specific threshold in number of foraging flights after which they must leave the meadow leave threshold individual specific time spent outside the meadow before returning to the study site time outside the meadow and search perception and return radius as well as three dynamic variables updated over model duration their location number of flower heads to visit during bee plant interaction and number of foraging flights table 1 one time step in the model represents 2 s simulations end when total number of bee plant visits is equal to total number of visits observed in the field 2386 but no longer than 14 h mimicking field observation time a visit is defined as an encounter between a bee and a thistle regardless of the number of flower heads visited see process overview and scheduling a visit ends when a bee encounteres a new thistle the world is set not to wrap either vertically or horizontally 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling processes the processes are structured into five processes as described below they are developed to cover the small scale within foraging patch movement of bees including leaving the meadow behaviour representing resting back to nest visiting other patches behaviour we do not aim to understand what bees do when leaving the meadow just to mimic this behaviour as observed scheduling the order of the processes is the same for each time step but as the model assumes no hierarchies and interactions among bees the order of which individuals execute the processes is randomised at each time step for each bee each state variable table 1 is immediately assigned a new value as soon as that value is calculated by a process the graphical description of the model flow is shown in fig 2 b values and reference of the state variables and parameters are given in table 1 select plant and fly each bee chooses the next plant to visit as follows the plant is selected at random but only among the plants for which all the following three statements are true 1 n e x t p l a n t d r 1 w d s h h m a x w h r f f m a x w f r where d is the distance to the plants within the search radius s perception range of the bees table 1 r is a random number drawn from the uniform distribution between 1 0 h is the height of the plants hmax is the maximum height of plants within s f is the number of flower heads of plants and fmax is the maximum number of flower heads within s wx are weights for the different selection criteria distance wd height wh and number of flower heads wf and see section 2 3 1 simulations and parameterisation for the range and combination of values of wx used in the simulations the eq 1 therefore defines the number of plants a bee is considering visiting in the next step the lower the weight of a given plant characteristic wx the more plants within the search radius s are considered by bees as their next foraging location once a bee choses its next plant to visit the number of time steps nts a bee spends flying to the next plant np is calculated as 2 n t s d n p f l i g h t s p e e d t i m e s t e p where dnp is the distance to the selcted plant or forest tree in case of leave the meadow procedure below in a straight line the flight speed is constant 0 5 m s so 1 m during one time step and has the same value for all the individuals table 1 if the distance to the next plant 1 m it still takes one time step for bees to move to this plant update number of foraging flights a foraging flight is defined as the movement between two consecutively visited plants and is independent of flight distance and number of visited flower heads each bee has a counter of number of foraging flights table 1 which increases by one every time a bee moves to the next plant number of foraging flights defines when bees should leave the meadow leave threshold see below visit flowers having arrived on a plant a bee visits a random number of flower heads between one and four mimicking numbers observed in the field table 1 if a plant has less than four flower heads a bee visits a random number of flower heads between one and the number of flower heads on this plant a bee visits each flower head for one time step the location of the bee does not change during this process leave the meadow a bee leaves the meadow to a nearest forest tree if the number of foraging flights equals or exceeds leave threshold table 1 the number of time steps a bee needs to get to the forest tree is calculated based on eq 2 outside the meadow each bee spends time outside the meadow for a period of time time outside meadow table 1 before returning to the meadow number of foraging flights is then set to zero the location of the bee does not change during this process return to the meadow after being outside the meadow a bee returns to a random plant in the meadow located within a return radius table 1 from the last plant it visited before departing counting of number of foraging flights restarts the number of time steps a bee needs to return to the meadow is calculated based on eq 2 2 2 4 design concepts basic principles the model builds on the principles of optimal foraging assuming that individual bees attempt to optimise their foraging behaviour by flying to a plant with as many flower heads as possible equivalent of high nectar content and as close as possible but allowing for a bias towards the tallest and most visible plants optimal foraging could result from a reduction of the time used for travelling between plants which allows more time for foraging beutler 1951 spatial perception of bee agents is limited and bees can therefore only search for flowers within their perception radius search radius emergence four network metrics p i n m and the kernel spatial analysis emerge from the interaction between bees and thistles calculated from the qualitative networks of these interactions movement of bees outside the meadow and back emerges from the fact that after visiting certain number of plants exceed leave threshold bees leave the meadow to rest unload floral resouces visit other flower patches the nectar and come back after a given time adaptation bees modify their movement based on plant characteristics height distance number of flower heads objectives bees indirectly seek to maximize their food intake by selecting plants based on distance from the previously visited plant height and number of flower heads of the next plant to be visited learning the bees do not learn from each other or from the past experience in the model prediction bees attempt to predict food intake based on flower characteristics sensing bees can see all the plants within search radius and evaluate their relative height number of flower heads and distance to them interaction not included bees do not interact indirectly competition for a common resource or directly by aggression plants and flower heads do not change their properties after being visited by bees stochasticity stochasticity is used in initialization of the model to place bees at their starting point and to assign individual specific leave threshold and time outside meadow during simulation the following processes are sources of stochasticity 1 the direction and location of the next plant selected by a bee among the ones fulfilling the search criteria 2 number of flower heads visited per plant 3 which plant is visited after returning to meadow within return radius stochasticity in the model is used to a mimic situation where there is a range of observed parameters instead of one value i e number of visited flower heads per plant b given procedure behavioural rule is likely to be stochastic in reality i e next visited plant collectives not used individual bees do not represent groups of real bees super individuals as defined by scheffer et al 1995 in the model and therefore one bee in the model represent one individual observation at the end of each time step the id location and behaviour flying visiting a plant or outside meadow of each bee is saved if a bee was visiting a plant the unique id of this thistle is also saved these thistle and bee ids are than used to create networks as described in 2 2 1 purpose and patterns 2 2 5 initialisation the model is initialised by creating 34 bees randomly distributed over thistles mimicking the number of unique individuals observed in the field the landscape contained 2685 flower heads distributed across 814 plants height and the number of flower heads is assigned to each plant as observed in the field fig 1 table 1 all bees are assigned state variables as listed in table 1 an individual specific leave threshold is drawn from a normal distribution mean sd but always 0 and an individual specific time outside the meadow is also drawn from a normal distribution mean sd always 0 2 2 6 input data no time series input is used in the model 2 2 7 submodels there is no additional information regarding different processes the model is programmed in netlogo 5 wilensky 1999 and model output was analysed in r r core team 2016 full model code is presented in appendix 6 and all model input can be given by request 2 3 simulation experiment 2 3 1 simulations and parameterisation as the purpose of the model was to investigate to what extent foraging decisions of bees are determined by the spatial setting and characteristics of the plants we systematically vary the weights of the different plant characteristics distance wd number of flower heads w f and height wh from 0 no importance to 1 high importance in steps of 0 25 in each simulation experiments the three weight values summed to one except for a group of experiments in which either all weights were set to 0 causing bees to select plants randomly or where one weight equalled 0 75 and the other two weights equalled 0 this was done in order to test the importance of single characteristic in the absence of the others but also to differentiate it from also included cases when one of the weights 1 and the remaining ones 0 using the combination of one weight 0 75 and remaining 0 allows for testing of the effect of larger stochasticity in comparison to combinations with one weight 1 and the remaining ones 0 the different combinations of weights are combined with different distributions of leave thresholds mean sd and time outside the meadow mean sd two model parameters for which we had no observed values or where values reported in literature were associated with considerable variation there is no information for b pascuorum on how long bees spend in a foraging patch before leaving it we use observations from other nest building species b hypnorum b lucorum and b pratorum on number of visited plants which in our model are represented by number of foraging flights after which the tracked individuals disappeared from the study site dupont et al 2014 these normally distributed ranges mean sd of leave threshold respectively for the three above mentioned species are given in table 1 and are tested in the model there is also no information on time outside meadow for b pascuorum we therefore used information on this values reported for similar species using radio transmitters hagen et al 2011 observed time outside meadow of b hortorum and reported normally distributed values with mean 45 and sd 15 min mean sd resting period of b terrestris in another field study was 30 15 min henriksen 2013 dupont et al 2014 observed that b hypnorum spent 30 30 min outside the meadow hence for the model we test these three different distributions of time outside meadow around these empirical values in total we test 171 combinations of different weights time outside meadow and leave threshold appendix 3 table a1 we ran five simulations for each of the 171 parameter combinations the standardised squared errors sse are used to evaluate the agreement between the values of the empirical metrics and the average simulated values for each metric i p n and m based on the five runs frank and baret 2013 sse values approaching zero suggest a strong match between the empirical and the simulated value of a given metric combinations resulting in 10 of lowest sse values for all four metrics simultaneously are further retained in the model and referred to as 10 best indices inverse modelling kramer schadt et al 2007 we then re ran 50 simulations for each of the 10 best indices to assess model stochasticity the interaction effect between the three weight variables wd wf and wh is visually investigated by inspecting interaction plots 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis the variance decomposition technique sobol 1990 thiele et al 2014 is used to analyse model sensitivity for three parameters return radius flight speed and number of flower heads visited per plant these parameters are estimated from limited data obtained during field observations and no additional information could be found in the literature all other parameters are directly assessed from field data or parameterised as described above table 1 the three parameters are allowed to vary as follows return radius 2 25 3 75m 25 from the values used in the final simulations flight speed 0 38 1 m s 25 to 100 and number of flower heads visited per plant low 1 2 high 3 6 if a visited plant had more than 3 flower heads we use the sensitivity package pujol et al 2016 in r using the formulas by jansen 1999 saltelli et al 2010 to define the final list of parameter combinations from the above listed variations n 400 sobol s first order main sensitivity parameter combinations si measure the effect of varying a focus parameter alone but averaged over variations in other input parameters thus providing information on the average reduction of output variance when the parameter is fixed sobol s total effect sensitivity parameter combinations sti measure the contribution to the output variance of the focus parameter including all variance caused by its interactions of any order with any other input parameters jensen 1999 and saltelli et al 2010 we run sensitivity analysis on one random parameter combination for which the sse fit criterion is lowered from 10 to 3 hereafter 3 best indices we run ten simulations for this combination appendix 3 table a1 3 results the extent to which bees prefer moving to plants nearby i e wd was the single most important parameter for recreating the empirical network structure as the network structure was much more sensitive to variations in wd than any other plant characteristics fig 3 indeed the abm only created realistic metrics for a very narrow range of wd 0 75 regardless values of other weights and distance to the next plant was therefore much more important than plant height or number of flower heads moreover leave threshold and time outside meadow had negligible influence on simulation outcomes since simulations that best fitted the empirical network both 10 and 3 best indices had all possible combinations of these two parameters fig 3 appendix 3 table a1 a total of 25 parameter combinations produced all four metrics p i n and m within10 and four parameter combination within 3 of the lowest sse values table a1 the best parameter combinations had wd 0 75 for i n and m while p fitted the empirical value well for all wd 0 75 fig 3 weights of 0 0 25 for wh and for wf produced acceptable fits for all metrics but only combined with high wd fig 3 p i and n decreased with increasing wd dropping steeply for wd 0 75 while m increased fig 4 when wd 0 75 regardless values of other weights the simulations produced networks that were significantly modular i e bees and plants tended to be grouped into modules in which individuals interacted more among each other than with individuals from other modules fig 4d plotting the empirical network in a spatial context revealed that the network was significantly modular with eight modules plants belonging to different modules were clearly segregated in space indicating that individual bees consistently foraged on a limited sub set of plants within the flower patch fig 5 although simulated networks with wd 0 75 tended to include fewer plant individuals and hence occupied a slightly more restricted spatial area than the empirical network the plants within the same modules also segregated spatially as also observed exemplified for 3 best indices fig 5 again wd was the single most important parameter for creating spatially restricted modules low wd 0 and 0 25 resulted in number of modules comparable to the empirical network but modules vastly overlapped fig 5 when wd approached 1 bees were caught on one or a few closely spaced plants because they often returned to the plant they had just departed from hence this value of wd resulted in unrealistic movements exemplified for parameter combinations with poor match with empirical metrics fig 5 this restriction to one or a few closely spaced plants explains the mismatch between all empirical and modelled metrics for simulations with wd 1 fig 3 5 although we calculated kernels for the empirical data and modelled simulations we do not consider statistical comparison of characteristics of kernels such as size or overlap as reliable patterns for pom as explained in section 4 2 of appendix 2 there was little variation between the results of the five runs of simulations with the same parameters values see error bars in fig 3 indicating that model stochasticity had negligible influence on the modelled network characteristics increasing the number of runs from 5 to 50 for the 10 best indices had little effect on mean and sd of the four metrics appendix 4 figs a6 7 a visual inspection of the interaction plots appendix 4 fig a3 showed no interaction between the three plant selection criteria 3 1 sensitivity analysis the results of sensitivity analysis show that the sum of main and total effects of parameter combinations 29 table a1 for all the observed metrics is close to 1 indicating that the models are additive i e there is a negligible interaction between parameters return radius flight speed and number of flower heads visited per plant these three parameters contributed comparably to the variation in the observed patterns for i and p n was mainly influenced by return radius appendix 5 fig a8 changing the three parameters by 25 to 100 in compariosn to final values used in the simulations or as described in the material and methods section resulted in p i and n varying between 37 and 128 compared to the mean values obtained for parameter combination 29 one of the 3 best indices and the largest variation was observed in n tables a1 2 compared to the variation in metrics among different parameter combinations the level of variation in the sensitivity analysis was modest 4 discussion the study of interactions between individuals and resources is fundamental to ecology here we demonstrate how abm combined with pom can be used to obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that determine the interactions between individuals and their resources and use network analyses to characterise the structure of the interactions network analyses provide important information about the structure function and evolution of ecological systems at many scales of organisation and are therefore ideal to provide system wide assessments of models borrett et al 2012 the applicability ranges from characterisation of empirical plant pollinator networks food webs bascompte 2009 eklöf et al 2012 knowledge exchange between individuals cornell et al 2012 to analysis of animal social networks rutz et al 2012 despite its usefulness network statistics have not been frequently combined with abms to obtain insights about the processes responsible for the interactions between individuals and their resources but see newton et al 2018 multinomial logistic regression models have previously been used to analyse to what extent foraging decisions of bees and other animals are influenced by spatial distribution of resources and their characteristics for example cartar 2004 makino et al 2007 in the current case study distance to food plants and their characteristics height and number of flower heads would be considered as fixed effects in a regression model accounting for spatial auto correlation in data distribution of plants as well as temporal auto correlation e g related to time since a bee last visited the meadow would require adding random effects to such a model intra specific variation among individuals would be an additional random effect adding such random effects frequently changes the estimates of the fixed effect coefficients and can therefore fail to estimate these effects accurately hodges and reich 2010 our approach of joining abm and network statistics under a pom framework reduces the uncertainty of the results compared to regression models as it is based on transparent structurally realistic and reproducible processes see for example grimm et al 2005 abms are sometimes being criticised for having many parameters for which empirical values are unknown for instance in the current case study two parameters were parameterised leave threshold time outside meadow as we don t have good measurement of these parameters in the field these parameters can however be assessed in the field and then used to further improve the model moreover our approach does not require taking spatial and temporal autocorrelation into account nor does it require assumptions about the relationship between processes underlying emerging patterns another important advantage of combining abms and network statistics under a pom framework is its predictive power and ability to test various scenarios in a new or altered environment complexity of models can be added or reduced in order to identify key mechanisms behind studied processes for instance our case study was based on a single resource type thistle plants hereby reducing the number of plant variables that may affect behaviour and perception of bees such as scent kantsa et al 2017 wright and schiestl 2009 colour ohashi et al 2015 or shape ne eman and kevan 2001 and variability in nectar content and quality due to high nectar content of thistles baude et al 2016 resource depletion is not likely to affect movement decision of the studied bees which have been shown to influence resource choice of other pollinators cartar 2004 the model can also be modified to incorporate behaviour of other species of bees species which movement is likely driven by other urges than in case of b pascuorum like parasitic bumblebees however all these new plant traits can be added to the model if our model is going to be used to simulate multiple resource types the model may be further extended by including other behavioural or environmental processes these could include learning and adaptation behaviour which has been documented for other bumblebee species alem et al 2016 leadbeater and chittka 2008 loukola et al 2017 interactions with conspecifics geslin et al 2014 makino et al 2007 direct energy uptake from the flowers nectar depletion or replenishment balfour et al 2015 chittka et al 1997 lihoreau et al 2016 our case study however is a good example that models based on a few simple processes can successfully reproduce mechanisms observed in nature combining ecological field data spatially explicit abm and network statistics appears to be a promising tool to improve our understanding of animal movements and the decision rules involved understanding which factors including plant selection criteria govern foraging decisions of wild pollinators is an important tool for developing recommendations for conservation and management schemes as pollinators of many wild plants and crops bee foraging behaviour also have consequences for the maintenance of plant populations in managed and natural ecosystems it is crucial to maintain habitats that are suitable for wild pollinators to reduce the ongoing pollinator crisis biesmeijer et al 2006 newton et al 2018 potts et al 2016 and abms combined with network analyses can be a powerful tool to reach this goal our results suggest that distance to the nearest foraging plant was the single most important parameter for foraging choice by the bee individuals modelled bees only developed realistic foraging patterns for a narrow range of wd distance to the next food plant was much more important than either plant height or number of flower heads moreover spatially restricted movement within sub areas of the flower patch resulting in geographically restricted network modules emerged from a simple parameter combination where bees strongly preferred the nearest plants this spatial segregation created by foraging in sub areas of the patch agrees with previous observations on bee foraging dupont et al 2014 hence our results highlight that local movement patterns of bumblebees can to a large extent be modelled using simple foraging rules based on the spatial arrangement of flowers our model is to our knowledge the first abm describing small scale within patch foraging behaviour of bees and therefore the first model that uses an inherently spatially explicit framework to analyse whether foraging decisions are predominantly determined by the spatial distribution of resources or by their structural characteristics the current study adds to the body of knowledge by strongly suggesting that plant spatial distribution is of key importance for bumblebee foraging decision however we currently have only fragmented knowledge about how additional factors such as spatial heterogeneity climate and intra and interspecific interactions affect foraging patterns in the field and more investigations are needed credit authorship

24833,understanding interactions between individual animals and their resources is fundamental to ecology agent based models abms offer an opportunity to study how individuals move given the spatial distribution and characteristics of their resources when contrasted with empirical individual resource network data abms can be a powerful method to detect the processes behind observed movement patterns as they allow for a complete and quantitative analysis of the agent to environment relationships here we use the small scale within patch movement of bumblebees bombus pascuorum as a case study to demonstrate how abms can be combined with network statistics to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind the interactions between individuals and their resources we build an abm that explicitly simulates the influence of distance to the nearest flowering plant allowing minimal energy expenditure and maximum time spent foraging plant height and number of flower heads as a proxy of food availability on local foraging decisions of bumblebees the relative importance of these three elements is determined using pattern oriented modelling pom where we confront the network statistics number of visited plants number of interactions nestedness and modularity of a real b pascuorum individual resource network with the emergent patterns of our abm we also explore the model results using spatial analysis the model is able to reproduce the observed network statistics despite the complex behaviour of bumblebees our results show a surprisingly precise match between the structure of the simulated and empirical networks after adjusting a single model parameter controlling the importance of distance to the next plant visited our study illustrates the potential of combining field data abms and individual resource networks for evaluating small scale within patch movement decisions to better understand animal movements in natural habitats we discuss the benefits of our approach when compared to more classical statistical methods and its ability to test various scenarios in a new or altered environment keywords individual resource network bumblebee foraging patterns pattern oriented modelling small scale foraging 1 introduction understanding why animals move as they do when searching for resources is a central question to behavioural biology and a prerequisite for the development of predictive process based movement models such models can increase our understanding of the complexity behind various decisions of mobile organisms which could be used to improve nature management e g boult et al 2018 one way of describing animal movement and foraging is to study the interactions between individuals and their resources examples of such interactions are trophic networks such as food webs boult et al 2018 networks describing the interactions between hosts and parasitoids and plants and pollinators ings et al 2009 the structure of interaction networks can be characterised with the use of several network statistics nestedness for instance describes whether specialist species individuals of the network interact with subsets of the interaction partners of highly connected generalist species bascompte et al 2003 while modularity describes the degree to which a network is organised into sub groups of interacting species individuals olesen et al 2007 hence network statistics can summarize structural features of complex systems consisting of interacting individuals and their resources however network statistics alone cannot explain how the spatial distribution traits and characteristics of the resources can shape network structure furthermore network statistics alone cannot predict how network structure would change in altered environments under the framework of agent based and pattern oriented modelling abm and pom respectively the mechanisms underlying movement decisions of individuals and the resulting interactions with resources can be identified by contrasting resource use patterns observed in nature with the emergent patterns of models railsback and grimm 2012 individual movement can be simulated in a spatially explicit setting and based on fundamental ecological principles such as optimal foraging and learning nabe nielsen et al 2018 railsback and grimm 2012 in pom the models which can reproduce multiple empirically observed patterns potentially include the key processes responsible for animal foraging decisions a key advantage of combining abm and network statistics is the ability to capture emergent properties of animal movement using relatively simple and transparent sets of rules governing individual behaviours coupling this approach with pom can ensure that these rules are based on realistic and ecologically feasible mechanisms here we present a combination of abm pom and network statistics to describe the foraging behaviour of pollinators specifically the bumblebee bombus pascuorum to understand how their movement is related to the within patch distribution and characteristics of plant resources bees are some of the most studied animals regarding small scale movement patterns herascu 2017 kissling et al 2014 pyke 1979 they are ideal study organisms for spatial foraging strategies as their movements can be tracked manually observed in large numbers almost continuously their food resources plants are stationary discrete and spatially explicit and hence constitute a simple modelling environment several modelling approaches have recently been applied to investigate bumblebee foraging at the landscape scale becher et al 2016 crone and williams 2016 häussler et al 2017 specifically the combination of network analysis with abms has already been used to study the influence of landscape level changes such as forest degradation on plant pollinator networks newton et al 2018 yet the small scale within patch foraging of bees has not been subject of modelling bumblebees are categorised as central place foragers which forage from a fixed base i e a nesting place pyke 1984 in the 1970s pyke developed a series of movement rules for bumblebees based on field observations of optimal foraging in an unknown environment one of these rules being that bees have a strong preference for minimising flight distance when choosing successive flowers pyke 1979 1978 subsequent observational and experimental studies focused on optimal foraging in known environments studying the importance of learning in establishing foraging routes lihoreau et al 2011 ohashi et al 2007 thomson 1996 these studies have shown that bees tend to confine their search within small foraging areas in which they may employ traplining i e visiting flowers in a predictable non random order based on memory of resource availability studies of within patch movements have revealed that bees are more likely to visit plants with a high number of flower heads as an indicator of higher nectar content cartar 2004 makino et al 2007 ohashi and yahara 2002 and make frequent visits to plants near the centre of the patch makino et al 2007 bumblebee movement decisions are therefore influenced by the spatial distribution of flowers and their characteristics but the relative importance of these features have not been tested but see dupont et al 2014 the presented model directly simulates the influence of distance to the nearest flowering plant as a proxy of minimising energy expenditure and maximising time spent foraging plant height and number of flower heads as a proxy of food availability to determine the influence of these plant characteristics on local movement choices of bumblebees the relative importance of these characteristics was determined using pom where we used network statistics to compare emergent patterns from the model with those derived from field data the aims of the study are therefore to demonstrate how combining abm and network analysis can help us to understand within patch foraging behaviour of b pascuorum and to what extent their foraging decisions are determined by the spatial setting and characteristics of the plants we hypothesise that 1 distance to the next plant is a key parameter in bumblebee movement decisions since the time spent collecting nectar and hence energy intake is maximised when time spent flying is minimised pyke 1979 2 plant height influences movement behaviour because taller plants are more visible and hence more attractive dupont et al 2014 and 3 the number of flower heads influences foraging decisions because flower rich plants likely offer a higher reward cartar 2004 makino et al 2007 we hypothesise that these selection criteria are key to explain local space and resource use by foraging bumblebees we demonstrate that the combination of abms and network statistics can be a useful tool in a variety of ecological studies and we discuss the benefits of the presented method when compared to traditional statistical analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site study species and collection of empirical data workers of bombus pascuorum hereafter bees fig 2a are common and important pollinators in northern europe including denmark dupont et al 2011a the foraging behaviour of this nest building species consists of several trips between flowering patches and the nest over the day usually within 500 m from the nest knight et al 2005 while at the flowering patch bees move in between flowers to collect nectar they then leave their foraging spot to go back to the nest to unload nectar or to cool down rest in order not to overheat with the increasing weight of carried floral resources heinrich 1979 1975a 1975b resting usually takes place nearby the foraging patch as in local trees after resting or nectar unloading bees return to the foraging patch to continue foraging hagen et al 2011 henriksen 2013 the study site a meadow at moesgaard have denmark 56 0806 n 10 2311 e was bounded on three sides by mixed deciduous forest fig 1 a during the study period marsh thistle cirsium palustre hereafter thistle or plant was by far the most abundant flowering plant in the meadow and it was at peak flowering during the study period 1 9 july 2013 we therefore assumed that thistle was the main food source for the bees and we did not consider other plant species as a potential food source as supported by the observations that b pascuorum workers were the most frequent visitors thistles are among the most nectar rich plants in northern europe baude et al 2016 and we therefore assumed nectar depletion to be unlikely during the study period we marked all spatially distinct flowering thistles within an area of 60 55 meters in the northern part of the meadow following the method described in dupont et al 2014 the exact position of all thistles n 850 fig 1b within the study patch was mapped by measuring the distances of each thistle to at least two geographically fixed points resulting in geographic coordinates for all thistles the maximum height of flowering stems hereafter height and the number of receptive flower heads were also measured for all thistles at the end of the study period 8 9 july a total of 36 thistles without receptive flower heads were excluded from the study the height of the remaining 814 plants ranged from 40 to 178 cm and the number of flower heads per plant varied from 1 to 15 appendix 1 fig a1 at the study site we captured and individually marked a total of 57 b pascuorum workers small number tags opalithplättchen were carefully glued onto the mesothorax so that bee mobility was not impaired bees were then released and allowed to forage at the end of the observation period 15 of the field identified b pascuorum workers were collected for taxonomic verification in the laboratory by an expert all taxonomically verified bees were correctly determined in the field movement patterns of marked bees were monitored simultaneously by three to five observers on six days during the period 1 9 july 2013 between 9 14 16 18 hrs to observe the movement of bees and plant visitation the observers walked around in the patch until encountering a marked bee this marked bee was then followed for as long as possible and the sequence of thistles visited and the total time of the observation period were registered thirty four unique individuals were observed during the study period most of these individuals were observed more than twice and the total number of continuous direct tracking of individuals equalled 170 max 22 tracks per individual bee median for 34 individuals 4 tracks appendix 1 fig a2 an observation was defined as any continuous tracking of the same individual for longer than 10 s max 31 min median 2 21 min fig a2 amounting to a total of 13 9 h of direct tracking of individual bees by all the observers combined over the 6 days to minimise the potential effect of the presence of the observers on the behaviour of bees observers did not move rapidly during tracking did not touch any of the thistles approached by the bees and did not cross the flying path of the tracked individuals the observers were also spread over the study site in order not to affect each other s observations due to low number of observers and relatively small sample size we did not account for a potential observer bias all observers however were given the exact same task which did not involve any subjective evaluation and we hence consider potential bias to be low if any we determined the number of flower heads per plant visited by tracked bees n 49 measurements of 3 individuals bee flight speed and their search perception radius speed was determined by timing individuals from taking off from one plant to landing on the next one in the study patch n 64 measurements of 14 individuals the mean measured value was used in simulations 0 5 m s search radius was obtained based on the travelling distances from one plant to the next in the empirical dataset more than 99 of observed travelling distances between plants were within 10 m n 2216 and we therefore defined search radius as 10 m assuming that this is the distance within which bees can see and detect plants the weather was sunny or overcast with no rain and light to moderate wind with temperatures ranging from 17 30 c during the observation period 2 2 model description the model description is based on odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2020 2010 2 2 1 purpose and patterns the main purpose of the study is to test whether combining spatially explicit abm and network statistics can help us to understand the drivers behind small scale foraging behaviour of bees such as to investigate to what extent their foraging decisions are determined by the spatial setting and characteristics of the plants in order to evaluate whether our model results in realistic behaviour of bees we adopted the pattern oriented modelling approach pom grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2005 wiegand et al 2003 we use four network metrics commonly applied in network ecology the number of plants p visited by the bees during a simulation number of interactions i here defined as unique combinations of thistle and bees nestedness n and modularity m further explained below in addition we calculate the spatial extent of visited plants estimated as kernel utilisation distributions for the model simulations best representing the empirical metrics 3 best indices as well as simulations resulting in poor match and visually compare these twosets with observed kernels see section 2 3 1 simulations and parameterisation for explanation of 3 best indices and appendix 2 for full description of kernel analysis finally we visually compare the plant modules resulting from the same set of simulations as used for the kernels with the observed together these four metrics kernel analysis and visual comparison of the modules represent spatial temporal and behavioural processes and capture the overall size structure and complexity of an ecological network for each simulation we construct bipartite networks with ids of bees in columns and ids of plants in rows and cell entries aij were non zero if bee i visited thistle j and zero otherwise dupont et al 2011b nestedness n is a non random interaction pattern of bipartite networks in which interactions of specialist nodes are a subset of the interactions of generalist nodes bascompte et al 2003 dupont et al 2003 if nested the network has a core of highly connected generalists here generalist nodes can be thistles visited by many bee individuals and or bee individuals that visit many thistles we assess the level of nestedness of the networks using the nodf index almeida neto et al 2008 appendix 2 eq a1 whether the empirical and modelled networks are significantly nested we assess by comparing the observed value against nestedness values from 1000 random matrices created using null model 2 where the interaction probabilities are proportional to the marginal totals as described by bascompte et al 2003 modularity m is the degree to which a network is organised into sub groups of nodes that interact more among themselves than with nodes from other sub groups i e modules olesen et al 2007 appendix 2 eq a2 both modelled and empirical m is calculated with netcarto using the simulated annealing algorithm significance of m is assessed against 100 randomisations of the network the null model implemented in the program conserves the degree distribution of the empirical network guimerà and amaral 2005a 2005b the empirical network which includes p 640 plants and i 1125 interactions is significantly nested n 3 84 p 0 001 and modular m 0 72 p 0 5 10 6 compared to randomised interaction networks 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model is designed to represent the field site and simulations were therefore based on a realistic meadow landscape where the position of individual thistles and the forest edge corresponds to the positions found at the field site fig 1 the simulated landscape is divided into 424 334 grid cells each corresponding to 0 25 m x 0 25 m the model includes the following entities patches grid cells thistles and bees patches and thistles are characterised only by static state variables variable which do not change over model duration and all these state variables are based on direct measurements in the field table 1 the bee agents are characterised by six static state variables id speed individual specific threshold in number of foraging flights after which they must leave the meadow leave threshold individual specific time spent outside the meadow before returning to the study site time outside the meadow and search perception and return radius as well as three dynamic variables updated over model duration their location number of flower heads to visit during bee plant interaction and number of foraging flights table 1 one time step in the model represents 2 s simulations end when total number of bee plant visits is equal to total number of visits observed in the field 2386 but no longer than 14 h mimicking field observation time a visit is defined as an encounter between a bee and a thistle regardless of the number of flower heads visited see process overview and scheduling a visit ends when a bee encounteres a new thistle the world is set not to wrap either vertically or horizontally 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling processes the processes are structured into five processes as described below they are developed to cover the small scale within foraging patch movement of bees including leaving the meadow behaviour representing resting back to nest visiting other patches behaviour we do not aim to understand what bees do when leaving the meadow just to mimic this behaviour as observed scheduling the order of the processes is the same for each time step but as the model assumes no hierarchies and interactions among bees the order of which individuals execute the processes is randomised at each time step for each bee each state variable table 1 is immediately assigned a new value as soon as that value is calculated by a process the graphical description of the model flow is shown in fig 2 b values and reference of the state variables and parameters are given in table 1 select plant and fly each bee chooses the next plant to visit as follows the plant is selected at random but only among the plants for which all the following three statements are true 1 n e x t p l a n t d r 1 w d s h h m a x w h r f f m a x w f r where d is the distance to the plants within the search radius s perception range of the bees table 1 r is a random number drawn from the uniform distribution between 1 0 h is the height of the plants hmax is the maximum height of plants within s f is the number of flower heads of plants and fmax is the maximum number of flower heads within s wx are weights for the different selection criteria distance wd height wh and number of flower heads wf and see section 2 3 1 simulations and parameterisation for the range and combination of values of wx used in the simulations the eq 1 therefore defines the number of plants a bee is considering visiting in the next step the lower the weight of a given plant characteristic wx the more plants within the search radius s are considered by bees as their next foraging location once a bee choses its next plant to visit the number of time steps nts a bee spends flying to the next plant np is calculated as 2 n t s d n p f l i g h t s p e e d t i m e s t e p where dnp is the distance to the selcted plant or forest tree in case of leave the meadow procedure below in a straight line the flight speed is constant 0 5 m s so 1 m during one time step and has the same value for all the individuals table 1 if the distance to the next plant 1 m it still takes one time step for bees to move to this plant update number of foraging flights a foraging flight is defined as the movement between two consecutively visited plants and is independent of flight distance and number of visited flower heads each bee has a counter of number of foraging flights table 1 which increases by one every time a bee moves to the next plant number of foraging flights defines when bees should leave the meadow leave threshold see below visit flowers having arrived on a plant a bee visits a random number of flower heads between one and four mimicking numbers observed in the field table 1 if a plant has less than four flower heads a bee visits a random number of flower heads between one and the number of flower heads on this plant a bee visits each flower head for one time step the location of the bee does not change during this process leave the meadow a bee leaves the meadow to a nearest forest tree if the number of foraging flights equals or exceeds leave threshold table 1 the number of time steps a bee needs to get to the forest tree is calculated based on eq 2 outside the meadow each bee spends time outside the meadow for a period of time time outside meadow table 1 before returning to the meadow number of foraging flights is then set to zero the location of the bee does not change during this process return to the meadow after being outside the meadow a bee returns to a random plant in the meadow located within a return radius table 1 from the last plant it visited before departing counting of number of foraging flights restarts the number of time steps a bee needs to return to the meadow is calculated based on eq 2 2 2 4 design concepts basic principles the model builds on the principles of optimal foraging assuming that individual bees attempt to optimise their foraging behaviour by flying to a plant with as many flower heads as possible equivalent of high nectar content and as close as possible but allowing for a bias towards the tallest and most visible plants optimal foraging could result from a reduction of the time used for travelling between plants which allows more time for foraging beutler 1951 spatial perception of bee agents is limited and bees can therefore only search for flowers within their perception radius search radius emergence four network metrics p i n m and the kernel spatial analysis emerge from the interaction between bees and thistles calculated from the qualitative networks of these interactions movement of bees outside the meadow and back emerges from the fact that after visiting certain number of plants exceed leave threshold bees leave the meadow to rest unload floral resouces visit other flower patches the nectar and come back after a given time adaptation bees modify their movement based on plant characteristics height distance number of flower heads objectives bees indirectly seek to maximize their food intake by selecting plants based on distance from the previously visited plant height and number of flower heads of the next plant to be visited learning the bees do not learn from each other or from the past experience in the model prediction bees attempt to predict food intake based on flower characteristics sensing bees can see all the plants within search radius and evaluate their relative height number of flower heads and distance to them interaction not included bees do not interact indirectly competition for a common resource or directly by aggression plants and flower heads do not change their properties after being visited by bees stochasticity stochasticity is used in initialization of the model to place bees at their starting point and to assign individual specific leave threshold and time outside meadow during simulation the following processes are sources of stochasticity 1 the direction and location of the next plant selected by a bee among the ones fulfilling the search criteria 2 number of flower heads visited per plant 3 which plant is visited after returning to meadow within return radius stochasticity in the model is used to a mimic situation where there is a range of observed parameters instead of one value i e number of visited flower heads per plant b given procedure behavioural rule is likely to be stochastic in reality i e next visited plant collectives not used individual bees do not represent groups of real bees super individuals as defined by scheffer et al 1995 in the model and therefore one bee in the model represent one individual observation at the end of each time step the id location and behaviour flying visiting a plant or outside meadow of each bee is saved if a bee was visiting a plant the unique id of this thistle is also saved these thistle and bee ids are than used to create networks as described in 2 2 1 purpose and patterns 2 2 5 initialisation the model is initialised by creating 34 bees randomly distributed over thistles mimicking the number of unique individuals observed in the field the landscape contained 2685 flower heads distributed across 814 plants height and the number of flower heads is assigned to each plant as observed in the field fig 1 table 1 all bees are assigned state variables as listed in table 1 an individual specific leave threshold is drawn from a normal distribution mean sd but always 0 and an individual specific time outside the meadow is also drawn from a normal distribution mean sd always 0 2 2 6 input data no time series input is used in the model 2 2 7 submodels there is no additional information regarding different processes the model is programmed in netlogo 5 wilensky 1999 and model output was analysed in r r core team 2016 full model code is presented in appendix 6 and all model input can be given by request 2 3 simulation experiment 2 3 1 simulations and parameterisation as the purpose of the model was to investigate to what extent foraging decisions of bees are determined by the spatial setting and characteristics of the plants we systematically vary the weights of the different plant characteristics distance wd number of flower heads w f and height wh from 0 no importance to 1 high importance in steps of 0 25 in each simulation experiments the three weight values summed to one except for a group of experiments in which either all weights were set to 0 causing bees to select plants randomly or where one weight equalled 0 75 and the other two weights equalled 0 this was done in order to test the importance of single characteristic in the absence of the others but also to differentiate it from also included cases when one of the weights 1 and the remaining ones 0 using the combination of one weight 0 75 and remaining 0 allows for testing of the effect of larger stochasticity in comparison to combinations with one weight 1 and the remaining ones 0 the different combinations of weights are combined with different distributions of leave thresholds mean sd and time outside the meadow mean sd two model parameters for which we had no observed values or where values reported in literature were associated with considerable variation there is no information for b pascuorum on how long bees spend in a foraging patch before leaving it we use observations from other nest building species b hypnorum b lucorum and b pratorum on number of visited plants which in our model are represented by number of foraging flights after which the tracked individuals disappeared from the study site dupont et al 2014 these normally distributed ranges mean sd of leave threshold respectively for the three above mentioned species are given in table 1 and are tested in the model there is also no information on time outside meadow for b pascuorum we therefore used information on this values reported for similar species using radio transmitters hagen et al 2011 observed time outside meadow of b hortorum and reported normally distributed values with mean 45 and sd 15 min mean sd resting period of b terrestris in another field study was 30 15 min henriksen 2013 dupont et al 2014 observed that b hypnorum spent 30 30 min outside the meadow hence for the model we test these three different distributions of time outside meadow around these empirical values in total we test 171 combinations of different weights time outside meadow and leave threshold appendix 3 table a1 we ran five simulations for each of the 171 parameter combinations the standardised squared errors sse are used to evaluate the agreement between the values of the empirical metrics and the average simulated values for each metric i p n and m based on the five runs frank and baret 2013 sse values approaching zero suggest a strong match between the empirical and the simulated value of a given metric combinations resulting in 10 of lowest sse values for all four metrics simultaneously are further retained in the model and referred to as 10 best indices inverse modelling kramer schadt et al 2007 we then re ran 50 simulations for each of the 10 best indices to assess model stochasticity the interaction effect between the three weight variables wd wf and wh is visually investigated by inspecting interaction plots 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis the variance decomposition technique sobol 1990 thiele et al 2014 is used to analyse model sensitivity for three parameters return radius flight speed and number of flower heads visited per plant these parameters are estimated from limited data obtained during field observations and no additional information could be found in the literature all other parameters are directly assessed from field data or parameterised as described above table 1 the three parameters are allowed to vary as follows return radius 2 25 3 75m 25 from the values used in the final simulations flight speed 0 38 1 m s 25 to 100 and number of flower heads visited per plant low 1 2 high 3 6 if a visited plant had more than 3 flower heads we use the sensitivity package pujol et al 2016 in r using the formulas by jansen 1999 saltelli et al 2010 to define the final list of parameter combinations from the above listed variations n 400 sobol s first order main sensitivity parameter combinations si measure the effect of varying a focus parameter alone but averaged over variations in other input parameters thus providing information on the average reduction of output variance when the parameter is fixed sobol s total effect sensitivity parameter combinations sti measure the contribution to the output variance of the focus parameter including all variance caused by its interactions of any order with any other input parameters jensen 1999 and saltelli et al 2010 we run sensitivity analysis on one random parameter combination for which the sse fit criterion is lowered from 10 to 3 hereafter 3 best indices we run ten simulations for this combination appendix 3 table a1 3 results the extent to which bees prefer moving to plants nearby i e wd was the single most important parameter for recreating the empirical network structure as the network structure was much more sensitive to variations in wd than any other plant characteristics fig 3 indeed the abm only created realistic metrics for a very narrow range of wd 0 75 regardless values of other weights and distance to the next plant was therefore much more important than plant height or number of flower heads moreover leave threshold and time outside meadow had negligible influence on simulation outcomes since simulations that best fitted the empirical network both 10 and 3 best indices had all possible combinations of these two parameters fig 3 appendix 3 table a1 a total of 25 parameter combinations produced all four metrics p i n and m within10 and four parameter combination within 3 of the lowest sse values table a1 the best parameter combinations had wd 0 75 for i n and m while p fitted the empirical value well for all wd 0 75 fig 3 weights of 0 0 25 for wh and for wf produced acceptable fits for all metrics but only combined with high wd fig 3 p i and n decreased with increasing wd dropping steeply for wd 0 75 while m increased fig 4 when wd 0 75 regardless values of other weights the simulations produced networks that were significantly modular i e bees and plants tended to be grouped into modules in which individuals interacted more among each other than with individuals from other modules fig 4d plotting the empirical network in a spatial context revealed that the network was significantly modular with eight modules plants belonging to different modules were clearly segregated in space indicating that individual bees consistently foraged on a limited sub set of plants within the flower patch fig 5 although simulated networks with wd 0 75 tended to include fewer plant individuals and hence occupied a slightly more restricted spatial area than the empirical network the plants within the same modules also segregated spatially as also observed exemplified for 3 best indices fig 5 again wd was the single most important parameter for creating spatially restricted modules low wd 0 and 0 25 resulted in number of modules comparable to the empirical network but modules vastly overlapped fig 5 when wd approached 1 bees were caught on one or a few closely spaced plants because they often returned to the plant they had just departed from hence this value of wd resulted in unrealistic movements exemplified for parameter combinations with poor match with empirical metrics fig 5 this restriction to one or a few closely spaced plants explains the mismatch between all empirical and modelled metrics for simulations with wd 1 fig 3 5 although we calculated kernels for the empirical data and modelled simulations we do not consider statistical comparison of characteristics of kernels such as size or overlap as reliable patterns for pom as explained in section 4 2 of appendix 2 there was little variation between the results of the five runs of simulations with the same parameters values see error bars in fig 3 indicating that model stochasticity had negligible influence on the modelled network characteristics increasing the number of runs from 5 to 50 for the 10 best indices had little effect on mean and sd of the four metrics appendix 4 figs a6 7 a visual inspection of the interaction plots appendix 4 fig a3 showed no interaction between the three plant selection criteria 3 1 sensitivity analysis the results of sensitivity analysis show that the sum of main and total effects of parameter combinations 29 table a1 for all the observed metrics is close to 1 indicating that the models are additive i e there is a negligible interaction between parameters return radius flight speed and number of flower heads visited per plant these three parameters contributed comparably to the variation in the observed patterns for i and p n was mainly influenced by return radius appendix 5 fig a8 changing the three parameters by 25 to 100 in compariosn to final values used in the simulations or as described in the material and methods section resulted in p i and n varying between 37 and 128 compared to the mean values obtained for parameter combination 29 one of the 3 best indices and the largest variation was observed in n tables a1 2 compared to the variation in metrics among different parameter combinations the level of variation in the sensitivity analysis was modest 4 discussion the study of interactions between individuals and resources is fundamental to ecology here we demonstrate how abm combined with pom can be used to obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that determine the interactions between individuals and their resources and use network analyses to characterise the structure of the interactions network analyses provide important information about the structure function and evolution of ecological systems at many scales of organisation and are therefore ideal to provide system wide assessments of models borrett et al 2012 the applicability ranges from characterisation of empirical plant pollinator networks food webs bascompte 2009 eklöf et al 2012 knowledge exchange between individuals cornell et al 2012 to analysis of animal social networks rutz et al 2012 despite its usefulness network statistics have not been frequently combined with abms to obtain insights about the processes responsible for the interactions between individuals and their resources but see newton et al 2018 multinomial logistic regression models have previously been used to analyse to what extent foraging decisions of bees and other animals are influenced by spatial distribution of resources and their characteristics for example cartar 2004 makino et al 2007 in the current case study distance to food plants and their characteristics height and number of flower heads would be considered as fixed effects in a regression model accounting for spatial auto correlation in data distribution of plants as well as temporal auto correlation e g related to time since a bee last visited the meadow would require adding random effects to such a model intra specific variation among individuals would be an additional random effect adding such random effects frequently changes the estimates of the fixed effect coefficients and can therefore fail to estimate these effects accurately hodges and reich 2010 our approach of joining abm and network statistics under a pom framework reduces the uncertainty of the results compared to regression models as it is based on transparent structurally realistic and reproducible processes see for example grimm et al 2005 abms are sometimes being criticised for having many parameters for which empirical values are unknown for instance in the current case study two parameters were parameterised leave threshold time outside meadow as we don t have good measurement of these parameters in the field these parameters can however be assessed in the field and then used to further improve the model moreover our approach does not require taking spatial and temporal autocorrelation into account nor does it require assumptions about the relationship between processes underlying emerging patterns another important advantage of combining abms and network statistics under a pom framework is its predictive power and ability to test various scenarios in a new or altered environment complexity of models can be added or reduced in order to identify key mechanisms behind studied processes for instance our case study was based on a single resource type thistle plants hereby reducing the number of plant variables that may affect behaviour and perception of bees such as scent kantsa et al 2017 wright and schiestl 2009 colour ohashi et al 2015 or shape ne eman and kevan 2001 and variability in nectar content and quality due to high nectar content of thistles baude et al 2016 resource depletion is not likely to affect movement decision of the studied bees which have been shown to influence resource choice of other pollinators cartar 2004 the model can also be modified to incorporate behaviour of other species of bees species which movement is likely driven by other urges than in case of b pascuorum like parasitic bumblebees however all these new plant traits can be added to the model if our model is going to be used to simulate multiple resource types the model may be further extended by including other behavioural or environmental processes these could include learning and adaptation behaviour which has been documented for other bumblebee species alem et al 2016 leadbeater and chittka 2008 loukola et al 2017 interactions with conspecifics geslin et al 2014 makino et al 2007 direct energy uptake from the flowers nectar depletion or replenishment balfour et al 2015 chittka et al 1997 lihoreau et al 2016 our case study however is a good example that models based on a few simple processes can successfully reproduce mechanisms observed in nature combining ecological field data spatially explicit abm and network statistics appears to be a promising tool to improve our understanding of animal movements and the decision rules involved understanding which factors including plant selection criteria govern foraging decisions of wild pollinators is an important tool for developing recommendations for conservation and management schemes as pollinators of many wild plants and crops bee foraging behaviour also have consequences for the maintenance of plant populations in managed and natural ecosystems it is crucial to maintain habitats that are suitable for wild pollinators to reduce the ongoing pollinator crisis biesmeijer et al 2006 newton et al 2018 potts et al 2016 and abms combined with network analyses can be a powerful tool to reach this goal our results suggest that distance to the nearest foraging plant was the single most important parameter for foraging choice by the bee individuals modelled bees only developed realistic foraging patterns for a narrow range of wd distance to the next food plant was much more important than either plant height or number of flower heads moreover spatially restricted movement within sub areas of the flower patch resulting in geographically restricted network modules emerged from a simple parameter combination where bees strongly preferred the nearest plants this spatial segregation created by foraging in sub areas of the patch agrees with previous observations on bee foraging dupont et al 2014 hence our results highlight that local movement patterns of bumblebees can to a large extent be modelled using simple foraging rules based on the spatial arrangement of flowers our model is to our knowledge the first abm describing small scale within patch foraging behaviour of bees and therefore the first model that uses an inherently spatially explicit framework to analyse whether foraging decisions are predominantly determined by the spatial distribution of resources or by their structural characteristics the current study adds to the body of knowledge by strongly suggesting that plant spatial distribution is of key importance for bumblebee foraging decision however we currently have only fragmented knowledge about how additional factors such as spatial heterogeneity climate and intra and interspecific interactions affect foraging patterns in the field and more investigations are needed credit authorship

24834,vegetation dynamics are generally restricted by climate and the related soil water state however the responses of vegetation growth to precipitation conditions following afforestation at a watershed scale remain unclear in this study we selected a typical small watershed in a semi humid arid transition climate zone the loess plateau in china where several afforestation programs have been implemented we employed a plant water coupled model to investigate the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation input and to identify the effect of drought on vegetation growth during juvenile and mature stages the model presents a favourable performance in simulating the water balance and vegetation dynamics during 2000 2015 the model and remote sensing retrieved leaf area index lai produce consistent trends regarding vegetation growth vegetation growth is not considerably restricted by the current precipitation conditions semi humid however the growth rate may be quite sensitive to low precipitation input semi arid conditions particularly in the juvenile stage following afforestation moreover vegetation growth is limited by the occurrence of drought in this area drought events impose a lag effect on the lai and there may be a longer lag effect in the juvenile stage than in the mature sage the findings from this study provide comprehensive insights into analysing vegetation responses to precipitation with considerable implications for the implementation of ecological restoration programs in china keywords loess plateau vegetation growth drought leaf

2018 zeng et al 2018 yao et al 2019 vegetation dynamics including vegetation growth is affected by both positive and negative effects of climate change and impose strong climate feedbacks by regulating water and energy exchanges and atmospheric co2 concentrations wu et al 2016 green et al 2017 wei et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 moreover vegetation dynamics are affected by afforestation activities in many areas of the world such as in southern ireland humid climate the mulde basin in germany semi humid climate the sahara arid climate and the kubuqi desert in inner mongolia arid climate kemena et al 2017 lautenbach et al 2017 jovani sancho et al 2018 odoulami et al 2018 wang et al 2018 due to serious soil erosion and frequent natural disasters specifically the loess plateau in china is a characteristic fragile ecological area sun et al 2015 li 2016 wang 2016 jia et al 2017 chen 2018 since 1999 several reforestation programs e g grain for green implemented in this area have significantly improved vegetation coverage xie et al 2015b wang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to understand the relationship between vegetation growth and climatic conditions especially in water limited regions the effect of precipitation change on vegetation growth has attracted extensive attention a few studies employed remote sensing based vegetation indexes e g the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi to represent vegetation growth conditions and concluded that ndvis are positively and strongly correlated with precipitation dynamics jiang et al 2017 tang et al 2017 workie and debella 2018 chu et al 2019 a similar relationship was also revealed in the loess plateau zhao 2012 xie et al 2015a wang 2016 yue et al 2019 however these studies have failed to fully understand the impact of precipitation on different vegetation growth stages after afforestation e g the juvenile and the mature stage moreover few studies considered the lag effect of interannual precipitation anomalies especially under drought conditions on vegetation growth which is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying ecosystem behaviours and activities cao and woodward 1998 to quantify the relationship between vegetation growth and precipitation dynamics a few methods have been proposed the most common method is the observation based statistical regression model green et al 2017 tang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 mo et al 2019 this black box type of model has been widely used to identify the relationship between vegetation activity and water conditions wu et al 2014 but it has limitations in parameterizing vegetation physiology which is essential to capture the complex interactions between plant and water constraints alternatively ecohydrological models that couple plant growth and water distribution are valuable for many applications as a typical plant water coupled model the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been demonstrated as an effective tool for hydrological modelling and plant growth across various scales arnold et al 1999 gassman et al 2007 krysanova and white 2015 yu et al 2017 in this study we aimed to understand the relationship between vegetation growth and precipitation conditions we selected a typical watershed the xiuyan river watershed in a semi humid arid transition climate zone which has been one of the first areas in which afforestation programs have been implemented i e the grain for green program we investigated two main issues 1 what is the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation change in different growth stages 2 what is the drought lag effect on vegetation growth following model evaluation on water and vegetation growth the swat model was used to simulate plant water coupled processes this study has implications for afforestation design and management in semi arid and semi humid climatic conditions 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area the xiuyan river watershed is located in zichang county yan an city shaanxi province of the loess plateau which lies between 37 1 37 19 n 109 12 109 43 e with an area of 892 4 km2 fig 1 it has a warm continental monsoon climate with a mean temperature of approximately 13 c during the past three decades the mean annual precipitation has been approximately 500 mm and annual precipitation has varied from 0 6 to 1 6 times of the mean value between approximately 300 800 mm more than 70 of the rainfall occurs from may to september hence this area is in a semi humid arid transition zone with evapotranspiration accounting for about 80 of the precipitation the area is dominated by cropland and grassland followed by forest with small proportions of water and construction land the main tree species in the forests are robinia pseudoacacia and pinus tabulaeformis yu et al 2019 after the grain for green program had been implemented in the year 1999 zhou et al 2009 li et al 2010 the proportion of forest increased from 9 02 81 km2 in 1990 to 21 41 185 km2 in 2010 fig 2 correspondingly cropland and grassland decreased by 9 08 86 km2 and 3 55 31 km2 respectively which implies that the afforestation project contributed a great deal to land use change in this area since afforestation was implemented in plateau and hilly areas precipitation is the only water input to the local ecosystem feng et al 2016 vegetation growth is particularly sensitive to precipitation changes shen et al 2011 thus this is an ideal area to identify the impact of precipitation on vegetation growth 2 2 data availability the swat model requires a

were obtained from a global land surface satellite glass product xiao et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 http www geodata cn table 1 presents detailed information about these data 2 3 model description swat is a semi distributed processed based ecohydrological model arnold et al 2010 arnold et al 2012 bonuma et al 2013 tan et al 2019 it is parameterized to simulate plant growth processes with water temperature and nutrient constrains in the swat framework the water balance is the basic process driving other ecohydrological processes the water balance equation is expressed as 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where swt is the final soil water content mm h2o sw 0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm h2o t is the time days rday is the amount of precipitation on day i mm h2o qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm h2o ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm h2o wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm h2o and qgw is the amount of return flow on day i mm h2o swat has been coupled with a plant growth model to simulate various vegetation dynamics arnold et al 1999 the model can differentiate between annual and perennial plants in this study we used the amount of canopy cover to indicate the condition of vegetation growth the amount of canopy cover is expressed as the lai which is defined as the area of green leaves per unit area of land under ideal growing conditions for perennials the leaf area added on day i is calculated using the following equation 2 δ l a i i f r l a i m x i f r l a i m x i 1 y r c u r y r f u l l d e v l a i m x 1 exp 5 l a i i 1 y r c u r y r f u l l d e v l a i m x the accumulated lai is expressed as 3 l a i i l a i i 1 δ l a i i where δlaii is the leaf area added on day i laii and l a i i 1 are the leaf area indices for day i and i 1 respectively fr laimx i and f r l a i m x i 1 are the fraction of the plant s maximum lai for day i and i 1 laimx is the maximum lai for the plant yrcur is the age of the tree years and yrfulldev is the number of years for the tree species to reach full development years according to equation 2 the model employs different vegetation growth modes for the juvenile and the mature stages for the juvenile stage yrcur yrfulldev the accumulated lai will vary depending on the age of the tree relative to the number of years required for the tree to mature for the mature stage yrcur yrfulldev the accumulated lai will not depend on the age increase thus yrfulldev is an important parameter for vegetation growth when leaf senescence becomes the dominant growth process the lai for perennials is calculated as 4 l a i y r c u r y r f u l l d e v l a i m x 1 f r p h u 1 f r p h u s e n f r p h u f r p h u s e n where lai is the lai for a given day laimx is the maximum lai frphu is the fraction of potential heat unit accumulated for the plant on a given day in the growing season fr phu sen is the fraction of the growing season phu at which senescence becomes the dominant growth process actual plant growth differs from the above potential growth due to temperature water and nutrient constraints the actual leaf area added on day i is calculated as 5 δ l a i a c t i δ l a i i γ r e g where δlai act i is the actual leaf area added on day i δlaii is the potential leaf area added on day i that is calculated with equation 1 or 2 and γreg is the plant growth factor 0 0 1 0 the plant growth factor quantifying the constraints is calculated as 6 γ r e g 1 max w s t r s t s t r s n s t r s p s t r s where wstrs is the water stress for a given day tstrs is the temperature stress for a given day expressed as a fraction of optimal plant growth nstrs is the nitrogen stress for a given day and pstrs is the phosphorus stress for a given day the water stress for a given day is calculated as 7 w s t r s 1 e t a c t e t 1 w a c t u a l u p e t where et is the maximum plant transpiration on a given day mm h2o e t act is the actual amount of transpiration on a given day mm h2o and wactualup is the total plant water uptake for the day mm h2o in this study we only considered the water constraint and removed nitrogen and phosphorus stress therefore the scenario simulation results of the model were assumed to be only contributed by the precipitation change given the consideration of the water constraint previous soil water conditions e g water stress during a drought in the year due to precipitation anomalies will impact the later soil water storage thereby affecting vegetation growth thus the swat model with a plant water coupled process cannot only simulate the interannual change in the lai but also its daily change the plant growth in a given year will vary depending on the age of the tree and environmental conditions e g water and temperature 2 4 model setup calibration and validation the study area was divided into 19 sub basins fig 1 and 89 hydrologic response units hrus the detailed model setup in this study is shown in fig 3 the soil and water assessment tool calibration uncertainty program swat cup software package was used in this study for model calibration validation sensitivity and uncertainty analysis liu et al 2010 this package employs the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm to map all uncertainties parameter conceptual model input etc on the parameters expressed as uniform distributions or ranges it is able to capture the majority of the measured data within the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu of the model in an iterative process three objective functions i e determination coefficient r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage bias were used to search for optimal parameter values the eco hydrological model was calibrated and validated with respect to water balance and vegetation dynamics for the water balance although the soil water state is a direct factor constraining vegetation growth we employed streamflow as a surrogate to evaluate the model performance due to data availability moreover streamflow is the most widely used variable in hydrological model evaluation according to the sensitive parameters in swat santhi et al 2001 muleta and nicklow 2005 arabi et al 2008 yu et al 2017 six parameters were selected for streamflow calibration regarding runoff generation and routing processes table 2 for the calibration of vegetation related parameters we first determined the initial value of each vegetation parameter according to the swat database and then optimized the vegetation parameters of different vegetation types so that the simulated lai matched the glass lai as well as possible based on the plant growth formulation five parameters were selected for lai calibration table 3 we first calibrated the runoff related parameters table 2 and then the vegetation related parameters table 3 it may be beneficial to combine both streamflow and lai but it is difficult to set an objective function because of this multi objective optimization problem moreover the soil and water assessment tool calibration uncertainty program swat cup can only be used for runoff related parameter calibrations while the vegetation related parameters need to be manually adjusted thus we optimized the runoff and vegetation related parameters separately although the two processes are actually coupled based on such a calibration and validation for water balance and vegetation dynamics optimal parameter values were achieved for subsequent simulations with different scenarios 2 5 experiment design according to the precipitation condition in the study area precipitation in this area fluctuates between 0 6 and 1 6 times the mean value moreover precipitation in 2004 and 2015 was approximately 289 mm and 329 mm respectively i e well below the annual mean precipitation which shows that drought events occurred in these two years which may have imposed different stresses on vegetation growth to identify the sensitivity of vegetation growth to the precipitation dynamics and the drought events we designed four scenarios with different precipitation conditions as illustrated in fig 3 in scenario 1 for the period of 2000 2017 the precipitation input for the model was set at 0 6 times the actual precipitation therefore the mean annual precipitation was approximately 312 mm which represents a semi arid climate condition in scenario 2 the precipitation input was the actual time series with a mean of approximately 520 mm this scenario indicates a semi humid condition and can be taken as a baseline simulation and was the scenario used for the model calibration and validation in scenario 3 the precipitation input was set as 1 6 times the actual time series and its value was approximately 832 mm which represents a humid climate condition in scenario 4 except that the precipitation input in 2004 and 2015 was the average annual precipitation the precipitation input in the other years was the same as that in scenario 2 this scenario was designed to enable the discussion of the drought lag effect of vegetation growth the lengths of the two stages were identified according to the temporal variation in the lai since this study focused on vegetation dynamics after afforestation the vegetation in this paper mainly refers to forest and the simulated lai is with respect to the forest land 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 streamflow the model for the water balance simulation was calibrated for the periods of 2006 and 2008 2009 and was validated for the period of 2010 2012 with a warm up period of 3 years 1997 1999 we used three years to spin up the model given that there was little afforestation practice before the year 2000 afforestation operations in the swat model started at the fourth year i e in 2000 which is in line with the actual situation fig 4 shows the simulation results of the daily runoff for calibration and the 2010 2012 validation at zichang station the simulated streamflow was consistent with the corresponding observations the determination coefficient r2 was 0 70 for the calibration and 0 73 for the validation and the nse was up to 0 70 the bias was 1 51 for the calibration and 5 99 for the validation the simulation results suggest that the swat model performance was satisfactory and acceptable according to the criteria used in this application nash and sutcliffe 1970 overall the swat model and related parameters were reliable to simulate the water balance in the catchment 3 1 2 leaf area index lai as the main vegetation growing season in the study area is from may to september we selected the lai from this growing season for calibration and validation for forest the increase in the lai was related to the change in tree structure in this study grass is actually a perennial vegetation with mixed shrubs and grasses not a simple annual vegetation thus the lai for the grassland should increase annually therefore we validated the lai from forest and grassland the results of the simulated model for the forest and grassland lais were consistent in terms of time with the corresponding glass lai fig 5 please note that the model and the glass presented a similar increase for the grass lai because the grassland is composed of mixed perennial vegetation table 4 shows the simulation results of the forest and grassland lais for 2000 2011 calibration and 2012 2017 validation for the forest the determination coefficient r2 was 0 80 for the calibration and 0 85 for the validation and the corresponding nse values were 0 73 and 0 82 respectively accordingly the calibration and validation of grassland also achieved acceptable results fig 6 shows the simulated lai and global land surface satellite glass lai for the 19 sub basins in the study area which were almost consistent in their spatial distribution given the appropriate parameterizations and the favourable performance the model results were reliable to interpret the response of plant growth after afforestation 3 1 3 climate and lai changes the interannual precipitation and air temperature showed different temporal variations fig 7 precipitation has had large interannual changes in this area the amount of precipitation was 700 mm in 2002 whereas it was only 289 mm in 2004 and 329 mm in 2015 indicating that drought events occurred in 2004 and 2015 however the interannual temperature in the region has shown little change with a mean of approximately 13 c in response to such climate conditions the soil water in this area simulated by swat had similar dynamics to those of the precipitation and it reached a low level in 2004 and 2015 about 172 mm and 134 mm respectively evidently the performance of the simulated lai was basically the same as that of the glass lai r2 0 77 nse 0 71 and bias 4 15 whereby both increased annually the lai increased from 0 34 in 2000 to 1 34 in 2017 interestingly the simulated lai showed an upward trend in 2002 and a slight decrease in 2015 which was basically consistent with the precipitation and soil water fluctuation although the simulated lai did not decrease in 2004 it showed a downward trend in 2005 which may be due to the lag effect of drought on the lai it has to be noted that the glass lai also showed a lag effect in 2005 as it remained at the same level as that in 2004 about 0 65 while the swat simulation failed to trace specific fluctuations in the glass lai e g the sharp increase in 2002 it successfully captured the general pattern of the lai increase according to the soil water dynamics the lag effect in 2015 was not obvious because the water stress referring to the low level of soil moisture due to the 2015 drought was largely relaxed by the precipitation in 2016 fig 7 in contrast the 2004 drought was more severe than that in 2015 according to precipitation and soil moisture thus soil moisture and the related vegetation growth state i e lai did not recover in 2005 these analyses suggest that precipitation may have a substantial impact on vegetation dynamics in addition the lai increased rapidly prior to 2012 whereas it tended to stabilise after 2012 given the life cycle of tree species the first 12 years were assumed as a juvenile stage after which the vegetation was assumed to be in a mature stage a few other studies also indicated that the tree species planted on the loess plateau need about 12 years to mature hu et al 1992 liu 1998 xu et al 2003 zhu et al 2004 therefore we set the mature stage y r f u l l d e v 12 in the modelling and investigated the lag effect in the two stages the vegetation lai also showed spatial variability fig 8 in 2001 the lai in most areas was 0 5 especially in the northwest where the lai was 0 3 in contrast in 2017 the lai of the entire area reached 0 9 and exceeded 1 5 in the southeast part generally the lai in the southeast of the study area was larger than that in the northwest which was likely due to the lower elevation in the southeast and the relatively rich water resources there was only a small difference in the lai between 2013 and 2017 because the vegetation reached the mature stage moreover the lai in 2015 was even lower than that in 2013 due to the drought in 2015 3 2 sensitivity of vegetation growth 3 2 1 effect of different precipitation conditions on vegetation growth the simulation results of scenarios 1 3 are shown in fig 9 a it was found that the lai from scenario 3 1 6 p was slightly larger than that from scenario 2 p the lai from scenario 1 0 6 p fluctuated sharply and was considerably lower than that of scenario 2 for instance the lai decreased from 0 53 scenario 2 to 0 36 scenario 3 in 2005 and from 1 32 to 0 89 respectively in 2015 to further examine the precipitation impact on vegetation in the modelling we prescribed different precipitation inputs from 0 2 to 2 times i e the multiplier of precipitation α in fig 9 c the actual precipitation time series fig 9 b and fig 9 c present the responses of the lai and biomass to the precipitation conditions the multiplier α respectively it is perceived that the lai and biomass had logarithmic correlations with precipitation as the coefficients of determination r2 were 0 93 and 0 86 respectively in the fitting formulas and with the increase of precipitation the lai and biomass growth rates also decreased beyond that and if α 1 vegetation growth was more sensitive to a precipitation change whereas if α 1 the sensitivity was substantially decreased 3 2 2 effect of precipitation change on vegetation in different stages of the growth cycle we identified the sensitivity of the lai in the juvenile and the mature stages from may to september in the three scenarios scenarios 1 3 the lai of the mature stage was clearly greater than that of the juvenile stage in the three scenarios fig 10 from may to september the largest lai difference between the juvenile stage and the mature stage appeared in july while the smallest difference occurred in may fig 10 d and 10 e show the lai change rate of scenario 1 and scenario 3 respectively relative to scenario 2 the lai change rate in the mature stage of scenario 1 was 4 higher than that in the juvenile stage and the highest was in june 5 however in scenario 3 there was no significant difference between the lai change rate in the mature stage and the juvenile stage especially in july and august while the largest difference appeared in may at the same time the lai change rate in the mature stage was approximately 1 higher than that in the juvenile stage 3 3 3 lagged effect of the influence of drought on vegetation the difference scenario 2 scenario 4 in the lai between scenario 2 and scenario 4 is shown in fig 11 the lai in scenario 2 was 0 017 and 0 132 lower than that in scenario 4 in 2004 and 2005 respectively interestingly in scenario 2 after the drought in 2004 the lai in 2005 decreased more than in 2004 which shows that the interannual lag effect of drought on vegetation growth was significant in the juvenile stage on the contrary the negative anomaly of precipitation in 2015 almost only caused the lai to decrease in that year which shows that the hysteresis of the influence of drought on vegetation is not very significant in the mature stage we further explored the response of the daily lai during the two drought events although the negative precipitation anomaly began in may of 2004 and 2015 fig 12 the negative lai differences appeared after june of the two years the largest absolute lai differences were up to 0 03 and 1 7 in june for 2004 and 2015 respectively where the largest proportional lai difference reached 4 4 and 9 5 in late june until september thus the lag effect of the two droughts is one month at least 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of precipitation on vegetation growth this study identified the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation change the results show that vegetation growth is substantially limited by precipitation and that the sensitivity of vegetation to precipitation varies in different life stages drought has a lag effect on vegetation growth although there have been many reports on the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation change the majority were based on black box type models with statistical regressions kong et al 2017 quetin and swann 2017 tang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 li et al 2019 mo et al 2019 in this study we employed a plant water coupled model to simulate vegetation growth we not only clarified the specific effects of different precipitation conditions on vegetation growth but also found that the lag effect of drought in different vegetation life cycle stages differed which has also been revealed by other studies martiny et al 2006 mberego 2017 papagiannopoulou et al 2017 li et al 2019 mo et al 2019 we found that the trend of vegetation growth varied with the increase in precipitation within a certain range and that there was a roughly logarithmic relationship between vegetation growth and precipitation fig 9 this finding has also been discussed by previous studies chang et al 2014 yang et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 justine et al 2017 tang et al 2017 in which close relationships were established between the vegetation index and climate factors li et al 2019 found that a stepwise multiple regression equation can well represent the relationship between the lai and precipitation del toro guerrero et al 2019 reported that vegetation greenness showed significant temporal and spatial correlations with precipitation features furthermore what is surprising is that the growth rate of lai and biomass decreased with increasing precipitation fig 9 this finding was consistent with tang et al 2017 who indicated that vegetation growth in a low precipitation area was more sensitive to precipitation than that in a high precipitation area this implies the existence of a precipitation threshold beyond which vegetation growth will not be limited by precipitation but rather controlled by other factors such as carbon dioxide solar radiation tree age etc gavito et al 2001 juvany et al 2013 our study revealed the effect of precipitation change on the vegetation in different stages of the growth cycle when the annual precipitation was 400 mm in scenario 1 for semi arid climate conditions vegetation growth in the juvenile stage was more sensitive to precipitation input than in the mature stage in contrast when the annual precipitation was 400 mm in scenario 2 for semi humid climate conditions vegetation growth in the mature stage was more sensitive to precipitation than in the juvenile stage although the sensitivity was not particularly distinct this may be due to the large water demand during the maturity of the vegetation previous studies have investigated seasonal effects of precipitation on vegetation growth gaughan et al 2012 chen and weber 2014 cramer and hoffman 2015 mberego 2017 liu et al 2018 zp et al 2018 tang et al 2017 explored the spatiotemporal changes of vegetation growth and the responses to climate changes and found that the summer ndvi was positively correlated with summer precipitation in comparison to previous studies our study not only discussed the sensitivity difference during the main growing season may september but also analysed the sensitivity of vegetation in the juvenile and mature stages to the precipitation change under different climatic conditions our study also found that drought had a lag effect on vegetation growth previous studies have independently reached the same conclusion martiny et al 2006 mberego 2017 papagiannopoulou et al 2017 tang et al 2017 li et al 2019 mo et al 2019 yet in contrast to previous research our study discovered the lag effect of drought on vegetation growth in different life cycles juvenile and mature stages fig 12 our study found that the lag effect of drought on vegetation growth in different life cycles young and mature is also different fig 12 this may be because in the juvenile stage the increase in the lai mainly depends on the age of the plants and the vegetation state at the end of the last year in the mature stage the increase in the lai is not related to the age and the vegetation state of the previous year but mainly relies on the climate of the current year therefore the lag effect is different between the juvenile and the mature stage there are several possible reasons for a time lag between precipitation and vegetation growth one is that the soil moisture memory is long term mo et al 2016 found that soil water storage during the previous non growing season had a consistent spatial effect on the vegetation cover change in a semi arid and semi humid river basin based on the annual water balance another reason is the nonlinear and delayed response of vegetation to precipitation change based on in situ observations wolf et al 2014 a further possible reason is the residence time of water flowing through different regions since it has been shown that there is a spatial phase difference between precipitation and ndvi dynamics helton et al 2014 mcdonnell and beven 2014 4 2 implications understanding the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation change in afforestation areas is conducive to reasonably evaluating the environmental carrying capacity of the area and has implications for the selection and construction of afforestation areas taking the loess plateau as an example there are distinct regional differences in precipitation changes miao et al 2016 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 and drought has a certain impact on vegetation growth numerous studies have shown that vegetation restoration in the loess plateau leads to soil drought which in turn affects the vegetation resulting in the decline in vegetation coverage jia and shao 2014 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 su and shangguan 2019 therefore local climate conditions should be considered for further afforestation in addition in other afforestation areas around the world such as kubuqi desert in inner mongolia the sahara the sahil in africa southwest ireland and the mulde basin in germany kemena et al 2017 lautenbach et al 2017 jovani sancho et al 2018 odoulami et al 2018 wang et al 2018 vegetation growth may also be affected by precipitation especially in arid areas such as the sahara kemena et al 2017 these areas should be forested without affecting the ecological balance 4 3 uncertainties there are uncertainties in this study first the uncertainties in the glass lai may influence the model calibration if additional ground lai observations were to be used to further validate the model the uncertainty would be reduced secondly the model parameters would have introduced uncertainties in our attribution analysis galavi et al 2019 guo and su 2019 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 therefore it would be advantageous to determine different vegetation parameters for various vegetation species across the loess plateau moreover the model calibration and validation for the water balance were based on streamflow observations soil moisture evaluations are important to guarantee reasonable simulations for the water balance in vegetation growth thirdly there are some small scale water conservancy facilities in the study area including small dams and scattered terraces guo 2016 these water conservancy facilities affect hydrological processes and are more influential for runoff routing process than for runoff generation which highly depends on soil water conditions our modelling did not specifically consider their impact however our model calibration attenuated the impact of the water conservancy facilities as it ensured a reliable runoff simulation through parameter adjustment optimization so as to obtain acceptable simulations for the overall water balance moreover this study focuses on vegetation growth processes which are constrained by the soil moisture conditions after afforestation the impact of terraces and check dams may thus not be significant 5 conclusions this study employed a plant water coupled ecohydrological model to simulate vegetation growth the primary focus was to identify the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation in a typical afforestation area on the loess plateau after afforestation the lai increased from 0 34 in 2000 to 1 34 in 2017 in the study area especially in the downstream areas with relatively sufficient water availability we found that vegetation growth seems to have a logarithmic correlation with precipitation the lai and biomass were more sensitive to precipitation in the case of a low precipitation specifically when the total precipitation was 400 mm the sensitivity of young vegetation to precipitation change was higher than that of mature vegetation when the total precipitation was 400 mm on the contrary the sensitivity of young vegetation to precipitation change was lower in the juvenile stage drought had a distinct lagged effect on vegetation growth and can even affect vegetation growth in the following year whereas in the mature stage the lag effect from drought may be shorter although these findings are inferred from a small watershed they are expected to not only contribute to the understanding of the hydrological and ecological processes of vegetation restoration but also provide reference values

24834,vegetation dynamics are generally restricted by climate and the related soil water state however the responses of vegetation growth to precipitation conditions following afforestation at a watershed scale remain unclear in this study we selected a typical small watershed in a semi humid arid transition climate zone the loess plateau in china where several afforestation programs have been implemented we employed a plant water coupled model to investigate the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation input and to identify the effect of drought on vegetation growth during juvenile and mature stages the model presents a favourable performance in simulating the water balance and vegetation dynamics during 2000 2015 the model and remote sensing retrieved leaf area index lai produce consistent trends regarding vegetation growth vegetation growth is not considerably restricted by the current precipitation conditions semi humid however the growth rate may be quite sensitive to low precipitation input semi arid conditions particularly in the juvenile stage following afforestation moreover vegetation growth is limited by the occurrence of drought in this area drought events impose a lag effect on the lai and there may be a longer lag effect in the juvenile stage than in the mature sage the findings from this study provide comprehensive insights into analysing vegetation responses to precipitation with considerable implications for the implementation of ecological restoration programs in china keywords loess plateau vegetation growth drought leaf

2018 zeng et al 2018 yao et al 2019 vegetation dynamics including vegetation growth is affected by both positive and negative effects of climate change and impose strong climate feedbacks by regulating water and energy exchanges and atmospheric co2 concentrations wu et al 2016 green et al 2017 wei et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 moreover vegetation dynamics are affected by afforestation activities in many areas of the world such as in southern ireland humid climate the mulde basin in germany semi humid climate the sahara arid climate and the kubuqi desert in inner mongolia arid climate kemena et al 2017 lautenbach et al 2017 jovani sancho et al 2018 odoulami et al 2018 wang et al 2018 due to serious soil erosion and frequent natural disasters specifically the loess plateau in china is a characteristic fragile ecological area sun et al 2015 li 2016 wang 2016 jia et al 2017 chen 2018 since 1999 several reforestation programs e g grain for green implemented in this area have significantly improved vegetation coverage xie et al 2015b wang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to understand the relationship between vegetation growth and climatic conditions especially in water limited regions the effect of precipitation change on vegetation growth has attracted extensive attention a few studies employed remote sensing based vegetation indexes e g the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi to represent vegetation growth conditions and concluded that ndvis are positively and strongly correlated with precipitation dynamics jiang et al 2017 tang et al 2017 workie and debella 2018 chu et al 2019 a similar relationship was also revealed in the loess plateau zhao 2012 xie et al 2015a wang 2016 yue et al 2019 however these studies have failed to fully understand the impact of precipitation on different vegetation growth stages after afforestation e g the juvenile and the mature stage moreover few studies considered the lag effect of interannual precipitation anomalies especially under drought conditions on vegetation growth which is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying ecosystem behaviours and activities cao and woodward 1998 to quantify the relationship between vegetation growth and precipitation dynamics a few methods have been proposed the most common method is the observation based statistical regression model green et al 2017 tang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 mo et al 2019 this black box type of model has been widely used to identify the relationship between vegetation activity and water conditions wu et al 2014 but it has limitations in parameterizing vegetation physiology which is essential to capture the complex interactions between plant and water constraints alternatively ecohydrological models that couple plant growth and water distribution are valuable for many applications as a typical plant water coupled model the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been demonstrated as an effective tool for hydrological modelling and plant growth across various scales arnold et al 1999 gassman et al 2007 krysanova and white 2015 yu et al 2017 in this study we aimed to understand the relationship between vegetation growth and precipitation conditions we selected a typical watershed the xiuyan river watershed in a semi humid arid transition climate zone which has been one of the first areas in which afforestation programs have been implemented i e the grain for green program we investigated two main issues 1 what is the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation change in different growth stages 2 what is the drought lag effect on vegetation growth following model evaluation on water and vegetation growth the swat model was used to simulate plant water coupled processes this study has implications for afforestation design and management in semi arid and semi humid climatic conditions 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area the xiuyan river watershed is located in zichang county yan an city shaanxi province of the loess plateau which lies between 37 1 37 19 n 109 12 109 43 e with an area of 892 4 km2 fig 1 it has a warm continental monsoon climate with a mean temperature of approximately 13 c during the past three decades the mean annual precipitation has been approximately 500 mm and annual precipitation has varied from 0 6 to 1 6 times of the mean value between approximately 300 800 mm more than 70 of the rainfall occurs from may to september hence this area is in a semi humid arid transition zone with evapotranspiration accounting for about 80 of the precipitation the area is dominated by cropland and grassland followed by forest with small proportions of water and construction land the main tree species in the forests are robinia pseudoacacia and pinus tabulaeformis yu et al 2019 after the grain for green program had been implemented in the year 1999 zhou et al 2009 li et al 2010 the proportion of forest increased from 9 02 81 km2 in 1990 to 21 41 185 km2 in 2010 fig 2 correspondingly cropland and grassland decreased by 9 08 86 km2 and 3 55 31 km2 respectively which implies that the afforestation project contributed a great deal to land use change in this area since afforestation was implemented in plateau and hilly areas precipitation is the only water input to the local ecosystem feng et al 2016 vegetation growth is particularly sensitive to precipitation changes shen et al 2011 thus this is an ideal area to identify the impact of precipitation on vegetation growth 2 2 data availability the swat model requires a

is a semi distributed processed based ecohydrological model arnold et al 2010 arnold et al 2012 bonuma et al 2013 tan et al 2019 it is parameterized to simulate plant growth processes with water temperature and nutrient constrains in the swat framework the water balance is the basic process driving other ecohydrological processes the water balance equation is expressed as 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where swt is the final soil water content mm h2o sw 0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm h2o t is the time days rday is the amount of precipitation on day i mm h2o qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm h2o ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm h2o wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm h2o and qgw is the amount of return flow on day i mm h2o swat has been coupled with a plant growth model to simulate various vegetation dynamics arnold et al 1999 the model can differentiate between annual and perennial plants in this study we used the amount of canopy cover to indicate the condition of vegetation growth the amount of canopy cover is expressed as the lai which is defined as the area of green leaves per unit area of land under ideal growing conditions for perennials the leaf area added on day i is calculated using the following equation 2 δ l a i i f r l a i m x i f r l a i m x i 1 y r c u r y r f u l l d e v l a i m x 1 exp 5 l a i i 1 y r c u r y r f u l l d e v l a i m x the accumulated lai is expressed as 3 l a i i l a i i 1 δ l a i i where δlaii is the leaf area added on day i laii and l a i i 1 are the leaf area indices for day i and i 1 respectively fr laimx i and f r l a i m x i 1 are the fraction of the plant s maximum lai for day i and i 1 laimx is the maximum lai for the plant yrcur is the age of the tree years and yrfulldev is the number of years for the tree species to reach full development years according to equation 2 the model employs different vegetation growth modes for the juvenile and the mature stages for the juvenile stage yrcur yrfulldev the accumulated lai will vary depending on the age of the tree relative to the number of years required for the tree to mature for the mature stage yrcur yrfulldev the accumulated lai will not depend on the age increase thus yrfulldev is an important parameter for vegetation growth when leaf senescence becomes the dominant growth process the lai for perennials is calculated as 4 l a i y r c u r y r f u l l d e v l a i m x 1 f r p h u 1 f r p h u s e n f r p h u f r p h u s e n where lai is the lai for a given day laimx is the maximum lai frphu is the fraction of potential heat unit accumulated for the plant on a given day in the growing season fr phu sen is the fraction of the growing season phu at which senescence becomes the dominant growth process actual plant growth differs from the above potential growth due to temperature water and nutrient constraints the actual leaf area added on day i is calculated as 5 δ l a i a c t i δ l a i i γ r e g where δlai act i is the actual leaf area added on day i δlaii is the potential leaf area added on day i that is calculated with equation 1 or 2 and γreg is the plant growth factor 0 0 1 0 the plant growth factor quantifying the constraints is calculated as 6 γ r e g 1 max w s t r s t s t r s n s t r s p s t r s where wstrs is the water stress for a given day tstrs is the temperature stress for a given day expressed as a fraction of optimal plant growth nstrs is the nitrogen stress for a given day and pstrs is the phosphorus stress for a given day the water stress for a given day is calculated as 7 w s t r s 1 e t a c t e t 1 w a c t u a l u p e t where et is the maximum plant transpiration on a given day mm h2o e t act is the actual amount of transpiration on a given day mm h2o and wactualup is the total plant water uptake for the day mm h2o in this study we only considered the water constraint and removed nitrogen and phosphorus stress therefore the scenario simulation results of the model were assumed to be only contributed by the precipitation change given the consideration of the water constraint previous soil water conditions e g water stress during a drought in the year due to precipitation anomalies will impact the later soil water storage thereby affecting vegetation growth thus the swat model with a plant water coupled process cannot only simulate the interannual change in the lai but also its daily change the plant growth in a given year will vary depending on the age of the tree and environmental conditions e g water and temperature 2 4 model setup calibration and validation the study area was divided into 19 sub basins fig 1 and 89 hydrologic response units hrus the detailed model setup in this study is shown in fig 3 the soil and water assessment tool calibration uncertainty program swat cup software package was used in this study for model calibration validation sensitivity and uncertainty analysis liu et al 2010 this package employs the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm to map all uncertainties parameter conceptual model input etc on the parameters expressed as uniform distributions or ranges it is able to capture the majority of the measured data within the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu of the model in an iterative process three objective functions i e determination coefficient r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage bias were used to search for optimal parameter values the eco hydrological model was calibrated and validated with respect to water balance and vegetation dynamics for the water balance although the soil water state is a direct factor constraining vegetation growth we employed streamflow as a surrogate to evaluate the model performance due to data availability moreover streamflow is the most widely used variable in hydrological model evaluation according to the sensitive parameters in swat santhi et al 2001 muleta and nicklow 2005 arabi et al 2008 yu et al 2017 six parameters were selected for streamflow calibration regarding runoff generation and routing processes table 2 for the calibration of vegetation related parameters we first determined the initial value of each vegetation parameter according to the swat database and then optimized the vegetation parameters of different vegetation types so that the simulated lai matched the glass lai as well as possible based on the plant growth formulation five parameters were selected for lai calibration table 3 we first calibrated the runoff related parameters table 2 and then the vegetation related parameters table 3 it may be beneficial to combine both streamflow and lai but it is difficult to set an objective function because of this multi objective optimization problem moreover the soil and water assessment tool calibration uncertainty program swat cup can only be used for runoff related parameter calibrations while the vegetation related parameters need to be manually adjusted thus we optimized the runoff and vegetation related parameters separately although the two processes are actually coupled based on such a calibration and validation for water balance and vegetation dynamics optimal parameter values were achieved for subsequent simulations with different scenarios 2 5 experiment design according to the precipitation condition in the study area precipitation in this area fluctuates between 0 6 and 1 6 times the mean value moreover precipitation in 2004 and 2015 was approximately 289 mm and 329 mm respectively i e well below the annual mean precipitation which shows that drought events occurred in these two years which may have imposed different stresses on vegetation growth to identify the sensitivity of vegetation growth to the precipitation dynamics and the drought events we designed four scenarios with different precipitation conditions as illustrated in fig 3 in scenario 1 for the period of 2000 2017 the precipitation input for the model was set at 0 6 times the actual precipitation therefore the mean annual precipitation was approximately 312 mm which represents a semi arid climate condition in scenario 2 the precipitation input was the actual time series with a mean of approximately 520 mm this scenario indicates a semi humid condition and can be taken as a baseline simulation and was the scenario used for the model calibration and validation in scenario 3 the precipitation input was set as 1 6 times the actual time series and its value was approximately 832 mm which represents a humid climate condition in scenario 4 except that the precipitation input in 2004 and 2015 was the average annual precipitation the precipitation input in the other years was the same as that in scenario 2 this scenario was designed to enable the discussion of the drought lag effect of vegetation growth the lengths of the two stages were identified according to the temporal variation in the lai since this study focused on vegetation dynamics after afforestation the vegetation in this paper mainly refers to forest and the simulated lai is with respect to the forest land 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 streamflow the model for the water balance simulation was calibrated for the periods of 2006 and 2008 2009 and was validated for the period of 2010 2012 with a warm up period of 3 years 1997 1999 we used three years to spin up the model given that there was little afforestation practice before the year 2000 afforestation operations in the swat model started at the fourth year i e in 2000 which is in line with the actual situation fig 4 shows the simulation results of the daily runoff for calibration and the 2010 2012 validation at zichang station the simulated streamflow was consistent with the corresponding observations the determination coefficient r2 was 0 70 for the calibration and 0 73 for the validation and the nse was up to 0 70 the bias was 1 51 for the calibration and 5 99 for the validation the simulation results suggest that the swat model performance was satisfactory and acceptable according to the criteria used in this application nash and sutcliffe 1970 overall the swat model and related parameters were reliable to simulate the water balance in the catchment 3 1 2 leaf area index lai as the main vegetation growing season in the study area is from may to september we selected the lai from this growing season for calibration and validation for forest the increase in the lai was related to the change in tree structure in this study grass is actually a perennial vegetation with mixed shrubs and grasses not a simple annual vegetation thus the lai for the grassland should increase annually therefore we validated the lai from forest and grassland the results of the simulated model for the forest and grassland lais were consistent in terms of time with the corresponding glass lai fig 5 please note that the model and the glass presented a similar increase for the grass lai because the grassland is composed of mixed perennial vegetation table 4 shows the simulation results of the forest and grassland lais for 2000 2011 calibration and 2012 2017 validation for the forest the determination coefficient r2 was 0 80 for the calibration and 0 85 for the validation and the corresponding nse values were 0 73 and 0 82 respectively accordingly the calibration and validation of grassland also achieved acceptable results fig 6 shows the simulated lai and global land surface satellite glass lai for the 19 sub basins in the study area which were almost consistent in their spatial distribution given the appropriate parameterizations and the favourable performance the model results were reliable to interpret the response of plant growth after afforestation 3 1 3 climate and lai changes the interannual precipitation and air temperature showed different temporal variations fig 7 precipitation has had large interannual changes in this area the amount of precipitation was 700 mm in 2002 whereas it was only 289 mm in 2004 and 329 mm in 2015 indicating that drought events occurred in 2004 and 2015 however the interannual temperature in the region has shown little change with a mean of approximately 13 c in response to such climate conditions the soil water in this area simulated by swat had similar dynamics to those of the precipitation and it reached a low level in 2004 and 2015 about 172 mm and 134 mm respectively evidently the performance of the simulated lai was basically the same as that of the glass lai r2 0 77 nse 0 71 and bias 4 15 whereby both increased annually the lai increased from 0 34 in 2000 to 1 34 in 2017 interestingly the simulated lai showed an upward trend in 2002 and a slight decrease in 2015 which was basically consistent with the precipitation and soil water fluctuation although the simulated lai did not decrease in 2004 it showed a downward trend in 2005 which may be due to the lag effect of drought on the lai it has to be noted that the glass lai also showed a lag effect in 2005 as it remained at the same level as that in 2004 about 0 65 while the swat simulation failed to trace specific fluctuations in the glass lai e g the sharp increase in 2002 it successfully captured the general pattern of the lai increase according to the soil water dynamics the lag effect in 2015 was not obvious because the water stress referring to the low level of soil moisture due to the 2015 drought was largely relaxed by the precipitation in 2016 fig 7 in contrast the 2004 drought was more severe than that in 2015 according to precipitation and soil moisture thus soil moisture and the related vegetation growth state i e lai did not recover in 2005 these analyses suggest that precipitation may have a substantial impact on vegetation dynamics in addition the lai increased rapidly prior to 2012 whereas it tended to stabilise after 2012 given the life cycle of tree species the first 12 years were assumed as a juvenile stage after which the vegetation was assumed to be in a mature stage a few other studies also indicated that the tree species planted on the loess plateau need about 12 years to mature hu et al 1992 liu 1998 xu et al 2003 zhu et al 2004 therefore we set the mature stage y r f u l l d e v 12 in the modelling and investigated the lag effect in the two stages the vegetation lai also showed spatial variability fig 8 in 2001 the lai in most areas was 0 5 especially in the northwest where the lai was 0 3 in contrast in 2017 the lai of the entire area reached 0 9 and exceeded 1 5 in the southeast part generally the lai in the southeast of the study area was larger than that in the northwest which was likely due to the lower elevation in the southeast and the relatively rich water resources there was only a small difference in the lai between 2013 and 2017 because the vegetation reached the mature stage moreover the lai in 2015 was even lower than that in 2013 due to the drought in 2015 3 2 sensitivity of vegetation growth 3 2 1 effect of different precipitation conditions on vegetation growth the simulation results of scenarios 1 3 are shown in fig 9 a it was found that the lai from scenario 3 1 6 p was slightly larger than that from scenario 2 p the lai from scenario 1 0 6 p fluctuated sharply and was considerably lower than that of scenario 2 for instance the lai decreased from 0 53 scenario 2 to 0 36 scenario 3 in 2005 and from 1 32 to 0 89 respectively in 2015 to further examine the precipitation impact on vegetation in the modelling we prescribed different precipitation inputs from 0 2 to 2 times i e the multiplier of precipitation α in fig 9 c the actual precipitation time series fig 9 b and fig 9 c present the responses of the lai and biomass to the precipitation conditions the multiplier α respectively it is perceived that the lai and biomass had logarithmic correlations with precipitation as the coefficients of determination r2 were 0 93 and 0 86 respectively in the fitting formulas and with the increase of precipitation the lai and biomass growth rates also decreased beyond that and if α 1 vegetation growth was more sensitive to a precipitation change whereas if α 1 the sensitivity was substantially decreased 3 2 2 effect of precipitation change on vegetation in different stages of the growth cycle we identified the sensitivity of the lai in the juvenile and the mature stages from may to september in the three scenarios scenarios 1 3 the lai of the mature stage was clearly greater than that of the juvenile stage in the three scenarios fig 10 from may to september the largest lai difference between the juvenile stage and the mature stage appeared in july while the smallest difference occurred in may fig 10 d and 10 e show the lai change rate of scenario 1 and scenario 3 respectively relative to scenario 2 the lai change rate in the mature stage of scenario 1 was 4 higher than that in the juvenile stage and the highest was in june 5 however in scenario 3 there was no significant difference between the lai change rate in the mature stage and the juvenile stage especially in july and august while the largest difference appeared in may at the same time the lai change rate in the mature stage was approximately 1 higher than that in the juvenile stage 3 3 3 lagged effect of the influence of drought on vegetation the difference scenario 2 scenario 4 in the lai between scenario 2 and scenario 4 is shown in fig 11 the lai in scenario 2 was 0 017 and 0 132 lower than that in scenario 4 in 2004 and 2005 respectively interestingly in scenario 2 after the drought in 2004 the lai in 2005 decreased more than in 2004 which shows that the interannual lag effect of drought on vegetation growth was significant in the juvenile stage on the contrary the negative anomaly of precipitation in 2015 almost only caused the lai to decrease in that year which shows that the hysteresis of the influence of drought on vegetation is not very significant in the mature stage we further explored the response of the daily lai during the two drought events although the negative precipitation anomaly began in may of 2004 and 2015 fig 12 the negative lai differences appeared after june of the two years the largest absolute lai differences were up to 0 03 and 1 7 in june for 2004 and 2015 respectively where the largest proportional lai difference reached 4 4 and 9 5 in late june until september thus the lag effect of the two droughts is one month at least 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of precipitation on vegetation growth this study identified the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation change the results show that vegetation growth is substantially limited by precipitation and that the sensitivity of vegetation to precipitation varies in different life stages drought has a lag effect on vegetation growth although there have been many reports on the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation change the majority were based on black box type models with statistical regressions kong et al 2017 quetin and swann 2017 tang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 li et al 2019 mo et al 2019 in this study we employed a plant water coupled model to simulate vegetation growth we not only clarified the specific effects of different precipitation conditions on vegetation growth but also found that the lag effect of drought in different vegetation life cycle stages differed which has also been revealed by other studies martiny et al 2006 mberego 2017 papagiannopoulou et al 2017 li et al 2019 mo et al 2019 we found that the trend of vegetation growth varied with the increase in precipitation within a certain range and that there was a roughly logarithmic relationship between vegetation growth and precipitation fig 9 this finding has also been discussed by previous studies chang et al 2014 yang et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 justine et al 2017 tang et al 2017 in which close relationships were established between the vegetation index and climate factors li et al 2019 found that a stepwise multiple regression equation can well represent the relationship between the lai and precipitation del toro guerrero et al 2019 reported that vegetation greenness showed significant temporal and spatial correlations with precipitation features furthermore what is surprising is that the growth rate of lai and biomass decreased with increasing precipitation fig 9 this finding was consistent with tang et al 2017 who indicated that vegetation growth in a low precipitation area was more sensitive to precipitation than that in a high precipitation area this implies the existence of a precipitation threshold beyond which vegetation growth will not be limited by precipitation but rather controlled by other factors such as carbon dioxide solar radiation tree age etc gavito et al 2001 juvany et al 2013 our study revealed the effect of precipitation change on the vegetation in different stages of the growth cycle when the annual precipitation was 400 mm in scenario 1 for semi arid climate conditions vegetation growth in the juvenile stage was more sensitive to precipitation input than in the mature stage in contrast when the annual precipitation was 400 mm in scenario 2 for semi humid climate conditions vegetation growth in the mature stage was more sensitive to precipitation than in the juvenile stage although the sensitivity was not particularly distinct this may be due to the large water demand during the maturity of the vegetation previous studies have investigated seasonal effects of precipitation on vegetation growth gaughan et al 2012 chen and weber 2014 cramer and hoffman 2015 mberego 2017 liu et al 2018 zp et al 2018 tang et al 2017 explored the spatiotemporal changes of vegetation growth and the responses to climate changes and found that the summer ndvi was positively correlated with summer precipitation in comparison to previous studies our study not only discussed the sensitivity difference during the main growing season may september but also analysed the sensitivity of vegetation in the juvenile and mature stages to the precipitation change under different climatic conditions our study also found that drought had a lag effect on vegetation growth previous studies have independently reached the same conclusion martiny et al 2006 mberego 2017 papagiannopoulou et al 2017 tang et al 2017 li et al 2019 mo et al 2019 yet in contrast to previous research our study discovered the lag effect of drought on vegetation growth in different life cycles juvenile and mature stages fig 12 our study found that the lag effect of drought on vegetation growth in different life cycles young and mature is also different fig 12 this may be because in the juvenile stage the increase in the lai mainly depends on the age of the plants and the vegetation state at the end of the last year in the mature stage the increase in the lai is not related to the age and the vegetation state of the previous year but mainly relies on the climate of the current year therefore the lag effect is different between the juvenile and the mature stage there are several possible reasons for a time lag between precipitation and vegetation growth one is that the soil moisture memory is long term mo et al 2016 found that soil water storage during the previous non growing season had a consistent spatial effect on the vegetation cover change in a semi arid and semi humid river basin based on the annual water balance another reason is the nonlinear and delayed response of vegetation to precipitation change based on in situ observations wolf et al 2014 a further possible reason is the residence time of water flowing through different regions since it has been shown that there is a spatial phase difference between precipitation and ndvi dynamics helton et al 2014 mcdonnell and beven 2014 4 2 implications understanding the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation change in afforestation areas is conducive to reasonably evaluating the environmental carrying capacity of the area and has implications for the selection and construction of afforestation areas taking the loess plateau as an example there are distinct regional differences in precipitation changes miao et al 2016 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 and drought has a certain impact on vegetation growth numerous studies have shown that vegetation restoration in the loess plateau leads to soil drought which in turn affects the vegetation resulting in the decline in vegetation coverage jia and shao 2014 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 su and shangguan 2019 therefore local climate conditions should be considered for further afforestation in addition in other afforestation areas around the world such as kubuqi desert in inner mongolia the sahara the sahil in africa southwest ireland and the mulde basin in germany kemena et al 2017 lautenbach et al 2017 jovani sancho et al 2018 odoulami et al 2018 wang et al 2018 vegetation growth may also be affected by precipitation especially in arid areas such as the sahara kemena et al 2017 these areas should be forested without affecting the ecological balance 4 3 uncertainties there are uncertainties in this study first the uncertainties in the glass lai may influence the model calibration if additional ground lai observations were to be used to further validate the model the uncertainty would be reduced secondly the model parameters would have introduced uncertainties in our attribution analysis galavi et al 2019 guo and su 2019 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 therefore it would be advantageous to determine different vegetation parameters for various vegetation species across the loess plateau moreover the model calibration and validation for the water balance were based on streamflow observations soil moisture evaluations are important to guarantee reasonable simulations for the water balance in vegetation growth thirdly there are some small scale water conservancy facilities in the study area including small dams and scattered terraces guo 2016 these water conservancy facilities affect hydrological processes and are more influential for runoff routing process than for runoff generation which highly depends on soil water conditions our modelling did not specifically consider their impact however our model calibration attenuated the impact of the water conservancy facilities as it ensured a reliable runoff simulation through parameter adjustment optimization so as to obtain acceptable simulations for the overall water balance moreover this study focuses on vegetation growth processes which are constrained by the soil moisture conditions after afforestation the impact of terraces and check dams may thus not be significant 5 conclusions this study employed a plant water coupled ecohydrological model to simulate vegetation growth the primary focus was to identify the sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation in a typical afforestation area on the loess plateau after afforestation the lai increased from 0 34 in 2000 to 1 34 in 2017 in the study area especially in the downstream areas with relatively sufficient water availability we found that vegetation growth seems to have a logarithmic correlation with precipitation the lai and biomass were more sensitive to precipitation in the case of a low precipitation specifically when the total precipitation was 400 mm the sensitivity of young vegetation to precipitation change was higher than that of mature vegetation when the total precipitation was 400 mm on the contrary the sensitivity of young vegetation to precipitation change was lower in the juvenile stage drought had a distinct lagged effect on vegetation growth and can even affect vegetation growth in the following year whereas in the mature stage the lag effect from drought may be shorter although these findings are inferred from a small watershed they are expected to not only contribute to the understanding of the hydrological and ecological processes of vegetation restoration but also provide reference values
