6195,knowledge about the origin and transformation of nutrients at different temporal scales in river ecosystems can provide a better understanding of carbon c and nitrogen n cycles in rivers and bear important implications for regional and global c and n cycling in this study stable isotopes of c and n δ13c and δ15n and a radioactive isotope of 210pb were used to investigate the factors affecting seasonal and long term changes in n source apportionment and c and n biogeochemical processes in the beijiang river located in the pearl river basin china source apportionment by a bayesian model stable isotopic analysis in r siar showed significant seasonal variations during the flood season the dominant origins were non point sources such as soil n for dissolved nitrogen dn accounting for 38 soil organic matter for particulate organic matter pom 58 and sedimentary organic matter som 31 due to intense precipitation during the non flood season fertilizer became the dominant nitrate source 48 and effluent detritus prevailed in the pom 47 and som 32 pools n transformation between the dn pom and som was influenced by seasonally variable hydrology our data suggested that low discharge was more favorable for the vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation which was supported by similar δ15n values in the dn pom and som in the non flood season a sedimentary history record of 65 years 1951 2015 showed that the variation of n in the sediment was mainly affected by human activities from 1999 to 2005 a decreasing trend in the δ15n values was observed due to the promotion of aquatic plant cultivation after reservoir impoundment from 2005 to 2011 the enrichment in the δ15n values was caused by increases in manure and sewage due to the development of the tourism industry from 2011 to 2015 the increase in pollution treatment funds from the government improved the water environment resulting in δ15n depletion in the sediment at the 65 year temporal scale increased temperature and co2 concentration had less impact on the c and n cycles in river ecosystems however high discharge could increase the c and n contents and flood events might increase the δ15n values in the sediment this study provided more detailed information regarding the nutrient sources and improved our understanding of the c and n cycling processes at different temporal scales in river ecosystems keywords nitrogen isotope seasonal variation long term variation human activity 1 introduction a river is a key pathway for the transport of nutrients in both dissolved and particulate forms from the land to the coastal zone and oceans michel 2003 nitrogen n and carbon c loading of aquatic ecosystems is increasing worldwide as a result of climate change and human activities meybeck 1982 peterson et al 2001 seitzinger et al 2005 strokal et al 2015 however less than half of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din is exported from a river to an estuary and the organic matter pools in the ocean have only minor terrestrial signatures benner 2004 peterson et al 2001 this pattern indicates that the complex transformation processes of c and n in river ecosystems have a significant impact on the c and n fluxes thus it is crucial to understand the origins transport and transformation of c and n in both dissolved and solid phases including suspended particulate organic matter pom and sedimentary organic matter som in river ecosystems in the upper stream region of an estuary this information may provide significant insight into the c and n cycles in estuaries and oceans and has important implications for regional and global c and n cycling several c and n origins have been identified for dissolved nitrogen dn pom and som in river ecosystems dn mainly originates from soil nitrogen sn synthetic fertilizers sf and manure and sewage ms xue et al 2009 while pom and som are supplied from soil organic matter soil om and effluent detritus ed in the terrestrial ecosystem and from phytoplankton pp and macrophytes mp in the aquatic ecosystem lu et al 2016 ock and takemon 2014 ogrinc et al 2008 both sources and migration processes are affected by natural factors and human activities and both show variations with different temporal scales two distinct scales can be recognized as seasonal variations and long term variations for the seasonal variations the input of non point sources e g soil increased in the wet season as a result of the intense precipitation li et al 2019a pennino et al 2016 aquatic plant production e g pp and mp is affected by temperature and precipitation lu et al 2016 high temperatures in the wet season promote the growth of aquatic plants while higher turbidity and weaker light caused by high precipitation could decrease the production of aquatic plants yin et al 2000 in addition the seasonal changes in hydrological conditions could also influence the transportation and transformation processes of nutrients between the dissolved phase and solid phase such as the processes of deposition resuspension assimilation and denitrification chen et al 2009 xia et al 2017a ye et al 2017 for long term variations climate change and human activities are deemed the major driving factors of the c and n cycles for instance climate change i e increasing temperature and atmospheric co2 concentrations promotes the growth of aquatic plants such as n2 fixing phytoplankton and algae which influences the c and n behaviors in the aquatic ecosystem komatsu et al 2007 xia et al 2015 land use changes including urbanization and large scale agricultural explorations by human activities are the main factors that alter the riverine n origins fang et al 2010 liu et al 2018 pennino et al 2016 moreover more direct ways such as dam construction in the river could affect the migration and biogeochemical process of nutrients directly or indirectly by influencing relevant processes such as sediment deposition and internal cycling kunz et al 2011 tang et al 2016 walling 2006 the recognition of c and n cycling at different temporal scales is a challenge for river ecosystem studies the stable isotopes δ13c and δ15n technique has been treated as a sophisticated method used to trace multiple sources in aquatic ecosystems as c and n bearing matters maintain the isotope signatures of their sources or alter their isotope signatures in regular ways such as rayleigh fractionation during the transport and transformation processes gao et al 2015 xu et al 2016 xue et al 2009 ye et al 2017 in addition to the stable isotope technique the radioactive isotope technique such as the lead 210 210pb dating technique for sediment has also been widely applied in exploring historical pollution information recorded in sediments appleby 2008 córdoba et al 2016 thus the combination of c n and 210pb isotopes provides more information regarding nutrient sources and improves our understanding of potential c and n cycling processes from the perspective of different temporal scales from both seasonal and long term variations in the aquatic ecosystem numerous studies of c and n cycles were conducted in the pearl river estuary guo et al 2015 lee 2000 miao et al 2016 ye et al 2017 ye et al 2016 ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 however little research has been conducted on the seasonal and long term variations in the c and n cycles in the river of upstream of the estuary in this study the beijiang river which is the second largest tributary of the pearl river and is located upstream of the pearl river estuary was chosen as the study area the objective of this study was to reveal how the nutrient cycles in different phases of the aquatic ecosystem at different temporal scales specifically the study 1 quantifies source apportionment of n during different seasons 2 discusses seasonal variations in the hydrology that alter the source patterns and transformation of n and 3 investigates the factors affecting the long term c and n cycles in the aquatic ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the beijiang river is the second largest tributary of the pearl river and is located in the upper drainage of the pearl river estuary which empties into the south china sea fig 1 the climate is characterized by warm and humid summer monsoon and cool and dry winter monsoon ye et al 2017 the average annual runoff of the beijiang river is 4 288 billion m3 with 70 80 of the flux occurring from april to september li et al 2005 this pattern can be attributed to the fact that more than 70 of the annual precipitation approximately 1800 mm year 1 is concentrated in the wet season april to september and less than 30 is concentrated in the dry season october to february according to the runoff data from 65 years 1951 2015 the flood period is mainly from may to june while the lowest discharge occurs in december to january the beijiang river basin covers a total area of 46 710 km2 and is a typical forestry and agricultural area chen et al 2009 wu et al 2014 the percentages of the amounts of forest and agricultural land within the beijiang river basin are 74 5 and 19 respectively table 4 since the 1970s the agricultural areas have expanded in the beijang river basin strokal et al 2015 intensive agricultural activities have caused soil organic matter loss and n pollution and have subsequently affected the transfer of c and n to the downstream aquatic ecosystems garzon garcia et al 2017 hao et al 2012 the main agricultural crop along the river is rice during the growing season march to july for early rice august to november for late rice chemical fertilizers and manure are frequently used to enhance agricultural productivity the estimated total amount of chemical fertilizers applied in agricultural fields was reported as approximately 1 3 105 t n in 2006 moreover manure has been another significant contributing source of n input due to urbanization since the 1980s and the amount of n input was estimated at approximately 1 2 105 t n in 2006 chen and jia 2009a hence high loads of organic matter and anthropogenic nutrients from fertilizer manure and sewage have profound effects on the sources and cycling of c and n because the primary industry in the beijiang river basin is mining and energy exploitation and the dominant pollutions in the discharge of industrial wastewater are heavy metals li et al 2019b wastewater has little effect on c and n variations in river water or organic matter the feilai gorge dam was constructed in the lower reach of the study area fig 1 for the main purposes of controlling floods and generating electricity it is the largest comprehensive water conservancy project in guangdong province china the construction of the feilai gorge dam began in 1994 and finished in 1998 subsequently the reservoir impoundment began operating in march 1999 2 2 sample collection in this study river water samples were collected at the feilaixia hydrological station on the first day of every month in 2015 to assess the fundamental parameters including the no3 concentration based on the precipitation discharge and nitrate concentration in 2015 fig s1 two sampling campaigns were conducted during the flood season in june 2015 and during the non flood season in december 2015 to reveal the nutrient behaviors between the dissolved and solid phases the water suspended matter and sediments were sampled fig 1 the total number of river water samples and surface sediments were 60 and 16 respectively specifically the surface water sw samples approximately 0 5 m below the surface and bottom water bw samples approximately 1 m above the bottom were collected during each sampling period from 15 sites which included 11 sites in the mainstream and 4 sites in the major tributaries connected to the mainstream in each sample the suspended particulate matter was collected by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters whatman gf f 47 mm in diameter surface sediments on the riverbed were collected from 8 sites along the main channel a sediment core was collected downstream from the b09 sampling point fig 1 this location was chosen because the transverse section in b09 was the widest and largest transverse section with a width of approximately 1440 m and an area of approximately 19 908 m2 along the main stream this hydraulic feature causes the average flow velocity to decrease dramatically and results in sedimentation at this point the sediment core for age dating was taken by a gravity sampler equipped with a polycarbonate cube with an inner diameter of 6 5 cm after sampling the overlying water was siphoned with a tubule and syringe and a stainless tapping pin with a degree scale was used to push the sediment out of the pipe from the bottom to the top of the pipe sediments were subsampled in 1 cm intervals samples of the potential c and n sources were also collected twenty two soil samples were collected from different land use paddy 7 crop 7 vegetable 4 forest 4 sites along the mainstream because these sites represented the primary sources of organic matter the groundwater samples n 10 and drainage water samples n 5 were also collected near the river sampling sites because they represented the major pathways for nutrients to reach the river all water samples were brought back to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until laboratory analysis and all sediment and soil samples were frozen within 24 h 2 3 analysis method field parameters for water samples including temperature t ph dissolved oxygen do and chlorophyll a chl a were measured in situ using portable equipment ysi exo2 multiparameter sondes the nitrate n no3 n and other major ions were analyzed by ion chromatography thermo fisher ics 900 the water samples used to measure the stable isotope composition of δ15n no3 were pretreated according to the agno3 method introduced by silva et al 2000 for the suspended particulate matter the sediment and soil samples total nitrogen tn and total organic carbon toc were analyzed by an elemental analyzer elemental vario macro cube prior to isotopic analysis any possible carbonate sediments and calcareous plankton were removed from the samples taking care not to remove organic c or n yamamuro and kayanne 1995 all c and n stable isotope analysis of solid samples was measured using an elemental analyzer flash ea2000 thermofisher and mass spectrometer delta advantage v thermofisher to determine the stable isotope composition at sunyat sen university china the average analytical error was typically 0 2 for δ15n and 0 1 for δ13c the 210pb and 226ra activities in the sediment core were measured using a high purity germanium detector gwl 120 15 ortec atlanta ga usa data on the monthly temperature and precipitation of the beijiang river basin from 1951 to 2015 were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn data on the daily discharge at two main hydrology stations in the downstream region of the beijiang river from 1951 to 2015 were collected from the pearl river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources http www pearlwater gov cn the land use data were obtained from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis 2 4 1 siar mixing model to quantify the contributions of different sources to c and n in the aquatic ecosystem the siar model was used the mixing model can be expressed as follows x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 1 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 i and j 1 2 3 j sjk is the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk is the proportion of source k which needs to be estimated by siar model cjk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with mean λjk and standard deviation τij and εij is the residual error representing the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation σj a detailed description of this model can be found in the literatures jackson et al 2011 parnell et al 2010 semmens et al 2009 to estimate the proportional contribution of no3 sources only one isotope j 1 δ15n no3 and three major potential no3 sources soil nitrogen synthetic fertilizers and manure and sewage were considered in this study the n isotopic signatures of synthetic fertilizer 1 2 0 4 and manure or domestic sewage 15 4 0 6 were obtained from the literature data choi et al 2017 the δ15n value of soil 9 6 2 2 was determined based on 22 soil samples distributed along the river in addition to identify the pom and som sources in different seasons two types of isotopic ratios i e δ15n and δ13c j 2 and four potential sources soil organic matter macrophytes phytoplankton and effluent detritus were considered the isotopic values of the potential sources are presented in table 2 the δ15n and δ13c values of the soil organic matter 9 6 2 2 and 27 6 0 7 were calculated from 22 soil samples in our study area the δ15n and δ13c characteristics of the macrophytes 9 1 1 1 and 29 4 0 5 and phytoplankton 5 1 and 30 0 65 were cited from results obtained in the dongjiang river which is another tributary of the pearl river and has similar climatic and environmental conditions as those of the beijaing river li 2015 the δ15n and δ13c values of the effluent detritus 2 2 1 9 and 24 4 1 4 were obtained from the literature lu et al 2016 the fractionation factors for all sources were set to zero cjk 0 in eq 1 because corresponding experiments for determining enrichment factors were not conducted in this study 2 4 2 statistical analysis all statistical tests were conducted using spss version 22 0 two way anova was used to test the differences in nitrate concentrations δ15n no3 n concentrations δ15n and δ13c values of pom between seasons and between water depths one way anova was used to test the differences in n concentrations δ15n and δ13c values of som between seasons the percentages of different land uses were generated by arcgis 10 2 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial variations in n concentrations and c and n isotopes the statistical characteristics of all parameters are summarized in table 1 during the sampling periods it was found that the dominant form of n in the din was no3 n fig s2 the no3 n concentrations showed significant seasonal variation with higher concentrations in the non flood season and lower concentrations in the flood season p 0 01 and this variation was consistent with that of the monthly data fig s1 no significant difference in the no3 n concentrations was detected for the surface and bottom water p 0 05 the pon concentrations showed significant seasonal and spatial variations with higher concentrations during the flood season and lower concentrations in the surface water p 0 01 the son concentrations did not vary significantly between seasons p 0 05 with an average value of 1 14 0 27 g kg 1 in the flood season and an average value of 1 35 0 56 g kg 1 in the non flood season the statistical characteristics of the δ15n and δ13c values for the dn pom and som by two way anova are summarized in table 1 the δ15n no3 values varied significantly between seasons p 0 01 but not between the surface and bottom water p 0 05 the δ15n no3 values were higher in the flood season than in the non flood season fig 2 c in the flood season the δ15n no3 values fluctuated along the river with higher values in the middle stream sections however in the non flood season the δ15n no3 values decreased along the river fig 2c the average δ15n no3 values of the groundwater and drainage were 12 27 5 04 and 1 5 3 86 respectively in the pom pool the δ15n pom values varied significantly between seasons and spaces p 0 01 and p 0 05 respectively with higher values observed in the flood season and in the surface water fig 2 the δ15n pom values fluctuated along the river during both the flood season and the non flood season in the flood season the δ15n pom values were higher in the middle stream and downstream region however in the non flood season the δ15n pom values were lower in the upper and middle stream sections fig 2a the δ13c pom values varied significantly between seasons p 0 05 but not between the surface and bottom water p 0 05 in contrast for the som pool no significant temporal variation was observed in the δ15n som and δ13c som values p 0 05 for the pom the ranges of the δ15n and δ13c values were from 2 10 to 9 02 and from 27 89 to 25 40 respectively for the som the ranges of the δ15n and δ13c values were from 5 80 to 9 08 and from 27 98 to 24 58 respectively 3 2 source apportionment of dn pom and som according to regional land use and previous studies the major potential dn sources in this study area included sf ms and sn and the potential sources of pom and som included terrestrial sources e g soil om and ed and aquatic sources e g mp and pp the c and n isotopic characteristics of the different sources are summarized in table 2 for the dn the source apportionment pattern showed a significant variation between seasons p 0 01 but no significant variation between the surface and bottom water p 0 05 in the flood season the apportionment of the sf sn and ms sources were similar with averages of 38 33 and 29 respectively in the non flood season the sf source contributed most mean probability estimate mpe 48 the ms source was the second contributor mpe 31 and the sn source contributed the least mpe 21 these source patterns suggested that a large proportion of the dn export was derived from fertilizer n in this agricultural watershed and an increased proportion of the sn source and a decreased proportion of the ms source contributed to the dn during the flood season additionally different sources have various migratory pathways e g groundwater and agricultural drainage to transport nutrients to the river in this study in the groundwater the contribution from the ms source was the highest mep 46 followed by the contribution from the sn source mep 36 and the sf source contributed the least mep 18 fig 3 c in the agricultural drainage the sf source contributed the most mep 63 the ms source contributed the least mep 14 and the sn source contributed an intermediate amount mep 23 fig 3d it was recognized that groundwater was the major pathway for the ms source and agricultural drainage was the predominant pathway for the sf source for the pom in the study area the soil om and ed might make larger contributions than those of the other two potential sources mp and pp to the pom and som fig s4 the siar mixing model outputs of the proportional contributions of the four major potential sources of pom and som are presented in fig 4 and table s1 the source apportionment patterns were significantly different between the two seasons in the pom pool fig 4 the contribution from the soil om source mpe 58 was the highest followed by the contribution from the ed source mpe 27 during the flood season however during the non flood season the proportion of the ed source mpe 47 was the highest followed by the proportions of the soil om mpe 27 and mp sources mpe 18 in the som pool the source patterns were similar to those in the pom pool where the soil om source mpe 31 was the predominant source in the flood season and the ed source mpe 32 contributed the most in the non flood season however the proportion of the mp source was higher for the som than it was for the pom 3 3 the age dating and c and n contents of the sediment core the chronology of the sediment core and the sedimentary rate which were determined by measuring 210pb and 226ra were presented in our previous study li et al 2019b the results showed the sedimentary geochronology of approximately 65 years i e from 1951 to 2015 in the sediment core fig 5 some studies have reported that diagenesis causes an unavoidable loss of organic matter from sediments due to the degradation processes of organic material such as mineralization banner and hanson 1990 gupta and kawahata 2006 however in this study during the 65 year period the c n ratios toc contents and tn contents were relatively stable throughout the core except at the depth of 5 cm fig 5 with average values of 11 07 2 48 14 57 0 81 g kg 1 and 1 40 0 32 g kg 1 respectively the toc concentration at the deepest depth 65 year old sediment was only approximately 2 8 lower than that at the top therefore the influence of diagenesis on the downcore organic carbon was not important in this study the annual sedimentation rate of toc and tn showed sharp increases from an average of 0 05 and 0 03 g cm 1 y 1 to an average of 0 15 and 0 10 g cm 1 y 1 respectively after the feilai gorge dam construction project was completed in 1998 the δ13c and δ15n values fluctuated throughout the sediment core fig 5 with averages of 27 88 0 24 and 5 97 1 26 respectively there were significant correlations between the tn contents and the toc contents and c n ratios as shown in table 3 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal variations in n cycle 4 1 1 source shifts between flood and non flood seasons in this study the dn source patterns were different between the two seasons in the flood season the proportions of the three sources were nearly equal fig 3 however the contribution proportions varied greatly in the non flood season with higher sf sources and lower sn sources fig 3 this seasonal source variation was similar to previous findings in other regions such as in the xijiang river li et al 2019a which is near the beijiang river however the results in other rivers such as the beiyun river liu et al 2018 and the qinhuai river xia et al 2017b showed that fertilizer contributed more to the flood season in the beijiang river the contribution of the sn source was approximately 12 higher in the flood season than that in the non flood season which might derive from soil erosion caused by substantial precipitation compared with the sn source the sf source is considered a point source in this study area because the sf source is transported to the river mainly as agricultural drainage fig 3d in addition agricultural drainage plays an important role as a direct n migratory pathway due to the construction of flood control levees and agricultural drainage in the beijiang river basin therefore soil erosion caused by high precipitation and runoff had little effect on the sf source export in the non flood season a higher proportion of the sf source was found which was attributed to a decrease in soil erosion during this period resulting in a decreased contribution from the sn source and an increase in the sf source proportion however a higher proportion of sf does not indicate enhanced fertilizer n exports in the non flood season according to the calculation the flux of no3 n from the sf was 7 58 104 t in the flood season and 6 81 104 t in the non flood season indicating that synthetic fertilizer is also a greater source as a result of runoff in the flood season overall in the flood season intense precipitation and high discharge resulted in non point source pollution being dominated by dn sources such as soil n pennino et al 2016 in contrast point source pollution such as fertilizer manure and sewage had greater contribution during the non flood season li et al 2019a xue et al 2012 in the pom and som pools the soil om source contributed the most organic matter to the river in the flood season while the ed source contributed the most in the non flood season fig 4 the highest proportion of the soil om source during the flood season was mainly affected by substantial precipitation in the subtropical area resulting in serious soil erosion and a high contribution from the soil om to the pom and som in river ecosystem garzon garcia et al 2017 in addition soils from paddy land and eucalyptus forest might be the predominant soil om sources for pom and som during this period which could be supported by the similar δ15n values found among the pom som paddy soils and eucalyptus soils fig s5 however during the non flood season an increase in point sources led to an increase in the contribution from the ed source the proportions of the mp and pp sources were higher in the non flood season than they were in the flood season especially in terms of the pom of the surface river water fig 4 the abundance of aquatic plants especially phytoplankton production 6 increase in the pom and som respectively during the non flood season was related to a longer residence time and an improved light intensity for river water under lower discharge conditions li et al 2017 however during the flood season a high discharge resulted in a shorter residence time weaker incident light and higher turbidity and dilution of nutrient inputs to river water causing a reduction in aquatic plant growth huang et al 2004 lu and gan 2015 furthermore terrestrial sources were the major sources of pom and som in summary high precipitation and soil erosion increased the terrestrial organic inputs of pom and som and low discharge promoted the growth of aquatic plants this result was consistent with the results reported in other watersheds or estuaries e g terrestrial organic matter as the dominant source of the pom pool during storm periods bardhan et al 2015 lu et al 2016 ogrinc et al 2008 4 1 2 n transformation between dn pom and som phases n migration and transformation between the dn pom and som included deposition and resuspension assimilation and nitrification or denitrification which was influenced by the hydrological conditions including discharge and flow rate water temperature redox processes and bacterial populations between the pom and som pools deposition and resuspension occurred differently during the two seasons the δ15n values of the pom and som could efficiently indicate the n sources and estimate the degrees of deposition and re suspension between these two phases in this study there were no significant differences between the δ15n pom and δ15n som values in the non flood season fig 6 suggesting that similar n sources contributed to the pom and som however significant differences were found between the δ15n pom values of surface water and the δ15n som values during the flood season fig 6 these findings indicated that due to lower river discharge the vertical mixing of the water column and the deposition from suspended particles were stronger in the non flood season ye et al 2016 in contrast during the flood season the hydrodynamic conditions characterized by relatively high runoff and flow velocity caused the poor depositional environment of the som further resulting in the separation of terrestrial sources in the som and pom between the dn and pom inorganic n might be transformed into an organic form e g pon by aquatic plants via an assimilation process xu et al 2016 if no3 assimilation was the major process in the aquatic ecosystem the pon of the δ15n values should be less than or equal to the δ15n no3 values becuase light δ14n was preferentially assimilated rather than heavy δ15n however in this study the δ15n pom values were higher than the δ15n no3 values in the flood season fig 6 suggesting that assimilation was weak during this period in contrast in the non flood season there was no significant difference between the δ15n no3 and δ15n pom values fig 6 suggesting that 1 pon might be transported by biological processing e g assimilation and microbial degradation and 2 the source of pon was the same as that of dn the abundance of phytoplankton was the dominant factor controlling the degree of assimilation wang et al 2018 however only approximately 9 of phytoplankton contributed to the pom fig 3 and 0 08 of the no3 n was transformed to the pon through assimilation based on quantitative calculations in the non flood season the similar n value between the dn and pom was likely related to the similar sources thus it was reasonable to infer that the process of transforming n from no3 into organic n was slow and phytoplankton assimilation was weak in the beijiang river nitrification and denitrification are the main processes of inorganic n transformation denk et al 2017 the nitrification process lowered the δ15n values in the generated nitrate denk et al 2017 xu et al 2016 however the denitrification process could induce significant isotope fractionation thus elevating the δ15n no3 values of the residual nitrate as the riverine no3 concentrations decreased bu et al 2017 lee et al 2008 in this study high do concentrations were observed in both the flood and the non flood seasons fig 7 indicating that aerobic conditions were conductive to nitrification however in both seasons the correlations between the no3 n and do concentrations were low and not statistically significant in addition there was no significant negative correlation between the δ15n no3 values and ln no3 p 0 05 fig 7 suggesting that nitrification and denitrification were weak for the dn along the beijiang river and that the variation in δ15n no3 during different seasons might be explained by dilution and the mixing of nitrate sources in the river ogrinc et al 2008 this result was in accordance with the conclusion that in large rivers 5 km2 the signals of nitrification and denitrification are absent or weak battaglin et al 2001 kellman and hillaire marcel 1998 peterson et al 2001 commonly n loss from rivers is thought to be caused by denitrification only in bed sediments indeed xia et al 2017a found evidence for a non negligible n loss in rivers which could be directly caused by coupled nitrification denitrification occurring in bed sediments denitrification should decrease the no3 n concentrations and increase the δ15n no3 values but this signal was not obvious in this study fig 7 we hypothesized that coupled nitrification denitrification occurred in the bed sediments because the decrease in δ15n no3 caused by nitrification could be simultaneously counteracted by the high δ15n no3 influenced by benthic denitrification and its degree would be affected by the flow rate and bacterial population ye et al 2016 clearly future studies on the interaction between the water column and the bed sediments are required to determine the importance of coupled nitrification denitrification and other transformation processes in the river ecosystem 4 2 factors affecting 65 years of c and n changes 4 2 1 runoff in general several climate change impacts such as increasing temperature and extreme precipitation have ramifications regarding the transport processing and deposition of om in river ecosystems houlton et al 2015 liu et al 2017 xia et al 2015 among these impacts flood events are expected to occur more frequently in the beijiang river due to the increasing trends of extreme precipitation wu et al 2014 this increase is because the inputs retention and losses of nutrients are in response to high discharge during flood events in this study the relationships between the average annual discharge and the tn toc and c n ratio were u shapes with a valley value of approximately 1500 m3 s 1 fig 8 in the beijiang river when the annual discharge was greater than 1500 m3 s 1 the hydrological year was considered a wet year according to the pearson type iii curve based on annual discharge values of 65 years however 1500 m3 s 1 was not an exact value rather it should be considered as a range or a representative value used to represent a wet year in this study 1500 m3 s 1 was chosen because it could represent the wet year and it showed regularity in our data when runoff was lower than the threshold value i e 1500 m3 s 1 a negative correlation was observed while a positive correlation was observed when the runoff was greater than 1500 m3 s 1 fig 8 generally high discharge and flow velocity with high hydrodynamic energy are capable of mobilizing and transporting coarser particles leading to sediments with a large proportion of coarse particles toonen et al 2015 as c and n elements are more easily absorbed by fine particles an increased proportion of coarse particles results in a decline of the tn and toc contents in the sediments gao et al 2014 the observed trend below 1500 m3 s 1 agreed with this principle however in this catchment when the average annual discharge was higher than 1500 m3 s 1 the tn and toc contents increased with runoff this trend elucidated the non linear response of soil erosion to precipitation during extreme precipitation more nutrients are transported to the river due to soil erosion consequently the tn and toc contents in the sediment core increase during a high discharge event table 3 shows that the correlations between the isotope compositions δ15n and δ13c of the sediment core and discharge were low and not statistically significant p 0 05 suggesting that the mixing of multiple sources would homogenize the isotope signatures in addition our data showed high δ15n values during flood events such as those in 1968 1982 1994 and 2008 fig 5 with daily maximum discharges of 14 700 14 800 16 400 and 13 100 m3 s 1 respectively several processes could be invoked to explain the observed enrichment in δ15n in the sediments during these flood events firstly the high discharge resulted in the shorter residence time weak incident light and higher turbidity of river water causing a reduction in aquatic plant growth huang et al 2004 lu and gan 2015 and terrestrial sources were the major sources of sediment leading to an increasing trend of δ15n after a flood event secondly an increased amount of manure and sewage with higher δ15n values choi et al 2017 entered the river through extremely high surface runoff which could result in the enrichment of the δ15n values therefore the δ15n value in the sediment core changed significantly after experiencing a flood event indicating that the stable isotope of the sediment core could record historic flood events 4 2 2 temperature and carbon dioxide in addition to runoff the temperature and co2 concentration are other primary controls on the annual dynamics of sedimentary organic matter in river ecosystems increasing temperatures and co2 concentrations can promote the growth of aquatic plants including phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes and change aquatic ecosystems brauer et al 2013 hernández hernández et al 2018 sett et al 2018 in this study temperature had a positive correlation with the toc contents of the sediment core table 3 suggesting that the increasing temperature caused an increase in organic carbon in the beijiang river over the past 65 years in addition the co2 concentration has recently mounted up to a keeling curve of 408 ppm kumar et al 2018 the increasing co2 concentration and temperature promote the growth of aquatic sources as well as assimilation which in turn could lead to a substantial increase in the organic matter of sediments wang et al 2018 xia et al 2015 hence the changes in aquatic plants induced by the temperature and co2 concentration could further control the variation in the sedimentary organic matter the change in organic sources or biogeochemical processes in the river ecosystem could affect the δ13c and δ15n values in the sediment core in general the δ13c of aquatic plants was influenced by 1 the isotopic composition of available c sources in the river 2 the form and concentration of inorganic c and 3 the biochemical pathway of plant photosynthesis phytoplankton preferentially incorporate light 12c over heavy 13c during dissolved inorganic carbon dic uptake however as aquatic plant productivity increases the δ13c value of the remaining dic increases and subsequently produces an increase in the δ13c value of the newly produced organic matter choudhary et al 2009 teranes and bernasconi 2005 moreover sinking organic matter would preferentially remove 12c from the surface water dic pool teranes and bernasconi 2005 thus as aquatic plant productivity increases due to rising temperatures and co2 concentrations hernández hernández et al 2018 the δ13c values of sediments increase in response to eutrophication it is known that the δ15n values of autochthonous sources are influenced by the available n substrates the isotopic fractionation during assimilation and the fractional utilization of din brauer et al 2013 sato et al 2006 in the beijiang river no3 was the dominant form of din which indicated that no3 was the major contributor to the biological n demand a previous study in the pearl river estuary ye et al 2017 reported that no3 assimilation could lead to a general increase in the δ15n of particulate nitrogen moreover the promotion of aquatic plant growth caused by the increase in temperature and co2 concentration could accelerate the rate of no3 assimilation wang et al 2018 resulting in the enrichment of δ15n in the sediment ye et al 2017 however in this study there was no significant positive correlation between the isotopic signature δ13c and δ15n of the sediment and temperature table 3 suggesting that it is difficult to retrieve the influence of increasing temperature and co2 concentrations by using the c and n isotopic signatures recorded in the sediment core in a catchment disturbed by human activities 4 2 3 human activities changes in land cover occurred mainly due to human activities such as agricultural intensification and urbanization lambin et al 2003 the land use changes could influence the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems such as water quality and n loading el khoury et al 2015 lin et al 2015 liu et al 2011 the δ15n values in the sediment core record changes in the allochthonous sources to river ecosystems related to land use variation because sediment has a clear response to land use variation zorzal almeida et al 2018 in this study region the variations in land use were minor during the past 65 years from 1951 to 2015 table 4 suggesting that the allochthonous sources of sediment were similar during these years thus the variation in isotopic signatures in the sediment core was mainly affected by other anthropogenic activities e g dam construction and water management which resulted in changes in hydrological conditions and aquatic environments dam construction represents a key component of disturbance to global rivers by human activity nilsson et al 2005 walling 2006 dam construction could have major ecological and biogeochemical impacts e g om source variation and algal proliferation on river ecosystems chen and jia 2009 kunz et al 2011 in this study the variation in the δ15n values in the sediment core recorded the variations in the origin and biogeochemical processing of n affected by the feilaixia dam during the dam construction period i e from 1994 to 1998 manure and domestic sewage became the dominant sources for river water when the manure is exposed to the atmosphere the ammonia nh3 easily forms and is lost to the atmosphere nh3 volatilization causes a strong δ15n depletion of nh3 leaving the remaining nh4 strongly enriched in δ15n kim et al 2008 widory et al 2005 most of this nh4 is subsequently converted into δ15n enriched no3 δ15n enriched no3 is transformed into an organic form by aquatic plants via an assimilation process leading to an increase in the δ15n value of organic matter in addition several studies have reported high δ15n values in suspended particulates and sediments which could be caused by the strong effect of n sources from sewage di lascio et al 2013 koziorowska et al 2016 morrissey et al 2013 during the sewage treatment process denitrifying bacteria have an enzymatic preference for 14n over 15n which results in enriched δ15n in the remaining n debruyn and rasmussen 2002 the sewage effluent is enriched with δ15n and as are the plants utilizing the n compounds from the sewage therefore during the period of dam construction the increase in manure and sewage caused an increasing trend of the δ15n values in the sediments fig 5 after the reservoir impoundment a decreasing trend in the δ15n value was observed from 1999 to 2005 two reasons might for this decreasing trend of the δ15n values after dam construction are as follows 1 after reservoir impoundment the quality of river water improved with high transparency due to less sewage input which promoted the growth of aquatic plants li et al 2014 organic matter produced by phytoplankton is expected to have depleted δ15n values 5 1 li 2015 compared with that of sewage sources 15 0 6 choi et al 2017 2 inorganic n is transformed into an organic form by aquatic plants via an assimilation process xu et al 2016 when no3 uptake by aquatic plants occurrs the δ15n value of organic matter should be less than or equal to the δ15n no3 value because light δ14n is preferentially assimilated rather than heavy δ15n granger et al 2004 granger et al 2010 after reservoir impoundment strict environmental management decreases the discharge of sewage into the river leading to low δ15n no3 values in the river water then this form is converted into an organic form by aquatic plants resulting in the depleted δ15n of organic matter however an increasing trend of the δ15n values was observed from 2005 to 2011 the δ15n enrichment was caused by the increases in manure and sewage due to the development of the tourism industry during the study period from 2011 to 2015 the δ15n values decreased significantly which was likely related to water management by the government for instance the pollution treatment fund from the government increased from 1700 million rmb in 2011 to nearly 4000 million rmb in 2015 based on the guangdong statistical yearbook the reinforcement of water environmental management by the government reduced the emissions of pollution from sources e g manure and sewage leading to the resuction of the δ15n values in the sediment core overall the variation of n isotopes recorded the effects of human activities on river ecosystems for instance dam construction and government management improved the river water environment reduced the emissions of terrestrial pollution into the river system and promoted the growth of aquatic plants 5 conclusions the sources and transformation of nutrients in river systems are of great significance to water resource management and global c and n cycles our study revealed that the apportionment of n sources varied significantly between seasons soil organic matter was the major source of n in the flood season due to intense precipitation and high discharge but fertilizer which was dominated by nitrate sources and effluent detritus was an important source of pom and som in the non flood season indicating that point sources increased during periods of low discharge the seasonal variation of n isotopes was mainly influenced by physical processes such as dilution and mixing while the signals of assimilation nitrification and denitrification were inconspicuous in this study our data also suggested that low discharge was more favorable for vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation the c and n isotopes in the sediment core could reveal the factors affecting the c and n cycles of river ecosystems under long term changes the results obtained from our study revealed that it is difficult to reflect climate change e g increases in temperature and co2 by the variation in c and n in the sediment core at a 65 year temporal scale however the levels of c and n could reveal the impact of human activities on the c and n cycles of river ecosystems after dam construction the sedimentation amount of toc and tn increased due to changes in fluvial hydrological continuity and aquatic plant growth was promoted due to the higher transparency of river water in addition water environmental management by the government could reduce the emission of terrestrial pollution into river ecosystems as indicated by δ15n the results indicated that the δ15n was more effective than δ13c for source distinction in conclusion this study clarifies the importance of seasonally variable hydrology and long term anthropogenic behaviors regarding the biogeochemistry of c and n and provides a better understanding of the c and n cycles in river ecosystems and a scientific basis for water environmental management declaration

6195,knowledge about the origin and transformation of nutrients at different temporal scales in river ecosystems can provide a better understanding of carbon c and nitrogen n cycles in rivers and bear important implications for regional and global c and n cycling in this study stable isotopes of c and n δ13c and δ15n and a radioactive isotope of 210pb were used to investigate the factors affecting seasonal and long term changes in n source apportionment and c and n biogeochemical processes in the beijiang river located in the pearl river basin china source apportionment by a bayesian model stable isotopic analysis in r siar showed significant seasonal variations during the flood season the dominant origins were non point sources such as soil n for dissolved nitrogen dn accounting for 38 soil organic matter for particulate organic matter pom 58 and sedimentary organic matter som 31 due to intense precipitation during the non flood season fertilizer became the dominant nitrate source 48 and effluent detritus prevailed in the pom 47 and som 32 pools n transformation between the dn pom and som was influenced by seasonally variable hydrology our data suggested that low discharge was more favorable for the vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation which was supported by similar δ15n values in the dn pom and som in the non flood season a sedimentary history record of 65 years 1951 2015 showed that the variation of n in the sediment was mainly affected by human activities from 1999 to 2005 a decreasing trend in the δ15n values was observed due to the promotion of aquatic plant cultivation after reservoir impoundment from 2005 to 2011 the enrichment in the δ15n values was caused by increases in manure and sewage due to the development of the tourism industry from 2011 to 2015 the increase in pollution treatment funds from the government improved the water environment resulting in δ15n depletion in the sediment at the 65 year temporal scale increased temperature and co2 concentration had less impact on the c and n cycles in river ecosystems however high discharge could increase the c and n contents and flood events might increase the δ15n values in the sediment this study provided more detailed information regarding the nutrient sources and improved our understanding of the c and n cycling processes at different temporal scales in river ecosystems keywords nitrogen isotope seasonal variation long term variation human activity 1 introduction a river is a key pathway for the transport of nutrients in both dissolved and particulate forms from the land to the coastal zone and oceans michel 2003 nitrogen n and carbon c loading of aquatic ecosystems is increasing worldwide as a result of climate change and human activities meybeck 1982 peterson et al 2001 seitzinger et al 2005 strokal et al 2015 however less than half of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din is exported from a river to an estuary and the organic matter pools in the ocean have only minor terrestrial signatures benner 2004 peterson et al 2001 this pattern indicates that the complex transformation processes of c and n in river ecosystems have a significant impact on the c and n fluxes thus it is crucial to understand the origins transport and transformation of c and n in both dissolved and solid phases including suspended particulate organic matter pom and sedimentary organic matter som in river ecosystems in the upper stream region of an estuary this information may provide significant insight into the c and n cycles in estuaries and oceans and has important implications for regional and global c and n cycling several c and n origins have been identified for dissolved nitrogen dn pom and som in river ecosystems dn mainly originates from soil nitrogen sn synthetic fertilizers sf and manure and sewage ms xue et al 2009 while pom and som are supplied from soil organic matter soil om and effluent detritus ed in the terrestrial ecosystem and from phytoplankton pp and macrophytes mp in the aquatic ecosystem lu et al 2016 ock and takemon 2014 ogrinc et al 2008 both sources and migration processes are affected by natural factors and human activities and both show variations with different temporal scales two distinct scales can be recognized as seasonal variations and long term variations for the seasonal variations the input of non point sources e g soil increased in the wet season as a result of the intense precipitation li et al 2019a pennino et al 2016 aquatic plant production e g pp and mp is affected by temperature and precipitation lu et al 2016 high temperatures in the wet season promote the growth of aquatic plants while higher turbidity and weaker light caused by high precipitation could decrease the production of aquatic plants yin et al 2000 in addition the seasonal changes in hydrological conditions could also influence the transportation and transformation processes of nutrients between the dissolved phase and solid phase such as the processes of deposition resuspension assimilation and denitrification chen et al 2009 xia et al 2017a ye et al 2017 for long term variations climate change and human activities are deemed the major driving factors of the c and n cycles for instance climate change i e increasing temperature and atmospheric co2 concentrations promotes the growth of aquatic plants such as n2 fixing phytoplankton and algae which influences the c and n behaviors in the aquatic ecosystem komatsu et al 2007 xia et al 2015 land use changes including urbanization and large scale agricultural explorations by human activities are the main factors that alter the riverine n origins fang et al 2010 liu et al 2018 pennino et al 2016 moreover more direct ways such as dam construction in the river could affect the migration and biogeochemical process of nutrients directly or indirectly by influencing relevant processes such as sediment deposition and internal cycling kunz et al 2011 tang et al 2016 walling 2006 the recognition of c and n cycling at different temporal scales is a challenge for river ecosystem studies the stable isotopes δ13c and δ15n technique has been treated as a sophisticated method used to trace multiple sources in aquatic ecosystems as c and n bearing matters maintain the isotope signatures of their sources or alter their isotope signatures in regular ways such as rayleigh fractionation during the transport and transformation processes gao et al 2015 xu et al 2016 xue et al 2009 ye et al 2017 in addition to the stable isotope technique the radioactive isotope technique such as the lead 210 210pb dating technique for sediment has also been widely applied in exploring historical pollution information recorded in sediments appleby 2008 córdoba et al 2016 thus the combination of c n and 210pb isotopes provides more information regarding nutrient sources and improves our understanding of potential c and n cycling processes from the perspective of different temporal scales from both seasonal and long term variations in the aquatic ecosystem numerous studies of c and n cycles were conducted in the pearl river estuary guo et al 2015 lee 2000 miao et al 2016 ye et al 2017 ye et al 2016 ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 however little research has been conducted on the seasonal and long term variations in the c and n cycles in the river of upstream of the estuary in this study the beijiang river which is the second largest tributary of the pearl river and is located upstream of the pearl river estuary was chosen as the study area the objective of this study was to reveal how the nutrient cycles in different phases of the aquatic ecosystem at different temporal scales specifically the study 1 quantifies source apportionment of n during different seasons 2 discusses seasonal variations in the hydrology that alter the source patterns and transformation of n and 3 investigates the factors affecting the long term c and n cycles in the aquatic ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the beijiang river is the second largest tributary of the pearl river and is located in the upper drainage of the pearl river estuary which empties into the south china sea fig 1 the climate is characterized by warm and humid summer monsoon and cool and dry winter monsoon ye et al 2017 the average annual runoff of the beijiang river is 4 288 billion m3 with 70 80 of the flux occurring from april to september li et al 2005 this pattern can be attributed to the fact that more than 70 of the annual precipitation approximately 1800 mm year 1 is concentrated in the wet season april to september and less than 30 is concentrated in the dry season october to february according to the runoff data from 65 years 1951 2015 the flood period is mainly from may to june while the lowest discharge occurs in december to january the beijiang river basin covers a total area of 46 710 km2 and is a typical forestry and agricultural area chen et al 2009 wu et al 2014 the percentages of the amounts of forest and agricultural land within the beijiang river basin are 74 5 and 19 respectively table 4 since the 1970s the agricultural areas have expanded in the beijang river basin strokal et al 2015 intensive agricultural activities have caused soil organic matter loss and n pollution and have subsequently affected the transfer of c and n to the downstream aquatic ecosystems garzon garcia et al 2017 hao et al 2012 the main agricultural crop along the river is rice during the growing season march to july for early rice august to november for late rice chemical fertilizers and manure are frequently used to enhance agricultural productivity the estimated total amount of chemical fertilizers applied in agricultural fields was reported as approximately 1 3 105 t n in 2006 moreover manure has been another significant contributing source of n input due to urbanization since the 1980s and the amount of n input was estimated at approximately 1 2 105 t n in 2006 chen and jia 2009a hence high loads of organic matter and anthropogenic nutrients from fertilizer manure and sewage have profound effects on the sources and cycling of c and n because the primary industry in the beijiang river basin is mining and energy exploitation and the dominant pollutions in the discharge of industrial wastewater are heavy metals li et al 2019b wastewater has little effect on c and n variations in river water or organic matter the feilai gorge dam was constructed in the lower reach of the study area fig 1 for the main purposes of controlling floods and generating electricity it is the largest comprehensive water conservancy project in guangdong province china the construction of the feilai gorge dam began in 1994 and finished in 1998 subsequently the reservoir impoundment began operating in march 1999 2 2 sample collection in this study river water samples were collected at the feilaixia hydrological station on the first day of every month in 2015 to assess the fundamental parameters including the no3 concentration based on the precipitation discharge and nitrate concentration in 2015 fig s1 two sampling campaigns were conducted during the flood season in june 2015 and during the non flood season in december 2015 to reveal the nutrient behaviors between the dissolved and solid phases the water suspended matter and sediments were sampled fig 1 the total number of river water samples and surface sediments were 60 and 16 respectively specifically the surface water sw samples approximately 0 5 m below the surface and bottom water bw samples approximately 1 m above the bottom were collected during each sampling period from 15 sites which included 11 sites in the mainstream and 4 sites in the major tributaries connected to the mainstream in each sample the suspended particulate matter was collected by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters whatman gf f 47 mm in diameter surface sediments on the riverbed were collected from 8 sites along the main channel a sediment core was collected downstream from the b09 sampling point fig 1 this location was chosen because the transverse section in b09 was the widest and largest transverse section with a width of approximately 1440 m and an area of approximately 19 908 m2 along the main stream this hydraulic feature causes the average flow velocity to decrease dramatically and results in sedimentation at this point the sediment core for age dating was taken by a gravity sampler equipped with a polycarbonate cube with an inner diameter of 6 5 cm after sampling the overlying water was siphoned with a tubule and syringe and a stainless tapping pin with a degree scale was used to push the sediment out of the pipe from the bottom to the top of the pipe sediments were subsampled in 1 cm intervals samples of the potential c and n sources were also collected twenty two soil samples were collected from different land use paddy 7 crop 7 vegetable 4 forest 4 sites along the mainstream because these sites represented the primary sources of organic matter the groundwater samples n 10 and drainage water samples n 5 were also collected near the river sampling sites because they represented the major pathways for nutrients to reach the river all water samples were brought back to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until laboratory analysis and all sediment and soil samples were frozen within 24 h 2 3 analysis method field parameters for water samples including temperature t ph dissolved oxygen do and chlorophyll a chl a were measured in situ using portable equipment ysi exo2 multiparameter sondes the nitrate n no3 n and other major ions were analyzed by ion chromatography thermo fisher ics 900 the water samples used to measure the stable isotope composition of δ15n no3 were pretreated according to the agno3 method introduced by silva et al 2000 for the suspended particulate matter the sediment and soil samples total nitrogen tn and total organic carbon toc were analyzed by an elemental analyzer elemental vario macro cube prior to isotopic analysis any possible carbonate sediments and calcareous plankton were removed from the samples taking care not to remove organic c or n yamamuro and kayanne 1995 all c and n stable isotope analysis of solid samples was measured using an elemental analyzer flash ea2000 thermofisher and mass spectrometer delta advantage v thermofisher to determine the stable isotope composition at sunyat sen university china the average analytical error was typically 0 2 for δ15n and 0 1 for δ13c the 210pb and 226ra activities in the sediment core were measured using a high purity germanium detector gwl 120 15 ortec atlanta ga usa data on the monthly temperature and precipitation of the beijiang river basin from 1951 to 2015 were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn data on the daily discharge at two main hydrology stations in the downstream region of the beijiang river from 1951 to 2015 were collected from the pearl river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources http www pearlwater gov cn the land use data were obtained from the resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis 2 4 1 siar mixing model to quantify the contributions of different sources to c and n in the aquatic ecosystem the siar model was used the mixing model can be expressed as follows x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 1 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 i and j 1 2 3 j sjk is the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk is the proportion of source k which needs to be estimated by siar model cjk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with mean λjk and standard deviation τij and εij is the residual error representing the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation σj a detailed description of this model can be found in the literatures jackson et al 2011 parnell et al 2010 semmens et al 2009 to estimate the proportional contribution of no3 sources only one isotope j 1 δ15n no3 and three major potential no3 sources soil nitrogen synthetic fertilizers and manure and sewage were considered in this study the n isotopic signatures of synthetic fertilizer 1 2 0 4 and manure or domestic sewage 15 4 0 6 were obtained from the literature data choi et al 2017 the δ15n value of soil 9 6 2 2 was determined based on 22 soil samples distributed along the river in addition to identify the pom and som sources in different seasons two types of isotopic ratios i e δ15n and δ13c j 2 and four potential sources soil organic matter macrophytes phytoplankton and effluent detritus were considered the isotopic values of the potential sources are presented in table 2 the δ15n and δ13c values of the soil organic matter 9 6 2 2 and 27 6 0 7 were calculated from 22 soil samples in our study area the δ15n and δ13c characteristics of the macrophytes 9 1 1 1 and 29 4 0 5 and phytoplankton 5 1 and 30 0 65 were cited from results obtained in the dongjiang river which is another tributary of the pearl river and has similar climatic and environmental conditions as those of the beijaing river li 2015 the δ15n and δ13c values of the effluent detritus 2 2 1 9 and 24 4 1 4 were obtained from the literature lu et al 2016 the fractionation factors for all sources were set to zero cjk 0 in eq 1 because corresponding experiments for determining enrichment factors were not conducted in this study 2 4 2 statistical analysis all statistical tests were conducted using spss version 22 0 two way anova was used to test the differences in nitrate concentrations δ15n no3 n concentrations δ15n and δ13c values of pom between seasons and between water depths one way anova was used to test the differences in n concentrations δ15n and δ13c values of som between seasons the percentages of different land uses were generated by arcgis 10 2 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial variations in n concentrations and c and n isotopes the statistical characteristics of all parameters are summarized in table 1 during the sampling periods it was found that the dominant form of n in the din was no3 n fig s2 the no3 n concentrations showed significant seasonal variation with higher concentrations in the non flood season and lower concentrations in the flood season p 0 01 and this variation was consistent with that of the monthly data fig s1 no significant difference in the no3 n concentrations was detected for the surface and bottom water p 0 05 the pon concentrations showed significant seasonal and spatial variations with higher concentrations during the flood season and lower concentrations in the surface water p 0 01 the son concentrations did not vary significantly between seasons p 0 05 with an average value of 1 14 0 27 g kg 1 in the flood season and an average value of 1 35 0 56 g kg 1 in the non flood season the statistical characteristics of the δ15n and δ13c values for the dn pom and som by two way anova are summarized in table 1 the δ15n no3 values varied significantly between seasons p 0 01 but not between the surface and bottom water p 0 05 the δ15n no3 values were higher in the flood season than in the non flood season fig 2 c in the flood season the δ15n no3 values fluctuated along the river with higher values in the middle stream sections however in the non flood season the δ15n no3 values decreased along the river fig 2c the average δ15n no3 values of the groundwater and drainage were 12 27 5 04 and 1 5 3 86 respectively in the pom pool the δ15n pom values varied significantly between seasons and spaces p 0 01 and p 0 05 respectively with higher values observed in the flood season and in the surface water fig 2 the δ15n pom values fluctuated along the river during both the flood season and the non flood season in the flood season the δ15n pom values were higher in the middle stream and downstream region however in the non flood season the δ15n pom values were lower in the upper and middle stream sections fig 2a the δ13c pom values varied significantly between seasons p 0 05 but not between the surface and bottom water p 0 05 in contrast for the som pool no significant temporal variation was observed in the δ15n som and δ13c som values p 0 05 for the pom the ranges of the δ15n and δ13c values were from 2 10 to 9 02 and from 27 89 to 25 40 respectively for the som the ranges of the δ15n and δ13c values were from 5 80 to 9 08 and from 27 98 to 24 58 respectively 3 2 source apportionment of dn pom and som according to regional land use and previous studies the major potential dn sources in this study area included sf ms and sn and the potential sources of pom and som included terrestrial sources e g soil om and ed and aquatic sources e g mp and pp the c and n isotopic characteristics of the different sources are summarized in table 2 for the dn the source apportionment pattern showed a significant variation between seasons p 0 01 but no significant variation between the surface and bottom water p 0 05 in the flood season the apportionment of the sf sn and ms sources were similar with averages of 38 33 and 29 respectively in the non flood season the sf source contributed most mean probability estimate mpe 48 the ms source was the second contributor mpe 31 and the sn source contributed the least mpe 21 these source patterns suggested that a large proportion of the dn export was derived from fertilizer n in this agricultural watershed and an increased proportion of the sn source and a decreased proportion of the ms source contributed to the dn during the flood season additionally different sources have various migratory pathways e g groundwater and agricultural drainage to transport nutrients to the river in this study in the groundwater the contribution from the ms source was the highest mep 46 followed by the contribution from the sn source mep 36 and the sf source contributed the least mep 18 fig 3 c in the agricultural drainage the sf source contributed the most mep 63 the ms source contributed the least mep 14 and the sn source contributed an intermediate amount mep 23 fig 3d it was recognized that groundwater was the major pathway for the ms source and agricultural drainage was the predominant pathway for the sf source for the pom in the study area the soil om and ed might make larger contributions than those of the other two potential sources mp and pp to the pom and som fig s4 the siar mixing model outputs of the proportional contributions of the four major potential sources of pom and som are presented in fig 4 and table s1 the source apportionment patterns were significantly different between the two seasons in the pom pool fig 4 the contribution from the soil om source mpe 58 was the highest followed by the contribution from the ed source mpe 27 during the flood season however during the non flood season the proportion of the ed source mpe 47 was the highest followed by the proportions of the soil om mpe 27 and mp sources mpe 18 in the som pool the source patterns were similar to those in the pom pool where the soil om source mpe 31 was the predominant source in the flood season and the ed source mpe 32 contributed the most in the non flood season however the proportion of the mp source was higher for the som than it was for the pom 3 3 the age dating and c and n contents of the sediment core the chronology of the sediment core and the sedimentary rate which were determined by measuring 210pb and 226ra were presented in our previous study li et al 2019b the results showed the sedimentary geochronology of approximately 65 years i e from 1951 to 2015 in the sediment core fig 5 some studies have reported that diagenesis causes an unavoidable loss of organic matter from sediments due to the degradation processes of organic material such as mineralization banner and hanson 1990 gupta and kawahata 2006 however in this study during the 65 year period the c n ratios toc contents and tn contents were relatively stable throughout the core except at the depth of 5 cm fig 5 with average values of 11 07 2 48 14 57 0 81 g kg 1 and 1 40 0 32 g kg 1 respectively the toc concentration at the deepest depth 65 year old sediment was only approximately 2 8 lower than that at the top therefore the influence of diagenesis on the downcore organic carbon was not important in this study the annual sedimentation rate of toc and tn showed sharp increases from an average of 0 05 and 0 03 g cm 1 y 1 to an average of 0 15 and 0 10 g cm 1 y 1 respectively after the feilai gorge dam construction project was completed in 1998 the δ13c and δ15n values fluctuated throughout the sediment core fig 5 with averages of 27 88 0 24 and 5 97 1 26 respectively there were significant correlations between the tn contents and the toc contents and c n ratios as shown in table 3 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal variations in n cycle 4 1 1 source shifts between flood and non flood seasons in this study the dn source patterns were different between the two seasons in the flood season the proportions of the three sources were nearly equal fig 3 however the contribution proportions varied greatly in the non flood season with higher sf sources and lower sn sources fig 3 this seasonal source variation was similar to previous findings in other regions such as in the xijiang river li et al 2019a which is near the beijiang river however the results in other rivers such as the beiyun river liu et al 2018 and the qinhuai river xia et al 2017b showed that fertilizer contributed more to the flood season in the beijiang river the contribution of the sn source was approximately 12 higher in the flood season than that in the non flood season which might derive from soil erosion caused by substantial precipitation compared with the sn source the sf source is considered a point source in this study area because the sf source is transported to the river mainly as agricultural drainage fig 3d in addition agricultural drainage plays an important role as a direct n migratory pathway due to the construction of flood control levees and agricultural drainage in the beijiang river basin therefore soil erosion caused by high precipitation and runoff had little effect on the sf source export in the non flood season a higher proportion of the sf source was found which was attributed to a decrease in soil erosion during this period resulting in a decreased contribution from the sn source and an increase in the sf source proportion however a higher proportion of sf does not indicate enhanced fertilizer n exports in the non flood season according to the calculation the flux of no3 n from the sf was 7 58 104 t in the flood season and 6 81 104 t in the non flood season indicating that synthetic fertilizer is also a greater source as a result of runoff in the flood season overall in the flood season intense precipitation and high discharge resulted in non point source pollution being dominated by dn sources such as soil n pennino et al 2016 in contrast point source pollution such as fertilizer manure and sewage had greater contribution during the non flood season li et al 2019a xue et al 2012 in the pom and som pools the soil om source contributed the most organic matter to the river in the flood season while the ed source contributed the most in the non flood season fig 4 the highest proportion of the soil om source during the flood season was mainly affected by substantial precipitation in the subtropical area resulting in serious soil erosion and a high contribution from the soil om to the pom and som in river ecosystem garzon garcia et al 2017 in addition soils from paddy land and eucalyptus forest might be the predominant soil om sources for pom and som during this period which could be supported by the similar δ15n values found among the pom som paddy soils and eucalyptus soils fig s5 however during the non flood season an increase in point sources led to an increase in the contribution from the ed source the proportions of the mp and pp sources were higher in the non flood season than they were in the flood season especially in terms of the pom of the surface river water fig 4 the abundance of aquatic plants especially phytoplankton production 6 increase in the pom and som respectively during the non flood season was related to a longer residence time and an improved light intensity for river water under lower discharge conditions li et al 2017 however during the flood season a high discharge resulted in a shorter residence time weaker incident light and higher turbidity and dilution of nutrient inputs to river water causing a reduction in aquatic plant growth huang et al 2004 lu and gan 2015 furthermore terrestrial sources were the major sources of pom and som in summary high precipitation and soil erosion increased the terrestrial organic inputs of pom and som and low discharge promoted the growth of aquatic plants this result was consistent with the results reported in other watersheds or estuaries e g terrestrial organic matter as the dominant source of the pom pool during storm periods bardhan et al 2015 lu et al 2016 ogrinc et al 2008 4 1 2 n transformation between dn pom and som phases n migration and transformation between the dn pom and som included deposition and resuspension assimilation and nitrification or denitrification which was influenced by the hydrological conditions including discharge and flow rate water temperature redox processes and bacterial populations between the pom and som pools deposition and resuspension occurred differently during the two seasons the δ15n values of the pom and som could efficiently indicate the n sources and estimate the degrees of deposition and re suspension between these two phases in this study there were no significant differences between the δ15n pom and δ15n som values in the non flood season fig 6 suggesting that similar n sources contributed to the pom and som however significant differences were found between the δ15n pom values of surface water and the δ15n som values during the flood season fig 6 these findings indicated that due to lower river discharge the vertical mixing of the water column and the deposition from suspended particles were stronger in the non flood season ye et al 2016 in contrast during the flood season the hydrodynamic conditions characterized by relatively high runoff and flow velocity caused the poor depositional environment of the som further resulting in the separation of terrestrial sources in the som and pom between the dn and pom inorganic n might be transformed into an organic form e g pon by aquatic plants via an assimilation process xu et al 2016 if no3 assimilation was the major process in the aquatic ecosystem the pon of the δ15n values should be less than or equal to the δ15n no3 values becuase light δ14n was preferentially assimilated rather than heavy δ15n however in this study the δ15n pom values were higher than the δ15n no3 values in the flood season fig 6 suggesting that assimilation was weak during this period in contrast in the non flood season there was no significant difference between the δ15n no3 and δ15n pom values fig 6 suggesting that 1 pon might be transported by biological processing e g assimilation and microbial degradation and 2 the source of pon was the same as that of dn the abundance of phytoplankton was the dominant factor controlling the degree of assimilation wang et al 2018 however only approximately 9 of phytoplankton contributed to the pom fig 3 and 0 08 of the no3 n was transformed to the pon through assimilation based on quantitative calculations in the non flood season the similar n value between the dn and pom was likely related to the similar sources thus it was reasonable to infer that the process of transforming n from no3 into organic n was slow and phytoplankton assimilation was weak in the beijiang river nitrification and denitrification are the main processes of inorganic n transformation denk et al 2017 the nitrification process lowered the δ15n values in the generated nitrate denk et al 2017 xu et al 2016 however the denitrification process could induce significant isotope fractionation thus elevating the δ15n no3 values of the residual nitrate as the riverine no3 concentrations decreased bu et al 2017 lee et al 2008 in this study high do concentrations were observed in both the flood and the non flood seasons fig 7 indicating that aerobic conditions were conductive to nitrification however in both seasons the correlations between the no3 n and do concentrations were low and not statistically significant in addition there was no significant negative correlation between the δ15n no3 values and ln no3 p 0 05 fig 7 suggesting that nitrification and denitrification were weak for the dn along the beijiang river and that the variation in δ15n no3 during different seasons might be explained by dilution and the mixing of nitrate sources in the river ogrinc et al 2008 this result was in accordance with the conclusion that in large rivers 5 km2 the signals of nitrification and denitrification are absent or weak battaglin et al 2001 kellman and hillaire marcel 1998 peterson et al 2001 commonly n loss from rivers is thought to be caused by denitrification only in bed sediments indeed xia et al 2017a found evidence for a non negligible n loss in rivers which could be directly caused by coupled nitrification denitrification occurring in bed sediments denitrification should decrease the no3 n concentrations and increase the δ15n no3 values but this signal was not obvious in this study fig 7 we hypothesized that coupled nitrification denitrification occurred in the bed sediments because the decrease in δ15n no3 caused by nitrification could be simultaneously counteracted by the high δ15n no3 influenced by benthic denitrification and its degree would be affected by the flow rate and bacterial population ye et al 2016 clearly future studies on the interaction between the water column and the bed sediments are required to determine the importance of coupled nitrification denitrification and other transformation processes in the river ecosystem 4 2 factors affecting 65 years of c and n changes 4 2 1 runoff in general several climate change impacts such as increasing temperature and extreme precipitation have ramifications regarding the transport processing and deposition of om in river ecosystems houlton et al 2015 liu et al 2017 xia et al 2015 among these impacts flood events are expected to occur more frequently in the beijiang river due to the increasing trends of extreme precipitation wu et al 2014 this increase is because the inputs retention and losses of nutrients are in response to high discharge during flood events in this study the relationships between the average annual discharge and the tn toc and c n ratio were u shapes with a valley value of approximately 1500 m3 s 1 fig 8 in the beijiang river when the annual discharge was greater than 1500 m3 s 1 the hydrological year was considered a wet year according to the pearson type iii curve based on annual discharge values of 65 years however 1500 m3 s 1 was not an exact value rather it should be considered as a range or a representative value used to represent a wet year in this study 1500 m3 s 1 was chosen because it could represent the wet year and it showed regularity in our data when runoff was lower than the threshold value i e 1500 m3 s 1 a negative correlation was observed while a positive correlation was observed when the runoff was greater than 1500 m3 s 1 fig 8 generally high discharge and flow velocity with high hydrodynamic energy are capable of mobilizing and transporting coarser particles leading to sediments with a large proportion of coarse particles toonen et al 2015 as c and n elements are more easily absorbed by fine particles an increased proportion of coarse particles results in a decline of the tn and toc contents in the sediments gao et al 2014 the observed trend below 1500 m3 s 1 agreed with this principle however in this catchment when the average annual discharge was higher than 1500 m3 s 1 the tn and toc contents increased with runoff this trend elucidated the non linear response of soil erosion to precipitation during extreme precipitation more nutrients are transported to the river due to soil erosion consequently the tn and toc contents in the sediment core increase during a high discharge event table 3 shows that the correlations between the isotope compositions δ15n and δ13c of the sediment core and discharge were low and not statistically significant p 0 05 suggesting that the mixing of multiple sources would homogenize the isotope signatures in addition our data showed high δ15n values during flood events such as those in 1968 1982 1994 and 2008 fig 5 with daily maximum discharges of 14 700 14 800 16 400 and 13 100 m3 s 1 respectively several processes could be invoked to explain the observed enrichment in δ15n in the sediments during these flood events firstly the high discharge resulted in the shorter residence time weak incident light and higher turbidity of river water causing a reduction in aquatic plant growth huang et al 2004 lu and gan 2015 and terrestrial sources were the major sources of sediment leading to an increasing trend of δ15n after a flood event secondly an increased amount of manure and sewage with higher δ15n values choi et al 2017 entered the river through extremely high surface runoff which could result in the enrichment of the δ15n values therefore the δ15n value in the sediment core changed significantly after experiencing a flood event indicating that the stable isotope of the sediment core could record historic flood events 4 2 2 temperature and carbon dioxide in addition to runoff the temperature and co2 concentration are other primary controls on the annual dynamics of sedimentary organic matter in river ecosystems increasing temperatures and co2 concentrations can promote the growth of aquatic plants including phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes and change aquatic ecosystems brauer et al 2013 hernández hernández et al 2018 sett et al 2018 in this study temperature had a positive correlation with the toc contents of the sediment core table 3 suggesting that the increasing temperature caused an increase in organic carbon in the beijiang river over the past 65 years in addition the co2 concentration has recently mounted up to a keeling curve of 408 ppm kumar et al 2018 the increasing co2 concentration and temperature promote the growth of aquatic sources as well as assimilation which in turn could lead to a substantial increase in the organic matter of sediments wang et al 2018 xia et al 2015 hence the changes in aquatic plants induced by the temperature and co2 concentration could further control the variation in the sedimentary organic matter the change in organic sources or biogeochemical processes in the river ecosystem could affect the δ13c and δ15n values in the sediment core in general the δ13c of aquatic plants was influenced by 1 the isotopic composition of available c sources in the river 2 the form and concentration of inorganic c and 3 the biochemical pathway of plant photosynthesis phytoplankton preferentially incorporate light 12c over heavy 13c during dissolved inorganic carbon dic uptake however as aquatic plant productivity increases the δ13c value of the remaining dic increases and subsequently produces an increase in the δ13c value of the newly produced organic matter choudhary et al 2009 teranes and bernasconi 2005 moreover sinking organic matter would preferentially remove 12c from the surface water dic pool teranes and bernasconi 2005 thus as aquatic plant productivity increases due to rising temperatures and co2 concentrations hernández hernández et al 2018 the δ13c values of sediments increase in response to eutrophication it is known that the δ15n values of autochthonous sources are influenced by the available n substrates the isotopic fractionation during assimilation and the fractional utilization of din brauer et al 2013 sato et al 2006 in the beijiang river no3 was the dominant form of din which indicated that no3 was the major contributor to the biological n demand a previous study in the pearl river estuary ye et al 2017 reported that no3 assimilation could lead to a general increase in the δ15n of particulate nitrogen moreover the promotion of aquatic plant growth caused by the increase in temperature and co2 concentration could accelerate the rate of no3 assimilation wang et al 2018 resulting in the enrichment of δ15n in the sediment ye et al 2017 however in this study there was no significant positive correlation between the isotopic signature δ13c and δ15n of the sediment and temperature table 3 suggesting that it is difficult to retrieve the influence of increasing temperature and co2 concentrations by using the c and n isotopic signatures recorded in the sediment core in a catchment disturbed by human activities 4 2 3 human activities changes in land cover occurred mainly due to human activities such as agricultural intensification and urbanization lambin et al 2003 the land use changes could influence the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems such as water quality and n loading el khoury et al 2015 lin et al 2015 liu et al 2011 the δ15n values in the sediment core record changes in the allochthonous sources to river ecosystems related to land use variation because sediment has a clear response to land use variation zorzal almeida et al 2018 in this study region the variations in land use were minor during the past 65 years from 1951 to 2015 table 4 suggesting that the allochthonous sources of sediment were similar during these years thus the variation in isotopic signatures in the sediment core was mainly affected by other anthropogenic activities e g dam construction and water management which resulted in changes in hydrological conditions and aquatic environments dam construction represents a key component of disturbance to global rivers by human activity nilsson et al 2005 walling 2006 dam construction could have major ecological and biogeochemical impacts e g om source variation and algal proliferation on river ecosystems chen and jia 2009 kunz et al 2011 in this study the variation in the δ15n values in the sediment core recorded the variations in the origin and biogeochemical processing of n affected by the feilaixia dam during the dam construction period i e from 1994 to 1998 manure and domestic sewage became the dominant sources for river water when the manure is exposed to the atmosphere the ammonia nh3 easily forms and is lost to the atmosphere nh3 volatilization causes a strong δ15n depletion of nh3 leaving the remaining nh4 strongly enriched in δ15n kim et al 2008 widory et al 2005 most of this nh4 is subsequently converted into δ15n enriched no3 δ15n enriched no3 is transformed into an organic form by aquatic plants via an assimilation process leading to an increase in the δ15n value of organic matter in addition several studies have reported high δ15n values in suspended particulates and sediments which could be caused by the strong effect of n sources from sewage di lascio et al 2013 koziorowska et al 2016 morrissey et al 2013 during the sewage treatment process denitrifying bacteria have an enzymatic preference for 14n over 15n which results in enriched δ15n in the remaining n debruyn and rasmussen 2002 the sewage effluent is enriched with δ15n and as are the plants utilizing the n compounds from the sewage therefore during the period of dam construction the increase in manure and sewage caused an increasing trend of the δ15n values in the sediments fig 5 after the reservoir impoundment a decreasing trend in the δ15n value was observed from 1999 to 2005 two reasons might for this decreasing trend of the δ15n values after dam construction are as follows 1 after reservoir impoundment the quality of river water improved with high transparency due to less sewage input which promoted the growth of aquatic plants li et al 2014 organic matter produced by phytoplankton is expected to have depleted δ15n values 5 1 li 2015 compared with that of sewage sources 15 0 6 choi et al 2017 2 inorganic n is transformed into an organic form by aquatic plants via an assimilation process xu et al 2016 when no3 uptake by aquatic plants occurrs the δ15n value of organic matter should be less than or equal to the δ15n no3 value because light δ14n is preferentially assimilated rather than heavy δ15n granger et al 2004 granger et al 2010 after reservoir impoundment strict environmental management decreases the discharge of sewage into the river leading to low δ15n no3 values in the river water then this form is converted into an organic form by aquatic plants resulting in the depleted δ15n of organic matter however an increasing trend of the δ15n values was observed from 2005 to 2011 the δ15n enrichment was caused by the increases in manure and sewage due to the development of the tourism industry during the study period from 2011 to 2015 the δ15n values decreased significantly which was likely related to water management by the government for instance the pollution treatment fund from the government increased from 1700 million rmb in 2011 to nearly 4000 million rmb in 2015 based on the guangdong statistical yearbook the reinforcement of water environmental management by the government reduced the emissions of pollution from sources e g manure and sewage leading to the resuction of the δ15n values in the sediment core overall the variation of n isotopes recorded the effects of human activities on river ecosystems for instance dam construction and government management improved the river water environment reduced the emissions of terrestrial pollution into the river system and promoted the growth of aquatic plants 5 conclusions the sources and transformation of nutrients in river systems are of great significance to water resource management and global c and n cycles our study revealed that the apportionment of n sources varied significantly between seasons soil organic matter was the major source of n in the flood season due to intense precipitation and high discharge but fertilizer which was dominated by nitrate sources and effluent detritus was an important source of pom and som in the non flood season indicating that point sources increased during periods of low discharge the seasonal variation of n isotopes was mainly influenced by physical processes such as dilution and mixing while the signals of assimilation nitrification and denitrification were inconspicuous in this study our data also suggested that low discharge was more favorable for vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation the c and n isotopes in the sediment core could reveal the factors affecting the c and n cycles of river ecosystems under long term changes the results obtained from our study revealed that it is difficult to reflect climate change e g increases in temperature and co2 by the variation in c and n in the sediment core at a 65 year temporal scale however the levels of c and n could reveal the impact of human activities on the c and n cycles of river ecosystems after dam construction the sedimentation amount of toc and tn increased due to changes in fluvial hydrological continuity and aquatic plant growth was promoted due to the higher transparency of river water in addition water environmental management by the government could reduce the emission of terrestrial pollution into river ecosystems as indicated by δ15n the results indicated that the δ15n was more effective than δ13c for source distinction in conclusion this study clarifies the importance of seasonally variable hydrology and long term anthropogenic behaviors regarding the biogeochemistry of c and n and provides a better understanding of the c and n cycles in river ecosystems and a scientific basis for water environmental management declaration

6196,single well push pull swpp test is one of the most important ways to estimate flow and transport parameters e g porosity dispersivity regional groundwater flow velocity usually the wellbore is surrounded by a finite thickness skin such as a gravel pack the positive skin has a smaller hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer formation zone and the negative skin has a greater one in this study a numerical model of a swpp test considering skin effects was established using the finite element comsol multiphysics program to estimate aquifer parameters several important results were obtained firstly regional groundwater velocity affects the types of breakthrough curves btcs through changing the flow pattern secondly a positive or negative skin leads to a slower or faster tracer transport process and a smaller ratio between the hydraulic conductivity of the skin and that of the aquifer formation zone results in greater solute plume retardation in the skin zone thirdly a larger thickness of the positive skin leads to a higher tracer concentration around the well and the opposite is true if the skin is negative besides the model of leap and kaplan 1988 underestimates the regional groundwater velocity for the second type of btcs and a larger longitudinal dispersivity can lead to a greater error where the second type of btcs has a rising limb at early stage followed by a falling limb at late stage the general conclusion is that the estimations of groundwater velocity from swpp tests are also affected by skin effects keywords push pull tests regional groundwater velocity solute transport skin effect 1 introduction the single well push pull swpp tests have been commonly employed to estimate flow and transport parameters e g regional groundwater flow velocity porosity dispersivity gelhar and collins 1971 hall et al 1991 schroth and istok 2006 the process of this test can be summarized as follows a tracer is injected into a target aquifer injection phase then the mixed solution is pumped out from the same location pumping phase groundwater samples are taken at regular time intervals at the test well in the pumping phase and parameters can be obtained by fitting the observed breakthrough curves btcs using a proper mathematical model conservative or reactive tracers can be utilized depending on the purpose of the test in general conservative tracers have been widely used to estimate regional groundwater flow velocity porosity and dispersivity etc leap and kaplan 1988 haggerty et al 2001 paradis et al 2018 similarly one can obtain the information of sorption cation exchange microbial processes by applying reactive tracers trudell et al 1986 field et al 2000 tong et al 2016 for instance tong et al 2016 used swpp tests to validate the abundant production of hydroxyl radicals due to the oxidization of subsurface sediments to interpret the swpp test results a proper mathematical model considering the fundamental physical and biogeochemical processes of the test is indispensable haggerty et al 2001 kleikemper et al 2002 schroth and istok 2006 from a transport perspective many existing models are governed by the conventional advection dispersion equation ade assuming the validity of fick s law in the swpp tests schroth et al 2001 huang et al 2010 subsequently many analytical and numerical solutions of various single well models have been developed for instance huang et al 2010 obtained an exact analytical solution of swpp test by using fick s law considering a partially penetrating well in the aquifer wang et al 2017 investigated the impacts of transient flow and wellbore storage on swpp test under transient forchheimer flow using a finite difference method besides ade a number of non fickian transport models of swpp tests have also been developed in recent years to recognize the influence of media heterogeneity especially in fractured aquifers chen et al 2017 such models include multi rate mass transfer models haggerty et al 2001 hansen et al 2016 continuous time random walk ctrw le borgne and gouze 2008 and fractional advection dispersion equation fade models benson et al 2004 chen et al 2017 to name a few for instance chen et al 2017 developed a fractional model of multistage swpp test to simulate non fickian behavior for a fractured aquifer hydrogeologists also have paid close attention to the effect of regional groundwater flow on swpp test lessoff and konikow 1997 johnsen and whitson 2009 hansen et al 2017 lessoff and konikow 1997 demonstrated that the non radial flow type which can be caused by the regional groundwater flow can result in a tailing behavior spuriously interpreted to owe to other reasons hansen et al 2017 studied the late time tailing phenomenon in swpp test for heterogeneous velocity fields with the regional groundwater flow using monte carlo simulations as mentioned above swpp test is a powerful tool for aquifer characterization but its application for determining the regional groundwater velocity has rarely been discussed in previous studies the groundwater flow velocity may be measured directly using a two well tracer test conducted under natural gradient condition but this requires a monitoring well that is located directly down gradient at a convenient distance from the test well which is unlikely in most field applications as one may not be aware of the hydraulic gradient and groundwater flow direction before the installation of monitoring wells in fact in most cases the hydraulic gradient is determined using a three well triangle and the groundwater flow velocity including its magnitude and direction may be obtained if the hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity are also known if the hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity are unavailable one may rely on the btcs obtained from such a three well system in a natural gradient tracer test as an alternative to determine the regional flow velocity and longitudinal and transverse dispersivities as well this can be done using the following procedures first the direction of hydraulic gradient can be determined based on the hydraulic head measurements in three monitoring wells and the groundwater flow direction is directly opposite to the hydraulic gradient direction in a horizontally isotropic media which is usually true for most field applications second after determining the direction of groundwater flow one has three more parameters to determine the magnitude of the groundwater flow velocity and longitudinal and transverse dispersivities such three unknown parameters can be obtained using the concentrations measured in above three or more wells by conducting the natural gradient tracer tests rather than the swpp tests pickens et al 1981 michie 1996 zimmermann and huenges 1999 however the natural gradient tracer tests usually take much longer time to complete this is particularly troublesome when the medium is less permeable and the regional groundwater flow velocity is relatively small schubert et al 2011 the natural gradient tracer test method is also very costly to implement in deep aquifers as the installation of multiple wells in deep aquifers can be formidably expensive in contrast the swpp test only needs a single well so that can substantially reduce the cost of test and becomes a nice alternative to determine the regional groundwater flow velocity leap and kaplan 1988 butler et al 2009 to serve such a purpose the swpp test usually consist of three phases tracer injection drift and pumping the drift phase allows the injected tracer to drift with regional groundwater flow thus it is a key phase to estimate regional groundwater flow velocity leap and kaplan 1988 presented an equation for push pull test to determine regional groundwater flow velocity in a confined aquifer assuming that the tracer transport during the push phase was negligible and a series of laboratory tests were conducted to verify the accuracy of the model and they described a velocity shadow that exists for some distance down gradient of the well hall et al 1991 considered that if the tracer was not drifted beyond the velocity shadow before pumping the calculated results of the regional flow velocity would produce a small error compared with the actual value after that monkmeyer and netzer 1993 stated that there was a stagnation point where the groundwater velocity is zero in the pumping phase for the swpp test and they considered that the tracer could be recovered if the tracer was not drifted beyond the stagnation point at the edge of the capture zone recently paradis et al 2018 stated that the transport of tracer during the push phase should not be neglected and has conducted a swpp test in an unconfined aquifer and estimated effective porosity and regional groundwater flow velocity using modified equations of leap and kaplan 1988 in addition the impacts of skin near a pumping well are usually neglected for a swpp test as we know a swpp test is generally conducted at the meter scale meaning that the process of test only affects a small range around the wellbore chen et al 2017 therefore the skin properties skin type and thickness might bring about great errors for the estimation of aquifer parameters and regional groundwater flow velocity during the process of well implementation the intrusion of drilling mud into the aquifer in the vicinity of well is inevitable which can result in the change of the porosity and permeability surrounding the well screen hurst et al 1969 this phenomenon can be regarded as the skin effect chen and chang 2002 wang et al 2012 the thickness of skin usually ranges from a few millimeters to several meters novakowski 1989 the skins can be classified into positive and negative types according to the hydraulic conductivity contrast between the skin and the aquifer formation zone if the hydraulic conductivity of the skin is smaller than that of the aquifer formation zone the skin is defined as a positive one otherwise it is a negative skin park and zhan 2002 yeh et al 2003 wen et al 2011 such a skin regardless of positive or negative will inevitably alter the flow field near the test well thus its effect must be taken into consideration for interpreting the swpp test for instance the streamlines of skin zone can converge toward the well in the case of a negative skin but the opposite is true for a positive skin drost et al 1968 schubert et al 2011 recently huang et al 2019 discussed the effect of skin zone on btcs for radially convergent tracer test rct and the rct is usually conducted for determining aquifer dispersivity using an extraction well and a tracer injection well which is different to swpp test the results showed that the skin zone near the pumping well has significant impacts on btcs for the rct thus the effect of skin zone on radial solute transport should not be ignored in summary the skin effect is a very important issue from the perspective of swpp test interpretation therefore the purpose of this study is to utilize the swpp test method to characterize the magnitude of regional groundwater velocity and dispersivity in a confined aquifer with the considerations of skin effects and other related matters this is done using the following procedures firstly we will employ a numerical model of a three phase swpp test to investigate types of btcs for different regional flow velocities secondly limitations of the model of leap and kaplan 1988 are discussed and we will propose a new approach to estimate the regional groundwater velocity for a certain type of btcs thirdly the effects of skin properties hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the skin on the btcs and the parameter estimation will be investigated to accomplish the objectives we will employ the finite element comsol multiphysics program to numerically simulate the steady state two dimensional 2d horizontal flow with specific attention paid to skin effects 2 mathematical model of the swpp test to illustrate the problem we will use a conservative tracer a confined aquifer is assumed to be unbounded laterally with a uniform regional groundwater flow presented over the entire duration of test the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and horizontally isotropic a fully penetrating well is used so only the horizontal flow is of concern here flow is assumed to be darcian and transport is assumed to be fickian the test well radius rw is assumed to be sufficiently small so that the wellbore storage is not a concern and the mixing effect is also negligible wang et al 2018 the tracer is injected with a constant rate and a constant concentration at the injection phase and is pumped with a constant rate which could be different from the injection rate at the pumping phase after a certain period of drift phase to allow the injected tracer move along with the regional groundwater flow the coordinate system is established as follows with the origin at the center of the test well and the x axis pointing to the direction of regional groundwater flow the confined aquifer consists of two zones in the radial direction the first zone known as the wellbore skin zone is located around the well and has a thickness of rs rw where rs is skin radius the second zone is known as the aquifer formation zone a 2d schematic diagram investigated here is depicted in fig 1 flow of the swpp test is assumed to be steady state and the solute transport is dominated by ade in the two zone system the ade of a conservative solute in the skin zone without source sink can be written as 1 c 1 t x d x x 1 c 1 x d x y 1 c 1 y v x 1 c 1 y d y x 1 c 1 x d y y 1 c 1 y v y 1 c 1 r w r r s t 0 and in the aquifer formation zone as 2 c 2 t x d x x 2 c 2 x d x y 2 c 2 y v x 2 c 2 y d x y 2 c 2 x d y y 2 c 2 y v y 2 c 2 r s r t 0 3 r x 2 y 2 where c 1 and c 2 are solute concentrations in the skin and aquifer formation zones respectively m l3 v x 1 and v x 2 are pore velocities in the x direction in the skin and formation zones respectively l t v x 2 and v y 2 are pore velocities in the y direction in the skin and formation zones respectively l t t is the transport time t r is the radial distance l from the well and x and y are two horizontal coordinates l parallel and perpendicular to the regional groundwater flow direction respectively the hydrodynamic dispersion is a velocity dependent tensor depicted as 4 d x x i α l v x 2 v α t v y 2 v d d i f f 5 d y y i α l v y 2 v α t v x 2 v d d i f f 6 d x y i d y x i α l α t v x v y v 7 v i v xi 2 v yi 2 where i 1 and 2 denote the skin zone and the aquifer formation zone respectively dxxi dxyi and dyyi are components of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor l2 t ddiff is the molecular diffusion coefficient l2 t αl is the longitudinal dispersivity l αt is the transverse dispersivity l and it is much smaller than the longitudinal dispersivity thus one usually assumes αl 10αt guvanasen and guvanasen 1987 chen et al 1999 vi is the total pore water velocity 3 numerical solution of the swpp test in this study a steady state flow model of 2d horizontal plane was developed based on comsol multiphysics as shown in fig 1 the model region was set to be 40 m 40 m and the well has a radius of 0 1 m in addition the aquifer thickness b 10 m the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is k 8 0 m d and the effective porosity of the aquifer θ 0 3 which is assumed to be the same as the total porosity of the aquifer when all the pore spaces are well connected with negligible immobile porosity porosity is according to fig 1 the boundary conditions for the domain of concern can be expressed as 8 h x y s 1 h 1 h x y s 2 h 2 9 k h n s 3 0 k h n s 4 0 10 v x k j θ v d θ where s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 are the boundaries of the model s 1 and s 2 are constant head boundaries with prescribed total heads of h 1 and h 2 respectively both s 3 and s 4 are no flux boundaries n is the normal vector of the boundary an outward pointing vector perpendicular to the boundary vx is the pore flow velocity of regional groundwater l t vd is the darcy velocity of regional groundwater l t j is the hydraulic gradient of regional flow in the aquifer l l a constant regional flow field can be generated and one can obtain different values of vx by changing the head differences between h 1 and h 2 in this model constant head boundaries were prescribed and the value of h 2 was set as 15 m according to eq 10 one can obtain different values of vx by changing the value of h 1 in the model a continuous mass flux of injection or pumping rate was assigned at r rw which can be expressed as 11 n 0 q ρ 2 π r w b where n 0 is the mass flux per unit thickness m l2 t q is the injection or pumping rate l3 t which is positive for the injection and negative for pumping and q is 0 in the drift phase ρ is the density of groundwater m l3 a uniform skin near the well was considered in a confined aquifer and the well skin thickness of rs rw was assumed to be constant in this model the hydraulic conductivity of skin was set to be ks the default values of the parameters were shown in table 1 for the solute transport model the initial condition in both skin and aquifer formation zones are 12 c 1 r 0 c 2 r 0 0 r r w in the injection phase the boundary condition at r r w can be described as 13 c 1 r t c 0 r r w 0 t t inj where c 0 represents the concentration of the injection phase m l3 tinj is the duration of the injection phase t the third type boundary condition may also be used to replace the first type boundary condition of eq 13 however our numerical exercises indicate that both conditions yield nearly the same results except for a very short period of time since the start of injection therefore without loss of generality we use the first type boundary condition here as an example to illustrate the methodology in the pumping phase the time dependent concentration is measured in the borehole the main target of the test is to obtain several parameters by fitting the observed btcs with corresponding theoretical btcs obtained from a proper analytical or numerical solution when solute transport through well screen the boundary condition at the well screen is wang et al 2017 14 d x x 1 c 1 x d y y 1 c 1 y d x y 1 c 1 y d y x 1 c 1 x 0 w i t h x 2 y 2 r w because the values of velocity and concentration are different around the perimeter of the borehole it is necessary to integrate the concentration around the borehole with the velocity as the weight to obtain the accurate value of concentration at the well thus the flux averaged concentrations can be expressed as 15 c pump l w v w c w l w v w r r w t drift t t pump where vw represents the velocity around the borehole in the pumping phase l t cw represents the concentration around the well perimeter m l3 c pump is the concentration inside the wellbore m l3 lw is the perimeter of the wellbore l the swpp test was divided into three phases the simulation results at the end of each phase including the hydraulic head and the solute concentration were set to be the initial values for the simulation in the next phase the model domain was discretized into 21 688 elements and the mesh size was progressively refined near the well and the well perimeter was discretized into 28 elements when the number of element is doubled the peak solute concentration for the pumping phase varied about 0 17 therefore the selected mesh is regarded as sufficiently fine for the problem investigated here to check the accuracy of the numerical model further the numerical solution for a special case without skin was used to compare with the analytical solution of huang et al 2010 who investigated a steady state flow swpp model with injection and extraction phases without the regional groundwater flow as shown in fig 2 the simulated time span of tracer injection and pumping were 0 5 day and 1 day respectively the other parameters were given as qinj 50 m3 d qpunp 50 m3 d b 10 m αl 0 1 m 0 5 m 1 m and θ 0 3 c 0 at r rw was set as 1 0 mol m3 the results showed that our numerical solution agreed perfectly with the analytical solution for the following analysis the values of the parameters are listed in table 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 types of btcs for different regional groundwater darcy velocity the main target of this swpp test is to estimate the unknown regional groundwater velocity in order to interpret the btcs a parametric study over a wide range of regional groundwater velocities was conducted fig 3 shows the btcs for the pumping phase with different regional groundwater velocities for the convenience of the numerical modeling we used darcy flow velocity vd to discuss the impacts of the regional groundwater velocity vx on the btcs and vd was given as 1 10 7 m s 4 10 6 m s 8 10 6 m s 1 2 10 6 m s 1 5 10 6m s 1 8 10 6 m s 2 2 10 6 m s and 2 5 10 6 besides αl 0 02 m θ 0 3 qinj 30 m3 d qpump 15 m3 d and the other parameters are the same as those used in table 1 one can see that regional groundwater darcy velocities have great impacts on btcs and the btcs can be identified as two main types as shown in fig 3 the first type of btcs shows a monotonically decreasing trend with time due to relatively low regional flow darcy velocities less than 1 2 10 6 m s as seen in fig 3a for this type of btcs an inverse correlation between the tracer concentration and the regional groundwater darcy velocity is evident as a higher regional darcy velocity leading to a smaller tracer concentration at early stage see fig 3a additionally it is notable that a higher regional groundwater darcy velocity will result in a longer tailing for this type of btcs the second type of btcs has a rising limb at early stage followed by a falling limb at late stage because of relatively high regional darcy velocities 1 5 10 6 m s as shown in fig 3b it is apparent that the time ta to reach the peak value increases with increase of the regional groundwater darcy velocity for this case while the concentration of peak value decreases with the increase of the regional groundwater darcy velocity in order to interpret this behavior explicitly the concentration distributions in a 2d horizontal plane at tpump 0 hr with different regional groundwater darcy velocities are shown in fig 4 in the pumping phase one can see that there is a stagnation point sp which has zero groundwater velocity v 2 and is located at the dividing streamline ds enveloping the capture zone as shown in fig 4 the ds divides the flow into the capture zone and the non capture zone while the sp represents the frontier of the capture zone around the pumping well if the tracer does not drift beyond the stagnation point of the capture zone in the drift phase it can be extracted from the aquifer therefore different convergence situations of tracer due to variable regional groundwater darcy velocities result in a series of btc types one can see that a certain amount of tracer mass may be retained near the symmetry axis x axis and around the well when the regional groundwater darcy velocity is relatively low such as vd 8 10 7 m s and 1 2 10 6 m s as shown in fig 4a b resulting in relatively high concentrations for the first type of btcs in the wellbore at early stage on the contrary a higher regional groundwater darcy velocity leads to a faster tracer transport process causing the tracer mass drifting away from the well as shown in fig 4c d resulting in relatively low concentrations and an increase of concentration inside the wellbore at early stage for the second type of btcs as shown in fig 3b besides one can also see that a higher regional groundwater darcy velocity leads to a smaller distance from sp to well resulting in a smaller recovery ratio of tracer mass in the pumping phase the opposite is true for the case of a lower regional groundwater darcy velocity for instance the tracer mass on the left side of the dividing streamline can be extracted by lower velocities such as vd 8 10 7 m s and 1 2 10 6 m s as shown in fig 4a b but very limited tracer can be captured with larger velocities like vd 2 5 10 6 m s resulting in lower concentration values of btcs in fig 3b 4 2 methods for estimating the regional groundwater velocity for the above second type of btcs leap and kaplan 1988 presented a simplified equation to estimate the regional velocity using a swpp test approximately and the displacement of the center of mass of a non reactive tracer during a swpp test was analytically attributed to several terms as follows 16 v a t drift v a t a q pump π θ b 1 2 t a 1 2 0 thus 17 v a q pump t a π θ b 1 2 t a t drift where qpump is the pumping rate in the pumping phase l3 t ta is the time elapsed from the start of pumping until the center of mass of tracer is recovered t tdrift is the time elapsed in the drift phase t va is average pore velocity of regional groundwater flow eq 17 was derived considering a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer with steady state horizontal advective transport with a constant hydraulic gradient the regional groundwater velocity is regarded as negligible in the injection phase and the dispersion is not considered for this model leap and kaplan 1988 according to eq 17 the groundwater velocity can be computed when the btcs has a peak value for a swpp test in which ta corresponds to the time of reaching the peak value according to fig 3b and eq 17 the regional groundwater velocities can be estimated and the results are shown in table 2 we also define a parameter of relative errors e va v a v x v x to reflect the difference of the calculated values and the real values where vx is the regional groundwater pore velocity based on eq 10 it is noteworthy that the calculated values are smaller than the real values a primary reason is that the peak time is not always corresponding to the center of the mass particularly when the peclet number is relatively small less than 10 and the peak time is somewhat less than the advective time due to the dispersive effect liang et al 2018 for example the dispersion can result in the change of the peak time as shown in fig 5 the parameters are given as vx 6 67 10 6 m s tinj 1 hr tdrift 36 hr tpump 36 hr qinj 30 m3 d qpump 15 m3 d and αl 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m it is obvious that αl has significant impacts on the shape of btcs and a larger αl leads to a smaller peak time the second type of btcs even transforms into the first type when αl 0 1 m resulting in failing to compute the regional groundwater velocity based on eq 17 as shown in fig 5 we have calculated the regional groundwater velocity using the method of leap and kaplan 1988 and the calculated regional groundwater velocities va are 4 63 10 6 m s and 2 83 10 6 m s for αl 0 01 m and 0 05 m respectively which are smaller than the true regional groundwater velocity 6 67 10 6 m s it can be found that a larger dispersion can result in a larger error to estimate the regional groundwater velocity therefore the approach of leap and kaplan 1988 is unreliable to estimate the regional groundwater velocity for a large longitudinal dispersivity in addition it can also be found that a higher actual regional groundwater velocity results a smaller eva except for the case of vx 8 33 10 6 m s in table 2 this means that a higher actual regional groundwater velocity can lead to a smaller error based on eq 17 however for the case of vx 8 33 10 6 m s it can be found that eva increases to 0 44 which can be explained in fig 4d because the tracer drifts beyond the stagnation point of the capture zone in the drift phase thus the tracer of the center of mass cannot be extracted from the aquifer in fig 4d resulting in a large error the phenomenon was also explained in the study of hall et al 1991 who considered that the tracer drifted beyond the velocity shadow i e capture zone before pumping resulting in that the calculated regional groundwater velocity was as much as 30 below the actual value for the case of a relatively low regional groundwater velocity such as vx 6 00 10 6 m s it can be found that the tracer mass is in the capture zone as shown in fig 4c therefore although a relatively high regional groundwater velocity results in a small error an extremely high or low regional groundwater velocity can result a large error another factor contributing to computational error is the assumption of the method of leap and kaplan 1988 i e the regional groundwater velocity is negligible in the injection phase which is not true when the injection rate is not sufficiently large and or the injection time is not sufficiently short paradis et al 2018 as mentioned above the regional groundwater velocity can be computed approximately for the second type of btcs based on eq 17 however btcs may transform from the second type to the first type if the regional groundwater velocity declines this is because a certain amount of tracer mass may be retained near the symmetry axis x axis for relatively low regional groundwater velocity such as vd 8 10 7 m s and 1 2 10 6 m s as shown in fig 4a b in addition a large longitudinal dispersivity can also lead to the form of the first type of btcs thus the regional groundwater velocity cannot be obtained based on eq 17 for such a case if the first type btcs are presented a reasonable approach is to fit btcs using the numerical model of this study for parameter estimation furthermore since swpp tests are usually conducted at the meter scale meaning that only a small volume around the wellbore can be affected by the injection phase chen et al 2017 hence the effects of well skin on btcs in the swpp test are of concern and should be investigated this is the task of the following section 4 3 the effects of skin hydraulic conductivity on btcs in the swpp test as mentioned above the well skin includes two general types i e a positive skin and a negative skin prescribing the hydraulic conductivities of skin and aquifer or aquifer formation zone as ks and k respectively one can use a new parameter δ ks k to reflect the skin impact where δ is a parameter reflecting the type of the skin and called the skin index hereinafter specifically δ 1 represents a positive skin while δ 1 represents a negative skin note that the case of δ 1 represents the case without a skin in this section we will provide a detailed analysis on the impact of the skin hydraulic conductivity on swpp test fig 6 shows the effect of skin indexes on btcs in the pumping phase the parameters are given as vx 6 67 10 6 m s qinj 30 m3 d qpump 15 m3 d αl 0 02 m rs 0 5 m and δ 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 and 1 5 the results indicate that the concentration gets higher at early stage of pumping when the skin index is lower and a smaller skin index results in a smaller ta as shown in fig 6 this may be explained as follows a skin with a lower δ value or a lower permeability value in respect to that of the formation essentially serves as a somewhat shield around the test well that can make the spreading of the tracer mass out of the test well more difficult in the injection phase consequently more tracer mass will be retained near the test well residing either in the skin or near the skin therefore in the pumping phase of the test more tracer mass can be extracted at the early stage of the pumping phase leading to higher concentrations at that stage especially for δ 0 5 the second type of btcs transforms into the first type the facts are the opposite for a larger δ value this is because a negative skin δ 1 is somewhat like a high conductance zone rather than a shield and can facilitate the spreading of tracer mass away from the test well in the injection phase therefore less tracer mass will be retained near the test well in the case of a higher skin index and lower concentrations will be seen at the early stage of pumping in the wellbore hence the existence of skin will result in an error to estimate the regional groundwater velocity to further explicitly interpret this behavior the concentration distributions in a 2d horizontal plane at tpump 0 hr with different δ values are shown in fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 a lower δ value or a lower skin hydraulic conductivity leads to more tracer accumulation in the skin zone after the drift phase on the contrary it is quite obvious to see that a larger δ value or a larger skin hydraulic conductivity leads to a lower tracer concentration in the skin zone at the early stage of the pumping phase for instance we can see that the tracer accumulation in the skin zone in the cases of δ 1 5 is clearly less than that in the cases of δ 0 5 and 0 75 fig 8 displays the curves of concentration versus distance at tpump 0 hr with δ 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 and 1 5 respectively we can see that the concentration gets higher in the skin zone when the skin index δ is lower as shown in fig 8 the results indicate that a lower skin hydraulic conductivity leads to more tracer accumulation in the skin zone after the drift phase the opposite is true if the skin index δ is larger in addition we can see that the peak concentration of solute appears at the location closer to the test well with a lower δ value resulting in the higher concentration at early stage of pumping as shown in fig 6 therefore different skin indices will lead to different concentration curves versus distance in the aquifer system 4 4 effects of skin thickness on btcs in the swpp test in this section we will analyze the impacts of the skin thickness on btcs the parameters are given as vx 6 67 10 6 m s tinj 1 hr tdrift 36 hr tpump 36 hr qinj 30 m3 d qpump 15 m3 d δ 0 625 positive skin δ 1 5 negative skin αl 0 02 m and rs 0 0 2 and 0 5 m in the case of δ 0 625 positive skin one can see that the concentration gets higher at early stage with the increase of rs and the values of ta gradually decrease in fig 9 the explanation is similar to that for fig 6 as a thicker positive skin means a thicker shield surrounding the test well preventing the injected tracer mass from spreading further away from the test well thus leading to higher concentrations at the early stage of the extraction phase while for the case of δ 1 5 negative skin it can be found that the concentration shows a decreasing trend at early stage with the increase of rs and the values of ta gradually increase as a thicker negative skin means a thicker high conductance zone surrounding the test well which will facilitate the injected tracer mass to spread further away from the test well to further explicitly interpret this behavior the concentration distributions in a 2d horizontal plane at tpump 0 hr with different positive or negative skin thickness are shown in fig 10 it is evident that a larger positive skin thickness leads to more tracer accumulation in the skin zone after the drift phase while in the case of a negative skin one can see that a greater portion of tracer mass migrate away from the test well after the cease of injection with a greater value of rs in fig 10 for instance one can see that the greater tracer accumulation in the skin zone in the case of rs 0 5 and δ 1 5 is clearly less than that in the case of rs 0 5 and δ 0 625 4 5 parameter estimations above sections 4 3 and 4 4 have demonstrated the skin effects on the dada interpretation of btcs with respect to practical application hydrogeologists are concerned about the parameter estimation accuracy on the basis of swpp models nevertheless the skin effect is inevitable therefore we will analyze how the skin affects the estimation of aquifer properties such as dispersivity and regional groundwater flow velocity in the following section in which we consider the model without skin effect as a reference of comparison an interesting question to ask is that what happens if one employs the non skin swpp model to interpret the btcs obtained from the model with a skin in another word how different are the parameters e g dispersivity and regional groundwater velocity estimated by the non skin swpp model from their actual values based on the swpp model with a skin if the differences between the estimated and actual parameter values are non negligible one has to take the skin effect into consideration in a swpp test model for parameter estimation fig 11 shows btcs at the well fitted by the a non skin model for different skin types the actual parameters used in the swpp model with skins are set as vx 1 10 5 m s tinj 1 hr tdrift 36 hr tpump 36 hr qinj 30 m3 d qext 15 m3 d δ 0 5 positive skin δ 1 5 negative skin αl 0 1 m θ 0 3 and rs 0 5 m the circle lines are created by the numerical solution of the swpp test with skins the dashed lines are created by the non skin swpp test model using a trial and error method we find that the fitness is good for the positive and negative skins as shown in fig 11 table 3 shows the parameter estimated by the non skin model one can see that in the case of a positive skin the groundwater flow velocities estimated using a non skin model is smaller than the real value and the longitudinal dispersivity is larger than the real value in addition in the case of a negative skin the groundwater flow velocity is overestimated and longitudinal dispersivity estimated is 0 66 times smaller than the real value in summary the parameters estimated by the non skin model are considerably different from their real values resulting in nonnegligible errors in parameter estimation if the non skin model is mistakenly used when a skin actually presents 5 summary and conclusions the swpp test has been used to determine regional groundwater velocity due to advantages that the swpp test is relatively easy to perform less expensive and more efficient than the well to well test however in many previous studies the models of the swpp tests neglect dispersive effect and skin effect thus may result in poor performance for parameter estimation in this study a numerical model for a swpp test with the presence of a regional groundwater flow field was investigated considering both the positive and negative skin effects there is a strong interaction between the uniform regional groundwater flow and the radial wellflow and different regional groundwater velocities can lead to various types of btcs in the pumping phase the effects of both the hydraulic conductivities and thickness of the skin zone on btcs have been considered the following conclusions can be drawn 1 regional groundwater velocity has a significant effect on the shape of btcs a lower regional groundwater velocity means that more tracer can be accumulated near the symmetry plane around the well resulting in formation of the first type of btcs which include falling limbs only in the pumping phase the opposite is true in a case of a higher regional flow velocity resulting in formation of the second type of btcs which include rising limbs followed by falling limbs in addition the pattern and location of the dividing streamline determine the quantity of tracer mass extracted in the pumping phase 2 the model of leap and kaplan 1988 underestimates the regional groundwater velocity for the second type of btcs and the main error of parameter estimates is that the peak time is not always corresponding to the center of mass which is a key assumption used for the method a larger longitudinal dispersivity leads to a smaller peak time resulting in a larger error and an extremely high or low regional groundwater velocity can also result in poor performance for parameter estimation in addition the method is not appropriate for the first type of btcs 3 in the pumping phase a lager hydraulic conductivity of skin results in a lower concentration at the early stage on the contrary a smaller hydraulic conductivity of skin leads to a higher concentration in addition a lager thickness of a positive skin strengthens the influence of skin causing a higher concentration at the early pumping stage and the opposite is true in the case of a negative skin 4 a smaller hydraulic conductivity of skin means that solute plume can accumulate more in the skin zone in the drift phase otherwise a larger hydraulic conductivity of skin results in a solute plume drifting further away from the skin zone therefore skin properties skin types and thickness will result in different shapes of btcs 5 the non skin swpp test model is used to interpret btcs obtained from the model with skins and the estimated parameters are very different from their actual values resulting in larger errors in parameter estimation if the non skin model is mistakenly used with the existence of skins the general conclusion is that the possible impacts of different skin types on swpp tests are significant and should be taken into consideration declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 41772259

6196,single well push pull swpp test is one of the most important ways to estimate flow and transport parameters e g porosity dispersivity regional groundwater flow velocity usually the wellbore is surrounded by a finite thickness skin such as a gravel pack the positive skin has a smaller hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer formation zone and the negative skin has a greater one in this study a numerical model of a swpp test considering skin effects was established using the finite element comsol multiphysics program to estimate aquifer parameters several important results were obtained firstly regional groundwater velocity affects the types of breakthrough curves btcs through changing the flow pattern secondly a positive or negative skin leads to a slower or faster tracer transport process and a smaller ratio between the hydraulic conductivity of the skin and that of the aquifer formation zone results in greater solute plume retardation in the skin zone thirdly a larger thickness of the positive skin leads to a higher tracer concentration around the well and the opposite is true if the skin is negative besides the model of leap and kaplan 1988 underestimates the regional groundwater velocity for the second type of btcs and a larger longitudinal dispersivity can lead to a greater error where the second type of btcs has a rising limb at early stage followed by a falling limb at late stage the general conclusion is that the estimations of groundwater velocity from swpp tests are also affected by skin effects keywords push pull tests regional groundwater velocity solute transport skin effect 1 introduction the single well push pull swpp tests have been commonly employed to estimate flow and transport parameters e g regional groundwater flow velocity porosity dispersivity gelhar and collins 1971 hall et al 1991 schroth and istok 2006 the process of this test can be summarized as follows a tracer is injected into a target aquifer injection phase then the mixed solution is pumped out from the same location pumping phase groundwater samples are taken at regular time intervals at the test well in the pumping phase and parameters can be obtained by fitting the observed breakthrough curves btcs using a proper mathematical model conservative or reactive tracers can be utilized depending on the purpose of the test in general conservative tracers have been widely used to estimate regional groundwater flow velocity porosity and dispersivity etc leap and kaplan 1988 haggerty et al 2001 paradis et al 2018 similarly one can obtain the information of sorption cation exchange microbial processes by applying reactive tracers trudell et al 1986 field et al 2000 tong et al 2016 for instance tong et al 2016 used swpp tests to validate the abundant production of hydroxyl radicals due to the oxidization of subsurface sediments to interpret the swpp test results a proper mathematical model considering the fundamental physical and biogeochemical processes of the test is indispensable haggerty et al 2001 kleikemper et al 2002 schroth and istok 2006 from a transport perspective many existing models are governed by the conventional advection dispersion equation ade assuming the validity of fick s law in the swpp tests schroth et al 2001 huang et al 2010 subsequently many analytical and numerical solutions of various single well models have been developed for instance huang et al 2010 obtained an exact analytical solution of swpp test by using fick s law considering a partially penetrating well in the aquifer wang et al 2017 investigated the impacts of transient flow and wellbore storage on swpp test under transient forchheimer flow using a finite difference method besides ade a number of non fickian transport models of swpp tests have also been developed in recent years to recognize the influence of media heterogeneity especially in fractured aquifers chen et al 2017 such models include multi rate mass transfer models haggerty et al 2001 hansen et al 2016 continuous time random walk ctrw le borgne and gouze 2008 and fractional advection dispersion equation fade models benson et al 2004 chen et al 2017 to name a few for instance chen et al 2017 developed a fractional model of multistage swpp test to simulate non fickian behavior for a fractured aquifer hydrogeologists also have paid close attention to the effect of regional groundwater flow on swpp test lessoff and konikow 1997 johnsen and whitson 2009 hansen et al 2017 lessoff and konikow 1997 demonstrated that the non radial flow type which can be caused by the regional groundwater flow can result in a tailing behavior spuriously interpreted to owe to other reasons hansen et al 2017 studied the late time tailing phenomenon in swpp test for heterogeneous velocity fields with the regional groundwater flow using monte carlo simulations as mentioned above swpp test is a powerful tool for aquifer characterization but its application for determining the regional groundwater velocity has rarely been discussed in previous studies the groundwater flow velocity may be measured directly using a two well tracer test conducted under natural gradient condition but this requires a monitoring well that is located directly down gradient at a convenient distance from the test well which is unlikely in most field applications as one may not be aware of the hydraulic gradient and groundwater flow direction before the installation of monitoring wells in fact in most cases the hydraulic gradient is determined using a three well triangle and the groundwater flow velocity including its magnitude and direction may be obtained if the hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity are also known if the hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity are unavailable one may rely on the btcs obtained from such a three well system in a natural gradient tracer test as an alternative to determine the regional flow velocity and longitudinal and transverse dispersivities as well this can be done using the following procedures first the direction of hydraulic gradient can be determined based on the hydraulic head measurements in three monitoring wells and the groundwater flow direction is directly opposite to the hydraulic gradient direction in a horizontally isotropic media which is usually true for most field applications second after determining the direction of groundwater flow one has three more parameters to determine the magnitude of the groundwater flow velocity and longitudinal and transverse dispersivities such three unknown parameters can be obtained using the concentrations measured in above three or more wells by conducting the natural gradient tracer tests rather than the swpp tests pickens et al 1981 michie 1996 zimmermann and huenges 1999 however the natural gradient tracer tests usually take much longer time to complete this is particularly troublesome when the medium is less permeable and the regional groundwater flow velocity is relatively small schubert et al 2011 the natural gradient tracer test method is also very costly to implement in deep aquifers as the installation of multiple wells in deep aquifers can be formidably expensive in contrast the swpp test only needs a single well so that can substantially reduce the cost of test and becomes a nice alternative to determine the regional groundwater flow velocity leap and kaplan 1988 butler et al 2009 to serve such a purpose the swpp test usually consist of three phases tracer injection drift and pumping the drift phase allows the injected tracer to drift with regional groundwater flow thus it is a key phase to estimate regional groundwater flow velocity leap and kaplan 1988 presented an equation for push pull test to determine regional groundwater flow velocity in a confined aquifer assuming that the tracer transport during the push phase was negligible and a series of laboratory tests were conducted to verify the accuracy of the model and they described a velocity shadow that exists for some distance down gradient of the well hall et al 1991 considered that if the tracer was not drifted beyond the velocity shadow before pumping the calculated results of the regional flow velocity would produce a small error compared with the actual value after that monkmeyer and netzer 1993 stated that there was a stagnation point where the groundwater velocity is zero in the pumping phase for the swpp test and they considered that the tracer could be recovered if the tracer was not drifted beyond the stagnation point at the edge of the capture zone recently paradis et al 2018 stated that the transport of tracer during the push phase should not be neglected and has conducted a swpp test in an unconfined aquifer and estimated effective porosity and regional groundwater flow velocity using modified equations of leap and kaplan 1988 in addition the impacts of skin near a pumping well are usually neglected for a swpp test as we know a swpp test is generally conducted at the meter scale meaning that the process of test only affects a small range around the wellbore chen et al 2017 therefore the skin properties skin type and thickness might bring about great errors for the estimation of aquifer parameters and regional groundwater flow velocity during the process of well implementation the intrusion of drilling mud into the aquifer in the vicinity of well is inevitable which can result in the change of the porosity and permeability surrounding the well screen hurst et al 1969 this phenomenon can be regarded as the skin effect chen and chang 2002 wang et al 2012 the thickness of skin usually ranges from a few millimeters to several meters novakowski 1989 the skins can be classified into positive and negative types according to the hydraulic conductivity contrast between the skin and the aquifer formation zone if the hydraulic conductivity of the skin is smaller than that of the aquifer formation zone the skin is defined as a positive one otherwise it is a negative skin park and zhan 2002 yeh et al 2003 wen et al 2011 such a skin regardless of positive or negative will inevitably alter the flow field near the test well thus its effect must be taken into consideration for interpreting the swpp test for instance the streamlines of skin zone can converge toward the well in the case of a negative skin but the opposite is true for a positive skin drost et al 1968 schubert et al 2011 recently huang et al 2019 discussed the effect of skin zone on btcs for radially convergent tracer test rct and the rct is usually conducted for determining aquifer dispersivity using an extraction well and a tracer injection well which is different to swpp test the results showed that the skin zone near the pumping well has significant impacts on btcs for the rct thus the effect of skin zone on radial solute transport should not be ignored in summary the skin effect is a very important issue from the perspective of swpp test interpretation therefore the purpose of this study is to utilize the swpp test method to characterize the magnitude of regional groundwater velocity and dispersivity in a confined aquifer with the considerations of skin effects and other related matters this is done using the following procedures firstly we will employ a numerical model of a three phase swpp test to investigate types of btcs for different regional flow velocities secondly limitations of the model of leap and kaplan 1988 are discussed and we will propose a new approach to estimate the regional groundwater velocity for a certain type of btcs thirdly the effects of skin properties hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the skin on the btcs and the parameter estimation will be investigated to accomplish the objectives we will employ the finite element comsol multiphysics program to numerically simulate the steady state two dimensional 2d horizontal flow with specific attention paid to skin effects 2 mathematical model of the swpp test to illustrate the problem we will use a conservative tracer a confined aquifer is assumed to be unbounded laterally with a uniform regional groundwater flow presented over the entire duration of test the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and horizontally isotropic a fully penetrating well is used so only the horizontal flow is of concern here flow is assumed to be darcian and transport is assumed to be fickian the test well radius rw is assumed to be sufficiently small so that the wellbore storage is not a concern and the mixing effect is also negligible wang et al 2018 the tracer is injected with a constant rate and a constant concentration at the injection phase and is pumped with a constant rate which could be different from the injection rate at the pumping phase after a certain period of drift phase to allow the injected tracer move along with the regional groundwater flow the coordinate system is established as follows with the origin at the center of the test well and the x axis pointing to the direction of regional groundwater flow the confined aquifer consists of two zones in the radial direction the first zone known as the wellbore skin zone is located around the well and has a thickness of rs rw where rs is skin radius the second zone is known as the aquifer formation zone a 2d schematic diagram investigated here is depicted in fig 1 flow of the swpp test is assumed to be steady state and the solute transport is dominated by ade in the two zone system the ade of a conservative solute in the skin zone without source sink can be written as 1 c 1 t x d x x 1 c 1 x d x y 1 c 1 y v x 1 c 1 y d y x 1 c 1 x d y y 1 c 1 y v y 1 c 1 r w r r s t 0 and in the aquifer formation zone as 2 c 2 t x d x x 2 c 2 x d x y 2 c 2 y v x 2 c 2 y d x y 2 c 2 x d y y 2 c 2 y v y 2 c 2 r s r t 0 3 r x 2 y 2 where c 1 and c 2 are solute concentrations in the skin and aquifer formation zones respectively m l3 v x 1 and v x 2 are pore velocities in the x direction in the skin and formation zones respectively l t v x 2 and v y 2 are pore velocities in the y direction in the skin and formation zones respectively l t t is the transport time t r is the radial distance l from the well and x and y are two horizontal coordinates l parallel and perpendicular to the regional groundwater flow direction respectively the hydrodynamic dispersion is a velocity dependent tensor depicted as 4 d x x i α l v x 2 v α t v y 2 v d d i f f 5 d y y i α l v y 2 v α t v x 2 v d d i f f 6 d x y i d y x i α l α t v x v y v 7 v i v xi 2 v yi 2 where i 1 and 2 denote the skin zone and the aquifer formation zone respectively dxxi dxyi and dyyi are components of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor l2 t ddiff is the molecular diffusion coefficient l2 t αl is the longitudinal dispersivity l αt is the transverse dispersivity l and it is much smaller than the longitudinal dispersivity thus one usually assumes αl 10αt guvanasen and guvanasen 1987 chen et al 1999 vi is the total pore water velocity 3 numerical solution of the swpp test in this study a steady state flow model of 2d horizontal plane was developed based on comsol multiphysics as shown in fig 1 the model region was set to be 40 m 40 m and the well has a radius of 0 1 m in addition the aquifer thickness b 10 m the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is k 8 0 m d and the effective porosity of the aquifer θ 0 3 which is assumed to be the same as the total porosity of the aquifer when all the pore spaces are well connected with negligible immobile porosity porosity is according to fig 1 the boundary conditions for the domain of concern can be expressed as 8 h x y s 1 h 1 h x y s 2 h 2 9 k h n s 3 0 k h n s 4 0 10 v x k j θ v d θ where s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 are the boundaries of the model s 1 and s 2 are constant head boundaries with prescribed total heads of h 1 and h 2 respectively both s 3 and s 4 are no flux boundaries n is the normal vector of the boundary an outward pointing vector perpendicular to the boundary vx is the pore flow velocity of regional groundwater l t vd is the darcy velocity of regional groundwater l t j is the hydraulic gradient of regional flow in the aquifer l l a constant regional flow field can be generated and one can obtain different values of vx by changing the head differences between h 1 and h 2 in this model constant head boundaries were prescribed and the value of h 2 was set as 15 m according to eq 10 one can obtain different values of vx by changing the value of h 1 in the model a continuous mass flux of injection or pumping rate was assigned at r rw which can be expressed as 11 n 0 q ρ 2 π r w b where n 0 is the mass flux per unit thickness m l2 t q is the injection or pumping rate l3 t which is positive for the injection and negative for pumping and q is 0 in the drift phase ρ is the density of groundwater m l3 a uniform skin near the well was considered in a confined aquifer and the well skin thickness of rs rw was assumed to be constant in this model the hydraulic conductivity of skin was set to be ks the default values of the parameters were shown in table 1 for the solute transport model the initial condition in both skin and aquifer formation zones are 12 c 1 r 0 c 2 r 0 0 r r w in the injection phase the boundary condition at r r w can be described as 13 c 1 r t c 0 r r w 0 t t inj where c 0 represents the concentration of the injection phase m l3 tinj is the duration of the injection phase t the third type boundary condition may also be used to replace the first type boundary condition of eq 13 however our numerical exercises indicate that both conditions yield nearly the same results except for a very short period of time since the start of injection therefore without loss of generality we use the first type boundary condition here as an example to illustrate the methodology in the pumping phase the time dependent concentration is measured in the borehole the main target of the test is to obtain several parameters by fitting the observed btcs with corresponding theoretical btcs obtained from a proper analytical or numerical solution when solute transport through well screen the boundary condition at the well screen is wang et al 2017 14 d x x 1 c 1 x d y y 1 c 1 y d x y 1 c 1 y d y x 1 c 1 x 0 w i t h x 2 y 2 r w because the values of velocity and concentration are different around the perimeter of the borehole it is necessary to integrate the concentration around the borehole with the velocity as the weight to obtain the accurate value of concentration at the well thus the flux averaged concentrations can be expressed as 15 c pump l w v w c w l w v w r r w t drift t t pump where vw represents the velocity around the borehole in the pumping phase l t cw represents the concentration around the well perimeter m l3 c pump is the concentration inside the wellbore m l3 lw is the perimeter of the wellbore l the swpp test was divided into three phases the simulation results at the end of each phase including the hydraulic head and the solute concentration were set to be the initial values for the simulation in the next phase the model domain was discretized into 21 688 elements and the mesh size was progressively refined near the well and the well perimeter was discretized into 28 elements when the number of element is doubled the peak solute concentration for the pumping phase varied about 0 17 therefore the selected mesh is regarded as sufficiently fine for the problem investigated here to check the accuracy of the numerical model further the numerical solution for a special case without skin was used to compare with the analytical solution of huang et al 2010 who investigated a steady state flow swpp model with injection and extraction phases without the regional groundwater flow as shown in fig 2 the simulated time span of tracer injection and pumping were 0 5 day and 1 day respectively the other parameters were given as qinj 50 m3 d qpunp 50 m3 d b 10 m αl 0 1 m 0 5 m 1 m and θ 0 3 c 0 at r rw was set as 1 0 mol m3 the results showed that our numerical solution agreed perfectly with the analytical solution for the following analysis the values of the parameters are listed in table 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 types of btcs for different regional groundwater darcy velocity the main target of this swpp test is to estimate the unknown regional groundwater velocity in order to interpret the btcs a parametric study over a wide range of regional groundwater velocities was conducted fig 3 shows the btcs for the pumping phase with different regional groundwater velocities for the convenience of the numerical modeling we used darcy flow velocity vd to discuss the impacts of the regional groundwater velocity vx on the btcs and vd was given as 1 10 7 m s 4 10 6 m s 8 10 6 m s 1 2 10 6 m s 1 5 10 6m s 1 8 10 6 m s 2 2 10 6 m s and 2 5 10 6 besides αl 0 02 m θ 0 3 qinj 30 m3 d qpump 15 m3 d and the other parameters are the same as those used in table 1 one can see that regional groundwater darcy velocities have great impacts on btcs and the btcs can be identified as two main types as shown in fig 3 the first type of btcs shows a monotonically decreasing trend with time due to relatively low regional flow darcy velocities less than 1 2 10 6 m s as seen in fig 3a for this type of btcs an inverse correlation between the tracer concentration and the regional groundwater darcy velocity is evident as a higher regional darcy velocity leading to a smaller tracer concentration at early stage see fig 3a additionally it is notable that a higher regional groundwater darcy velocity will result in a longer tailing for this type of btcs the second type of btcs has a rising limb at early stage followed by a falling limb at late stage because of relatively high regional darcy velocities 1 5 10 6 m s as shown in fig 3b it is apparent that the time ta to reach the peak value increases with increase of the regional groundwater darcy velocity for this case while the concentration of peak value decreases with the increase of the regional groundwater darcy velocity in order to interpret this behavior explicitly the concentration distributions in a 2d horizontal plane at tpump 0 hr with different regional groundwater darcy velocities are shown in fig 4 in the pumping phase one can see that there is a stagnation point sp which has zero groundwater velocity v 2 and is located at the dividing streamline ds enveloping the capture zone as shown in fig 4 the ds divides the flow into the capture zone and the non capture zone while the sp represents the frontier of the capture zone around the pumping well if the tracer does not drift beyond the stagnation point of the capture zone in the drift phase it can be extracted from the aquifer therefore different convergence situations of tracer due to variable regional groundwater darcy velocities result in a series of btc types one can see that a certain amount of tracer mass may be retained near the symmetry axis x axis and around the well when the regional groundwater darcy velocity is relatively low such as vd 8 10 7 m s and 1 2 10 6 m s as shown in fig 4a b resulting in relatively high concentrations for the first type of btcs in the wellbore at early stage on the contrary a higher regional groundwater darcy velocity leads to a faster tracer transport process causing the tracer mass drifting away from the well as shown in fig 4c d resulting in relatively low concentrations and an increase of concentration inside the wellbore at early stage for the second type of btcs as shown in fig 3b besides one can also see that a higher regional groundwater darcy velocity leads to a smaller distance from sp to well resulting in a smaller recovery ratio of tracer mass in the pumping phase the opposite is true for the case of a lower regional groundwater darcy velocity for instance the tracer mass on the left side of the dividing streamline can be extracted by lower velocities such as vd 8 10 7 m s and 1 2 10 6 m s as shown in fig 4a b but very limited tracer can be captured with larger velocities like vd 2 5 10 6 m s resulting in lower concentration values of btcs in fig 3b 4 2 methods for estimating the regional groundwater velocity for the above second type of btcs leap and kaplan 1988 presented a simplified equation to estimate the regional velocity using a swpp test approximately and the displacement of the center of mass of a non reactive tracer during a swpp test was analytically attributed to several terms as follows 16 v a t drift v a t a q pump π θ b 1 2 t a 1 2 0 thus 17 v a q pump t a π θ b 1 2 t a t drift where qpump is the pumping rate in the pumping phase l3 t ta is the time elapsed from the start of pumping until the center of mass of tracer is recovered t tdrift is the time elapsed in the drift phase t va is average pore velocity of regional groundwater flow eq 17 was derived considering a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer with steady state horizontal advective transport with a constant hydraulic gradient the regional groundwater velocity is regarded as negligible in the injection phase and the dispersion is not considered for this model leap and kaplan 1988 according to eq 17 the groundwater velocity can be computed when the btcs has a peak value for a swpp test in which ta corresponds to the time of reaching the peak value according to fig 3b and eq 17 the regional groundwater velocities can be estimated and the results are shown in table 2 we also define a parameter of relative errors e va v a v x v x to reflect the difference of the calculated values and the real values where vx is the regional groundwater pore velocity based on eq 10 it is noteworthy that the calculated values are smaller than the real values a primary reason is that the peak time is not always corresponding to the center of the mass particularly when the peclet number is relatively small less than 10 and the peak time is somewhat less than the advective time due to the dispersive effect liang et al 2018 for example the dispersion can result in the change of the peak time as shown in fig 5 the parameters are given as vx 6 67 10 6 m s tinj 1 hr tdrift 36 hr tpump 36 hr qinj 30 m3 d qpump 15 m3 d and αl 0 01 m 0 05 m and 0 1 m it is obvious that αl has significant impacts on the shape of btcs and a larger αl leads to a smaller peak time the second type of btcs even transforms into the first type when αl 0 1 m resulting in failing to compute the regional groundwater velocity based on eq 17 as shown in fig 5 we have calculated the regional groundwater velocity using the method of leap and kaplan 1988 and the calculated regional groundwater velocities va are 4 63 10 6 m s and 2 83 10 6 m s for αl 0 01 m and 0 05 m respectively which are smaller than the true regional groundwater velocity 6 67 10 6 m s it can be found that a larger dispersion can result in a larger error to estimate the regional groundwater velocity therefore the approach of leap and kaplan 1988 is unreliable to estimate the regional groundwater velocity for a large longitudinal dispersivity in addition it can also be found that a higher actual regional groundwater velocity results a smaller eva except for the case of vx 8 33 10 6 m s in table 2 this means that a higher actual regional groundwater velocity can lead to a smaller error based on eq 17 however for the case of vx 8 33 10 6 m s it can be found that eva increases to 0 44 which can be explained in fig 4d because the tracer drifts beyond the stagnation point of the capture zone in the drift phase thus the tracer of the center of mass cannot be extracted from the aquifer in fig 4d resulting in a large error the phenomenon was also explained in the study of hall et al 1991 who considered that the tracer drifted beyond the velocity shadow i e capture zone before pumping resulting in that the calculated regional groundwater velocity was as much as 30 below the actual value for the case of a relatively low regional groundwater velocity such as vx 6 00 10 6 m s it can be found that the tracer mass is in the capture zone as shown in fig 4c therefore although a relatively high regional groundwater velocity results in a small error an extremely high or low regional groundwater velocity can result a large error another factor contributing to computational error is the assumption of the method of leap and kaplan 1988 i e the regional groundwater velocity is negligible in the injection phase which is not true when the injection rate is not sufficiently large and or the injection time is not sufficiently short paradis et al 2018 as mentioned above the regional groundwater velocity can be computed approximately for the second type of btcs based on eq 17 however btcs may transform from the second type to the first type if the regional groundwater velocity declines this is because a certain amount of tracer mass may be retained near the symmetry axis x axis for relatively low regional groundwater velocity such as vd 8 10 7 m s and 1 2 10 6 m s as shown in fig 4a b in addition a large longitudinal dispersivity can also lead to the form of the first type of btcs thus the regional groundwater velocity cannot be obtained based on eq 17 for such a case if the first type btcs are presented a reasonable approach is to fit btcs using the numerical model of this study for parameter estimation furthermore since swpp tests are usually conducted at the meter scale meaning that only a small volume around the wellbore can be affected by the injection phase chen et al 2017 hence the effects of well skin on btcs in the swpp test are of concern and should be investigated this is the task of the following section 4 3 the effects of skin hydraulic conductivity on btcs in the swpp test as mentioned above the well skin includes two general types i e a positive skin and a negative skin prescribing the hydraulic conductivities of skin and aquifer or aquifer formation zone as ks and k respectively one can use a new parameter δ ks k to reflect the skin impact where δ is a parameter reflecting the type of the skin and called the skin index hereinafter specifically δ 1 represents a positive skin while δ 1 represents a negative skin note that the case of δ 1 represents the case without a skin in this section we will provide a detailed analysis on the impact of the skin hydraulic conductivity on swpp test fig 6 shows the effect of skin indexes on btcs in the pumping phase the parameters are given as vx 6 67 10 6 m s qinj 30 m3 d qpump 15 m3 d αl 0 02 m rs 0 5 m and δ 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 and 1 5 the results indicate that the concentration gets higher at early stage of pumping when the skin index is lower and a smaller skin index results in a smaller ta as shown in fig 6 this may be explained as follows a skin with a lower δ value or a lower permeability value in respect to that of the formation essentially serves as a somewhat shield around the test well that can make the spreading of the tracer mass out of the test well more difficult in the injection phase consequently more tracer mass will be retained near the test well residing either in the skin or near the skin therefore in the pumping phase of the test more tracer mass can be extracted at the early stage of the pumping phase leading to higher concentrations at that stage especially for δ 0 5 the second type of btcs transforms into the first type the facts are the opposite for a larger δ value this is because a negative skin δ 1 is somewhat like a high conductance zone rather than a shield and can facilitate the spreading of tracer mass away from the test well in the injection phase therefore less tracer mass will be retained near the test well in the case of a higher skin index and lower concentrations will be seen at the early stage of pumping in the wellbore hence the existence of skin will result in an error to estimate the regional groundwater velocity to further explicitly interpret this behavior the concentration distributions in a 2d horizontal plane at tpump 0 hr with different δ values are shown in fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 a lower δ value or a lower skin hydraulic conductivity leads to more tracer accumulation in the skin zone after the drift phase on the contrary it is quite obvious to see that a larger δ value or a larger skin hydraulic conductivity leads to a lower tracer concentration in the skin zone at the early stage of the pumping phase for instance we can see that the tracer accumulation in the skin zone in the cases of δ 1 5 is clearly less than that in the cases of δ 0 5 and 0 75 fig 8 displays the curves of concentration versus distance at tpump 0 hr with δ 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 and 1 5 respectively we can see that the concentration gets higher in the skin zone when the skin index δ is lower as shown in fig 8 the results indicate that a lower skin hydraulic conductivity leads to more tracer accumulation in the skin zone after the drift phase the opposite is true if the skin index δ is larger in addition we can see that the peak concentration of solute appears at the location closer to the test well with a lower δ value resulting in the higher concentration at early stage of pumping as shown in fig 6 therefore different skin indices will lead to different concentration curves versus distance in the aquifer system 4 4 effects of skin thickness on btcs in the swpp test in this section we will analyze the impacts of the skin thickness on btcs the parameters are given as vx 6 67 10 6 m s tinj 1 hr tdrift 36 hr tpump 36 hr qinj 30 m3 d qpump 15 m3 d δ 0 625 positive skin δ 1 5 negative skin αl 0 02 m and rs 0 0 2 and 0 5 m in the case of δ 0 625 positive skin one can see that the concentration gets higher at early stage with the increase of rs and the values of ta gradually decrease in fig 9 the explanation is similar to that for fig 6 as a thicker positive skin means a thicker shield surrounding the test well preventing the injected tracer mass from spreading further away from the test well thus leading to higher concentrations at the early stage of the extraction phase while for the case of δ 1 5 negative skin it can be found that the concentration shows a decreasing trend at early stage with the increase of rs and the values of ta gradually increase as a thicker negative skin means a thicker high conductance zone surrounding the test well which will facilitate the injected tracer mass to spread further away from the test well to further explicitly interpret this behavior the concentration distributions in a 2d horizontal plane at tpump 0 hr with different positive or negative skin thickness are shown in fig 10 it is evident that a larger positive skin thickness leads to more tracer accumulation in the skin zone after the drift phase while in the case of a negative skin one can see that a greater portion of tracer mass migrate away from the test well after the cease of injection with a greater value of rs in fig 10 for instance one can see that the greater tracer accumulation in the skin zone in the case of rs 0 5 and δ 1 5 is clearly less than that in the case of rs 0 5 and δ 0 625 4 5 parameter estimations above sections 4 3 and 4 4 have demonstrated the skin effects on the dada interpretation of btcs with respect to practical application hydrogeologists are concerned about the parameter estimation accuracy on the basis of swpp models nevertheless the skin effect is inevitable therefore we will analyze how the skin affects the estimation of aquifer properties such as dispersivity and regional groundwater flow velocity in the following section in which we consider the model without skin effect as a reference of comparison an interesting question to ask is that what happens if one employs the non skin swpp model to interpret the btcs obtained from the model with a skin in another word how different are the parameters e g dispersivity and regional groundwater velocity estimated by the non skin swpp model from their actual values based on the swpp model with a skin if the differences between the estimated and actual parameter values are non negligible one has to take the skin effect into consideration in a swpp test model for parameter estimation fig 11 shows btcs at the well fitted by the a non skin model for different skin types the actual parameters used in the swpp model with skins are set as vx 1 10 5 m s tinj 1 hr tdrift 36 hr tpump 36 hr qinj 30 m3 d qext 15 m3 d δ 0 5 positive skin δ 1 5 negative skin αl 0 1 m θ 0 3 and rs 0 5 m the circle lines are created by the numerical solution of the swpp test with skins the dashed lines are created by the non skin swpp test model using a trial and error method we find that the fitness is good for the positive and negative skins as shown in fig 11 table 3 shows the parameter estimated by the non skin model one can see that in the case of a positive skin the groundwater flow velocities estimated using a non skin model is smaller than the real value and the longitudinal dispersivity is larger than the real value in addition in the case of a negative skin the groundwater flow velocity is overestimated and longitudinal dispersivity estimated is 0 66 times smaller than the real value in summary the parameters estimated by the non skin model are considerably different from their real values resulting in nonnegligible errors in parameter estimation if the non skin model is mistakenly used when a skin actually presents 5 summary and conclusions the swpp test has been used to determine regional groundwater velocity due to advantages that the swpp test is relatively easy to perform less expensive and more efficient than the well to well test however in many previous studies the models of the swpp tests neglect dispersive effect and skin effect thus may result in poor performance for parameter estimation in this study a numerical model for a swpp test with the presence of a regional groundwater flow field was investigated considering both the positive and negative skin effects there is a strong interaction between the uniform regional groundwater flow and the radial wellflow and different regional groundwater velocities can lead to various types of btcs in the pumping phase the effects of both the hydraulic conductivities and thickness of the skin zone on btcs have been considered the following conclusions can be drawn 1 regional groundwater velocity has a significant effect on the shape of btcs a lower regional groundwater velocity means that more tracer can be accumulated near the symmetry plane around the well resulting in formation of the first type of btcs which include falling limbs only in the pumping phase the opposite is true in a case of a higher regional flow velocity resulting in formation of the second type of btcs which include rising limbs followed by falling limbs in addition the pattern and location of the dividing streamline determine the quantity of tracer mass extracted in the pumping phase 2 the model of leap and kaplan 1988 underestimates the regional groundwater velocity for the second type of btcs and the main error of parameter estimates is that the peak time is not always corresponding to the center of mass which is a key assumption used for the method a larger longitudinal dispersivity leads to a smaller peak time resulting in a larger error and an extremely high or low regional groundwater velocity can also result in poor performance for parameter estimation in addition the method is not appropriate for the first type of btcs 3 in the pumping phase a lager hydraulic conductivity of skin results in a lower concentration at the early stage on the contrary a smaller hydraulic conductivity of skin leads to a higher concentration in addition a lager thickness of a positive skin strengthens the influence of skin causing a higher concentration at the early pumping stage and the opposite is true in the case of a negative skin 4 a smaller hydraulic conductivity of skin means that solute plume can accumulate more in the skin zone in the drift phase otherwise a larger hydraulic conductivity of skin results in a solute plume drifting further away from the skin zone therefore skin properties skin types and thickness will result in different shapes of btcs 5 the non skin swpp test model is used to interpret btcs obtained from the model with skins and the estimated parameters are very different from their actual values resulting in larger errors in parameter estimation if the non skin model is mistakenly used with the existence of skins the general conclusion is that the possible impacts of different skin types on swpp tests are significant and should be

6197,lake level regulation is commonly used to manage water resources and mitigate flood risk in watersheds with linked river lake systems in this study we first assess exposure in terms of both population and land area to flooding impacts in the yahara watershed s chain of four lakes in southern wisconsin as affected by minimum lake level management a flooding exposure assessment shows that the areas surrounding the upstream lakes mendota and monona have dense urban areas with high populations that are exposed to flooding waubesa has low elevations along its lakeshore resulting in a large potential flooding area and the most downstream lake kegonsa has a large area of surrounding cropland that is exposed to flooding but impacts a limited population we then use a linked modeling framework of a land surface model agro ibis and a hydrologic routing model thmb to simulate daily lake level over a study period of 1994 2013 in the yahara watershed with different minimum lake level management strategies modeling results show that the peak lake levels and corresponding exposed land area and population to flooding will decrease under a lower target minimum lake level however at the same time the number of days that the lake level is below winter minimum will increase which may adversely affect ecosystem health in addition our sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing target minimum lake levels will help mitigate flood risk in terms of both flood magnitude and frequency nevertheless this must be balanced against the need to maintain adequately high lake levels for ecosystem services and recreational functions of the lakes keywords flood exposure assessment lake level management hydrologic model ecosystem services 1 introduction land located in close proximity to water bodies has been preferentially selected for human settlement throughout history because of fertile soils recreation opportunties aesthetic beauty diverse ecosystems clean water supply and a means to transport goods di baldassarre et al 2010 mcgranahan et al 2007 however surface water flooding caused by natural water bodies such as rivers and lakes is a significant natural hazard posed to society opperman et al 2009 in the current century growing population and urban footprints near water combined with trends toward increasing frequency of intense precipitation events in some regions ipcc 2013 has contributed to an increased exposure of people land area and property to flood risk milly et al 2002 pahl wostl 2007 in order to manage these risks regulating water flows and controlling water body levels with engineered control structures such as dams levees and reservoirs are common management options white 1945 salazar et al 2012 among the various ways of managing inland water bodies lake level regulation and management are options in watersheds with hydrologic connections between lakes rivers and streams the management of levels in low gradient natural lake chains is more challenging than the management of reservoir levels because of the complex river lake connectivity lesack and march 2010 between lake interactions zhang and werner 2015 and water flow variability peters and buttle 2010 dams are a key tool for managers to maintain lake levels between targets as much as possible with the acknowledgement that extreme wet and dry periods may lead to levels outside of the target range county of dane 2010 in order to effectively manage flood risk in watersheds with lakes it is important to understand lake level dynamics and the impact of management decisions related to high and low lake levels on flooding and then use this information to design management plans based on a wide range of plausible outcomes management of high lake levels attempts to minimize flooding by maintaining the lake level below some target maximum and focuses on dam operation during storm periods reimer and wu 2016 management of low lake levels aims to maintain the lake level above some target minimum relying on lake outflow interventions during non extreme periods management of low lake levels is focused on maintaining ecosystem services such as near shore fish spawning and river habitat provision and boat recreation carpenter et al 2007 optimal management of both high and low lake levels is challenging since low lake levels and flows also affect flood risk young 1968 extensive studies have been performed on dam management and operation optimization to list a few wang et al 2013 developed a near real time optimization model for flood mitigation in a river basin in china with multiple reservoirs and focused on high water level management during flood season ahn et al 2018 used a modeling approach to assess the coordinated operation of dams and weirs in terms of both high and low flow management under different climate change scenarios ehsani et al 2017 analyzed climate and dam management data in the northeast united states and suggested an increase of the size and number of dams in the region to mitigate flood and drought risk under climate change these previous studies have shown the challenges of dam management and its multi objective nature however study on the flood mitigation impacts of low lake level management is limited especially in a natural river lake coupled system the main objectives of this study are to assess the potential exposure to flooding in an agricultural urban watershed containing a chain of lakes and investigate the effect of minimum lake level management on flood mitigation using a physically based modeling framework in this way our study provides new insights about flood control in river lake coupled hydrologic systems to accomplish this we adapt and link a 1 d dynamic land surface model with a 2 d hydrologic routing model to simulate the streamflow and lake levels in the watershed over a 20 year period from 1994 to 2013 as they are impacted by management of minimum lake levels 2 study area the yahara watershed yw is located in southern wisconsin home to the city of madison and has a drainage area of 1345 km2 fig 1 land cover within the yw is primarily cropland 46 5 of the total area and urban land 26 7 of the total area the watershed had a total population around 372 000 in 2010 u s census bureau 2015 carpenter et al 2015 with 65 within the city of madison there are four major lakes in the watershed connected by the yahara river mendota monona waubesa and kegonsa listed in order from upstream to downstream this low relief chain of lakes has 2 1 m of elevation change from the upper to lower lakes which are separated by a distance of 10 9 km there are three dams in the yw allowing management of lake levels fig 1 in this study we refer to dams by the lake of which they are downstream mendota dam also called tenney dam is located at the outlet of mendota and controls the outflow and lake level of mendota waubesa dam also called babcock dam is located at the outlet of waubesa there is no control structure and little elevation change at the outlet of monona so both monona and waubesa are controlled by waubesa dam finally kegonsa dam also called lafollette dam is located at the outlet of kegonsa high and low lake level targets have been established for each lake based on extensive discussion between local managers regulatory institutions and the general public table 1 county of dane 2010 to better understand the effectiveness of lake level regulation there are several models that have previously been applied in the yahara region to simulate river lake dynamics krug 1999 developed a lumped water balance model to estimate the lake outflows under both high and low lake level regulations suggesting that to maintain a reasonable level of minimum streamflow in the chain of lakes requires active dam management which relies on detailed computations and modeling of streamflow and lake levels in the watershed baird and associates 2007 coupled a lumped land surface model nam and a 1 d hydraulic routing model mike 11 to study the hydrologic system and assist lake level managers they showed that both channel roughness and dam operation would have direct impact on lake levels reimer and wu 2016 developed a real time water information system to simulate water level and flow rate in the river chain of lakes using their real time hydrodynamic model the study tested different lake level management strategies to mitigate flood risks they found that reducing the flood duration at one lake may cause the extension of flooding at another lake as a result lake level management needs to involve consideration of each lake s water level to achieve the overall flood mitigation for the entire lake chain system these previous modeling efforts have provided physical insights of the lake chain system and guidelines for lake level management however these studies have focused primarily on event and intra annual time scales research is still needed to simulate lake levels over longer time scales in order to understand the effect of low lake level management on flood risk during non extreme periods in addition a number of studies have been conducted on the nonstationarity of climate in the yw that is exacerbating flood risks gillon et al 2015 reported an increasing trend of precipitation in the yahara region in terms of both annual average precipitation totals and the frequency of extreme rainfall events e g 50 and 75 mm in a 24 h period hayden et al 2016 conducted a storm transposition experiment in the upper yahara watershed to show a potential increase of flood risk in an urbanized area under climate change they recommended that a watershed scale modeling effort should take place with a focus on how flood risk is impacted by lake level variability in the last decade flood management has become an important and timely issue in the yw usinowicz et al 2017 document a long term increase in flashiness for lake levels in both mendota and monona over the past century several recent events have also highlighted the challenges in flood management in june 2008 flooding affected the yw when the region received approximately 20 35 cm of rainfall between june 1 and 15 budikova et al 2010 this contributed to monona exceeding its 100 year return period high lake level causing substantial economic loss and property damage in dane county county of dane emergency management 2014 more recently in late august through early october 2018 the entire yahara chain of lakes was impacted by record flooding that began with a heavy 24 h rainfall event mean of 11 5 cm over the lake monona watershed on august 20 this historic event was then followed by an unusually wet september these conditions combined with lake mendota water levels that were already 20 30 cm above the normal maximum level due to previously high spring and summer rainfall created an unprecedented and long lasting water management issue the large volume of runoff that entered lake mendota was slowly released through the yahara river to minimize downstream flooding however given the high lake and river levels this caused localized street closures and other flooding around businesses and homes for about 6 weeks verburg 2018 lake monona reached a maximum level of 258 57 m which is 19 cm higher than its 100 year return period level lake waubesa also exceeded its 100 year flood level after these flooding events improving flood protection has once again become a major topic of discussion within the community elbow 2018 3 methodology 3 1 assessment of exposure to flooding in order to investigate the flood risk in the yw we conduct an assessment of exposure to flooding in the lakeshore areas based on schanze et al 2006 the term flood risk is defined as the probability of negative consequences caused by floods which depends on the exposure of elements at risk to flooding there are different methods of flood risk assessment including the index method solín 2012 mathematical modeling dutta et al 2003 statistical approaches thieken et al 2015 hydrologic modeling and scenario projections kobayashi and takara 2013 sušnik et al 2015 vozinaki et al 2015 and explicit damage and cost accounting based on historical events patankar and patwardhan 2016 our approach uses a simple assessment of potential exposure to flooding of the lakeshore area of the yw based on the relationship between lake levels and land surface elevation first we use historical lake level records to calculate the regulated lake level exceedance frequency of the four lakes fig 2 second we link a digital elevation model dem with population density and land use land cover maps to estimate the potential exposure of population and land area of each lake across a range of lake levels the potential exposure of land area is determined as the area within 1 km from the lakeshore that has an elevation lower than the target extreme lake level and is not directly protected by dams and levees fig 3 the potential exposure of population is determined by multiplying each census level block population density by the exposed area within that block then the total exposed population is determined by summing all of the exposed blocks we recognize that our measure of potential exposure of populations is an approximation since the spatial scale of the census data may not be fine enough to be able to fully capture the details of population distribution in the lakeshore area four extreme lake levels are used in this assessment target maximum level target maximum level 0 1 m target maximum level 0 4 m and target maximum level 0 7 m these extreme levels are selected based on the historical lake level records fig 2 to represent different levels of flood risk for example lake monona exceeded the 0 7 m lake level during the 2008 and 2018 flood events which had major impacts on the city of madison and surroundings 3 2 modeling framework after we performed the exposure assessment under different lake levels we use a watershed scale modeling framework to simulate the linked river lake system in the yw with lake level management implementation to investigate the effects of the minimum lake level management on flood risk in the yw to build this modeling framework we adapt and link an agricultural version of the integrated biosphere simulator agro ibis kucharik 2003 with the terrestrial hydrology model with biogeochemistry thmb coe 1998 agro ibis simulates among other processes and quantities surface runoff and subsurface drainage for a variety of ecosystems and land cover types using agro ibis outputs as driver variables thmb simulates the in stream transport of water and the change of lake levels a more detailed description of these two models is provided in the following sections 3 3 and 3 4 this modeling framework has the capability to dynamically simulate daily streamflow and lake levels under the impacts of changing management land use land cover and climate and has been used previously in different regions and at coarser spatial scales but across larger spatial domains coe et al 2002 donner et al 2002 donner and kucharik 2003 coe et al 2008 3 3 agro ibis model description agro ibis is a 1 d land surface and dynamic ecosystem model that simulates the movement of water energy momentum carbon nitrogen and phosphorus through the soil vegetationatmosphere system foley et al 1996 kucharik et al 2000 kucharik 2003 the model has been validated across a range of ecosystems at different regions and time periods kucharik and brye 2003 kucharik and twine 2007 recently agro ibis was integrated with the soil water and energy transport routines from hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 to improve simulation of water soil vegetation interactions in the unsaturated zone soylu et al 2014 in the yw the updated agro ibis model has previously been validated at both the field scale soylu et al 2014 zipper et al 2015 and watershed scale motew et al 2017 3 4 thmb model description thmb is a physically based 2 d hydrologic routing model that combines prescribed river network information with calibrated parameterization of river morphological characteristics to simulate the flow and storage of water in hydrologic systems using linear reservoir functions coe 1998 coe 2000 thmb has been validated in various regions and at a range of scales coe et al 2002 donner et al 2002 donner and kucharik 2003 coe et al 2008 the version of thmb used for the yw is modified from the version of coe et al 2008 to include lake level simulation under regulation the original lake outflow equation to compute lake outflow under unmanaged conditions coe 1998 is replaced by eq 1 1 q out 2 3 2 g c l v 3 2 v l 3 2 a s 3 2 v l v q m v v l where q out m3 s is the lake outflow g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 c is the outflow coefficient which is obtained through calibration l m is the effective length of the crest gate width which is given by the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr 2001 v m3 is the current lake volume v l m3 is the management low volume a s m2 is the standard lake area and q m m3 s is the regulated minimum flow in eq 1 the first equation is a modified version of the spillway discharge equation in chow et al 1988 in our model lake volume v is simulated at each time step in thmb driven by meteorology and lake outflows the initial lake levels are prescribed based on the dem a detailed explanation of lake volume simulation in thmb is provided by coe 1998 and coe et al 2008 the levels of v l of each of the four lakes are calculated based on the model minimum lake levels mimicking the target minimum lake levels in table 1 as table 1 shows the minimum lake levels in the model are not the same as the target minimum lake levels the model minimum levels are obtained through calibration described in section 3 5 standard lake area a s is obtained from lathrop 1992 we assume that the lake area variability is negligible for outflow calculation and therefore a s is constant in eq 1 the minimum flow rate q m is set to 0 1 m3 s for all four lakes this flow rate is the lowest among the minimum outflow requirements of the four lakes according to krug 1999 the actual minimum flow varies with the lake level conditions but we simplify the minimum flow rate to a constant level of 0 1 m3 s because variability around this small discharge value does not substantially affect lake levels because of the simplicity of eq 1 short time scale hydrodynamic processes such as backwater effects are not considered in the model as a result the effect of high lake level management during extreme events which has been extensively studied reimer and wu 2016 is not investigated in this study we focus on the contribution and impact of minimum lake level regulations to yw flood risk and evaluate these effects from 1994 to 2013 3 5 data sources and model calibration weather data for input to agro ibis and thmb from 1986 to 2013 include daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation daily precipitation observations from a national weather service cooperative observer program coop weather station at the madison wisconsin airport coop id 474961 are used for the time period of 1986 2000 and applied across the watershed ncdc 2015 spatially variable radar derived daily precipitation estimates 4 km 4 km synthesized by the national centers for environmental prediction are used for the 2001 2013 time period ncep 2015 daily maximum and minimum air temperature and wind speed observations from the madison wisconsin airport coop id 474961 are used for the entire time period and applied across the model domain ncdc 2015 daily relative humidity and solar radiation observations for the complete study time period are obtained from a university of wisconsin extension weather station in arlington wisconsin which is located in the northern yw uw extension 2014 these weather data are applied across the entire domain land surface data collected for this study included land use land cover lulc elevation and population data dynamic lulc maps are compiled to determine lake extent and annual landscape composition consisting of 17 biophysically distinct categories and interpolated to the 220 m 220 m model grid in the period of 1986 2013 booth et al 2016 the land use land cover map of 2013 is used for the flood vulnerability assessment in this study lidar derived elevation data with a resolution of 1 5 m by 1 5 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 15 m are downloaded from the wisconsinview database ftp ftp ssec wisc edu pub wisconsinview lidar dane and used to determine the potential flood affected area furthermore we collect 10 m resolution elevation data from usgs ned dataset and resample the data to 220 m spatial resolution to match agro ibis the resampled elevation data is used to derive the stream network for thmb modeling block level population data was obtained from the u s census bureau to determine the number of people potentially impacted by lake flooding u s census bureau 2015 for model calibration and validation purposes observations of streamflow from six gages and lake level from four gages are obtained from the u s geological survey s national water information system usgs 2015 streamflow simulation and realism in thmb has been discussed in depth in previous studies coe et al 2002 2008 and therefore will not be a focus of validation here nevertheless the performance of streamflow simulation will be shown in the results section the lake level simulation calibration in thmb is performed by comparing the observed daily lake levels with simulations adjusting the model minimum lake levels and outflow coefficients of the four lakes we calibrate the parameters of each lake sequentially from upstream to downstream the best fit parameters are selected based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of simulations the model minimum lake levels table 1 rows 5 and 6 are not the same as the target minimum lake levels table 1 rows 2 and 3 because the target minimum lake levels are reference levels that guide management decision making rather than the actual minimum lake levels that are observed we choose the period of 2004 2013 as the calibration period and 1994 2003 as the validation period 3 6 model simulation and sensitivity analysis after calibration and validation we use the calibrated model to investigate the effect of minimum lake level management on flood risk and ecosystem health specifically we conduct a new simulation with a model minimum lake level 0 1 m lower than the calibrated value at lake mendota representing an alternative management strategy then we compare this simulation result with the original modeling result in terms of high and low lake levels for high lake levels we compare the potential exposure of land area and population under different peak levels using the same method described in section 3 1 for low lake levels the winter target minimum levels are absolute minimums low winter lake levels may adversely affect hibernating aquatic species and damage fish habitats county of dane 2010 therefore we count the number of days that the lake level is below the target winter minimum levels to evaluate the effect of minimum lake level management on ecosystem health we select lake mendota for this analysis because it is the largest lake of the four and the south side of the lakeshore area is highly urbanized the management of lake level at mendota is crucial to the safety and economic development of the local community as well as the health of ecosystems in the region this analysis is conducted during the calibration period of 2004 2013 furthermore we conduct a sensitivity analysis of daily water levels under different model minimum levels at all four lakes to gain a complete picture about the impact of minimum lake level management using the current lake level control strategy as the base line we evaluate 6 alternative strategies for each of the 3 dams we increase decrease the minimum levels by 0 1 m respectively the sensitivity analysis is also conducted during the calibration period of 2004 2013 4 results 4 1 assessment of exposure to flooding we first investigate the exceedance frequency of lake levels based on the historical period with data from all four lakes 2004 2018 fig 2 relative to the target maximum lake levels listed in table 1 in fig 2 monona and waubesa exceed target maximum levels most frequently while kegonsa and mendota have lower exceedance frequency of target maximum levels with kegonsa being the lowest also mendota shows a larger range of low lake levels approximately 0 m to 0 6 m than the other lakes approximately 0 m to 0 5 m indicating low lake levels are more common in mendota this comparison reflects the lake level range and potential flood risk of the four lakes in the 2004 2018 time period however 15 years is a relatively short period to analyze lake level distributions therefore we also plot the exceedance frequency curves based on long term 1916 2018 records for mendota and monona only these two lakes have long term records both lakes show a general increasing frequency of high lake levels in the modern record compared to long term data fig 4 for example the extreme rainfall that occurred during the first half of june 2008 caused the lake level in monona to exceed its 100 year return period level also the more recent storm event of august 2018 coupled with heavy rainfall in may and early june 33 cm from may 1 to june 15 2018 that increased lake levels above maximum targets caused monona waubesa and kegonsa to exceed their 100 year return period levels the increase in high water level occurrences in yw is an important temporal change to note in terms of the exposed land area and population as expected lakeshore areas of mendota and monona have the highest exposed urban area and population among the four lakes since they are the closest to madison s urban core fig 5 a and b waubesa has a smaller developed area and lower population density than monona but a relatively low elevation around the lakeshore area and therefore a larger potentially flooded area but smaller exposed population relative to mendota and monona fig 5c the outlying landscape surrounding kegonsa away from the shoreline is largely undeveloped surrounded by wetlands and croplands therefore kegonsa has the lowest exposed urban area and population and the highest exposed agricultural area fig 5d based on the flood exposure assessment results the four lakes lakeshore areas are facing varied levels of flood risk which are closely related to the extreme lake levels in the following sections we use a modeling approach to investigate the impact of minimum lake level management on the daily and extreme lake levels in the yw 4 2 lake level model results after calibration the linked agro ibis and thmb models simulate lake levels at a daily timestep fig 6 with satisfactory values of nse and r2 during the calibration period for all lakes moriasi et al 2007 since lake level simulation is closely related to streamflow simulation in our modeling framework the streamflow simulation performance is presented in fig 7 more detailed information about streamflow simulation in terms of individual location performance and map of stream gauges is provided in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2 model validation of lake level simulation is only performed at mendota and monona since only these two lakes have a long historical record of lake levels that covers the validation period the performance of lake level simulation in the validation period fig 6e and f is not as good as in the calibration period one possible explanation for differing performance between the two intervals is that lake level management strategies have changed over time even with the same target maximum and minimum lake levels while management in our model is constant over the entire calibration and validation period the model performance indicates that the modified spillway discharge equation eq 1 is able to simulate daily lake levels with minimum lake level management at least under non extreme conditions we also compare the observed and simulated lake level exceedance frequency curves fig 8 we compute r2 values between the frequency curves and also the percentage differences of the accumulated area of the simulated frequency curve from the observed frequency curve da the model performs well at mendota r2 0 983 da 0 002 fig 8a for monona r2 0 973 da 0 004 the model tends to underestimate the lake level in extreme events with exceedance frequency lower than 0 2 fig 8b the model also performs well at waubesa r2 0 985 da 0 001 with a similar slight underestimation of lake level for extreme events fig 8c for kegonsa r2 0 989 da 0 002 the model underestimates lake levels when the exceedance frequency is higher than 0 4 fig 8d in general the model underestimates lake levels during extreme events except for kegonsa where the lake level is underestimated during normal level and low level periods this underestimation may be due to different lake level management operation decisions from event to event also hydrodynamic processes such as backwater effects are not considered in our model which may also cause underestimation of extreme lake levels 4 3 minimum lake level management impact assessment and sensitivity analysis to quantitatively assess the effect of minimum lake level management of lake mendota we conduct a comparison analysis as described in section 3 6 by decreasing the model minimum lake level by 0 1 m the water levels at mendota are generally lower than the baseline condition fig 9 as a result the peak level will be lower during extreme events with this alternative management strategy such as the one in june 2008 budikova et al 2010 however the low lake levels will be further decreased with this strategy we use the peak lake level at mid june 2008 as a representative event to evaluate the effect of minimum lake level management on flood risk mitigation the peak level decreases from 259 77 m to 259 67 m with the change of model minimum lake level table 2 correspondingly the potentially exposed land area decreases from 8 04 km2 to 6 09 km2 and the potentially exposed population decreases from 4916 to 3403 in the mendota lakeshore area on the other hand during the analysis period of 2004 2013 the total number of days that lake mendota is below the target winter minimum lake level increases from 45 to 203 with the new management strategy to systematically investigate the impact of minimum lake level management changes on daily lake levels in the yw we perform a sensitivity analysis on model minimum lake levels for each lake the daily lake levels under different model minimum lake levels are compared using exceedance frequency curves for all four lakes the minimum levels significantly affect daily levels increasing or decreasing the minimum level by 0 1 m will lead to a nearly uniform increase or decrease of the lake level by 0 1 m respectively fig 10 however changes in the upstream dam minimum levels show little to no effect on lake levels in downstream lakes 5 discussion 5 1 a balance between flood control and other ecosystem services based on our modeling and analysis results we observe that reducing model minimum lake levels has a relatively uniform effect on daily lake levels one that mitigates flood risk but may make the minimum lake level requirements for ecological or recreational services harder to achieve while our study focused on the response of flooding to minimum lake level management the yahara lakes have diverse functions lakes provide aquatic habitats for a variety of species and support recreational activities such as boating fishing and swimming qiu and turner 2013 qiu et al 2018a b as a result lake level management faces a complex challenge to maintain the balance among different lake functions which require different water levels ylag2 2012 this is a general management dilemma both in the yw and in many lake catchment systems around the world i e christensen et al 2016 yang et al 2016 hyatt et al 2015 and has long been identified as a formidable task young 1968 day and weisz 1976 morales hernández et al 2013 to optimize the multifunctional lake level management a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of lake levels on competing interests is required 5 2 the importance of high lake level management controlling for high lake levels associated with extreme rainfall and high runoff events is another important perspective of lake level management the timing and amount of water release from the three local dams in the yw are critical for flood control during and after extreme rainfall which changes from event to event in order to simulate flood control during extreme events a hydrodynamic model with high spatial and temporal resolution is required this is not the functional purpose of our model in future studies we would like to combine our watershed modeling framework with a hydrodynamic model such as the integrated nowcast and forecast operation system infos reimer and wu 2016 to investigate the effects of both long term minimum lake level regulations and the impacts of lake level management during extreme rainfall and subsequent runoff events in the yw 5 3 other possible drivers of change on lake level management a particularly challenging aspect of lake level management is that stakeholders in the yw have varying opinions on what are the most important lake level management goals residents in the lakeshore area may favor flood protection wisconsin initiative on climate change impacts 2011 while offshore residents are concerned more about the health of the lake ecosystem and accessibility of recreational activities in the lakes carpenter et al 2007 as a result the interaction between people s preferences may also affect lake level management in the yw in order to investigate this interaction socioeconomic information such as flood insurance economic growth and or public perceptions are required di baldassarre et al 2017 which is a potential future research need to further integrate socio hydrologic feedbacks sivapalan et al 2012 in addition changes in climate and land use land cover may alter streamflow into the lakes the impact of climate change and land use land cover change on flood risk and lake level management is an on going research endeavor following this study 6 conclusions in this study we assessed the potential exposure to flooding of the lakeshore areas in the yw based on historical records monona has the highest frequency of exceeding its target maximum lake level among the four lakes furthermore of the four lakes mendota and monona have relatively high exposed populations in terms of exposed land area mendota monona and waubesa all have a large amount of exposed urban area we then investigated the effect of lake regulation and management on lake levels with a focus on management of target minimum levels using a modeling approach with the calibrated modeling framework we compared the high and low water levels at lake mendota under two different model minimum lake levels by decreasing the model minimum level by 0 1 m the simulated peak water level in the major flood event of mid june 2008 will decrease by about 0 1 m and as a result the exposed land area and population in lakeshore area of mendota will decrease by 24 3 and 30 8 respectively however decreasing the model minimum level by 0 1 m will also cause an increase of the number of days that lake mendota is below the target winter minimum level from 45 to 206 during the study period of 2004 2013 which may have adverse effects on local aquatic ecosystems we also conducted a sensitivity analysis on model minimum lake levels at all four lakes and demonstrated that decreasing model minimum lake levels will reduce the frequency of extremely high lake levels results indicate that focusing on management of minimum lake levels will have a direct effect on high water levels with a 10 cm change in minimum lake level translating to nearly a 10 cm drop in water level across the spectrum of exceedance frequencies on all four lakes recognition of the control of minimum water level management in lake chains may help mitigate flood risks in the yw and other similar watersheds however lower minimum levels will also reduce lake levels during dry periods potentially impacting recreational activities and lake ecosystems managing lake levels requires consideration of trade offs between flood protection and other ecosystem services and optimizing lake level management will require a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of lake levels on competing interests future research should attempt to link our watershed model with hydrodynamic models in order to investigate 1 the effectiveness of maximum lake level control during extreme events another lake level management challenge and 2 the impact of climate change and land use land cover change on flood risk in the yw declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we acknowledge funding from the us national science foundation including

6197,lake level regulation is commonly used to manage water resources and mitigate flood risk in watersheds with linked river lake systems in this study we first assess exposure in terms of both population and land area to flooding impacts in the yahara watershed s chain of four lakes in southern wisconsin as affected by minimum lake level management a flooding exposure assessment shows that the areas surrounding the upstream lakes mendota and monona have dense urban areas with high populations that are exposed to flooding waubesa has low elevations along its lakeshore resulting in a large potential flooding area and the most downstream lake kegonsa has a large area of surrounding cropland that is exposed to flooding but impacts a limited population we then use a linked modeling framework of a land surface model agro ibis and a hydrologic routing model thmb to simulate daily lake level over a study period of 1994 2013 in the yahara watershed with different minimum lake level management strategies modeling results show that the peak lake levels and corresponding exposed land area and population to flooding will decrease under a lower target minimum lake level however at the same time the number of days that the lake level is below winter minimum will increase which may adversely affect ecosystem health in addition our sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing target minimum lake levels will help mitigate flood risk in terms of both flood magnitude and frequency nevertheless this must be balanced against the need to maintain adequately high lake levels for ecosystem services and recreational functions of the lakes keywords flood exposure assessment lake level management hydrologic model ecosystem services 1 introduction land located in close proximity to water bodies has been preferentially selected for human settlement throughout history because of fertile soils recreation opportunties aesthetic beauty diverse ecosystems clean water supply and a means to transport goods di baldassarre et al 2010 mcgranahan et al 2007 however surface water flooding caused by natural water bodies such as rivers and lakes is a significant natural hazard posed to society opperman et al 2009 in the current century growing population and urban footprints near water combined with trends toward increasing frequency of intense precipitation events in some regions ipcc 2013 has contributed to an increased exposure of people land area and property to flood risk milly et al 2002 pahl wostl 2007 in order to manage these risks regulating water flows and controlling water body levels with engineered control structures such as dams levees and reservoirs are common management options white 1945 salazar et al 2012 among the various ways of managing inland water bodies lake level regulation and management are options in watersheds with hydrologic connections between lakes rivers and streams the management of levels in low gradient natural lake chains is more challenging than the management of reservoir levels because of the complex river lake connectivity lesack and march 2010 between lake interactions zhang and werner 2015 and water flow variability peters and buttle 2010 dams are a key tool for managers to maintain lake levels between targets as much as possible with the acknowledgement that extreme wet and dry periods may lead to levels outside of the target range county of dane 2010 in order to effectively manage flood risk in watersheds with lakes it is important to understand lake level dynamics and the impact of management decisions related to high and low lake levels on flooding and then use this information to design management plans based on a wide range of plausible outcomes management of high lake levels attempts to minimize flooding by maintaining the lake level below some target maximum and focuses on dam operation during storm periods reimer and wu 2016 management of low lake levels aims to maintain the lake level above some target minimum relying on lake outflow interventions during non extreme periods management of low lake levels is focused on maintaining ecosystem services such as near shore fish spawning and river habitat provision and boat recreation carpenter et al 2007 optimal management of both high and low lake levels is challenging since low lake levels and flows also affect flood risk young 1968 extensive studies have been performed on dam management and operation optimization to list a few wang et al 2013 developed a near real time optimization model for flood mitigation in a river basin in china with multiple reservoirs and focused on high water level management during flood season ahn et al 2018 used a modeling approach to assess the coordinated operation of dams and weirs in terms of both high and low flow management under different climate change scenarios ehsani et al 2017 analyzed climate and dam management data in the northeast united states and suggested an increase of the size and number of dams in the region to mitigate flood and drought risk under climate change these previous studies have shown the challenges of dam management and its multi objective nature however study on the flood mitigation impacts of low lake level management is limited especially in a natural river lake coupled system the main objectives of this study are to assess the potential exposure to flooding in an agricultural urban watershed containing a chain of lakes and investigate the effect of minimum lake level management on flood mitigation using a physically based modeling framework in this way our study provides new insights about flood control in river lake coupled hydrologic systems to accomplish this we adapt and link a 1 d dynamic land surface model with a 2 d hydrologic routing model to simulate the streamflow and lake levels in the watershed over a 20 year period from 1994 to 2013 as they are impacted by management of minimum lake levels 2 study area the yahara watershed yw is located in southern wisconsin home to the city of madison and has a drainage area of 1345 km2 fig 1 land cover within the yw is primarily cropland 46 5 of the total area and urban land 26 7 of the total area the watershed had a total population around 372 000 in 2010 u s census bureau 2015 carpenter et al 2015 with 65 within the city of madison there are four major lakes in the watershed connected by the yahara river mendota monona waubesa and kegonsa listed in order from upstream to downstream this low relief chain of lakes has 2 1 m of elevation change from the upper to lower lakes which are separated by a distance of 10 9 km there are three dams in the yw allowing management of lake levels fig 1 in this study we refer to dams by the lake of which they are downstream mendota dam also called tenney dam is located at the outlet of mendota and controls the outflow and lake level of mendota waubesa dam also called babcock dam is located at the outlet of waubesa there is no control structure and little elevation change at the outlet of monona so both monona and waubesa are controlled by waubesa dam finally kegonsa dam also called lafollette dam is located at the outlet of kegonsa high and low lake level targets have been established for each lake based on extensive discussion between local managers regulatory institutions and the general public table 1 county of dane 2010 to better understand the effectiveness of lake level regulation there are several models that have previously been applied in the yahara region to simulate river lake dynamics krug 1999 developed a lumped water balance model to estimate the lake outflows under both high and low lake level regulations suggesting that to maintain a reasonable level of minimum streamflow in the chain of lakes requires active dam management which relies on detailed computations and modeling of streamflow and lake levels in the watershed baird and associates 2007 coupled a lumped land surface model nam and a 1 d hydraulic routing model mike 11 to study the hydrologic system and assist lake level managers they showed that both channel roughness and dam operation would have direct impact on lake levels reimer and wu 2016 developed a real time water information system to simulate water level and flow rate in the river chain of lakes using their real time hydrodynamic model the study tested different lake level management strategies to mitigate flood risks they found that reducing the flood duration at one lake may cause the extension of flooding at another lake as a result lake level management needs to involve consideration of each lake s water level to achieve the overall flood mitigation for the entire lake chain system these previous modeling efforts have provided physical insights of the lake chain system and guidelines for lake level management however these studies have focused primarily on event and intra annual time scales research is still needed to simulate lake levels over longer time scales in order to understand the effect of low lake level management on flood risk during non extreme periods in addition a number of studies have been conducted on the nonstationarity of climate in the yw that is exacerbating flood risks gillon et al 2015 reported an increasing trend of precipitation in the yahara region in terms of both annual average precipitation totals and the frequency of extreme rainfall events e g 50 and 75 mm in a 24 h period hayden et al 2016 conducted a storm transposition experiment in the upper yahara watershed to show a potential increase of flood risk in an urbanized area under climate change they recommended that a watershed scale modeling effort should take place with a focus on how flood risk is impacted by lake level variability in the last decade flood management has become an important and timely issue in the yw usinowicz et al 2017 document a long term increase in flashiness for lake levels in both mendota and monona over the past century several recent events have also highlighted the challenges in flood management in june 2008 flooding affected the yw when the region received approximately 20 35 cm of rainfall between june 1 and 15 budikova et al 2010 this contributed to monona exceeding its 100 year return period high lake level causing substantial economic loss and property damage in dane county county of dane emergency management 2014 more recently in late august through early october 2018 the entire yahara chain of lakes was impacted by record flooding that began with a heavy 24 h rainfall event mean of 11 5 cm over the lake monona watershed on august 20 this historic event was then followed by an unusually wet september these conditions combined with lake mendota water levels that were already 20 30 cm above the normal maximum level due to previously high spring and summer rainfall created an unprecedented and long lasting water management issue the large volume of runoff that entered lake mendota was slowly released through the yahara river to minimize downstream flooding however given the high lake and river levels this caused localized street closures and other flooding around businesses and homes for about 6 weeks verburg 2018 lake monona reached a maximum level of 258 57 m which is 19 cm higher than its 100 year return period level lake waubesa also exceeded its 100 year flood level after these flooding events improving flood protection has once again become a major topic of discussion within the community elbow 2018 3 methodology 3 1 assessment of exposure to flooding in order to investigate the flood risk in the yw we conduct an assessment of exposure to flooding in the lakeshore areas based on schanze et al 2006 the term flood risk is defined as the probability of negative consequences caused by floods which depends on the exposure of elements at risk to flooding there are different methods of flood risk assessment including the index method solín 2012 mathematical modeling dutta et al 2003 statistical approaches thieken et al 2015 hydrologic modeling and scenario projections kobayashi and takara 2013 sušnik et al 2015 vozinaki et al 2015 and explicit damage and cost accounting based on historical events patankar and patwardhan 2016 our approach uses a simple assessment of potential exposure to flooding of the lakeshore area of the yw based on the relationship between lake levels and land surface elevation first we use historical lake level records to calculate the regulated lake level exceedance frequency of the four lakes fig 2 second we link a digital elevation model dem with population density and land use land cover maps to estimate the potential exposure of population and land area of each lake across a range of lake levels the potential exposure of land area is determined as the area within 1 km from the lakeshore that has an elevation lower than the target extreme lake level and is not directly protected by dams and levees fig 3 the potential exposure of population is determined by multiplying each census level block population density by the exposed area within that block then the total exposed population is determined by summing all of the exposed blocks we recognize that our measure of potential exposure of populations is an approximation since the spatial scale of the census data may not be fine enough to be able to fully capture the details of population distribution in the lakeshore area four extreme lake levels are used in this assessment target maximum level target maximum level 0 1 m target maximum level 0 4 m and target maximum level 0 7 m these extreme levels are selected based on the historical lake level records fig 2 to represent different levels of flood risk for example lake monona exceeded the 0 7 m lake level during the 2008 and 2018 flood events which had major impacts on the city of madison and surroundings 3 2 modeling framework after we performed the exposure assessment under different lake levels we use a watershed scale modeling framework to simulate the linked river lake system in the yw with lake level management implementation to investigate the effects of the minimum lake level management on flood risk in the yw to build this modeling framework we adapt and link an agricultural version of the integrated biosphere simulator agro ibis kucharik 2003 with the terrestrial hydrology model with biogeochemistry thmb coe 1998 agro ibis simulates among other processes and quantities surface runoff and subsurface drainage for a variety of ecosystems and land cover types using agro ibis outputs as driver variables thmb simulates the in stream transport of water and the change of lake levels a more detailed description of these two models is provided in the following sections 3 3 and 3 4 this modeling framework has the capability to dynamically simulate daily streamflow and lake levels under the impacts of changing management land use land cover and climate and has been used previously in different regions and at coarser spatial scales but across larger spatial domains coe et al 2002 donner et al 2002 donner and kucharik 2003 coe et al 2008 3 3 agro ibis model description agro ibis is a 1 d land surface and dynamic ecosystem model that simulates the movement of water energy momentum carbon nitrogen and phosphorus through the soil vegetationatmosphere system foley et al 1996 kucharik et al 2000 kucharik 2003 the model has been validated across a range of ecosystems at different regions and time periods kucharik and brye 2003 kucharik and twine 2007 recently agro ibis was integrated with the soil water and energy transport routines from hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 to improve simulation of water soil vegetation interactions in the unsaturated zone soylu et al 2014 in the yw the updated agro ibis model has previously been validated at both the field scale soylu et al 2014 zipper et al 2015 and watershed scale motew et al 2017 3 4 thmb model description thmb is a physically based 2 d hydrologic routing model that combines prescribed river network information with calibrated parameterization of river morphological characteristics to simulate the flow and storage of water in hydrologic systems using linear reservoir functions coe 1998 coe 2000 thmb has been validated in various regions and at a range of scales coe et al 2002 donner et al 2002 donner and kucharik 2003 coe et al 2008 the version of thmb used for the yw is modified from the version of coe et al 2008 to include lake level simulation under regulation the original lake outflow equation to compute lake outflow under unmanaged conditions coe 1998 is replaced by eq 1 1 q out 2 3 2 g c l v 3 2 v l 3 2 a s 3 2 v l v q m v v l where q out m3 s is the lake outflow g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 c is the outflow coefficient which is obtained through calibration l m is the effective length of the crest gate width which is given by the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr 2001 v m3 is the current lake volume v l m3 is the management low volume a s m2 is the standard lake area and q m m3 s is the regulated minimum flow in eq 1 the first equation is a modified version of the spillway discharge equation in chow et al 1988 in our model lake volume v is simulated at each time step in thmb driven by meteorology and lake outflows the initial lake levels are prescribed based on the dem a detailed explanation of lake volume simulation in thmb is provided by coe 1998 and coe et al 2008 the levels of v l of each of the four lakes are calculated based on the model minimum lake levels mimicking the target minimum lake levels in table 1 as table 1 shows the minimum lake levels in the model are not the same as the target minimum lake levels the model minimum levels are obtained through calibration described in section 3 5 standard lake area a s is obtained from lathrop 1992 we assume that the lake area variability is negligible for outflow calculation and therefore a s is constant in eq 1 the minimum flow rate q m is set to 0 1 m3 s for all four lakes this flow rate is the lowest among the minimum outflow requirements of the four lakes according to krug 1999 the actual minimum flow varies with the lake level conditions but we simplify the minimum flow rate to a constant level of 0 1 m3 s because variability around this small discharge value does not substantially affect lake levels because of the simplicity of eq 1 short time scale hydrodynamic processes such as backwater effects are not considered in the model as a result the effect of high lake level management during extreme events which has been extensively studied reimer and wu 2016 is not investigated in this study we focus on the contribution and impact of minimum lake level regulations to yw flood risk and evaluate these effects from 1994 to 2013 3 5 data sources and model calibration weather data for input to agro ibis and thmb from 1986 to 2013 include daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation daily precipitation observations from a national weather service cooperative observer program coop weather station at the madison wisconsin airport coop id 474961 are used for the time period of 1986 2000 and applied across the watershed ncdc 2015 spatially variable radar derived daily precipitation estimates 4 km 4 km synthesized by the national centers for environmental prediction are used for the 2001 2013 time period ncep 2015 daily maximum and minimum air temperature and wind speed observations from the madison wisconsin airport coop id 474961 are used for the entire time period and applied across the model domain ncdc 2015 daily relative humidity and solar radiation observations for the complete study time period are obtained from a university of wisconsin extension weather station in arlington wisconsin which is located in the northern yw uw extension 2014 these weather data are applied across the entire domain land surface data collected for this study included land use land cover lulc elevation and population data dynamic lulc maps are compiled to determine lake extent and annual landscape composition consisting of 17 biophysically distinct categories and interpolated to the 220 m 220 m model grid in the period of 1986 2013 booth et al 2016 the land use land cover map of 2013 is used for the flood vulnerability assessment in this study lidar derived elevation data with a resolution of 1 5 m by 1 5 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 15 m are downloaded from the wisconsinview database ftp ftp ssec wisc edu pub wisconsinview lidar dane and used to determine the potential flood affected area furthermore we collect 10 m resolution elevation data from usgs ned dataset and resample the data to 220 m spatial resolution to match agro ibis the resampled elevation data is used to derive the stream network for thmb modeling block level population data was obtained from the u s census bureau to determine the number of people potentially impacted by lake flooding u s census bureau 2015 for model calibration and validation purposes observations of streamflow from six gages and lake level from four gages are obtained from the u s geological survey s national water information system usgs 2015 streamflow simulation and realism in thmb has been discussed in depth in previous studies coe et al 2002 2008 and therefore will not be a focus of validation here nevertheless the performance of streamflow simulation will be shown in the results section the lake level simulation calibration in thmb is performed by comparing the observed daily lake levels with simulations adjusting the model minimum lake levels and outflow coefficients of the four lakes we calibrate the parameters of each lake sequentially from upstream to downstream the best fit parameters are selected based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of simulations the model minimum lake levels table 1 rows 5 and 6 are not the same as the target minimum lake levels table 1 rows 2 and 3 because the target minimum lake levels are reference levels that guide management decision making rather than the actual minimum lake levels that are observed we choose the period of 2004 2013 as the calibration period and 1994 2003 as the validation period 3 6 model simulation and sensitivity analysis after calibration and validation we use the calibrated model to investigate the effect of minimum lake level management on flood risk and ecosystem health specifically we conduct a new simulation with a model minimum lake level 0 1 m lower than the calibrated value at lake mendota representing an alternative management strategy then we compare this simulation result with the original modeling result in terms of high and low lake levels for high lake levels we compare the potential exposure of land area and population under different peak levels using the same method described in section 3 1 for low lake levels the winter target minimum levels are absolute minimums low winter lake levels may adversely affect hibernating aquatic species and damage fish habitats county of dane 2010 therefore we count the number of days that the lake level is below the target winter minimum levels to evaluate the effect of minimum lake level management on ecosystem health we select lake mendota for this analysis because it is the largest lake of the four and the south side of the lakeshore area is highly urbanized the management of lake level at mendota is crucial to the safety and economic development of the local community as well as the health of ecosystems in the region this analysis is conducted during the calibration period of 2004 2013 furthermore we conduct a sensitivity analysis of daily water levels under different model minimum levels at all four lakes to gain a complete picture about the impact of minimum lake level management using the current lake level control strategy as the base line we evaluate 6 alternative strategies for each of the 3 dams we increase decrease the minimum levels by 0 1 m respectively the sensitivity analysis is also conducted during the calibration period of 2004 2013 4 results 4 1 assessment of exposure to flooding we first investigate the exceedance frequency of lake levels based on the historical period with data from all four lakes 2004 2018 fig 2 relative to the target maximum lake levels listed in table 1 in fig 2 monona and waubesa exceed target maximum levels most frequently while kegonsa and mendota have lower exceedance frequency of target maximum levels with kegonsa being the lowest also mendota shows a larger range of low lake levels approximately 0 m to 0 6 m than the other lakes approximately 0 m to 0 5 m indicating low lake levels are more common in mendota this comparison reflects the lake level range and potential flood risk of the four lakes in the 2004 2018 time period however 15 years is a relatively short period to analyze lake level distributions therefore we also plot the exceedance frequency curves based on long term 1916 2018 records for mendota and monona only these two lakes have long term records both lakes show a general increasing frequency of high lake levels in the modern record compared to long term data fig 4 for example the extreme rainfall that occurred during the first half of june 2008 caused the lake level in monona to exceed its 100 year return period level also the more recent storm event of august 2018 coupled with heavy rainfall in may and early june 33 cm from may 1 to june 15 2018 that increased lake levels above maximum targets caused monona waubesa and kegonsa to exceed their 100 year return period levels the increase in high water level occurrences in yw is an important temporal change to note in terms of the exposed land area and population as expected lakeshore areas of mendota and monona have the highest exposed urban area and population among the four lakes since they are the closest to madison s urban core fig 5 a and b waubesa has a smaller developed area and lower population density than monona but a relatively low elevation around the lakeshore area and therefore a larger potentially flooded area but smaller exposed population relative to mendota and monona fig 5c the outlying landscape surrounding kegonsa away from the shoreline is largely undeveloped surrounded by wetlands and croplands therefore kegonsa has the lowest exposed urban area and population and the highest exposed agricultural area fig 5d based on the flood exposure assessment results the four lakes lakeshore areas are facing varied levels of flood risk which are closely related to the extreme lake levels in the following sections we use a modeling approach to investigate the impact of minimum lake level management on the daily and extreme lake levels in the yw 4 2 lake level model results after calibration the linked agro ibis and thmb models simulate lake levels at a daily timestep fig 6 with satisfactory values of nse and r2 during the calibration period for all lakes moriasi et al 2007 since lake level simulation is closely related to streamflow simulation in our modeling framework the streamflow simulation performance is presented in fig 7 more detailed information about streamflow simulation in terms of individual location performance and map of stream gauges is provided in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2 model validation of lake level simulation is only performed at mendota and monona since only these two lakes have a long historical record of lake levels that covers the validation period the performance of lake level simulation in the validation period fig 6e and f is not as good as in the calibration period one possible explanation for differing performance between the two intervals is that lake level management strategies have changed over time even with the same target maximum and minimum lake levels while management in our model is constant over the entire calibration and validation period the model performance indicates that the modified spillway discharge equation eq 1 is able to simulate daily lake levels with minimum lake level management at least under non extreme conditions we also compare the observed and simulated lake level exceedance frequency curves fig 8 we compute r2 values between the frequency curves and also the percentage differences of the accumulated area of the simulated frequency curve from the observed frequency curve da the model performs well at mendota r2 0 983 da 0 002 fig 8a for monona r2 0 973 da 0 004 the model tends to underestimate the lake level in extreme events with exceedance frequency lower than 0 2 fig 8b the model also performs well at waubesa r2 0 985 da 0 001 with a similar slight underestimation of lake level for extreme events fig 8c for kegonsa r2 0 989 da 0 002 the model underestimates lake levels when the exceedance frequency is higher than 0 4 fig 8d in general the model underestimates lake levels during extreme events except for kegonsa where the lake level is underestimated during normal level and low level periods this underestimation may be due to different lake level management operation decisions from event to event also hydrodynamic processes such as backwater effects are not considered in our model which may also cause underestimation of extreme lake levels 4 3 minimum lake level management impact assessment and sensitivity analysis to quantitatively assess the effect of minimum lake level management of lake mendota we conduct a comparison analysis as described in section 3 6 by decreasing the model minimum lake level by 0 1 m the water levels at mendota are generally lower than the baseline condition fig 9 as a result the peak level will be lower during extreme events with this alternative management strategy such as the one in june 2008 budikova et al 2010 however the low lake levels will be further decreased with this strategy we use the peak lake level at mid june 2008 as a representative event to evaluate the effect of minimum lake level management on flood risk mitigation the peak level decreases from 259 77 m to 259 67 m with the change of model minimum lake level table 2 correspondingly the potentially exposed land area decreases from 8 04 km2 to 6 09 km2 and the potentially exposed population decreases from 4916 to 3403 in the mendota lakeshore area on the other hand during the analysis period of 2004 2013 the total number of days that lake mendota is below the target winter minimum lake level increases from 45 to 203 with the new management strategy to systematically investigate the impact of minimum lake level management changes on daily lake levels in the yw we perform a sensitivity analysis on model minimum lake levels for each lake the daily lake levels under different model minimum lake levels are compared using exceedance frequency curves for all four lakes the minimum levels significantly affect daily levels increasing or decreasing the minimum level by 0 1 m will lead to a nearly uniform increase or decrease of the lake level by 0 1 m respectively fig 10 however changes in the upstream dam minimum levels show little to no effect on lake levels in downstream lakes 5 discussion 5 1 a balance between flood control and other ecosystem services based on our modeling and analysis results we observe that reducing model minimum lake levels has a relatively uniform effect on daily lake levels one that mitigates flood risk but may make the minimum lake level requirements for ecological or recreational services harder to achieve while our study focused on the response of flooding to minimum lake level management the yahara lakes have diverse functions lakes provide aquatic habitats for a variety of species and support recreational activities such as boating fishing and swimming qiu and turner 2013 qiu et al 2018a b as a result lake level management faces a complex challenge to maintain the balance among different lake functions which require different water levels ylag2 2012 this is a general management dilemma both in the yw and in many lake catchment systems around the world i e christensen et al 2016 yang et al 2016 hyatt et al 2015 and has long been identified as a formidable task young 1968 day and weisz 1976 morales hernández et al 2013 to optimize the multifunctional lake level management a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of lake levels on competing interests is required 5 2 the importance of high lake level management controlling for high lake levels associated with extreme rainfall and high runoff events is another important perspective of lake level management the timing and amount of water release from the three local dams in the yw are critical for flood control during and after extreme rainfall which changes from event to event in order to simulate flood control during extreme events a hydrodynamic model with high spatial and temporal resolution is required this is not the functional purpose of our model in future studies we would like to combine our watershed modeling framework with a hydrodynamic model such as the integrated nowcast and forecast operation system infos reimer and wu 2016 to investigate the effects of both long term minimum lake level regulations and the impacts of lake level management during extreme rainfall and subsequent runoff events in the yw 5 3 other possible drivers of change on lake level management a particularly challenging aspect of lake level management is that stakeholders in the yw have varying opinions on what are the most important lake level management goals residents in the lakeshore area may favor flood protection wisconsin initiative on climate change impacts 2011 while offshore residents are concerned more about the health of the lake ecosystem and accessibility of recreational activities in the lakes carpenter et al 2007 as a result the interaction between people s preferences may also affect lake level management in the yw in order to investigate this interaction socioeconomic information such as flood insurance economic growth and or public perceptions are required di baldassarre et al 2017 which is a potential future research need to further integrate socio hydrologic feedbacks sivapalan et al 2012 in addition changes in climate and land use land cover may alter streamflow into the lakes the impact of climate change and land use land cover change on flood risk and lake level management is an on going research endeavor following this study 6 conclusions in this study we assessed the potential exposure to flooding of the lakeshore areas in the yw based on historical records monona has the highest frequency of exceeding its target maximum lake level among the four lakes furthermore of the four lakes mendota and monona have relatively high exposed populations in terms of exposed land area mendota monona and waubesa all have a large amount of exposed urban area we then investigated the effect of lake regulation and management on lake levels with a focus on management of target minimum levels using a modeling approach with the calibrated modeling framework we compared the high and low water levels at lake mendota under two different model minimum lake levels by decreasing the model minimum level by 0 1 m the simulated peak water level in the major flood event of mid june 2008 will decrease by about 0 1 m and as a result the exposed land area and population in lakeshore area of mendota will decrease by 24 3 and 30 8 respectively however decreasing the model minimum level by 0 1 m will also cause an increase of the number of days that lake mendota is below the target winter minimum level from 45 to 206 during the study period of 2004 2013 which may have adverse effects on local aquatic ecosystems we also conducted a sensitivity analysis on model minimum lake levels at all four lakes and demonstrated that decreasing model minimum lake levels will reduce the frequency of extremely high lake levels results indicate that focusing on management of minimum lake levels will have a direct effect on high water levels with a 10 cm change in minimum lake level translating to nearly a 10 cm drop in water level across the spectrum of exceedance frequencies on all four lakes recognition of the control of minimum water level management in lake chains may help mitigate flood risks in the yw and other similar watersheds however lower minimum levels will also reduce lake levels during dry periods potentially impacting recreational activities and lake ecosystems managing lake levels requires consideration of trade offs between flood protection and other ecosystem services and optimizing lake level management will require a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of lake levels on competing interests future research should attempt to link our watershed model with hydrodynamic models in order to investigate 1 the effectiveness of maximum lake level control during extreme events another lake level management challenge and 2 the impact of climate change and land use land cover change on flood risk in the yw declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we acknowledge funding from the us national science foundation including

urbanisation and riparian shading on indicators of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen concentration by way of a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of model structural uncertainty results are presented from two alternative formulations of the biological response all outputs from each unique combination of stressors are presented in one graphic comprising multiple sub plots that display the results of thousands of model runs simultaneously consequently graphical analysis allows us to pinpoint under what circumstances reductions in key variables representing management related stressors i e lowering phosphorus concentrations and establishing riparian shading may act synergistically antagonistically or simply in an additive manner furthermore we identify how these relationships may vary under different river flow and water temperature regimes and changes in abstraction and effluent discharge rates to indicate the likely influence of future climate and population growth response can vary markedly depending on the choice of biological model and also changes considerably downstream along the river system chlorophyll indicators consistently show antagonistic responses to reduction in stressors whereas dissolved oxygen indicators show varied and complex responses as expected increases in phosphorus loading are detrimental but so too are large decreases whilst the analysis suggests that urbanisation impacts are in general not expected to be large changes in water demand brought about by population growth have disproportionate effects at low flows these may result in increased incidence of very low dissolved oxygen concentrations which damage the health of the ecosystem keywords eutrophication river water quality model river thames graphical analysis multi stressors 1 introduction global water resources are affected by a complex mixture of stressors resulting from a range of drivers including intensification of land use and climate change across the full spectrum of european river types 90 of lowland rivers experience pressure from combinations of hydrological morphological and water quality stressors schinegger et al 2012 understanding when and how these stressors interact to alter ecological status is essential for developing effective river basin management plans and influencing environmental policy hering et al 2015 jackson et al 2016 yet it is challenging to untangle individual stressor contributions without very comprehensive observations dafforn et al 2016 river phytoplankton blooms represent a key threat to water quality and the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems smith and schindler 2009 pressurising anthropogenic water use particularly under projected future climate bussi et al 2016 essential to managing blooms effectively is better understanding of their timing magnitude and duration and their physical and chemical controls whilst elevated chlorophyll concentrations are indicative of blooms it is the effects on dissolved oxygen do which provide strong and holistic indicators of the wider health of river ecosystems consequently preventing low do concentrations which are harmful across various trophic levels e g for fish and benthic macro invertebrates at 3 4 mg do l 1 garvey et al 2007 is a primary objective of the eu water framework directive oxygen concentrations are influenced by numerous factors including a photosynthesis and associated autotrophic respiration b water temperature c aeration and mixing d microbial decay of organic matter cox 2003 as phytoplankton blooms develop they become increasingly susceptible to a population crash rendering rivers vulnerable to oxygen depletion following their decay oxygen concentration in turn influences biological responses with low levels causing biotic impairment comte et al 2010 in such complex systems of abiotic biotic feedback it is difficult to separate the influences of individual stressors rode et al 2016 therefore in large basins evaluating impacts on do of changes in stressor combinations is somewhat intractable considerable uncertainties in do response are in part directly attributable to incomplete understanding of phytoplankton behaviour nguyen and willems 2016 it is commonly assumed in river quality models chapra 1997 that a species or group of phytoplankton will take advantage of conditions whatever the temperature various observations support this assumption e g in the meuse descy et al 2003 and loire descy et al 2012 however cool water diatom species proliferate and dominate the phytoplankton assemblage in many cases jeong et al 2007 moreover in the river thames uk the subject of the present study phytoplankton biomass appears suppressed in mid summer possibly due to short lived nutrient limitation together with biological interactions e g control by grazers at higher trophic levels waylett et al 2013 bowes et al 2016 hence an alternative hypothesis of biological response is that phytoplankton biomass is dominated by cool water diatom species which bloom in spring and early summer combined effects of stressor interactions can be categorised after brown et al 2013 as a additive where there is no interaction and so the overall effect is the sum of their effects in isolation b synergistic where the combined effect of two stresses is greater than the additive expectation c antagonistic where the combined effect is less than the additive expectation d mitigating where the effects of the two stressors cancel one another out e opposing where the relationship switches from being additive to mitigating as one of the stressors increases 1 1 observational studies categorising multiple stressor effects multi stressor studies considering impacts on do are scarce although long term lake monitoring studies of climate and land management impacts have been undertaken e g north et al 2013 in contrast empirical statistical analyses from numerous observational studies have identified impacts of stressor combinations on aquatic biota schinegger et al 2012 cite a wide breadth of studies identifying effects in habitats and organisms across a european wide river survey some survey based studies specifically categorise how stressors interact using empirical approaches linked to process based modelling segurado et al 2018 identified complex responses of fish and macrophyte biodiversity in portuguese rivers to combinations of nutrient and flow stress characterising opposing and antagonistic relationships in multi stressed danish headwaters mitigation of single stressors is unlikely to have substantial benefits on benthic macroinvertebrate communities rasmussen et al 2013 in smaller streams controlled experiments have characterised both synergistic wagenhoff et al 2012 and antagonistic townsend et al 2008 macroinvertebrate response to interactive nutrient and sediment stress the range of stressors has sometimes been widened to consider climate driven pressure whereby complex macroinvertebrate responses were found elbrecht et al 2016 piggott et al 2015 which also depended on whether biota were assessed at population or community level due to the diversity of findings from controlled experiments synthesising and scaling up understanding to larger rivers is not straightforward nevertheless bringing findings together from over 250 monitoring and controlled experiments jackson et al 2016 categorised biotic response to paired stressors and identified antagonistic interaction to be most prevalent 41 followed by synergistic 28 additive 16 and mitigating 15 of these studies focusing on primary producers such as phytoplankton revealed synergistic relations to be more prevalent than the additive or antagonistic responses typically found for macroinvertebrates 1 2 computational approaches to assessing multiple stressors the inconsistencies apparent from observational studies imply considerable system complexity whilst basin scale process based river modelling studies are abundant hipsey et al 2015 found that applications have primarily related degradation of aquatic habitat to water quality deterioration under specific scenarios with limited exploitation of their potential to make more generic characterisation of responses arising from different combinations of stressors historically however infrequent biological observations fail to match the high resolution possible with physical and chemical measurement e g rode et al 2016 thereby limiting the value of ecosystem assessment dafforn et al 2016 advances in biomonitoring science and earth observation are now allowing much more comprehensive datasets of stressors and response variables such as chlorophyll hunter et al 2008 to be compiled at large scales with consequent improvements in process based ecological modelling in turn the advent of high performance computing has widened the scope for defining the nature of multi stressor response relationships which is now possible even in the absence of driving data by undertaking increasingly exhaustive sensitivity analysis of stressor combinations and their impacts 1 3 aims and objectives the importance of abiotic biotic feedbacks physical factors and climatic variables in addition to nutrient levels in controlling phytoplankton and do in large rivers has been widely demonstrated e g hardenbicker et al 2014 istvanovics et al 2009 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 bowes et al 2016 minaudo et al 2018 however whilst detailed these contrasting studies highlight that understanding arising of multi stressor impacts cannot be comprehensive instead being largely rudimentary typically only providing snapshots rather than response along stressor gradients of a system from their work on the thames bussi et al 2016 highlight that modelling studies often only cover two climatic stressors and recommend that sensitivity of model output should be assessed more systematically in terms of a greater number of stressor variables the aim of the present study was to make an ensemble of water quality model applications to assess the sensitivity of eutrophication in the thames to a range of stressor variables and to develop a method for representing the outputs five stressor variables were chosen water temperature phosphate concentration river flow urbanisation and riparian shading to which eutrophication in the thames is known to be especially sensitive waylett et al 2013 bowes et al 2016 hutchins et al 2018 the variables themselves reflect a range of pressure types including those related to climate catchment management and population growth individually they are not directly mappable to specific pressures in isolation such as agricultural pollution or increased water demand however as a group of variables together they are a useful proxy for assessing the sensitivity of river water to a wide range of commonly occurring pressures acting in combination our analysis although enabling us to provide some advice for managers does not have a primary aim of identifying a detailed set of guidelines to achieve the aims of the study main constituent objectives are to establish a method of visualising eutrophication responses comprehensively and concisely to execute a sensitivity analysis of the five stressors and to demonstrate their impact on three summary indicators of eutrophication derived from chlorophyll a and do concentrations to detect which stressors predominate and identify different types of relationship additive synergistic antagonistic mitigating etc acting on do and chlorophyll a indicators from stressor pairs to repeat the analysis using two contrasting versions of the model so as to evaluate the impact of uncertainty reflecting incomplete understanding of biological processes controlling eutrophication whilst ultimately of fundamental importance the present study cannot identify which version of the two contrasting biological models representing the two specific competing hypotheses of biological response described earlier is best this would require considerable additional biological monitoring and targeted experimental work instead using the two model versions we illustrate how uncertainty in understanding of the biological system affects the multi stressor assessment differing impacts on chlorophyll a indicators arising from change in temperature stress are to be expected from the contrasting model formulations but any dissimilarity in the nature of other stress response interactions is far less clear therefore we distinguish those circumstances of multiple stress where there is agreement as opposed to disagreement between models thereby identifying where we can already be confident of making an appropriate management decision and conversely where a better system understanding is necessary prior to prescribing interventions 2 method 2 1 eutrophication and multiple stressors in the river thames the river thames fig 1 with a catchment area of 9948 km2 marsh and hannaford 2008 extends upstream from the tidal limit for 257 km and is the largest river wholly in england receiving mean annual rainfall of 720 mm marsh and hannaford 2008 the river basin is a source of water to 14 million people whitehead et al 2015 and receives waste from almost 4 million inhabitants kinniburgh and barnett 2009 the upper thames basin is predominantly underlain by oolitic limestone with cretaceous chalk in the lower catchment it is largely rural despite being highly populous the dominant land classification being arable 45 with only 6 urban suburban ample nutrient supply to the river sustains phytoplankton nitrate n and total phosphorus at wallingford in recent years always exceeding 1 4 and 0 09 mg l 1 respectively bowes et al 2012 nitrate concentrations appear always to be in excess e g halliday et al 2016 the basin is very suitable for assessing multi stressor impacts on river eutrophication given the intensity of land use and the proliferation of controlled experimental research and long term monitoring activities e g do measurements extend back to the work of kowalczewski and lack 1971 which have supported process based modelling studies modelling has revealed that intensification of agriculture has accentuated phytoplankton growth especially in the upper reaches bussi et al 2016 nevertheless whilst controlled experimental work in the thames bowes et al 2011 and high frequency monitoring in the enborne tributary halliday et al 2016 concur that there is evidence of phytoplankton growth in unshaded sections being at times limited by phosphate concentrations they both clearly suggest that establishing riparian shading would be more effective at curtailing blooms monitoring bowes et al 2016 and modelling waylett et al 2013 studies have both implied that coincidence of conditions bringing favourable temperature sufficient sunshine and low flow is necessary to support phytoplankton growth future scenarios have been explored in modelling studies assessing a spectrum of future changes in climate land use and water resources management crossman et al 2013 identified that the extent to which efforts should be focused on reducing point sources as opposed to agricultural sources of phosphate depends on the future hydrological conditions hutchins et al 2016 expect do to decline but uncertainty surrounding how the phytoplankton community responds between april and october and how future climate will influence river flows and physical properties makes prediction of the prevalence of low do conditions uncertain 2 2 questor model representation of the thames theory and performance water quality simulation undertaken at daily resolution uses applications of the 1d questor river network model waylett et al 2013 hutchins et al 2016 and focuses on a 126 4 km upper stretch of the river network between hannington and wallingford comprising the cherwell and thame tributaries and the main thames of lengths 14 9 19 6 and 91 9 km respectively the network is split into 41 reaches and is fed by 23 tributaries and 7 major sewage treatment works stws also accounting for 2 abstractions and 22 weirs the main abstraction of mean flow 1 62 m3 s 1 at farmoor reservoir effectively reduces mean flow at wallingford by about 5 model outputs are presented at abingdon site 3 69 km downstream of hannington draining an area of 1616 km2 and wallingford site 4 92 km downstream with catchment area of 3445

nitrification denitrification phosphorus mineralisation decay of bod benthic oxygen demand aeration and sedimentation of bod suspended sediment and particulate forms of n and p in conjunction with a biological sub model representing growth respiration and death of phytoplankton which includes nutrient uptake and release equations fully describing do bod temperature and chlorophyll a are provided appendix 1 two of the biological models tested by waylett et al 2013 were used a mixed phytoplankton model denoted mp primarily composed of diatoms and chlorophytes green algae and a stephanodiscus hantzschii version denoted sh stephanodiscus hantzschii is a cool water diatom assumed to dominate phytoplankton populations in the river thames between the two models the photosynthetic growth rate biomass represented by chlorophyll a concentration differs in its relationship with temperature eqs 1 and 2 equation 1 photosynthetic rate with respect to biomass and temperature for the mixed

sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for flow and temperature which are not affected by calibration or model version always exceed 0 9 and 0 8 respectively when comparing results from daily resolution applications of the two models with observations table 1 nutrients are simulated better by sh than mp for dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a it is unclear which model performs better as might be expected from equations 1 and 2 the models differ considerably in terms of chlorophyll a simulation as illustrated for site 4 appendix 2a the sh model usually simulates higher concentrations in spring whereas highest chlorophyll a concentrations simulated by the mp model occur in mid summer as a consequence some differences in the simulated do time series also arise appendix 2b in the calibration period the sh model simulates the dynamics more satisfactorily in terms of chlorophyll but less so in terms of do the sh model represents the spring bloom better than mp but also simulates similar levels in the autumn when substantial blooms have not been seen therefore for chlorophyll higher positive values of percent error in mean pbias tend to arise when using sh in terms of chlorophyll a and do the mp model appears more robust under validation conditions 2 3 questor sensitivity analysis framework we undertake a sensitivity analysis using the questor model considering gradients of each of the five stressor variables defined in a framework river flow reflecting climate drivers m3 s 1 denoted b phosphate concentrations in effluents and tributaries reflecting management of pollution loads from point and diffuse sources mg l 1 c water temperature reflecting climate drivers c d urbanisation size of abstractions and stw effluents reflecting population growth and also change in water use efficiency e tree shading reflecting riparian zone management in terms of percent bankside occupancy by trees then equated to fractional penetration of global radiation f the framework consists of between 5 and 9 change factors applied to each of the stressor variables for completion other variables which required specification for the model applications but remained invariant for each model application in the sensitivity analysis are denoted a these variables were bod ph nitrate pon ammonia chloride suspended sediment and chlorophyll a for the sensitivity analysis questor model applications were made for the 4 year period from 2009 to 2012 for each combination of the above factors resulting in an ensemble of 8100 model runs the stressor variables and the other variables set a form the upstream boundary conditions of the model the baseline conditions are taken from present day time series of the stressor variables for each tributary abstraction and effluent influence in the thames network hutchins et al 2016 describe their use as defined from periodic monitoring data for other sets of time series along the five stressor gradients input datasets used by the model were constructed by applying the change factors table 2 to the time series for each influence the model runs were carried out using cirrus the nerc hosted high performance cluster located at ceh wallingford river flow baseline data was provided by the national river flow archive nrfa at daily intervals the change factors applied to river flow range from x0 8 to x1 2 in line with the outcomes of available scenarios observed in ukpc09 x0 3 to x1 4 murphy et al 2009 bussi pers comm 29th oct 2016 using rainfall and temperature data from ukcip09 estimated likely change in annual flow at farmoor site 2 on fig 1 this is illustrated as a probability distribution function fig 2 the lower boundary of x0 2 for change in phosphorus concentrations is guided by a scenario where the best available sewage treatment technology has been implemented and best agricultural practices are employed charlton et al 2018 the maximum change factor of x3 0 is taken from a study undertaken as part of the mars project managing aquatic ecosystems and water resources under multiple stress eu fp7 grant agreement 603378 as the worst case scenario based on socio economic projections derived by a group of european experts hutchins et al 2018 the chosen water temperature change factors range from 1 c to 4 c and are based upon air temperature ranges defined by bussi et al 2016 0 5 to 3 5 c which are taken from uk climate projections 2009 ukcp09 scenarios water temperature is estimated from air temperature using a linear relationship hutchins et al 2016 for flow phosphorus and water temperature variables the baseline upon which the change factors were applied were tributary specific averages from weekly monitoring in 2009 12 the urbanisation factor relates to changes in water extraction and effluent release into the thames a predicted population increase of 16 is predicted by 2035 ons 2015 change factors range from x0 8 in a scenario where there has been more efficient water usage and or some form of population decrease i e emigration to x1 24 in a scenario where population has increased and water usage has not changed the upper change factor is constrained by the upper limit of water supply infrastructure in the catchment i e the size and capacity of farmoor reservoir an urbanisation factor of x1 5 was originally included but this periodically resulted in river flow drying up implying that such a change in demand would be unsustainable under present water management daily global radiation data was provided from little rissington near the river windrush in gloucestershire ngr 4299 2107 by the british atmospheric datacentre midas landsat data the raw global radiation data was scaled between 0 and 80 in 20 increments to represent changes in the management of riparian zone vegetation using the findings of dewalle 2008 these scenarios equate to fractional light penetration levels under full leaf canopies of 1 0 87 0 73 0 60 and 0 46 respectively in winter it was assumed that fractional light penetration is always maximum between winter and summer and vice versa transitional periods of 35 days were assumed of these scenarios 0 represents a situation where all riverside trees are felled and 80 where they are actively increased in number to provide greater shading of the channel 2 4 graphical analysis using contour plots the results were assessed using graphical techniques carried out at selected points of interest e g in this case sites 3 and 4 of fig 1 along the river network the analysis focussed on chlorophyll a and do for reasons outlined in the introduction three indicators generated from the model outputs are presented two percentiles and a third representing days exceeding a threshold i the 90th percentile chlorophyll a concentration denoted 90 chl is a measure of river eutrophication indicating excessive primary production of phytoplankton hutchins et al 2010 ii the 10th percentile dissolved oxygen concentration denoted 10 do is an indicator of ecosystem health used in implementation of the eu water framework directive iii a threshold of 6 mg do l 1 more specifically pinpoints the incidence of harmful conditions hutchins et al 2016 denoted low do days ldod and summed over the four year period of model applications for each indicator when calculated for each model application this is then converted into the graphical output a suite of contour plots using a colour blind friendly colour scheme showing the sensitivity of levels of each of the three indicators to change in a pair of stressors was generated for each combination of parameters resulting in 10 suites of plots flow vs phosphorus flow vs water temperature flow vs urbanisation flow vs riparian shading phosphorus vs water temperature phosphorus vs urbanisation phosphorus vs riparian shading example shown appendix 3 water temperature vs urbanisation water temperature vs riparian shading urbanisation vs riparian shading within each combination the other parameters were used to arrange the plots in a way allowing maximum information to be gleaned from the model outputs for example when comparing the flow and phosphate stressors the urbanisation stressor was used to group the plots and the shading and temperature stressors to order the plots within each urbanisation factor block see appendix 3 the modelling system has capability to generate the graphical analysis for each of the 41 reaches and each combination of stressors as outlined in section 1 the main types of stressor relationships expected to be shown by the three indicators were additive antagonistic synergistic mitigating and opposing a conceptual schematic of the contour patterns fig 3 represents these different relationships exhibited in response to changing levels of pairs of stressors increasing stress is represented along both axes from the origin in the bottom left hand corner it was anticipated these relationships would be manifested in the presentation of full ensemble sets of 8100 results for each of the two models appendix 3 3 results and discussion the section comprises the following narrative 1 firstly scatterplots fig 4 are presented illustrating that relationships between the three indicators of eutrophication are not straightforward section 3 1 2 we then present a key fig 5 which explains the contour plots legends and their interpretation regarding change in stress from present day conditions and results for all 10 combinations of stressor pairs are presented for each indicator and each model appendix 5 figs 6 8 section 3 2 3 finally the stressor pair representing management factors riparian shading and phosphorus concentrations is plotted on 180 graphs representing all 8100 combinations of the five stressors appendix 6 8 fig 8 this illustrates how the effects of change in the management stressors p shading differ under varying conditions of the remaining stressors flow temperature urbanisation section 3 3 4 discussion of the implications of the results in terms of uncertainty and prescribing management interventions section 3 4 3 1 relationships between indicators of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen scatterplots fig 4 which relate the three indicators defined in section 2 4 show that comparing the results from all 8100 applications simultaneously from both models demonstrates that there is only a weak relationship between 10 do and 90 chl there is visual evidence that some of the variation in the relationship between these summary indicators may be explicable in terms of water temperature figs 4a 4b and shading appendix 4a b it is evident that the relationship between phytoplankton biomass and do is clearly very complex even as represented in a simplified modelled system high 90 chl does not necessarily give rise to low 10 do this is not surprising as knowing whether or not the conditions arise that bring about growth limiting conditions and population crashes depends on many factors coming together in time and space and is intractable these issues are revisited in detail below by assessing possible causal factors using contour plots also there are difference between the models which are primarily a result of the differing relations with temperature and these are discussed in the following sections and summarised in section 3 4 this display of model results also allows comparison of all model runs between different sites see figs 4c and 4d here the relationship between 10 do and ldod reveals large changes downstream along the river system in terms of the incidence of conditions where do falls below 6 mg l 1 the nature of the change is different depending on the choice of model with a worsening situation downstream mp model contrasting with slight improvements downstream sh model 3 2 how do indicators vary as stressors pairs change relative to present day conditions the contour plots presented in section 3 all have the same legend fig 5 they should be interpreted in terms of increasing or decreasing stress see example on fig 5 for phosphorus and shading stressor pairs which itself illustrates a complex picture with mostly additive areas of parallel contours but also some antagonistic areas of curved contours effects note the direction of increasing decreasing stress for the two stressors in fig 5 is different from the idealised concepts illustrated in fig 3 contour plots for the 10 different stressor pairs for each of the three indicators and for the two different biological models reveal much variation in the three indicators and in relationships between pairs a selection of these are shown on figs 6 8 with the full set presented in appendix 5 fig 6 illustrates the variability of 90 chl responses as represented under the sh model to different stressor pairs although synergistic characteristics in the responses are commonplace fig 7 reveals that for 10 do the two models provide broadly similar patterns of response to a variety of additional combined stress despite showing different sensitivity to a primary flow stressor fig 8 summarises the responses of 90 chl and 10 do to the combination of phosphorus and shading stressors and shows how they compare under the two biological models the outputs for each different combination of stressors include the present day conditions as indicated in bold in table 2 and by the red dots on figs 6 8 throughout the plots also demonstrate many examples of the difference in behaviour of the two models 3 2 1 types of response relationships pairs of stressors to which the output indicators are particularly sensitive can be identified neutral relationships i e where the output shows a gradient with respect to only one stressor not to the other are often seen especially for very steep contours of decrease in 90 chl when phosphorus concentrations are reduced appendix 5a e g fig 6a in other circumstances in the case of both models impacts of stressors on 90 chl appendix 5a e g fig 6b c and 8a show the strongest relationships to be almost always synergistic and sometimes also non linear more than one type of conceptual relationship fig 3 may be seen in different parts of the same plot e g appendix 5a notably fig 6a and also the corresponding mp model plot flow v phosphorus showing both neutral and synergistic patterns this complexity is apparent on many of the 10 do plots appendix 5b where opposing relationships are also found e g fig 7a conversely there are stressor pairs for which change makes little or no difference to an output indicator e g appendix 5a mp temp v urbanisation and appendix 5a sh flow v urbanisation appendices 5a and 5b also demonstrate as do fig 7c and g that urbanisation always has a negative but weak impact on the system this is likely to be a reflection of the largely rural nature of the catchment whereby a percentage increase in urban water use does not greatly impact the water balance for sh ldod is insensitive to almost all pairs appendix 5c as incidence of do below 6 mg l is rarely encountered in contrast for mp depending on the choice of pairs impacts on ldod are either additive or synergistic appendix 5c 3 2 2 specific response relationships arising from changes to climatic stressors clearly 10 do is less sensitive to changes in flow in the mp model than in the sh model fig 7 based on long term data from two rivers in temperate regions hardenbicker et al 2014 conclude that blooms in cool spring conditions are especially strongly regulated by flow as meteorological conditions are at their most variable at this time of year therefore due to its predilection for cooler conditions the spring bloom simulated in the sh model is larger than that corresponding in the mp model appendix 2 consequently it is perhaps to be expected that the sh model may show the greater sensitivity of 10 do to flow change in terms of responses to such changes in flow in conjunction with those of other stressors however both models show a degree of consistency slightly antagonistic relationships are apparent fig 7a and e under increasing temperature and decreasing flow i e moving from x 1 0 y 0 towards x 0 8 y 4 on fig 7a which is broadly indicative of future change in climate where respectively and y are the flow and temperature change factors from table 2 the models behave slightly differently with the decline in do being faster in the sh model relationships are different for the other indicators the effect on 90 chl in the sh model is slightly antagonistic fig 6d as stephanodiscus hantzschii has an optimum temperature cooler waters result in an increase in 90 chl however this optimum temperature is more readily seen during spring and autumn rather than summer times when flows are too high residence time is insufficient and sunlight too scarce for phytoplankton to multiply sufficiently in contrast 90 chl in the mp model shows no sensitivity which is to be expected as groups of phytoplankton should thrive under any temperature conditions in the sh model there is no occurrence of do below 6 mg l 1 ldod appendix 5c the 6 mg l 1 threshold is breached for the mp model in which case lowering flow and raising temperatures results in increasing incidence of ldod following a non linear additive relationship the generally differing responses to climate stressors demonstrate the importance of an appropriate choice of biological model 3 3 contour plots showing full set of sensitivity analysis results as displayed appendix 6 7 and 8 for 90 chl 10 do and ldod respectively the results from the full ensemble of 8100 model runs convey the multi stressor sensitivity analysis in one set of graphs in this case the plots illustrate the sensitivity of the output indicators to relationships between stressor variables which can be controlled by management phosphorus concentration x axis and shading y axis the plots are arranged systematically according to variation in the other three stressors as explained in appendix 3 this form of presentation portrays the combined effects of five stressors through graphical analysis which can reveal a comprehensive set of trends in the data the fine detail of which is unlikely to be captured using summary techniques based on statistical modelling for both models this is illustrated by the multi modal responses of 10 do for many of the stressors pairs appendix 7 e g fig 8c and d of particular note being the complex phosphorus temperature response of the mp model which is pervasive for all combinations of the other 3 stressors appendix 7a 3 3 1 90th percentile chlorophyll a for both models the indicator 90 chl always shows an antagonistic response when reducing stressors reducing p and increasing shade thereby moving towards the top left of set of plots appendix 6 increasing both stressors i e moving towards bottom right of each plot has a synergistic effect identification of these responses is in line with many of the findings of the meta analysis of jackson et al 2016 this has two important implications for managers i if there is a deterioration in one of the stressors it is important to ensure the other does not also deteriorate otherwise this will accelerate the negative effect ii for mitigation it is more effective to focus on one of the stressors rather than make smaller individual efforts in controlling both under present day conditions models indicate that light is likely the most limiting factor for algal growth however in terms of 90 chl an optimum level of light is never reached even under 0 shade for either the sh or mp models e g fig 8a and b the graphical analysis clearly demonstrates that phosphorus also has a limiting impact on phytoplankton growth when phosphorus no longer limits algal growth at levels slightly above those of present day flow residence time becomes the limiting factor e g fig 7b and f 3 3 2 10th percentile dissolved oxygen whilst the plots reveal a fairly simple consistent and largely to be expected situation in the case of 90 chl responses are very complicated for 10 do appendix 7 e g fig 8c and d which is not surprising given the wide scatter seen in fig 4 this is a result of multiple influences affecting do levels and is particularly complex for the mp model increasing both stressors results in strong synergistic relations for management this suggests that if an increase in shading cannot be made it is vital to prevent any fluctuation in phosphorus levels otherwise there will be a reduction in do the response of 10 do is very complex especially when considering the phosphorus level and the interplay between different combinations of stressors the mp model suggests that increasing or decreasing phosphorus results in a deterioration however for the sh model the optimum phosphorus is less than the present day value the sh model shows mostly additive relationships but can behave synergistically depending on flow levels the worst conditions for the sh model are where temperatures are cold and shading is low in contrast to the mp model where worst conditions are found at highest temperatures thereby suggesting that phytoplankton dynamics are dominant in controlling this facet of do response for the 10 do criterion there appears to be an optimum level of phosphorus as can be seen figs 7b f 8c and 8d this optimum level is around 80 of present day levels in the mp but approximately 30 of present day in the sh model complex relationships can occur when phosphorus levels are reduced especially when flow is higher and temperature lower than under present day conditions this demonstrates an opposing relationship fig 3e reducing phosphorus is beneficial but too great a reduction can have detrimental effects this is likely because p limiting conditions will become more prevalent with blooms thereby more frequently becoming unsustainable in these circumstances crashes in biomass occur leading to depletion of do through microbial breakdown of organic matter in terms of general guidance regarding mitigation this supports research suggesting that reducing shading is a particularly effective option bowes et al 2011 3 3 3 incidence of low dissolved oxygen when assessing change in phosphorus and shading similar behaviour is seen in the ldod response appendix 8 to that of 90 chl there are differences between the models incidence of ldod is rarely encountered under the sh model for the mp model a reduction in stressors from present day conditions results in antagonistic relationships whereas for increasing stressors response is synergistic in this case increasing urbanisation becomes important resulting in higher incidence of ldod this is because despite urban growth having little effect volumetrically at mean flow effects at low flows in summer are more important at these times the river system is especially vulnerable to adverse consequences of eutrophication the responses are sensitive to the geographic location of abstractions and effluent returns under a warmer drier and more urbanised future from a management perspective if an increase in shade cannot be established it is important not to let phosphorus levels change even if phosphorus were to be reduced the number of undesirable do days would increase 3 4 differences between the biological models and implications for mitigation we demonstrate that the choice of biological model used in the analysis is fundamental to the outcome of the study differences in the behaviours of the two models are apparent some of which are broadly predictable from the biological model formulations the sh model gives higher chlorophyll results than the mp model for example at site 4 under present day conditions 90 chl is 0 115 mg l 1 for sh but only 0 075 mg l 1 for mp however the sh model does not generate limiting conditions as readily as the mp model this means that although 10 do is generally slightly lower across all model applications mean of 8 63 mg l 1 for sh compared with 9 18 mg l 1 for mp there are fewer days when do falls below 6 mg l 1 this indicates that crashes in the system due to limitation and decay are less frequently reached in sh than for mp despite sh exhibiting larger blooms higher 90 chl however this situation appears to be highly site specific and appears markedly different upstream at abingdon figs 4c and 4d when both shading and flows are at their lowest the models are in accordance predicting low 10 do appendix 5b e g fig 7d and h however the models disagree when other stressors are also considered although an increase in phosphorus has consistently adverse effects on 10 do when using mp lowering phosphorus is also detrimental it appears that at high light levels the relationship between phosphorus and flow is complex and this is particularly the case under the mp model for mitigation of eutrophication in terms of the 10 do indicator establishing additional riparian shade will clearly be effective under sh model assumptions but the benefits are less obvious when using mp model appendix 7 e g fig 8c and d in contrast for the ldod indicator high levels of shade appear more beneficial under the mp model than the sh model appendix 8 these contradictions reflect subtle complexities nevertheless it seems that the choice of biological model is not critical when specifically assessing response to change in urbanisation or riparian shading stressors but it is important when also drawing out climate change considerations the graphical analysis has been valuable in identifying the subtle differences in behaviour of the two biological models 4 conclusions we developed a sensitivity analysis framework to assess five types of stressor water temperature phosphate concentration river flow urbanisation and riparian shading acting on river eutrophication as represented in a process based water quality model using graphical illustration we pinpointed findings in the context of model uncertainty by running two models one assuming a mixed population of phytoplankton mp the other assuming dominance by a cool water diatom stephanodiscus hantzschii sh the main findings are summarised as demonstrated by the wide scatter on fig 4 there is not a consistent response between the three chosen indicators of eutrophication to changes in any of the five stressors either individually or in combination knowledge of one indicator does not mean either of the others can be predicted impacts of changing stressor levels are likely to differ markedly downstream along a river network it is apparent that shading and phosphorus act antagonistically on indicators of phytoplankton biomass 90 chl for mitigation the overall effect of reducing both stressors is less than the sum of the individual effects increasing both stressors makes for a synergistic response the effect is largely consistent under all levels of the other three stressors the consequent impacts on do of changes in shading and phosphorus are far more complex although the factors controlling do are widely known the relationships presented graphically of great value to catchment managers could not have been foreseen without undertaking the sensitivity analysis presented there are circumstances where the models agree responses of do suggest the existence of optimum levels of phosphorus for both models the optimum is lower than at present day particularly in the case of sh in both cases it is apparent that not only would an increase in phosphorus loading to rivers be detrimental so would a decrease this is particularly evident in the case of mp whereupon under warmer and drier conditions of increased urbanisation a change in phosphorus level will bring about greater incidence of ecologically damaging do levels ldod in contrast if future conditions are to become warmer and drier the models show disparity of evidence this in part reflects the different ways in which they represent the influence of temperature on phytoplankton growth it also reinforces evidence of complex and uncertain responses of biota to temperature and flow conditions apparent from the observational work cited in section 1 1 overall the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that we should maintain attention on

6198,the severity of river eutrophication is influenced by multiple stressors which reflect a wide ranging variety of drivers encompassing land management population growth and climatic effects experimental studies have successfully identified response to single or paired stressors under controlled conditions in small streams but have limited capability to characterise larger systems influenced by a wider variety of stressors here a physics based water quality model of the river thames uk is used to explore the impacts of water temperature phosphate concentration river flow urbanisation and riparian shading on indicators of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen concentration by way of a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of model structural uncertainty results are presented from two alternative formulations of the biological response all outputs from each unique combination of stressors are presented in one graphic comprising multiple sub plots that display the results of thousands of model runs simultaneously consequently graphical analysis allows us to pinpoint under what circumstances reductions in key variables representing management related stressors i e lowering phosphorus concentrations and establishing riparian shading may act synergistically antagonistically or simply in an additive manner furthermore we identify how these relationships may vary under different river flow and water temperature regimes and changes in abstraction and effluent discharge rates to indicate the likely influence of future climate and population growth response can vary markedly depending on the choice of biological model and also changes considerably downstream along the river system chlorophyll indicators consistently show antagonistic responses to reduction in stressors whereas dissolved oxygen indicators show varied and complex responses as expected increases in phosphorus loading are detrimental but so too are large decreases whilst the analysis suggests that urbanisation impacts are in general not expected to be large changes in water demand brought about by population growth have disproportionate effects at low flows these may result in increased incidence of very low dissolved oxygen concentrations which damage the health of the ecosystem keywords eutrophication river water quality model river thames graphical analysis multi stressors 1 introduction global water resources are affected by a complex mixture of stressors resulting from a range of drivers including intensification of land use and climate change across the full spectrum of european river types 90 of lowland rivers experience pressure from combinations of hydrological morphological and water quality stressors schinegger et al 2012 understanding when and how these stressors interact to alter ecological status is essential for developing effective river basin management plans and influencing environmental policy hering et al 2015 jackson et al 2016 yet it is challenging to untangle individual stressor contributions without very comprehensive observations dafforn et al 2016 river phytoplankton blooms represent a key threat to water quality and the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems smith and schindler 2009 pressurising anthropogenic water use particularly under projected future climate bussi et al 2016 essential to managing blooms effectively is better understanding of their timing magnitude and duration and their physical and chemical controls whilst elevated chlorophyll concentrations are indicative of blooms it is the effects on dissolved oxygen do which provide strong and holistic indicators of the wider health of river ecosystems consequently preventing low do concentrations which are harmful across various trophic levels e g for fish and benthic macro invertebrates at 3 4 mg do l 1 garvey et al 2007 is a primary objective of the eu water framework directive oxygen concentrations are influenced by numerous factors including a photosynthesis and associated autotrophic respiration b water temperature c aeration and mixing d microbial decay of organic matter cox 2003 as phytoplankton blooms develop they become increasingly susceptible to a population crash rendering rivers vulnerable to oxygen depletion following their decay oxygen concentration in turn influences biological responses with low levels causing biotic impairment comte et al 2010 in such complex systems of abiotic biotic feedback it is difficult to separate the influences of individual stressors rode et al 2016 therefore in large basins evaluating impacts on do of changes in stressor combinations is somewhat intractable considerable uncertainties in do response are in part directly attributable to incomplete understanding of phytoplankton behaviour nguyen and willems 2016 it is commonly assumed in river quality models chapra 1997 that a species or group of phytoplankton will take advantage of conditions whatever the temperature various observations support this assumption e g in the meuse descy et al 2003 and loire descy et al 2012 however cool water diatom species proliferate and dominate the phytoplankton assemblage in many cases jeong et al 2007 moreover in the river thames uk the subject of the present study phytoplankton biomass appears suppressed in mid summer possibly due to short lived nutrient limitation together with biological interactions e g control by grazers at higher trophic levels waylett et al 2013 bowes et al 2016 hence an alternative hypothesis of biological response is that phytoplankton biomass is dominated by cool water diatom species which bloom in spring and early summer combined effects of stressor interactions can be categorised after brown et al 2013 as a additive where there is no interaction and so the overall effect is the sum of their effects in isolation b synergistic where the combined effect of two stresses is greater than the additive expectation c antagonistic where the combined effect is less than the additive expectation d mitigating where the effects of the two stressors cancel one another out e opposing where the relationship switches from being additive to mitigating as one of the stressors increases 1 1 observational studies categorising multiple stressor effects multi stressor studies considering impacts on do are scarce although long term lake monitoring studies of climate and land management impacts have been undertaken e g north et al 2013 in contrast empirical statistical analyses from numerous observational studies have identified impacts of stressor combinations on aquatic biota schinegger et al 2012 cite a wide breadth of studies identifying effects in habitats and organisms across a european wide river survey some survey based studies specifically categorise how stressors interact using empirical approaches linked to process based modelling segurado et al 2018 identified complex responses of fish and macrophyte biodiversity in portuguese rivers to combinations of nutrient and flow stress characterising opposing and antagonistic relationships in multi stressed danish headwaters mitigation of single stressors is unlikely to have substantial benefits on benthic macroinvertebrate communities rasmussen et al 2013 in smaller streams controlled experiments have characterised both synergistic wagenhoff et al 2012 and antagonistic townsend et al 2008 macroinvertebrate response to interactive nutrient and sediment stress the range of stressors has sometimes been widened to consider climate driven pressure whereby complex macroinvertebrate responses were found elbrecht et al 2016 piggott et al 2015 which also depended on whether biota were assessed at population or community level due to the diversity of findings from controlled experiments synthesising and scaling up understanding to larger rivers is not straightforward nevertheless bringing findings together from over 250 monitoring and controlled experiments jackson et al 2016 categorised biotic response to paired stressors and identified antagonistic interaction to be most prevalent 41 followed by synergistic 28 additive 16 and mitigating 15 of these studies focusing on primary producers such as phytoplankton revealed synergistic relations to be more prevalent than the additive or antagonistic responses typically found for macroinvertebrates 1 2 computational approaches to assessing multiple stressors the inconsistencies apparent from observational studies imply considerable system complexity whilst basin scale process based river modelling studies are abundant hipsey et al 2015 found that applications have primarily related degradation of aquatic habitat to water quality deterioration under specific scenarios with limited exploitation of their potential to make more generic characterisation of responses arising from different combinations of stressors historically however infrequent biological observations fail to match the high resolution possible with physical and chemical measurement e g rode et al 2016 thereby limiting the value of ecosystem assessment dafforn et al 2016 advances in biomonitoring science and earth observation are now allowing much more comprehensive datasets of stressors and response variables such as chlorophyll hunter et al 2008 to be compiled at large scales with consequent improvements in process based ecological modelling in turn the advent of high performance computing has widened the scope for defining the nature of multi stressor response relationships which is now possible even in the absence of driving data by undertaking increasingly exhaustive sensitivity analysis of stressor combinations and their impacts 1 3 aims and objectives the importance of abiotic biotic feedbacks physical factors and climatic variables in addition to nutrient levels in controlling phytoplankton and do in large rivers has been widely demonstrated e g hardenbicker et al 2014 istvanovics et al 2009 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 bowes et al 2016 minaudo et al 2018 however whilst detailed these contrasting studies highlight that understanding arising of multi stressor impacts cannot be comprehensive instead being largely rudimentary typically only providing snapshots rather than response along stressor gradients of a system from their work on the thames bussi et al 2016 highlight that modelling studies often only cover two climatic stressors and recommend that sensitivity of model output should be assessed more systematically in terms of a greater number of stressor variables the aim of the present study was to make an ensemble of water quality model applications to assess the sensitivity of eutrophication in the thames to a range of stressor variables and to develop a method for representing the outputs five stressor variables were chosen water temperature phosphate concentration river flow urbanisation and riparian shading to which eutrophication in the thames is known to be especially sensitive waylett et al 2013 bowes et al 2016 hutchins et al 2018 the variables themselves reflect a range of pressure types including those related to climate catchment management and population growth individually they are not directly mappable to specific pressures in isolation such as agricultural pollution or increased water demand however as a group of variables together they are a useful proxy for assessing the sensitivity of river water to a wide range of commonly occurring pressures acting in combination our analysis although enabling us to provide some advice for managers does not have a primary aim of identifying a detailed set of guidelines to achieve the aims of the study main constituent objectives are to establish a method of visualising eutrophication responses comprehensively and concisely to execute a sensitivity analysis of the five stressors and to demonstrate their impact on three summary indicators of eutrophication derived from chlorophyll a and do concentrations to detect which stressors predominate and identify different types of relationship additive synergistic antagonistic mitigating etc acting on do and chlorophyll a indicators from stressor pairs to repeat the analysis using two contrasting versions of the model so as to evaluate the impact of uncertainty reflecting incomplete understanding of biological processes controlling eutrophication whilst ultimately of fundamental importance the present study cannot identify which version of the two contrasting biological models representing the two specific competing hypotheses of biological response described earlier is best this would require considerable additional biological monitoring and targeted experimental work instead using the two model versions we illustrate how uncertainty in understanding of the biological system affects the multi stressor assessment differing impacts on chlorophyll a indicators arising from change in temperature stress are to be expected from the contrasting model formulations but any dissimilarity in the nature of other stress response interactions is far less clear therefore we distinguish those circumstances of multiple stress where there is agreement as opposed to disagreement between models thereby identifying where we can already be confident of making an appropriate management decision and conversely where a better system understanding is necessary prior to prescribing interventions 2 method 2 1 eutrophication and multiple stressors in the river thames the river thames fig 1 with a catchment area of 9948 km2 marsh and hannaford 2008 extends upstream from the tidal limit for 257 km and is the largest river wholly in england receiving mean annual rainfall of 720 mm marsh and hannaford 2008 the river basin is a source of water to 14 million people whitehead et al 2015 and receives waste from almost 4 million inhabitants kinniburgh and barnett 2009 the upper thames basin is predominantly underlain by oolitic limestone with cretaceous chalk in the lower catchment it is largely rural despite being highly populous the dominant land classification being arable 45 with only 6 urban suburban ample nutrient supply to the river sustains phytoplankton nitrate n and total phosphorus at wallingford in recent years always exceeding 1 4 and 0 09 mg l 1 respectively bowes et al 2012 nitrate concentrations appear always to be in excess e g halliday et al 2016 the basin is very suitable for assessing multi stressor impacts on river eutrophication given the intensity of land use and the proliferation of controlled experimental research and long term monitoring activities e g do measurements extend back to the work of kowalczewski and lack 1971 which have supported process based modelling studies modelling has revealed that intensification of agriculture has accentuated phytoplankton growth especially in the upper reaches bussi et al 2016 nevertheless whilst controlled experimental work in the thames bowes et al 2011 and high frequency monitoring in the enborne tributary halliday et al 2016 concur that there is evidence of phytoplankton growth in unshaded sections being at times limited by phosphate concentrations they both clearly suggest that establishing riparian shading would be more effective at curtailing blooms monitoring bowes et al 2016 and modelling waylett et al 2013 studies have both implied that coincidence of conditions bringing favourable temperature sufficient sunshine and low flow is necessary to support phytoplankton growth future scenarios have been explored in modelling studies assessing a spectrum of future changes in climate land use and water resources management crossman et al 2013 identified that the extent to which efforts should be focused on reducing point sources as opposed to agricultural sources of phosphate depends on the future hydrological conditions hutchins et al 2016 expect do to decline but uncertainty surrounding how the phytoplankton community responds between april and october and how future climate will influence river flows and physical properties makes prediction of the prevalence of low do conditions uncertain 2 2 questor model representation of the thames theory and performance water quality simulation undertaken at daily resolution uses applications of the 1d questor river network model waylett et al 2013 hutchins et al 2016 and focuses on a 126 4 km upper stretch of the river network between hannington and wallingford comprising the cherwell and thame tributaries and the main thames of lengths 14 9 19 6 and 91 9 km respectively the network is split into 41 reaches and is fed by 23 tributaries and 7 major sewage treatment works stws also accounting for 2 abstractions and 22 weirs the main abstraction of mean flow 1 62 m3 s 1 at farmoor reservoir effectively reduces mean flow at wallingford by about 5 model outputs are presented at abingdon site 3 69 km downstream of hannington draining an area of 1616 km2 and wallingford site 4 92 km downstream with catchment area of 3445

biological sub model representing growth respiration and death of phytoplankton which includes nutrient uptake and release equations fully describing do bod temperature and chlorophyll a are provided appendix 1 two of the biological models tested by waylett et al 2013 were used a mixed phytoplankton model denoted mp primarily composed of diatoms and chlorophytes green algae and a stephanodiscus hantzschii version denoted sh stephanodiscus hantzschii is a cool water diatom assumed to dominate phytoplankton populations in the river thames between the two models the photosynthetic growth rate biomass represented by chlorophyll a concentration differs in its relationship with temperature eqs 1 and 2 equation 1 photosynthetic rate with respect to biomass and temperature for the mixed

sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for flow and temperature which are not affected by calibration or model version always exceed 0 9 and 0 8 respectively when comparing results from daily resolution applications of the two models with observations table 1 nutrients are simulated better by sh than mp for dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a it is unclear which model performs better as might be expected from equations 1 and 2 the models differ considerably in terms of chlorophyll a simulation as illustrated for site 4 appendix 2a the sh model usually simulates higher concentrations in spring whereas highest chlorophyll a concentrations simulated by the mp model occur in mid summer as a consequence some differences in the simulated do time series also arise appendix 2b in the calibration period the sh model simulates the dynamics more satisfactorily in terms of chlorophyll but less so in terms of do the sh model represents the spring bloom better than mp but also simulates similar levels in the autumn when substantial blooms have not been seen therefore for chlorophyll higher positive values of percent error in mean pbias tend to arise when using sh in terms of chlorophyll a and do the mp model appears more robust under validation conditions 2 3 questor sensitivity analysis framework we undertake a sensitivity analysis using the questor model considering gradients of each of the five stressor variables defined in a framework river flow reflecting climate drivers m3 s 1 denoted b phosphate concentrations in effluents and tributaries reflecting management of pollution loads from point and diffuse sources mg l 1 c water temperature reflecting climate drivers c d urbanisation size of abstractions and stw effluents reflecting population growth and also change in water use efficiency e tree shading reflecting riparian zone management in terms of percent bankside occupancy by trees then equated to fractional penetration of global radiation f the framework consists of between 5 and 9 change factors applied to each of the stressor variables for completion other variables which required specification for the model applications but remained invariant for each model application in the sensitivity analysis are denoted a these variables were bod ph nitrate pon ammonia chloride suspended sediment and chlorophyll a for the sensitivity analysis questor model applications were made for the 4 year period from 2009 to 2012 for each combination of the above factors resulting in an ensemble of 8100 model runs the stressor variables and the other variables set a form the upstream boundary conditions of the model the baseline conditions are taken from present day time series of the stressor variables for each tributary abstraction and effluent influence in the thames network hutchins et al 2016 describe their use as defined from periodic monitoring data for other sets of time series along the five stressor gradients input datasets used by the model were constructed by applying the change factors table 2 to the time series for each influence the model runs were carried out using cirrus the nerc hosted high performance cluster located at ceh wallingford river flow baseline data was provided by the national river flow archive nrfa at daily intervals the change factors applied to river flow range from x0 8 to x1 2 in line with the outcomes of available scenarios observed in ukpc09 x0 3 to x1 4 murphy et al 2009 bussi pers comm 29th oct 2016 using rainfall and temperature data from ukcip09 estimated likely change in annual flow at farmoor site 2 on fig 1 this is illustrated as a probability distribution function fig 2 the lower boundary of x0 2 for change in phosphorus concentrations is guided by a scenario where the best available sewage treatment technology has been implemented and best agricultural practices are employed charlton et al 2018 the maximum change factor of x3 0 is taken from a study undertaken as part of the mars project managing aquatic ecosystems and water resources under multiple stress eu fp7 grant agreement 603378 as the worst case scenario based on socio economic projections derived by a group of european experts hutchins et al 2018 the chosen water temperature change factors range from 1 c to 4 c and are based upon air temperature ranges defined by bussi et al 2016 0 5 to 3 5 c which are taken from uk climate projections 2009 ukcp09 scenarios water temperature is estimated from air temperature using a linear relationship hutchins et al 2016 for flow phosphorus and water temperature variables the baseline upon which the change factors were applied were tributary specific averages from weekly monitoring in 2009 12 the urbanisation factor relates to changes in water extraction and effluent release into the thames a predicted population increase of 16 is predicted by 2035 ons 2015 change factors range from x0 8 in a scenario where there has been more efficient water usage and or some form of population decrease i e emigration to x1 24 in a scenario where population has increased and water usage has not changed the upper change factor is constrained by the upper limit of water supply infrastructure in the catchment i e the size and capacity of farmoor reservoir an urbanisation factor of x1 5 was originally included but this periodically resulted in river flow drying up implying that such a change in demand would be unsustainable under present water management daily global radiation data was provided from little rissington near the river windrush in gloucestershire ngr 4299 2107 by the british atmospheric datacentre midas landsat data the raw global radiation data was scaled between 0 and 80 in 20 increments to represent changes in the management of riparian zone vegetation using the findings of dewalle 2008 these scenarios equate to fractional light penetration levels under full leaf canopies of 1 0 87 0 73 0 60 and 0 46 respectively in winter it was assumed that fractional light penetration is always maximum between winter and summer and vice versa transitional periods of 35 days were assumed of these scenarios 0 represents a situation where all riverside trees are felled and 80 where they are actively increased in number to provide greater shading of the channel 2 4 graphical analysis using contour plots the results were assessed using graphical techniques carried out at selected points of interest e g in this case sites 3 and 4 of fig 1 along the river network the analysis focussed on chlorophyll a and do for reasons outlined in the introduction three indicators generated from the model outputs are presented two percentiles and a third representing days exceeding a threshold i the 90th percentile chlorophyll a concentration denoted 90 chl is a measure of river eutrophication indicating excessive primary production of phytoplankton hutchins et al 2010 ii the 10th percentile dissolved oxygen concentration denoted 10 do is an indicator of ecosystem health used in implementation of the eu water framework directive iii a threshold of 6 mg do l 1 more specifically pinpoints the incidence of harmful conditions hutchins et al 2016 denoted low do days ldod and summed over the four year period of model applications for each indicator when calculated for each model application this is then converted into the graphical output a suite of contour plots using a colour blind friendly colour scheme showing the sensitivity of levels of each of the three indicators to change in a pair of stressors was generated for each combination of parameters resulting in 10 suites of plots flow vs phosphorus flow vs water temperature flow vs urbanisation flow vs riparian shading phosphorus vs water temperature phosphorus vs urbanisation phosphorus vs riparian shading example shown appendix 3 water temperature vs urbanisation water temperature vs riparian shading urbanisation vs riparian shading within each combination the other parameters were used to arrange the plots in a way allowing maximum information to be gleaned from the model outputs for example when comparing the flow and phosphate stressors the urbanisation stressor was used to group the plots and the shading and temperature stressors to order the plots within each urbanisation factor block see appendix 3 the modelling system has capability to generate the graphical analysis for each of the 41 reaches and each combination of stressors as outlined in section 1 the main types of stressor relationships expected to be shown by the three indicators were additive antagonistic synergistic mitigating and opposing a conceptual schematic of the contour patterns fig 3 represents these different relationships exhibited in response to changing levels of pairs of stressors increasing stress is represented along both axes from the origin in the bottom left hand corner it was anticipated these relationships would be manifested in the presentation of full ensemble sets of 8100 results for each of the two models appendix 3 3 results and discussion the section comprises the following narrative 1 firstly scatterplots fig 4 are presented illustrating that relationships between the three indicators of eutrophication are not straightforward section 3 1 2 we then present a key fig 5 which explains the contour plots legends and their interpretation regarding change in stress from present day conditions and results for all 10 combinations of stressor pairs are presented for each indicator and each model appendix 5 figs 6 8 section 3 2 3 finally the stressor pair representing management factors riparian shading and phosphorus concentrations is plotted on 180 graphs representing all 8100 combinations of the five stressors appendix 6 8 fig 8 this illustrates how the effects of change in the management stressors p shading differ under varying conditions of the remaining stressors flow temperature urbanisation section 3 3 4 discussion of the implications of the results in terms of uncertainty and prescribing management interventions section 3 4 3 1 relationships between indicators of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen scatterplots fig 4 which relate the three indicators defined in section 2 4 show that comparing the results from all 8100 applications simultaneously from both models demonstrates that there is only a weak relationship between 10 do and 90 chl there is visual evidence that some of the variation in the relationship between these summary indicators may be explicable in terms of water temperature figs 4a 4b and shading appendix 4a b it is evident that the relationship between phytoplankton biomass and do is clearly very complex even as represented in a simplified modelled system high 90 chl does not necessarily give rise to low 10 do this is not surprising as knowing whether or not the conditions arise that bring about growth limiting conditions and population crashes depends on many factors coming together in time and space and is intractable these issues are revisited in detail below by assessing possible causal factors using contour plots also there are difference between the models which are primarily a result of the differing relations with temperature and these are discussed in the following sections and summarised in section 3 4 this display of model results also allows comparison of all model runs between different sites see figs 4c and 4d here the relationship between 10 do and ldod reveals large changes downstream along the river system in terms of the incidence of conditions where do falls below 6 mg l 1 the nature of the change is different depending on the choice of model with a worsening situation downstream mp model contrasting with slight improvements downstream sh model 3 2 how do indicators vary as stressors pairs change relative to present day conditions the contour plots presented in section 3 all have the same legend fig 5 they should be interpreted in terms of increasing or decreasing stress see example on fig 5 for phosphorus and shading stressor pairs which itself illustrates a complex picture with mostly additive areas of parallel contours but also some antagonistic areas of curved contours effects note the direction of increasing decreasing stress for the two stressors in fig 5 is different from the idealised concepts illustrated in fig 3 contour plots for the 10 different stressor pairs for each of the three indicators and for the two different biological models reveal much variation in the three indicators and in relationships between pairs a selection of these are shown on figs 6 8 with the full set presented in appendix 5 fig 6 illustrates the variability of 90 chl responses as represented under the sh model to different stressor pairs although synergistic characteristics in the responses are commonplace fig 7 reveals that for 10 do the two models provide broadly similar patterns of response to a variety of additional combined stress despite showing different sensitivity to a primary flow stressor fig 8 summarises the responses of 90 chl and 10 do to the combination of phosphorus and shading stressors and shows how they compare under the two biological models the outputs for each different combination of stressors include the present day conditions as indicated in bold in table 2 and by the red dots on figs 6 8 throughout the plots also demonstrate many examples of the difference in behaviour of the two models 3 2 1 types of response relationships pairs of stressors to which the output indicators are particularly sensitive can be identified neutral relationships i e where the output shows a gradient with respect to only one stressor not to the other are often seen especially for very steep contours of decrease in 90 chl when phosphorus concentrations are reduced appendix 5a e g fig 6a in other circumstances in the case of both models impacts of stressors on 90 chl appendix 5a e g fig 6b c and 8a show the strongest relationships to be almost always synergistic and sometimes also non linear more than one type of conceptual relationship fig 3 may be seen in different parts of the same plot e g appendix 5a notably fig 6a and also the corresponding mp model plot flow v phosphorus showing both neutral and synergistic patterns this complexity is apparent on many of the 10 do plots appendix 5b where opposing relationships are also found e g fig 7a conversely there are stressor pairs for which change makes little or no difference to an output indicator e g appendix 5a mp temp v urbanisation and appendix 5a sh flow v urbanisation appendices 5a and 5b also demonstrate as do fig 7c and g that urbanisation always has a negative but weak impact on the system this is likely to be a reflection of the largely rural nature of the catchment whereby a percentage increase in urban water use does not greatly impact the water balance for sh ldod is insensitive to almost all pairs appendix 5c as incidence of do below 6 mg l is rarely encountered in contrast for mp depending on the choice of pairs impacts on ldod are either additive or synergistic appendix 5c 3 2 2 specific response relationships arising from changes to climatic stressors clearly 10 do is less sensitive to changes in flow in the mp model than in the sh model fig 7 based on long term data from two rivers in temperate regions hardenbicker et al 2014 conclude that blooms in cool spring conditions are especially strongly regulated by flow as meteorological conditions are at their most variable at this time of year therefore due to its predilection for cooler conditions the spring bloom simulated in the sh model is larger than that corresponding in the mp model appendix 2 consequently it is perhaps to be expected that the sh model may show the greater sensitivity of 10 do to flow change in terms of responses to such changes in flow in conjunction with those of other stressors however both models show a degree of consistency slightly antagonistic relationships are apparent fig 7a and e under increasing temperature and decreasing flow i e moving from x 1 0 y 0 towards x 0 8 y 4 on fig 7a which is broadly indicative of future change in climate where respectively and y are the flow and temperature change factors from table 2 the models behave slightly differently with the decline in do being faster in the sh model relationships are different for the other indicators the effect on 90 chl in the sh model is slightly antagonistic fig 6d as stephanodiscus hantzschii has an optimum temperature cooler waters result in an increase in 90 chl however this optimum temperature is more readily seen during spring and autumn rather than summer times when flows are too high residence time is insufficient and sunlight too scarce for phytoplankton to multiply sufficiently in contrast 90 chl in the mp model shows no sensitivity which is to be expected as groups of phytoplankton should thrive under any temperature conditions in the sh model there is no occurrence of do below 6 mg l 1 ldod appendix 5c the 6 mg l 1 threshold is breached for the mp model in which case lowering flow and raising temperatures results in increasing incidence of ldod following a non linear additive relationship the generally differing responses to climate stressors demonstrate the importance of an appropriate choice of biological model 3 3 contour plots showing full set of sensitivity analysis results as displayed appendix 6 7 and 8 for 90 chl 10 do and ldod respectively the results from the full ensemble of 8100 model runs convey the multi stressor sensitivity analysis in one set of graphs in this case the plots illustrate the sensitivity of the output indicators to relationships between stressor variables which can be controlled by management phosphorus concentration x axis and shading y axis the plots are arranged systematically according to variation in the other three stressors as explained in appendix 3 this form of presentation portrays the combined effects of five stressors through graphical analysis which can reveal a comprehensive set of trends in the data the fine detail of which is unlikely to be captured using summary techniques based on statistical modelling for both models this is illustrated by the multi modal responses of 10 do for many of the stressors pairs appendix 7 e g fig 8c and d of particular note being the complex phosphorus temperature response of the mp model which is pervasive for all combinations of the other 3 stressors appendix 7a 3 3 1 90th percentile chlorophyll a for both models the indicator 90 chl always shows an antagonistic response when reducing stressors reducing p and increasing shade thereby moving towards the top left of set of plots appendix 6 increasing both stressors i e moving towards bottom right of each plot has a synergistic effect identification of these responses is in line with many of the findings of the meta analysis of jackson et al 2016 this has two important implications for managers i if there is a deterioration in one of the stressors it is important to ensure the other does not also deteriorate otherwise this will accelerate the negative effect ii for mitigation it is more effective to focus on one of the stressors rather than make smaller individual efforts in controlling both under present day conditions models indicate that light is likely the most limiting factor for algal growth however in terms of 90 chl an optimum level of light is never reached even under 0 shade for either the sh or mp models e g fig 8a and b the graphical analysis clearly demonstrates that phosphorus also has a limiting impact on phytoplankton growth when phosphorus no longer limits algal growth at levels slightly above those of present day flow residence time becomes the limiting factor e g fig 7b and f 3 3 2 10th percentile dissolved oxygen whilst the plots reveal a fairly simple consistent and largely to be expected situation in the case of 90 chl responses are very complicated for 10 do appendix 7 e g fig 8c and d which is not surprising given the wide scatter seen in fig 4 this is a result of multiple influences affecting do levels and is particularly complex for the mp model increasing both stressors results in strong synergistic relations for management this suggests that if an increase in shading cannot be made it is vital to prevent any fluctuation in phosphorus levels otherwise there will be a reduction in do the response of 10 do is very complex especially when considering the phosphorus level and the interplay between different combinations of stressors the mp model suggests that increasing or decreasing phosphorus results in a deterioration however for the sh model the optimum phosphorus is less than the present day value the sh model shows mostly additive relationships but can behave synergistically depending on flow levels the worst conditions for the sh model are where temperatures are cold and shading is low in contrast to the mp model where worst conditions are found at highest temperatures thereby suggesting that phytoplankton dynamics are dominant in controlling this facet of do response for the 10 do criterion there appears to be an optimum level of phosphorus as can be seen figs 7b f 8c and 8d this optimum level is around 80 of present day levels in the mp but approximately 30 of present day in the sh model complex relationships can occur when phosphorus levels are reduced especially when flow is higher and temperature lower than under present day conditions this demonstrates an opposing relationship fig 3e reducing phosphorus is beneficial but too great a reduction can have detrimental effects this is likely because p limiting conditions will become more prevalent with blooms thereby more frequently becoming unsustainable in these circumstances crashes in biomass occur leading to depletion of do through microbial breakdown of organic matter in terms of general guidance regarding mitigation this supports research suggesting that reducing shading is a particularly effective option bowes et al 2011 3 3 3 incidence of low dissolved oxygen when assessing change in phosphorus and shading similar behaviour is seen in the ldod response appendix 8 to that of 90 chl there are differences between the models incidence of ldod is rarely encountered under the sh model for the mp model a reduction in stressors from present day conditions results in antagonistic relationships whereas for increasing stressors response is synergistic in this case increasing urbanisation becomes important resulting in higher incidence of ldod this is because despite urban growth having little effect volumetrically at mean flow effects at low flows in summer are more important at these times the river system is especially vulnerable to adverse consequences of eutrophication the responses are sensitive to the geographic location of abstractions and effluent returns under a warmer drier and more urbanised future from a management perspective if an increase in shade cannot be established it is important not to let phosphorus levels change even if phosphorus were to be reduced the number of undesirable do days would increase 3 4 differences between the biological models and implications for mitigation we demonstrate that the choice of biological model used in the analysis is fundamental to the outcome of the study differences in the behaviours of the two models are apparent some of which are broadly predictable from the biological model formulations the sh model gives higher chlorophyll results than the mp model for example at site 4 under present day conditions 90 chl is 0 115 mg l 1 for sh but only 0 075 mg l 1 for mp however the sh model does not generate limiting conditions as readily as the mp model this means that although 10 do is generally slightly lower across all model applications mean of 8 63 mg l 1 for sh compared with 9 18 mg l 1 for mp there are fewer days when do falls below 6 mg l 1 this indicates that crashes in the system due to limitation and decay are less frequently reached in sh than for mp despite sh exhibiting larger blooms higher 90 chl however this situation appears to be highly site specific and appears markedly different upstream at abingdon figs 4c and 4d when both shading and flows are at their lowest the models are in accordance predicting low 10 do appendix 5b e g fig 7d and h however the models disagree when other stressors are also considered although an increase in phosphorus has consistently adverse effects on 10 do when using mp lowering phosphorus is also detrimental it appears that at high light levels the relationship between phosphorus and flow is complex and this is particularly the case under the mp model for mitigation of eutrophication in terms of the 10 do indicator establishing additional riparian shade will clearly be effective under sh model assumptions but the benefits are less obvious when using mp model appendix 7 e g fig 8c and d in contrast for the ldod indicator high levels of shade appear more beneficial under the mp model than the sh model appendix 8 these contradictions reflect subtle complexities nevertheless it seems that the choice of biological model is not critical when specifically assessing response to change in urbanisation or riparian shading stressors but it is important when also drawing out climate change considerations the graphical analysis has been valuable in identifying the subtle differences in behaviour of the two biological models 4 conclusions we developed a sensitivity analysis framework to assess five types of stressor water temperature phosphate concentration river flow urbanisation and riparian shading acting on river eutrophication as represented in a process based water quality model using graphical illustration we pinpointed findings in the context of model uncertainty by running two models one assuming a mixed population of phytoplankton mp the other assuming dominance by a cool water diatom stephanodiscus hantzschii sh the main findings are summarised as demonstrated by the wide scatter on fig 4 there is not a consistent response between the three chosen indicators of eutrophication to changes in any of the five stressors either individually or in combination knowledge of one indicator does not mean either of the others can be predicted impacts of changing stressor levels are likely to differ markedly downstream along a river network it is apparent that shading and phosphorus act antagonistically on indicators of phytoplankton biomass 90 chl for mitigation the overall effect of reducing both stressors is less than the sum of the individual effects increasing both stressors makes for a synergistic response the effect is largely consistent under all levels of the other three stressors the consequent impacts on do of changes in shading and phosphorus are far more complex although the factors controlling do are widely known the relationships presented graphically of great value to catchment managers could not have been foreseen without undertaking the sensitivity analysis presented there are circumstances where the models agree responses of do suggest the existence of optimum levels of phosphorus for both models the optimum is lower than at present day particularly in the case of sh in both cases it is apparent that not only would an increase in phosphorus loading to rivers be detrimental so would a decrease this is particularly evident in the case of mp whereupon under warmer and drier conditions of increased urbanisation a change in phosphorus level will bring about greater incidence of ecologically damaging do levels ldod in contrast if future conditions are to become warmer and drier the models show disparity of evidence this in part reflects the different ways in which they represent the influence of temperature on phytoplankton growth it also reinforces evidence of complex and uncertain responses of biota to temperature and flow conditions apparent from the observational work cited in section 1 1 overall the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that we should maintain attention on

6199,accurate and reliable short term runoff prediction is of great significance to the management of water resources optimization and reservoir flood operation in order to improve the accuracy of short term runoff forecasting a hybrid model based feature decomposition learning reconstruction named vmd dbn ipso was proposed in this paper variational mode decomposition vmd is first used to decompose the original daily runoff series into a set of sub sequence for improving the frequency resolution partial autocorrelation function pacf is then applied to determine the input variables of each sub sequence the improved particle swarm optimization ipso algorithm is combined with the deep belief network dbn model to predict each sub sequences and finally reconstruct the ensemble forecasting result three quantitative evaluation indicators mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate and compare the established models using the historical daily runoff data 1 1 1988 31 12 2017 at yangxian and ankang hydrological station in the han river basin of china meanwhile a comparative analysis of the performance of vmd dbn ipso model under different forecast periods 1 3 5 and 7 day lead time was performed in addition the prediction ability of peak runoff of the vmd dbn ipso model is further verified by analyzing the 10 peak flows during the testing data series the results indicate that the vmd dbn ipso model can always achieve the best performance in the training and testing stage and has good stability and representativeness the nse coefficient remains above 0 8 and the prediction error of peak flow is within 20 it is a preferred data driven tool for forecasting daily runoff

precision daily runoff forecasting has always been a highly relevant and difficult topic in hydrology accurate and reliable runoff forecasting has important guiding significance for flood control and disaster reduction optimal allocation of water resources optimal reservoir dispatching napolitano et al 2011 etc as we all know the daily runoff process shows strong non linear non stationary and stochastic characteristics due to the comprehensive influence of meteorological events watershed characteristics and natural geographical conditions ensuring the accuracy and stability of a prediction method is the key issue for relevant scholars to study wang et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 in past decades a large number of runoff forecasting models have been proposed these methods can generally be divided into two categories process driven models and data driven models wang et al 2013 generally the prediction method based on a process driven model bittelli et al 2010 partington et al 2012 requires complex mathematical models accurate knowledge of physical processes of runoff formation a large quantify of hydrological and meteorological data and sometimes human judgement there are many limiting factors in the application process resulting in poor prediction performance of the model and uncertainties yoon et al 2011 for the operation and management of hydropower stations and reservoirs the formulation of short term dispatching plans including daily and weekly dispatching plans are mainly based on daily runoff prediction however due to its characteristics of short pre forecasting period data driven models are mostly used for forecasting to meet the needs of high accuracy and reliability kumar et al 2015 many researchers have used time series smoothing technology to predict hydrological time series mainly including the autoregressive model myronidis et al 2018 autoregressive moving average arma model moeeni et al 2017 and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model wen et al 2019 these models assume that the relationship between input and output series is linear but their relationship is highly nonlinear therefore the models neglect the nonlinear characteristics hidden in runoff series resulting in poor prediction performance amiri 2015 with the development of intelligent algorithms yaseen et al 2015 quantile regression fan et al 2017 stepwise cluster analysis fan et al 2016 artificial neural network ann etc sharghi et al 2018 decision tree dt gan et al 2014 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis zhou et al 2019 and svm aggarwal et al 2012 have been widely used in runoff prediction compared with traditional regression methods these methods have made great progress in prediction accuracy and effectiveness which has enriched the inferences of runoff prediction theory however these models belong to the shallow learning category sze et al 2017 they have limited ability to address input features they are prone to fall into local optimum or poor convergence overfitting and strong dependence on parameters lee et al 2012 mcinerney et al 2017 which restricts the practicability and interpretability of prediction models to a certain extent deep learning is inspired by the cognitive mode of the human brain that is extracting information from multiple layers of abstraction for a long time it was difficult to optimize the weights of deep architecture due to lack of training methods and experience which led to the stagnation of related research and application it was not until hinton proposed a greedy unsupervised deep belief network method that this problem was solved hinton 2002 since then the dbn has shown an incomparable ability in feature extraction classification and discrimination and fitting prediction overturning the dominance of shallow learning methods in many fields at present deep belief networks are widely used and fruitful in speech recognition hinton et al 2012 computer vision krizhevsky et al 2017 text processing ciresan et al 2010 and natural language processing collobert et al 2011 while there is still a lack of use in areas related to hydrology as an interdisciplinary field spanning both machine learning and hydrology runoff prediction will become an important breakthrough example in the application of deep learning to hydrology in addition the complexity of the runoff process itself is another difficulty of the data driven forecasting model it is difficult to distinguish and recognize these features accurately only by conventional forecasting models noori et al 2011 more and more studies show that by choosing appropriate time frequency decomposition technology to pre process data useful information hidden in complex hydrological time series can be effectively extracted and the prediction accuracy of data driven models can be improved zhang et al 2015 discrete wavelet transform dwt lahmiri and boukadoum 2015 emd huang et al 2014 and eemd bai et al 2016 are commonly used time frequency decomposition methods among them dwt has good time frequency localization characteristics but the decomposition effect depends on the choice of the basis function and its adaptability is poor hadi and tombul 2018 emd has strong adaptability but there are some problems such as end point effects and over enveloping sankaran and reddy 2016 eemd is an improved method of emd that can analyze signals with noise assistance and weaken the influence of modal aliasing phenomena he et al 2019 however the method involves a large amount of computation and the modal component cannot be controlled which easily leads to non convergence of the function and affects the accuracy of the algorithm yu et al 2018 to overcome these shortcomings vmd is introduced into the prediction issue as a new adaptive time frequency decomposition method compared with the traditional recursive screening decomposition mode vmd can recursively transform non stationary signals into a series of orthogonal intrinsic mode function imf sequences with natural frequencies which is essentially a group of self adaptive wiener filters with a mature theoretical foundation yin and ren 2015 at present vmd technology has been used in many research fields such as new energy generation forecasting liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and international stock market analysis lahmiri 2015 however there are few reports on the application of vmd to hydrological time series to further improve the accuracy of daily runoff prediction an innovative hybrid model based on modal decomposition feature extraction optimization learning combination forecasting called vmd ipos dbn is proposed in this paper for daily runoff forecasting first the vmd is used to decomposed the daily runoff series into a series of imf sequence with good characteristics to reduce the complexity and non stationarity of the original series second the partial autocorrelation function pacf is employed to determine the input variables of each imf series then the ipso optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of the dbn model and the optimal prediction network model based on dbn ipso is obtained in the training process finally each optimization prediction model is applied to the corresponding imf sequence to obtain the final daily runoff prediction results through reorganization specifically the organizational structure of this paper is as follows section 2 briefly introduces the above mentioned methods including vmd pacf dbn and ipso section 3 introduces prediction models and prediction performance evaluation indicators section 4 carries out case studies section 5 discusses the results and section 6 gives research conclusions 2 methodologies 2 1 feature extraction vmd vmd is a new non stationary signal adaptive decomposition estimation method it was proposed by dragomiretskiy et al in 2014 dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 the main process is to decompose complex non stationary signals into k signals of fm and am by wiener filtering the optimal solution of the variational model is searched iteratively to determine the central angular frequency ω k and finite bandwidth parameter α finally the fundamental frequency band of the signal is adaptively decomposed to obtain the imf under the corresponding controllable number k compared with the recursive cyclic model adopted by traditional emd and eemd the vmd method uses non recursive and variational mode decomposition to process the original signal which has better robustness for measuring noise in addition because k can be preset the computational complexity of the model can be effectively reduced by setting reasonable convergence conditions the overall framework of vmd is variational problem which mainly includes constructing variational problems and solving them majumder et al 2018 the original runoff data sequence is regarded as a non stationary signal f and the variational problem is described as seeking k finite bandwidth modal functions u k t k 1 2 k with central frequency so that the sum of bandwidth estimates of each mode is minimized the constraint condition is that the sum of each modal is equal to the input signal f the constrained variational problem naik et al 2019 can be expressed as 1 min u k ω k k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k 1 k u k f where u k u 1 u 2 u k is the set of modal functions ω k ω 1 ω 2 ω k is the set of central frequencies corresponding to modal functions is the convolution operation k is the total number of modal functions and δ t is the dirac distribution e j ω k t is the phasor description of the center frequency of the modal function on the complex plane and ω k is the center frequency of the modal function the vmd algorithm is summarized as algorithm 1 dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 algorithm 1 the implementation of vmd step 1 define the number of modes k step 2 initialization parameter u k 1 ω k 1 θ 1 n 0 step 3 update n n

wiener filter equivalent to the current residual f ω k 1 k u k ω ω k n 1 is the center of gravity of the power spectrum of the current modal function and f represents the fourier transform of original signal x t step 4 according to the modal number k obtain the corresponding modal subsequence imfs 2 2 preliminary processing pacf because the daily runoff fluctuates differently in different periods the correlation of the modal components decomposed by vmd is also different therefore before predicting the modal components we need to analyze the correlation between the data in each imf according to the current decomposition results and select the optimal input eigenvector of each prediction model through the correlation pacf was used to evaluate the correlation and result of each component sun et al 2016 assuming that x t is the output variable x t k is one of the input variables if the lag autocorrelation length k exceeds 95 confidence interval 1 96 n 1 96 n if all pacf coefficients are in the 95 confidence interval the former value is used as the input variable pacf is described as follows for runoff series covariance at lag k if k 0 it is variance γ k is estimated as 6 γ k 1 n t 1 n k x t x x t k x k 1 2 m where x is the mean value of the runoff series and m n 4 is the maximum hysteresis coefficient k is the lag length of autocorrelation function ρ k can be estimated as 7 ρ

s m 2 3 learning prediction dbn dbn is an efficient deep learning network algorithm proposed by hinton et al for dealing with high dimensional and large scale data problems hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 such as image feature extraction and collaborative filtering in essence dbn consists of a restricted boltzmann machine rbm network and a supervised back propagation network the lower level represents the details of the original data and the higher level represents the categories or features of the data data are abstracted from the lower level to the higher level and deep data mining occurs step by step the specific structure is shown in fig 1 the parameter learning training process of the dbn model is divided into two stages forward stack rbm pre training and reverse trimming 1 in the pre training phase the parameters of the entire dbn model are initialized and each rbm is trained by the unsupervised learning of the forward stack geng et al 2018 and the output of the lower rbm is used as the input of the upper rbm visible layer because the rbm network can only achieve optimal intra layer feature mapping and cannot guarantee optimal feature mapping of the entire dbn model it is necessary to enter the fine tuning phase to optimize the parameters of the entire network 2 in the reverse fine tuning phase the dbn uses the supervised learning method zrira et al 2018 to further optimize and adjust the relevant parameters of the network space propagate the offset value between the expected output and the actual data layer by layer fine tune the training weight of each connection layer in the whole model and complete the entire training of the dbn model 2 4 parameter optimization ipso to overcome the disadvantage that the dbn network easily falls into the local optimum in the process of learning and training an ipso algorithm cheng and jin 2015 is used to solve the connection weight of the dbn model eq 9 enhances the ability of local optimization in the

forecasting models and evaluation indicators 3 1 the decomposition ensemble model vmd dbn ipso after discussing each key constituent separately the approach of the proposed model based on modal decomposition feature extraction optimization and learning combination forecasting vmd dbn ipso can be concluded as follows and diagrammed in fig 2 the process of the model algorithm is described as follows the first part modal decomposition the original unstable runoff sequence is decomposed into several relatively stable imf components with obvious characteristics the second part feature extraction according to the pacf value of each imf sequence the component sequence hysteresis analysis is carried out to reduce the influence of interactions between different features and extract the optimal input variables the third part optimization and learning the parameters are optimized by ipso and the dbn prediction models of imfs components are determined by reducing or increasing the number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer the fourth part reconstruction prediction in the third part the prediction results of each imf component are reconstructed using dbn ipso and the final prediction results are obtained 3 2 model evaluation criteria to comprehensively evaluate the prediction effect of the model this paper evaluates the prediction results of the model considering the following three aspects 1 accuracy of prediction results mae is used to characterize the overall prediction accuracy 12 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where n is the sample number and y i is the measured value y i is the predicted value 2 precision of prediction results rmse is used to characterize the overall prediction precision gopalan et al 2018 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 the value range of rmse is 0 and the closer the value is to 0 the higher the prediction accuracy 3 stability of prediction results the prediction accuracy cannot completely evaluate the prediction performance of the model if the prediction error fluctuates too much even if the overall accuracy is high the model is unreliable the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is sensitive to the fluctuation of the data series and can describe the tracking ability of the predicted value to the measured value nse is used to evaluate the stability of the predicted value naik et al 2019 the calculation method is as follows 14 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y is the measured sample mean value the value range of nse is 1 the closer the value is to 1 the higher the accuracy and stability of the prediction results the closer the prediction results are to 0 the closer the average value of the measured samples the more credible the overall model but the greater the process error when the value of nse is less than 0 the prediction results of the model are not credible 4 case study 4 1 study area and data han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river originates from the southern foot of the qin mountains

is worth mentioning that the han river is not only an important grain production area and an important economic development zone in china s one belt and one road construction but also a source of water conservation for south to north water diversion project in china considering the impact of climate change and human activities the management of water resources dispatching in the han river is facing great pressure therefore the basin is a useful candidate for developing a hybrid forecasting model in this paper the daily runoff data were collected from yangxian 107 35 e 33 13 n and ankang

of information about hydrological characteristics and indicates that the division of data sets is reasonable 4 2 data decomposition with vmd according to the prediction model established in section 3 1 the vmd model is applied to decompose the original runoff series to reduce the complexity of the runoff series the appropriate number of modes k can extract the original data features more fully to prevent over decomposition most scholars used the central frequency method huang et al 2016 to determine the number of modes k the vmd is employed to decompose the training set of yangxian hydrological station and the center frequencies under different k values are determined as shown in table 2 it is worth noting that the feature sequence extraction here only aims at training data to avoid potential errors in the forecasting results due to the use of future data from table 2 when k 8 the value of the central frequency is the largest i e 4928 54 hz and when the number of k increased the difference of the central frequency of the adjacent k is smaller and smaller which indicates the appearance of mode mixing therefore when k 8 this critical point is chosen as the optimal value and the other built in parameters of the vmd algorithms shi et al 2018 are shown in table 3 the training set of daily runoff series at yangxian and ankang hydrological stations are decomposed by vmd respectively and the results are shown in fig 5 4 3 determination of input variables by pacf according to the description of feature extraction of time series data in section 2 2 pacf is used to determine the input variables of the training model when f is in the 95 confidence interval the t dimension runoff series is linearly independent and can be used as an input variable when there are multiple f in the 95 confidence interval the minimum t 1 value is chosen as the delay number that is the optimal input variable fig 6 shows the pacf of each imfs decomposed by vmd at yangxian hydrological station and the optimal input variables of each imfs are presented in table 4 the first imf of vmd i e imf1 is employed as an example to illustrate the process of determining the input and output variables by pacf from fig 6 when the time lag t is 8d the pacf is 0 03 in 95 confidence interval and t 1 7d is the delay time of imf1 in other words the daily runoff data of imf1 from t 7d to t 1d for 7 consecutive days are used as input variables and the daily runoff of predicted period td t 2 d t 4 d and t 6 d are used as output variables fig 7 plots the process of determining the input and output variables of imf1 are described in 4 4 component prediction based on dbn ipso before applying the dbn ipso hybrid model for runoff series prediction the learning rate of each rbm hidden layer in the dbn model is set to 0 01 the maximum number of iterations is 1000 and the connection weight is obtained by ipso optimization among them the parameters of the ipso weight optimization model are set as follows ω max 0 9 ω min 0 4 c max 2 6 c min 0 6 t 1000 and population size is 50 and the basis of each parameter setting is found in reference al musaylh et al 2018 when training the dbn model structure the number of hidden neurons is selected layer by layer using the experimental error method and the prediction effects of different network structures are compared and verified because the corresponding weights and thresholds are optimized by the ipso model during each training the hidden layers are set to rbm1 rbm2 and rbm3 layers in turn and the number of hidden neurons in each rbm layer is set to 3 24 interval is 3 a total of 8 levels imf1 is used as an example to describe the determination of the dbn ipso network structure the specific process is as follows first initialize a single hidden layer dbn model with 7 input neurons and 1 output neuron run ten times for different hidden neurons and calculate each performance index and average running time the results are shown in table 5 the dbn ipso model has the best learning performance when the rbm1 layer has 18 hidden neurons then let the number of hidden neurons in the rbm1 layer be 18 and a hidden layer rbm2 is added to conduct the dbn model learning of the double hidden layer the optimal value of the number of hidden units in the rbm2 layer is determined in turn and the prediction performance is as shown in table 6 when the hidden neurons of the rbm2 layer are 12 the mae is 1 8459 the rmse is 4 0161 and the nse is 0 9907 the model has the best learning performance and is superior to the performance evaluation value of the dbn ipso model with only rbm1 it is necessary to continue to increase the rbm3 for testing by analogy the optimization and learning of the dbn model structure is performed letting the hidden neurons of rbm1 and rbm2 be 18 and 12 respectively the optimal values of the number of hidden units in the rbm3 layer are determined in turn and the prediction performance is shown in table 7 when hidden neurons of the rbm3 are 9 the dbn with 3 hidden layers has the optimal performance value however none of its performance indicators are more excellent than dbn models with two hidden layers for the imf1 component dataset with the increase of the number of hidden layers the optimized learning ability of the model is gradually enhanced and the optimal is obtained when there are 2 rbm layers and then the error is gradually increased and the optimized learning ability is reduced that is the dbn ipso prediction model has a better effect when adopting the 4layers structure of 7 18 12 1 input layer 7 neurons hidden layer rbm1 18neurons rbm2 12 neurons output layer 1 neuron through the above method the dbn model structure of the imf2 imf8 components and the prediction performance are obtained as shown in table 8 as the original series are decomposed layer by layer the frequencies of the sub series are reduced gradually with obvious periodic processes see fig 5 correspondingly the forecast performance of imfs is improved gradually resulting in an increase in the nse value and a decrease in the mae and rmse values the results are consistent with the motivation that we use the decomposition ensemble framework to build a forecast model the decomposition process can generate cleaner inputs for dbn models thus improving the forecast performance 4 5 reconstruction of prediction results in this paper the dbn ipso prediction model is used to reconstruct the prediction results of each component imf1 imf8 taking imfs sample data as input and actual runoff as output the model is trained and then the prediction values of each component are used as input to obtain the final prediction values of runoff the figs 8 and 9 show the results of daily runoff prediction using the vmd dbn ipso model at yangxian and ankang stations respectively 5 result analysis and discussion in order to verify the prediction accuracy and stability of the proposed model five kinds of daily scale runoff prediction models such as arma dbn dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso and vmd dbn ipso are established respectively the single model could verify that the dbn ipso model has better predictive ability the eemd dbn ipso and vmd dbn ipso models could verify that the decomposition integration model can greatly improve the prediction accuracy and the denoising optimization capability of vmd decomposition is better than that of the eemd decomposition figs 10 and 11 show the results of the runoff series predictions for the yangxian and ankang stations one day ahead figs 12 and 13 show the fitting figure of the runoff series prediction results for the yangxian and ankang stations one day ahead it can be seen from figs 10 and 11 that the training set and test set prediction results of various models in yangxian and ankang stations are in line with expectations and the prediction accuracy is ranked from high to low as vmd dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso dbn ipso dbn arma in the single model prediction the arma model has poor fitting ability and high prediction error compared with arma model dbn model has deep learning mechanism whose specific content is positive unsupervised learning and reverse supervised learning the prediction accuracy of the model is improved however the model parameters are more difficult to select which may lead to over fitting by using the ipso optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of the dbn model the prediction performance of the model can be effectively improved compared with the single model prediction results the combined prediction model after processed by eemd and vmd modal decomposition is always better than single model prediction which can better fit the peak flow and have better prediction accuracy in addition it is worth mentioning that the prediction results of the vmd dbn ipso model proposed in this paper are always better than the eemd dbn ipso model which is mainly because that different decomposition methods has different control method on the modal number thus affecting the size of the prediction error the center frequency of the vmd modal decomposition is controllable which can effectively avoid modal aliasing comparing with eemd modal decomposition model the fitting line of the vmd dbn ipso model in figs 12 and 13 the red fitting line in figs 12 and 13 is closest to the ideal fitting line the black fitting line in figs 12 and 13 and the peak prediction error is the smallest and the overall prediction effect is the best followed by eemd dbn ipso dbn ipso and dbn the arma model has the worst fitting effect and the fitting effect of the training period is better than the testing period the angle between the fitted line of each model and the ideal fitted line during the training period is less than the testing period there is no over fitting phenomenon although hydrographs and scatter plots can intuitively assess the temporal correspondence between observed data and model prediction value statistical indicators can more accurately assess the predictive power of each dataset of the model tables 9 and 10 shows the evaluation results of arma dbn dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso and vmd dbn ipso models in yangxian and ankang during their respective training period and testing period the analysis shows that dbn ipso has better flow prediction results than dbn and arma compared with dbn ipso using eemd and vmd decomposition methods improves prediction accuracy the vmd dbn ipso is the best daily flow forecasting model in hrb more importantly such a conclusion is true for both the testing dataset and the t raining dataset taking yangxian station as an example for the runoff dataset predicted when foresight period is 1 day ahead the mae values of each model during the testing period are as 11 72 vmd dbn ipso vs 20 41 eemd dbn ipso 40 95 dbn ipso 59 19 dbn 82 38 arma the mae value of the vmd dbn ipso model is reduced by 42 58 71 38 80 19 and 85 77 respectively compared to other models while the rmse values are respectively as 38 57 vmd dbn ipso vs 57 78 eemd dbn ipso 81 82 dbn ipso 111 07 dbn 141 06 arma the rmse values of vmd dbn ipso model is reduced by 33 25 52 86 65 27 and 72 66 respectively compared to other models this result also concurs with a relatively high nse value 0 9798 for the vmd dbn ipso vs 0 9236 for the eemd dbn ipso 0 8224 for the dbn ipso 0 7617 for the dbn and 0 4836 for the arma model the nse values of vmd dbn ipso model is reduced by 6 08 19 14 28 63 and 102 61 respectively compared to other models through the calculation and comparison about statistics like mae rmse and nse of training dataset and testing set of each model we found that the vmd dbn ipso model provide accurate and reliable 1 day ahead runoff forecasts almost for all models tables 9 and 10 the above studies show that all the dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso and vmd dbn ipso models have an nse coefficient more than 0 8 when the lag time of training period and test period is 1 day that is the foreseen period is 1 day and both mae and rmse are small the effect is satisfactory except that hydrological forecasting focus on the accuracy of forecasting the length of the foresight period is also of great significance for guiding the operation and dispatching of reservoir now taking vmd dbn ipso as an example we illustrate the effects of the foresight period of 1d 3d 5d and 7d on the prediction results fig 14 is a scatter fitting figure of the predicted results in the yangxian and ankang station testing dataset under different foresight period to explain these results five lines of fitting scatter were included in each panel in fig 14 to assess the overall accuracy of the model obviously the vmd dbn ipso method performed best in the runoff prediction when the foresight period is 1 day which is also better than the prediction effect that when foresight period is respectively 3 5 and 7 days it is worth noting that the longer the foresight period the worse the fitting effect fig 14 which is caused by the continuously accumulation of errors it can be clearly seen that the runoff value estimated by the vmd dbn ipso method is the closest to the observed value and the trend is consistent in order to further compare the impact of the foresight period on the forecast results statistical analysis is carried out on the forecast evaluation indicators under different foresight period table 11 shows the statistical values of the evaluation indicators in yangxian and ankang standing under the foresight period of 1d 3d 5d and 7d it can be seen that the statistical results in table 11 are consistent with the results of fig 14 as the foresight period increases the mae and rmse increase gradually the prediction pass rate decreases and the nse coefficient decreases but it remains above 0 8 which can satisfy the formulation of the daily operation plan such as daily plan and weekly plan of the reservoir peak flow forecasting through a reliable runoff model is important to disseminate information on water resource management and timely flood warning table 12 shows 10 peak flow forecast results for different models under the foresight period of 1 day table 13 shows 10 peak flow forecast results for the vmd dbn ipso model for under the foresight period of 1 3 5 and 7 days the absolute relative error are proposed in this paper is calculated and obtained based on the observed and predicted peak flow we note that the range of are prediction values for different models under the foresight period of 1 day as following arma 25 435 to 43 673 dbn 18 788 to 35 171 dbn ipso 13 172 to 21 847 eemd dbn ipso 0 302 to 8 243 and vmd dbn ipso 0 073 to 7 766 the results of this study show that the vmd dbn ipso model has the smallest prediction error for peak runoff according to the are average of the top 10 peak runoff data points the vmd dbn ipso model has respectively errors of 2 506 5 453 10 969 and 19 317 under foresight period of 1 3 5 7 days in addition although the results are poor compared to the vmd dbn ipso model the peak flow error of the eemd dbn ipso model is relatively small compared to the undecomposed model which again proves that the decomposition can improve the prediction accuracy of model 6 conclusions to improve the prediction accuracy of non stationary daily runoff time series an hybrid vmd dbn ipso model is innovatively proposed in this paper specific contents are as follows 1 decomposition of the nonlinear and non stationary runoff series based on vmd the vmd method is used to decompose the original runoff series into several imf components with low complexity and strong periodicity which reduces the complexity of the original series 2 determination of the input variables by pacf the pacf is used to analyze the characteristics of each sub sequences for extracting the input variables 3 forecasting the each sub sequences based on dbn ipso the sub sequences are predicted by the dbn model with strong non linear mapping ability high self learning and self adaptive ability the parameters of dbn are optimized iteratively by the ipso optimization model and the final prediction results are obtained by their combination in addition using mae rmse and nse as the performance evaluation indices and the prediction results of the vmd dbn ipso model are compared with that of four prediction model such as arma dbn dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso etc in general the vmd dbn ipso model proposed in this paper can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of daily scale non stationary runoff series different from traditional daily series runoff forecasting the key features of the proposed method lie in the following aspects 1 the model can effectively distinguish the modolaliasing of the original non stationary series reduce the imf components and improve the forecasting efficiency 2 it can reduce the cumulative errors in the process of feature extraction of each component 3 it can effectively improve the parameter iteration speed rate of the forecasting model to avoid the parameter falling into a local optimum the prediction results show that among all methods mentioned the vmd dbn ipso model proposed in this paper is the best on prediction accuracy stationarity and extreme peak prediction the model can effectively predict non stationary and non linear complex time series data it is a promising new method for daily runoff prediction in addition it should be noted that in the research process although the vmd decomposition method has improved the modal aliasing and the false component phenomenon it has not been completely eliminated these issues the appropriate center frequency k value is worthy of attention specifically when k is too large it is easy to cause excessive frequency decomposition which leads to an increase in model prediction complexity when k is too small it will cause modal aliasing to obtain the optimal prediction results we optimized the dbn model parameters through ipso it is necessary to train the model multiple times which increases the workload inevitably increases the uncontrollable error in the prediction process and affects the final prediction it is an important problem that needs to be overcome in the next research stage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

6199,accurate and reliable short term runoff prediction is of great significance to the management of water resources optimization and reservoir flood operation in order to improve the accuracy of short term runoff forecasting a hybrid model based feature decomposition learning reconstruction named vmd dbn ipso was proposed in this paper variational mode decomposition vmd is first used to decompose the original daily runoff series into a set of sub sequence for improving the frequency resolution partial autocorrelation function pacf is then applied to determine the input variables of each sub sequence the improved particle swarm optimization ipso algorithm is combined with the deep belief network dbn model to predict each sub sequences and finally reconstruct the ensemble forecasting result three quantitative evaluation indicators mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate and compare the established models using the historical daily runoff data 1 1 1988 31 12 2017 at yangxian and ankang hydrological station in the han river basin of china meanwhile a comparative analysis of the performance of vmd dbn ipso model under different forecast periods 1 3 5 and 7 day lead time was performed in addition the prediction ability of peak runoff of the vmd dbn ipso model is further verified by analyzing the 10 peak flows during the testing data series the results indicate that the vmd dbn ipso model can always achieve the best performance in the training and testing stage and has good stability and representativeness the nse coefficient remains above 0 8 and the prediction error of peak flow is within 20 it is a preferred data driven tool for forecasting daily runoff

precision daily runoff forecasting has always been a highly relevant and difficult topic in hydrology accurate and reliable runoff forecasting has important guiding significance for flood control and disaster reduction optimal allocation of water resources optimal reservoir dispatching napolitano et al 2011 etc as we all know the daily runoff process shows strong non linear non stationary and stochastic characteristics due to the comprehensive influence of meteorological events watershed characteristics and natural geographical conditions ensuring the accuracy and stability of a prediction method is the key issue for relevant scholars to study wang et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 in past decades a large number of runoff forecasting models have been proposed these methods can generally be divided into two categories process driven models and data driven models wang et al 2013 generally the prediction method based on a process driven model bittelli et al 2010 partington et al 2012 requires complex mathematical models accurate knowledge of physical processes of runoff formation a large quantify of hydrological and meteorological data and sometimes human judgement there are many limiting factors in the application process resulting in poor prediction performance of the model and uncertainties yoon et al 2011 for the operation and management of hydropower stations and reservoirs the formulation of short term dispatching plans including daily and weekly dispatching plans are mainly based on daily runoff prediction however due to its characteristics of short pre forecasting period data driven models are mostly used for forecasting to meet the needs of high accuracy and reliability kumar et al 2015 many researchers have used time series smoothing technology to predict hydrological time series mainly including the autoregressive model myronidis et al 2018 autoregressive moving average arma model moeeni et al 2017 and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model wen et al 2019 these models assume that the relationship between input and output series is linear but their relationship is highly nonlinear therefore the models neglect the nonlinear characteristics hidden in runoff series resulting in poor prediction performance amiri 2015 with the development of intelligent algorithms yaseen et al 2015 quantile regression fan et al 2017 stepwise cluster analysis fan et al 2016 artificial neural network ann etc sharghi et al 2018 decision tree dt gan et al 2014 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis zhou et al 2019 and svm aggarwal et al 2012 have been widely used in runoff prediction compared with traditional regression methods these methods have made great progress in prediction accuracy and effectiveness which has enriched the inferences of runoff prediction theory however these models belong to the shallow learning category sze et al 2017 they have limited ability to address input features they are prone to fall into local optimum or poor convergence overfitting and strong dependence on parameters lee et al 2012 mcinerney et al 2017 which restricts the practicability and interpretability of prediction models to a certain extent deep learning is inspired by the cognitive mode of the human brain that is extracting information from multiple layers of abstraction for a long time it was difficult to optimize the weights of deep architecture due to lack of training methods and experience which led to the stagnation of related research and application it was not until hinton proposed a greedy unsupervised deep belief network method that this problem was solved hinton 2002 since then the dbn has shown an incomparable ability in feature extraction classification and discrimination and fitting prediction overturning the dominance of shallow learning methods in many fields at present deep belief networks are widely used and fruitful in speech recognition hinton et al 2012 computer vision krizhevsky et al 2017 text processing ciresan et al 2010 and natural language processing collobert et al 2011 while there is still a lack of use in areas related to hydrology as an interdisciplinary field spanning both machine learning and hydrology runoff prediction will become an important breakthrough example in the application of deep learning to hydrology in addition the complexity of the runoff process itself is another difficulty of the data driven forecasting model it is difficult to distinguish and recognize these features accurately only by conventional forecasting models noori et al 2011 more and more studies show that by choosing appropriate time frequency decomposition technology to pre process data useful information hidden in complex hydrological time series can be effectively extracted and the prediction accuracy of data driven models can be improved zhang et al 2015 discrete wavelet transform dwt lahmiri and boukadoum 2015 emd huang et al 2014 and eemd bai et al 2016 are commonly used time frequency decomposition methods among them dwt has good time frequency localization characteristics but the decomposition effect depends on the choice of the basis function and its adaptability is poor hadi and tombul 2018 emd has strong adaptability but there are some problems such as end point effects and over enveloping sankaran and reddy 2016 eemd is an improved method of emd that can analyze signals with noise assistance and weaken the influence of modal aliasing phenomena he et al 2019 however the method involves a large amount of computation and the modal component cannot be controlled which easily leads to non convergence of the function and affects the accuracy of the algorithm yu et al 2018 to overcome these shortcomings vmd is introduced into the prediction issue as a new adaptive time frequency decomposition method compared with the traditional recursive screening decomposition mode vmd can recursively transform non stationary signals into a series of orthogonal intrinsic mode function imf sequences with natural frequencies which is essentially a group of self adaptive wiener filters with a mature theoretical foundation yin and ren 2015 at present vmd technology has been used in many research fields such as new energy generation forecasting liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and international stock market analysis lahmiri 2015 however there are few reports on the application of vmd to hydrological time series to further improve the accuracy of daily runoff prediction an innovative hybrid model based on modal decomposition feature extraction optimization learning combination forecasting called vmd ipos dbn is proposed in this paper for daily runoff forecasting first the vmd is used to decomposed the daily runoff series into a series of imf sequence with good characteristics to reduce the complexity and non stationarity of the original series second the partial autocorrelation function pacf is employed to determine the input variables of each imf series then the ipso optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of the dbn model and the optimal prediction network model based on dbn ipso is obtained in the training process finally each optimization prediction model is applied to the corresponding imf sequence to obtain the final daily runoff prediction results through reorganization specifically the organizational structure of this paper is as follows section 2 briefly introduces the above mentioned methods including vmd pacf dbn and ipso section 3 introduces prediction models and prediction performance evaluation indicators section 4 carries out case studies section 5 discusses the results and section 6 gives research conclusions 2 methodologies 2 1 feature extraction vmd vmd is a new non stationary signal adaptive decomposition estimation method it was proposed by dragomiretskiy et al in 2014 dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 the main process is to decompose complex non stationary signals into k signals of fm and am by wiener filtering the optimal solution of the variational model is searched iteratively to determine the central angular frequency ω k and finite bandwidth parameter α finally the fundamental frequency band of the signal is adaptively decomposed to obtain the imf under the corresponding controllable number k compared with the recursive cyclic model adopted by traditional emd and eemd the vmd method uses non recursive and variational mode decomposition to process the original signal which has better robustness for measuring noise in addition because k can be preset the computational complexity of the model can be effectively reduced by setting reasonable convergence conditions the overall framework of vmd is variational problem which mainly includes constructing variational problems and solving them majumder et al 2018 the original runoff data sequence is regarded as a non stationary signal f and the variational problem is described as seeking k finite bandwidth modal functions u k t k 1 2 k with central frequency so that the sum of bandwidth estimates of each mode is minimized the constraint condition is that the sum of each modal is equal to the input signal f the constrained variational problem naik et al 2019 can be expressed as 1 min u k ω k k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k 1 k u k f where u k u 1 u 2 u k is the set of modal functions ω k ω 1 ω 2 ω k is the set of central frequencies corresponding to modal functions is the convolution operation k is the total number of modal functions and δ t is the dirac distribution e j ω k t is the phasor description of the center frequency of the modal function on the complex plane and ω k is the center frequency of the modal function the vmd algorithm is summarized as algorithm 1 dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 algorithm 1 the implementation of vmd step 1 define the number of modes k step 2 initialization parameter u k 1 ω k 1 θ 1 n 0 step 3 update n n

wiener filter equivalent to the current residual f ω k 1 k u k ω ω k n 1 is the center of gravity of the power spectrum of the current modal function and f represents the fourier transform of original signal x t step 4 according to the modal number k obtain the corresponding modal subsequence imfs 2 2 preliminary processing pacf because the daily runoff fluctuates differently in different periods the correlation of the modal components decomposed by vmd is also different therefore before predicting the modal components we need to analyze the correlation between the data in each imf according to the current decomposition results and select the optimal input eigenvector of each prediction model through the correlation pacf was used to evaluate the correlation and result of each component sun et al 2016 assuming that x t is the output variable x t k is one of the input variables if the lag autocorrelation length k exceeds 95 confidence interval 1 96 n 1 96 n if all pacf coefficients are in the 95 confidence interval the former value is used as the input variable pacf is described as follows for runoff series covariance at lag k if k 0 it is variance γ k is estimated as 6 γ k 1 n t 1 n k x t x x t k x k 1 2 m where x is the mean value of the runoff series and m n 4 is the maximum hysteresis coefficient k is the lag length of autocorrelation function ρ k can be estimated as 7 ρ

s m 2 3 learning prediction dbn dbn is an efficient deep learning network algorithm proposed by hinton et al for dealing with high dimensional and large scale data problems hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 such as image feature extraction and collaborative filtering in essence dbn consists of a restricted boltzmann machine rbm network and a supervised back propagation network the lower level represents the details of the original data and the higher level represents the categories or features of the data data are abstracted from the lower level to the higher level and deep data mining occurs step by step the specific structure is shown in fig 1 the parameter learning training process of the dbn model is divided into two stages forward stack rbm pre training and reverse trimming 1 in the pre training phase the parameters of the entire dbn model are initialized and each rbm is trained by the unsupervised learning of the forward stack geng et al 2018 and the output of the lower rbm is used as the input of the upper rbm visible layer because the rbm network can only achieve optimal intra layer feature mapping and cannot guarantee optimal feature mapping of the entire dbn model it is necessary to enter the fine tuning phase to optimize the parameters of the entire network 2 in the reverse fine tuning phase the dbn uses the supervised learning method zrira et al 2018 to further optimize and adjust the relevant parameters of the network space propagate the offset value between the expected output and the actual data layer by layer fine tune the training weight of each connection layer in the whole model and complete the entire training of the dbn model 2 4 parameter optimization ipso to overcome the disadvantage that the dbn network easily falls into the local optimum in the process of learning and training an ipso algorithm cheng and jin 2015 is used to solve the connection weight of the dbn model eq 9 enhances the ability of local optimization in the

decomposition feature extraction optimization and learning combination forecasting vmd dbn ipso can be concluded as follows and diagrammed in fig 2 the process of the model algorithm is described as follows the first part modal decomposition the original unstable runoff sequence is decomposed into several relatively stable imf components with obvious characteristics the second part feature extraction according to the pacf value of each imf sequence the component sequence hysteresis analysis is carried out to reduce the influence of interactions between different features and extract the optimal input variables the third part optimization and learning the parameters are optimized by ipso and the dbn prediction models of imfs components are determined by reducing or increasing the number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer the fourth part reconstruction prediction in the third part the prediction results of each imf component are reconstructed using dbn ipso and the final prediction results are obtained 3 2 model evaluation criteria to comprehensively evaluate the prediction effect of the model this paper evaluates the prediction results of the model considering the following three aspects 1 accuracy of prediction results mae is used to characterize the overall prediction accuracy 12 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where n is the sample number and y i is the measured value y i is the predicted value 2 precision of prediction results rmse is used to characterize the overall prediction precision gopalan et al 2018 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 the value range of rmse is 0 and the closer the value is to 0 the higher the prediction accuracy 3 stability of prediction results the prediction accuracy cannot completely evaluate the prediction performance of the model if the prediction error fluctuates too much even if the overall accuracy is high the model is unreliable the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is sensitive to the fluctuation of the data series and can describe the tracking ability of the predicted value to the measured value nse is used to evaluate the stability of the predicted value naik et al 2019 the calculation method is as follows 14 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y is the measured sample mean value the value range of nse is 1 the closer the value is to 1 the higher the accuracy and stability of the prediction results the closer the prediction results are to 0 the closer the average value of the measured samples the more credible the overall model but the greater the process error when the value of nse is less than 0 the prediction results of the model are not credible 4 case study 4 1 study area and data han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river originates from the southern foot of the qin mountains in shaanxi province and flows through shaanxi and hubei provinces it converges into the yangtze river in wuhan with a total length of 1577 km the basin area is about 159 000 km2 106 25 114 33 e 30 17 34 33 e located in the transitional zone of hydrological and climatic changes in north and south china the han river basin hrb belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate zone of east asia with warm and humid climate and annual average temperature ranging from 12 c to 16 c zhou et al 2017 the topography of the basin is high in the west and low in the east and gradually drops from the middle and low mountain areas in the west to the hilly and plain areas forming a vein like water system the annual average runoff is 18 7 billion m3 and the annual mean precipitation is approximately 843 1 mm with the high intra and inter annual variability the maximum precipitation for four consecutive months accounts for about 55 65 of the annual precipitation of which the summer flood season was from late june to late july and the autumn flood season was from late august to mid october zheng et al 2013 fig 3 shows a digital elevation model dem of the region and the rivers located in the basin it is worth mentioning that the han river is not only an important grain production area and an important economic development zone in china s one belt and one road construction but also a source of water conservation for south to north water diversion project in china considering the impact of climate change and human activities the management of water resources dispatching in the han river is facing great pressure therefore the basin is a useful candidate for developing a hybrid forecasting model in this paper the daily runoff data were collected from yangxian 107 35 e 33 13 n and ankang 109 00 e 32 40 n hydrological stations in the hrb which is the main stream control station of the han river these observed values are collected from the published hydrological yearbook of hrb and hydrological and water resources information network of shaanxi province http www shxsw com cn 7 39 list aspx and the quality of data is strictly controlled in the process of publication the daily runoff data of the two stations was covering 1 1 1988 to 31 12 2017 of which from 1 1 1988 to 31 12 2012 9132 days accounting for 83 35 of the total data set is used for calibration whereas that from 1 1 2013 to 31 12 2017 1826 days accounting for 16 65 of the total data set is used for validation as shown in fig 4 table 1 shows the characteristic parameters of daily runoff data at yangxian and ankang hydrological stations according to the statistical properties no significant difference between the division of training data and testing data which means that the training set contains a lot of information about hydrological characteristics and indicates that the division of data sets is reasonable 4 2 data decomposition with vmd according to the prediction model established in section 3 1 the vmd model is applied to decompose the original runoff series to reduce the complexity of the runoff series the appropriate number of modes k can extract the original data features more fully to prevent over decomposition most scholars used the central frequency method huang et al 2016 to determine the number of modes k the vmd is employed to decompose the training set of yangxian hydrological station and the center frequencies under different k values are determined as shown in table 2 it is worth noting that the feature sequence extraction here only aims at training data to avoid potential errors in the forecasting results due to the use of future data from table 2 when k 8 the value of the central frequency is the largest i e 4928 54 hz and when the number of k increased the difference of the central frequency of the adjacent k is smaller and smaller which indicates the appearance of mode mixing therefore when k 8 this critical point is chosen as the optimal value and the other built in parameters of the vmd algorithms shi et al 2018 are shown in table 3 the training set of daily runoff series at yangxian and ankang hydrological stations are decomposed by vmd respectively and the results are shown in fig 5 4 3 determination of input variables by pacf according to the description of feature extraction of time series data in section 2 2 pacf is used to determine the input variables of the training model when f is in the 95 confidence interval the t dimension runoff series is linearly independent and can be used as an input variable when there are multiple f in the 95 confidence interval the minimum t 1 value is chosen as the delay number that is the optimal input variable fig 6 shows the pacf of each imfs decomposed by vmd at yangxian hydrological station and the optimal input variables of each imfs are presented in table 4 the first imf of vmd i e imf1 is employed as an example to illustrate the process of determining the input and output variables by pacf from fig 6 when the time lag t is 8d the pacf is 0 03 in 95 confidence interval and t 1 7d is the delay time of imf1 in other words the daily runoff data of imf1 from t 7d to t 1d for 7 consecutive days are used as input variables and the daily runoff of predicted period td t 2 d t 4 d and t 6 d are used as output variables fig 7 plots the process of determining the input and output variables of imf1 are described in 4 4 component prediction based on dbn ipso before applying the dbn ipso hybrid model for runoff series prediction the learning rate of each rbm hidden layer in the dbn model is set to 0 01 the maximum number of iterations is 1000 and the connection weight is obtained by ipso optimization among them the parameters of the ipso weight optimization model are set as follows ω max 0 9 ω min 0 4 c max 2 6 c min 0 6 t 1000 and population size is 50 and the basis of each parameter setting is found in reference al musaylh et al 2018 when training the dbn model structure the number of hidden neurons is selected layer by layer using the experimental error method and the prediction effects of different network structures are compared and verified because the corresponding weights and thresholds are optimized by the ipso model during each training the hidden layers are set to rbm1 rbm2 and rbm3 layers in turn and the number of hidden neurons in each rbm layer is set to 3 24 interval is 3 a total of 8 levels imf1 is used as an example to describe the determination of the dbn ipso network structure the specific process is as follows first initialize a single hidden layer dbn model with 7 input neurons and 1 output neuron run ten times for different hidden neurons and calculate each performance index and average running time the results are shown in table 5 the dbn ipso model has the best learning performance when the rbm1 layer has 18 hidden neurons then let the number of hidden neurons in the rbm1 layer be 18 and a hidden layer rbm2 is added to conduct the dbn model learning of the double hidden layer the optimal value of the number of hidden units in the rbm2 layer is determined in turn and the prediction performance is as shown in table 6 when the hidden neurons of the rbm2 layer are 12 the mae is 1 8459 the rmse is 4 0161 and the nse is 0 9907 the model has the best learning performance and is superior to the performance evaluation value of the dbn ipso model with only rbm1 it is necessary to continue to increase the rbm3 for testing by analogy the optimization and learning of the dbn model structure is performed letting the hidden neurons of rbm1 and rbm2 be 18 and 12 respectively the optimal values of the number of hidden units in the rbm3 layer are determined in turn and the prediction performance is shown in table 7 when hidden neurons of the rbm3 are 9 the dbn with 3 hidden layers has the optimal performance value however none of its performance indicators are more excellent than dbn models with two hidden layers for the imf1 component dataset with the increase of the number of hidden layers the optimized learning ability of the model is gradually enhanced and the optimal is obtained when there are 2 rbm layers and then the error is gradually increased and the optimized learning ability is reduced that is the dbn ipso prediction model has a better effect when adopting the 4layers structure of 7 18 12 1 input layer 7 neurons hidden layer rbm1 18neurons rbm2 12 neurons output layer 1 neuron through the above method the dbn model structure of the imf2 imf8 components and the prediction performance are obtained as shown in table 8 as the original series are decomposed layer by layer the frequencies of the sub series are reduced gradually with obvious periodic processes see fig 5 correspondingly the forecast performance of imfs is improved gradually resulting in an increase in the nse value and a decrease in the mae and rmse values the results are consistent with the motivation that we use the decomposition ensemble framework to build a forecast model the decomposition process can generate cleaner inputs for dbn models thus improving the forecast performance 4 5 reconstruction of prediction results in this paper the dbn ipso prediction model is used to reconstruct the prediction results of each component imf1 imf8 taking imfs sample data as input and actual runoff as output the model is trained and then the prediction values of each component are used as input to obtain the final prediction values of runoff the figs 8 and 9 show the results of daily runoff prediction using the vmd dbn ipso model at yangxian and ankang stations respectively 5 result analysis and discussion in order to verify the prediction accuracy and stability of the proposed model five kinds of daily scale runoff prediction models such as arma dbn dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso and vmd dbn ipso are established respectively the single model could verify that the dbn ipso model has better predictive ability the eemd dbn ipso and vmd dbn ipso models could verify that the decomposition integration model can greatly improve the prediction accuracy and the denoising optimization capability of vmd decomposition is better than that of the eemd decomposition figs 10 and 11 show the results of the runoff series predictions for the yangxian and ankang stations one day ahead figs 12 and 13 show the fitting figure of the runoff series prediction results for the yangxian and ankang stations one day ahead it can be seen from figs 10 and 11 that the training set and test set prediction results of various models in yangxian and ankang stations are in line with expectations and the prediction accuracy is ranked from high to low as vmd dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso dbn ipso dbn arma in the single model prediction the arma model has poor fitting ability and high prediction error compared with arma model dbn model has deep learning mechanism whose specific content is positive unsupervised learning and reverse supervised learning the prediction accuracy of the model is improved however the model parameters are more difficult to select which may lead to over fitting by using the ipso optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of the dbn model the prediction performance of the model can be effectively improved compared with the single model prediction results the combined prediction model after processed by eemd and vmd modal decomposition is always better than single model prediction which can better fit the peak flow and have better prediction accuracy in addition it is worth mentioning that the prediction results of the vmd dbn ipso model proposed in this paper are always better than the eemd dbn ipso model which is mainly because that different decomposition methods has different control method on the modal number thus affecting the size of the prediction error the center frequency of the vmd modal decomposition is controllable which can effectively avoid modal aliasing comparing with eemd modal decomposition model the fitting line of the vmd dbn ipso model in figs 12 and 13 the red fitting line in figs 12 and 13 is closest to the ideal fitting line the black fitting line in figs 12 and 13 and the peak prediction error is the smallest and the overall prediction effect is the best followed by eemd dbn ipso dbn ipso and dbn the arma model has the worst fitting effect and the fitting effect of the training period is better than the testing period the angle between the fitted line of each model and the ideal fitted line during the training period is less than the testing period there is no over fitting phenomenon although hydrographs and scatter plots can intuitively assess the temporal correspondence between observed data and model prediction value statistical indicators can more accurately assess the predictive power of each dataset of the model tables 9 and 10 shows the evaluation results of arma dbn dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso and vmd dbn ipso models in yangxian and ankang during their respective training period and testing period the analysis shows that dbn ipso has better flow prediction results than dbn and arma compared with dbn ipso using eemd and vmd decomposition methods improves prediction accuracy the vmd dbn ipso is the best daily flow forecasting model in hrb more importantly such a conclusion is true for both the testing dataset and the t raining dataset taking yangxian station as an example for the runoff dataset predicted when foresight period is 1 day ahead the mae values of each model during the testing period are as 11 72 vmd dbn ipso vs 20 41 eemd dbn ipso 40 95 dbn ipso 59 19 dbn 82 38 arma the mae value of the vmd dbn ipso model is reduced by 42 58 71 38 80 19 and 85 77 respectively compared to other models while the rmse values are respectively as 38 57 vmd dbn ipso vs 57 78 eemd dbn ipso 81 82 dbn ipso 111 07 dbn 141 06 arma the rmse values of vmd dbn ipso model is reduced by 33 25 52 86 65 27 and 72 66 respectively compared to other models this result also concurs with a relatively high nse value 0 9798 for the vmd dbn ipso vs 0 9236 for the eemd dbn ipso 0 8224 for the dbn ipso 0 7617 for the dbn and 0 4836 for the arma model the nse values of vmd dbn ipso model is reduced by 6 08 19 14 28 63 and 102 61 respectively compared to other models through the calculation and comparison about statistics like mae rmse and nse of training dataset and testing set of each model we found that the vmd dbn ipso model provide accurate and reliable 1 day ahead runoff forecasts almost for all models tables 9 and 10 the above studies show that all the dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso and vmd dbn ipso models have an nse coefficient more than 0 8 when the lag time of training period and test period is 1 day that is the foreseen period is 1 day and both mae and rmse are small the effect is satisfactory except that hydrological forecasting focus on the accuracy of forecasting the length of the foresight period is also of great significance for guiding the operation and dispatching of reservoir now taking vmd dbn ipso as an example we illustrate the effects of the foresight period of 1d 3d 5d and 7d on the prediction results fig 14 is a scatter fitting figure of the predicted results in the yangxian and ankang station testing dataset under different foresight period to explain these results five lines of fitting scatter were included in each panel in fig 14 to assess the overall accuracy of the model obviously the vmd dbn ipso method performed best in the runoff prediction when the foresight period is 1 day which is also better than the prediction effect that when foresight period is respectively 3 5 and 7 days it is worth noting that the longer the foresight period the worse the fitting effect fig 14 which is caused by the continuously accumulation of errors it can be clearly seen that the runoff value estimated by the vmd dbn ipso method is the closest to the observed value and the trend is consistent in order to further compare the impact of the foresight period on the forecast results statistical analysis is carried out on the forecast evaluation indicators under different foresight period table 11 shows the statistical values of the evaluation indicators in yangxian and ankang standing under the foresight period of 1d 3d 5d and 7d it can be seen that the statistical results in table 11 are consistent with the results of fig 14 as the foresight period increases the mae and rmse increase gradually the prediction pass rate decreases and the nse coefficient decreases but it remains above 0 8 which can satisfy the formulation of the daily operation plan such as daily plan and weekly plan of the reservoir peak flow forecasting through a reliable runoff model is important to disseminate information on water resource management and timely flood warning table 12 shows 10 peak flow forecast results for different models under the foresight period of 1 day table 13 shows 10 peak flow forecast results for the vmd dbn ipso model for under the foresight period of 1 3 5 and 7 days the absolute relative error are proposed in this paper is calculated and obtained based on the observed and predicted peak flow we note that the range of are prediction values for different models under the foresight period of 1 day as following arma 25 435 to 43 673 dbn 18 788 to 35 171 dbn ipso 13 172 to 21 847 eemd dbn ipso 0 302 to 8 243 and vmd dbn ipso 0 073 to 7 766 the results of this study show that the vmd dbn ipso model has the smallest prediction error for peak runoff according to the are average of the top 10 peak runoff data points the vmd dbn ipso model has respectively errors of 2 506 5 453 10 969 and 19 317 under foresight period of 1 3 5 7 days in addition although the results are poor compared to the vmd dbn ipso model the peak flow error of the eemd dbn ipso model is relatively small compared to the undecomposed model which again proves that the decomposition can improve the prediction accuracy of model 6 conclusions to improve the prediction accuracy of non stationary daily runoff time series an hybrid vmd dbn ipso model is innovatively proposed in this paper specific contents are as follows 1 decomposition of the nonlinear and non stationary runoff series based on vmd the vmd method is used to decompose the original runoff series into several imf components with low complexity and strong periodicity which reduces the complexity of the original series 2 determination of the input variables by pacf the pacf is used to analyze the characteristics of each sub sequences for extracting the input variables 3 forecasting the each sub sequences based on dbn ipso the sub sequences are predicted by the dbn model with strong non linear mapping ability high self learning and self adaptive ability the parameters of dbn are optimized iteratively by the ipso optimization model and the final prediction results are obtained by their combination in addition using mae rmse and nse as the performance evaluation indices and the prediction results of the vmd dbn ipso model are compared with that of four prediction model such as arma dbn dbn ipso eemd dbn ipso etc in general the vmd dbn ipso model proposed in this paper can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of daily scale non stationary runoff series different from traditional daily series runoff forecasting the key features of the proposed method lie in the following aspects 1 the model can effectively distinguish the modolaliasing of the original non stationary series reduce the imf components and improve the forecasting efficiency 2 it can reduce the cumulative errors in the process of feature extraction of each component 3 it can effectively improve the parameter iteration speed rate of the forecasting model to avoid the parameter falling into a local optimum the prediction results show that among all methods mentioned the vmd dbn ipso model proposed in this paper is the best on prediction accuracy stationarity and extreme peak prediction the model can effectively predict non stationary and non linear complex time series data it is a promising new method for daily runoff prediction in addition it should be noted that in the research process although the vmd decomposition method has improved the modal aliasing and the false component phenomenon it has not been completely eliminated these issues the appropriate center frequency k value is worthy of attention specifically when k is too large it is easy to cause excessive frequency decomposition which leads to an increase in model prediction complexity when k is too small it will cause modal aliasing to obtain the optimal prediction results we optimized the dbn model parameters through ipso it is necessary to train the model multiple times which increases the workload inevitably increases the uncontrollable error in the prediction process and affects the final prediction it is an important problem that needs to be overcome in the next research stage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
