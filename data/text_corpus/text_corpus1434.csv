7170,although numerous studies have investigated the relationships between hydrological drought hd and meteorological drought md in different regions few studies have examined the influence of reservoir operations during drought periods on such relationships particularly at multiple time scales this study presents a useful framework to examine the influences of reservoir operation rules during drought periods on the multi scale correlations between hd and md two standardized drought indices standardized streamflow index ssi and standardized precipitation index spi with different timescales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months were used to compare the pre reservoir and post reservoir periods also a simple algorithm was proposed to examine the difference value dvalue between the inflow and outflow under different reservoir operation rules and it was used to evaluate the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought on the correlation of the hd and md monthly streamflow and precipitation records from 1960 to 2015 and monthly inflow and outflow records of a large reservoir xinfengjiang reservoir during 1974 2009 in the basin of the dongjiang river in south china were used to demonstrate the applicability of the analysis methodology the results indicate that 1 the reservoir operations during the post reservoir period 1974 2015 exerted a significant influence positive impact on the evolution of the short term 1 and 3 months hd by reducing the drought duration and alleviating its magnitude and altered the linear correlation between the hd and md compared to the pre reservoir period 1960 1972 however the effects on the long term e g 12 and 24 months hd and its correlation with the md were not apparent 2 the impacts of the reservoir operation under the drought condition on the relationship between the hd and md were clearly different from those under normal rules this study provides additional information for policy makers to regarding reservoir management during a drought keywords hydrological drought meteorological drought reservoir operation multiple scales standardized drought index 1 introduction drought is a recurring natural phenomenon that occurs at multiple time scales and affects large areas and every part of the hydrological cycle unlike flash flood producing rainfall peters et al 2006 it is common to categorize drought into three categories based on the type of water cycle deficit meteorological below normal precipitation agricultural below normal soil water levels and hydrological below normal river flow drought tallaksen and van lanen 2004 van loon et al 2016 meteorological droughts md may develop quickly however hydrological droughts hd follow md and are mainly caused by the continuation of the md barker et al 2016 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 tallaksen and van lanen 2004 in other words close relationships exist between hd and md van loon et al 2016 wu et al 2017 in order to describe and assess the drought characteristics such as severity duration and spatial extent many drought indices have been developed for certain drought types md indices such as the pdsi palmer drought severity index also called the agricultural drought index palmer 1965 the spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010 and the spi standardized precipitation index mckee et al 1993 are the most widely utilized indices to monitor md worldwide although the pdsi has been improved considerably in recent years wells et al 2004 liu et al 2017 the main shortcoming of the pdsi which include the fixed timescale the input data requirements and the complex computational demands have not been sufficiently improved lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 mishra and singh 2010 although the spei is a new md index that combines precipitation and potential evapotranspiration based on the calculation of the spi the results of the spei exhibit different sensitivities to different evapotranspiration data when the thornthwaite or penman monteith models li et al 2017 are used and the results need to be closely inspected stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2016 compared with the pdsi and spei the spi is more widely accepted because its calculation is simple and it cannot only be calculated for a variety of timescales but also has fewer input requirements only precipitation data are required mo 2008 andreadis et al 2005 wang et al 2011 aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 stagge et al 2015 the ssi standardized streamflow index vicente serrano et al 2011 has similar advantages as the spi and uses streamflow data to describe the hd at different time scales it has been commonly used in the analysis of hd niu et al 2015 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 usually the standardized drought indices e g spi and ssi are used to describe the drought characteristics because they do not only reflect the dry wet conditions at multiple scales but also facilitate the comparison of drought severity at different temporal spatial scales the shortcomings of standardized drought indices are that the water deficit of a drought event cannot be measured and quantified directly mishra and singh 2010 the linear and nonlinear relationships between the hd and md were determined in previous studies edossa et al 2010 wu et al 2017 the pearson correlation coefficient pcc method has been widely applied to analyze the linear correlation between the hd and md by using the correlation coefficients between the single timescale of the hd e g ssi 1 and different timescales of the md index e g 1 24 months of spi and by using the same method to determine the propagation time response time from the md to the hd lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 huang et al 2017 however the correlation between a single time scale of the hd and the different timescales of the md does not fully reflect their relationships the reason is that the streamflow response to precipitation differs at different timescales niu et al 2017 rathinasamy et al 2014 in addition increased anthropogenic activities have accelerated the changes in the hd through various pathways in recent years mo 2011 aghakouchak et al 2015 van loon et al 2016 such as land use land cover change cook et al 2009 irrigation droogers et al 2000 and construction of reservoirs or dams van loon and laaha 2015 van loon et al 2016 kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 in other words the high intensity of human activities results in a greater complexity of the hd and greater uncertainty especially for reservoir activities al faraj and scholz 2015 ahmadalipour et al 2017 zhang et al 2015a wu et al 2017 he et al 2017 for example al faraj and scholz 2015 conducted research in a transboundary river iraq and iran and used monthly streamflow observations to determine the changes in the downstream hydrological conditions the results indicated that the construction of upstream dams changed the downstream hydrological processes and aggravated the downstream hd zhang et al 2015a suggested that the reservoir storage function of smoothing the streamflow variation resulted in the reduction of the hd frequency and the increase in the drought duration by observing the changes in the spi and ssi for a 6 month period wu et al 2017 analyzed the response of an hd to an md and the impact of a large reservoir by using 3 month spi and ssi indices the authors pointed out that the regulation of large reservoirs significantly reduced the duration and magnitude of the hd downstream and thus altered the relationships between the hd and md previous studies have shown that certain reservoir operations tended to aggravate or mitigate the severity of hds downstream and their correlation with mds was also changed the reservoir induced long term changes of hd and its relationship to md have essential differences with their the hd and its relationship to md short term changes due to temporally varying reservoir discharges and runoff however most recent studies only used drought indices at a single timescale e g month seasonal or annual to determine the changes in the hd characteristics or the relationships between the hd and md moreover different reservoir operation rules have different impacts on hydrological processes zhang et al 2017 such as the correlation between hd and md therefore to further enhance our understanding of the relationship between hd and md under the influence of reservoir operations our study aims to present a useful methodology for determining the influence of the reservoir operation rules during a drought period on the multi scale correlations between hd and md at the basin level the dongjiang river basin in south china is used as the study area to examine the usefulness of the proposed methodology the main objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the changes in the hd characteristics at multiple scales 2 determine the changes in the multi scale correlations between hd and md 3 explore the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought period on the multi scale correlations between hd and md the results of this study have the potential to improve our decision making ability under highly uncertain hd conditions and to provide useful information for optimizing water resource allocations during droughts 2 study area and data preprocessing 2 1 study area the dongjiang river is one of the largest tributaries of the pearl river in south china fig 1 the dongjiang river basin has a humid monsoon climate which results in the uneven intra annual distribution of rainfall i e 70 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during april to september 896 hydraulic projects with total capacity of 19 109 m3 have been constructed in the basin among them the xinfengjiang reservoir is the largest reservoir in the dongjiang river basin fig 1 the xinfengjiang reservoir has a storage capacity of 13 9 billion m3 and is located on a tributary of the dongjiang river in its middle reach the xinfengjiang reservoir is a multi annual regulation reservoir and plays a key role in flood control drinking water supply power generation and drought mitigation in the downstream basin although the xinfengjiang reservoir dam was completed in 1961 it had less influence on the downstream hydrological processes prior to the construction of other reservoirs in the basin during 1961 1972 as reported by shi et al 2005 and zhang et al 2012 several studies have been conducted on the changes in the discharge regimes as a result of reservoir operations such as studies on hydrological deviations from normal patterns wang et al 2008 liu et al 2010 lv et al 2013 ecological flows zhang et al 2012 2015b and the changes in the relationship between runoff and precipitation shi et al 2005 lv et al 2013 however the evolution of hd at multiple scales under the influence of large reservoirs has not been investigated 2 2 management patterns at the xinfengjiang reservoir the management plans of the xinfengjiang reservoir in the dongjiang river basin outlines eight operational rules http zwgk gd gov cn 006941135 201301 t20130122 363881 html three of which are designed for drought regulation fig 2 the three drought regulation rules are as follows 1 when the water level of the xinfengjiang reservoir is below the threshold of prevent environmental damage the reservoir enters the drought regulation status 2 when the water level is between prevent environmental damage and prevent agricultural water deficits the majority of the water in the reservoir is allocated for industrial and domestic water use downstream and the agricultural water use is reduced by 20 downstream 3 when the water level is below the threshold of prevent industrial and domestic water deficits the entire region enters the drought emergency status and the industrial and agricultural water use must be reduced by 10 and 30 respectively under these conditions the water in the reservoir is mainly used for domestic consumption 2 3 data preprocessing the monthly discharge records from january 1 1960 to december 31 2015 at the heyuan lingxia and boluo hydrological stations in the mainstream of the dongjiang river basin see fig 1 were obtained from the water conservancy and electric power bureau in guangdong province china in addition monthly precipitation data from january 1 1960 through december 31 2015 of 22 rain stations were also obtained missing data less than 2 44 the missing data were replaced by the average of the respective months during 1960 2015 the information on the hydrometric and meteorological stations in the dongjiang river basin is lists in supporting information table 1 table si 1 all the original data of the hydrometric and meteorological gauges passed the homogenization test the monthly inflow and outflow records of the xinfengjiang reservoir from january 1974 to september 2010 were used to determine the drought operation rules of the reservoir because the water level or operational records were not available supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2018 06 053 the monthly discharge records from january 1 1960 to december 31 2015 at the heyuan lingxia and boluo hydrological stations in the mainstream of the dongjiang river basin see fig 1 were obtained from the water conservancy and electric power bureau in guangdong province china in addition monthly precipitation data from january 1 1960 through december 31 2015 of 22 rain stations were

outflow records of the xinfengjiang reservoir from january 1974 to september 2010 were used to determine the drought operation rules of the reservoir because the water level or operational records were not available in addition the study area was divided into three sub basins basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 by using the drainage extraction method of the soil and water assessment tool swat model based on a digital elevation model dem see fig 1 to calculate the average precipitation of the basins in the control area for the different hydrometric stations detailed information on the swat model and the drainage extraction method for the sub basins can be found in the swat operation manual neitsh et al 2009 the average precipitation of the basin was calculated using the arithmetic mean of the rain stations located in the sub basins fig 3 previous studies have used the mann kendall scanning t and rank sum tests to determine the change points in the annual streamflow series from 1952 to 2002 1951 to 2002 1954 to 2002 and 1954 to 2002 at the heyuan lingxia and boluo hydrometric stations to ascertain the impact of the reservoir activities in the basin the results indicated only one significant abrupt point in 1973 zhang et al 2012 2015b therefore 1973 was selected as the breakpoint between the pre reservoir and post reservoir periods for the heyuan lingxia and boluo hydrometric stations 3 methodology our analytical framework is comprised of four major steps 1 the monthly streamflow and precipitation data were used to calculate the drought indices spi and ssi at different timescales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months the ssi and spi time series were divided into the pre reservoir and post reservoir periods 2 we extracted the drought characteristics duration and magnitude at multiple scales using the run theory and its corresponding thresholds a correlation analysis method pcc was used to determine the correlations between the hd and md at different timescales 3 we analyzed the influence of the large reservoir rules on the evolution of the hd characteristics for each time scale by comparing the correlation coefficients of the two different periods i e pre reservoir and post reservoir periods 4 a difference value dvalue between the inflow and outflow of the large reservoir was defined to examine the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought period on the multi scale correlations between the hd and md fig 4 shows a schematic diagram of the methodology which is briefly described below 3 1 spi ssi precipitation and streamflow are often used to characterize the md and hd mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2011 in this study the spi mckee et al 1993 was used to describe the md at various timescales using long term 30 years monthly precipitation data different timescales of the spi reflect different dry wet conditions for example short timescales of the spi the one and three month scales of the spi were called spi 1 and spi 3 respectively better reflect the short term dry wet conditions e g soil moisture the long timescales of the spi e g spi 12 spi 24 better describe the long term dry wet conditions hayes et al 1999 for example the spi 12 and spi 24 represent the cumulative precipitation anomalies of consecutive 12 and 24 month periods respectively and these indices capture the characteristics of a long term drought note that the spi 12 and spi 24 represent the cumulative precipitation anomalies of consecutive 12 and 24 month periods respectively for example the spi 12 of june is based on the cumulative precipitation from july last year to june this year whereas that of december is based on the cumulative precipitation from january to december the ssi was used to represent the hd in this study because its calculation steps and advantages are similar to those of the spi aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 the detailed calculation procedures of the spi and ssi were reported in mckee et al 1993 and vicente serrano et al 2011 previous studies of the xijiang river basin whose rivers are tributaries to the pearl river indicated that the log normal function was a better fit for the precipitation and streamflow records at multiple timescales i e 1 3 6 and 12 months than the gamma or normal functions niu et al 2015 thus monthly precipitation and streamflow data from 1960 to 2015 were used to calculate the different timescales of the spi and ssi using log normal functions 1 3 6 12 and 24 months the spi and ssi classifications of the drought levels are listed in table 1 and correspond to classifications used in previous studies mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2011 3 2 run theory the drought duration and magnitude were extracted using the run theory and using the truncation level yevjevich 1967 according to the run theory the duration of a drought including the drought start and end time is defined as the time period during which the drought index remains below a truncation level the magnitude of the drought severity was defined by the accumulated drought index during the drought duration the drought magnitude is a standardized value rather than a direct measurement of the shortage of streamflow or precipitation because the spi and ssi time series were standardized in this study three run theory drought levels were used 1 0 1 to extract the drought duration and magnitude based on the spi or ssi drought level classification table 1 the method of extracting the drought duration and magnitude using the run theory has been described in our previous studies wu et al 2017 3 3 correlation analysis the pcc was used to determine the correlations between the ssi and spi for the different timescales at a 99 confidence level the pcc ranges from 1 to 1 and a pcc 0 indicates a positive correlation and a pcc 0 indicates a negative correlation furthermore the closer the pcc is to 1 or 1 the stronger the correlation is silva et al 2016 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2013 applied the pcc method to determine the response time of the hydrological variables to md at different timescales by comparing the correlation between a standardized series of monthly streamflows and a standardized series of an md index spi in this study the pcc method was also used to determine the response time of the hydrological variables to the md spi conditions for example if the standardized series of monthly streamflows and spi 4 have a higher correlation than other timescales of the spi it means that the response time of the hd to the md spi is about 4 months lorenzo moreno et al 2013 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 3 4 determination of the impacts of reservoir operation rules on drought the reservoir operation is dependent on the inflow and outflow to quantify the impacts of a large reservoir on the correlations of the hd and md as a result of different reservoir operation rules we designed a simple algorithm as follows 1 first we calculated the difference value dvalue using the equation d value i n f l o w i o u t f l o w i i 1 where i represents the times i e months of the inflow and outflow 2 the thresholds of the dvalue for the reservoir operation rule are determined by using the cumulative distribution function cdf of the dvalue and the corresponding reservoir operation rule for example assuming that a reservoir has n operation rules e g flood drought and other regulations the cdf is first divided into n 1 groups according to the operation rules fig 2 by using the equal interval classification method chen and wang 2009 then the thresholds of the dvalue e g threshold 1 threshold 2 threshold n in fig 5 for the different reservoir operation rules are calculated for each group by using the equal probability transformation method lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 finally the thresholds of the dvalue for the drought operation rules are used in the subsequent analysis 3 the final step is to quantify the changes in the correlations between hd and md as a result of the drought regulation rules the spi and ssi are extracted for the levels of the dvalue for each drought regulation rule as defined in step 2 then the correlations of the ssi and spi are calculated using the pcc method for all drought regulation rules the changes in the correlation are thus quantified by determining the differences in the pcc for the drought regulations we chose to use the drought regulation rules based on the dvalue between inflow and outflow because real time water levels and operation records of a large reservoir are difficult to obtain note that it would be good to derive dvalue by using water level and reservoir operation records when these information are available if they are not available which is not uncommon in many places other field data such as the flow discharge may be used to derive the value 4 results and discussion 4 1 hd and md characteristics the distribution of the drought characteristics at multiple scales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months was evaluated using box plots the drought duration and magnitude for the different periods including pre reservoir 1960 1972 post reservoir 1974 2015 and total period 1960 2015 are shown in fig 6 the average value is represented by the dot in the box the spi and ssi time series of the different timescales and the corresponding number of the hd md events are shown in supporting information fig si and table si 2 the distribution of the drought characteristics at multiple scales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months was evaluated using box plots the drought duration and magnitude for the different periods including pre reservoir 1960 1972 post reservoir 1974 2015 and total period 1960 2015 are shown in fig 6 the average value is represented by the dot in the box the spi and ssi time series of the different timescales and the corresponding number of the hd md events are shown in supporting information fig si and table si 2 as illustrated in fig 6 the average of the drought duration and magnitude increased with the increase in the timescales of the spi and ssi in general the average duration and magnitude were larger for the hd than the md because a short term md may not develop into hd whereas a series of mds can merge to form a long lasting hydrological drought and the streamflow would remain at a relatively low level for some time after the end of the hd lake 2006 van loon et al 2012 additionally the average duration and magnitude of the mds in the three sub basins were similar for the different periods however the average duration and magnitude of the hd differed significantly among the three hydrometric stations during the post reservoir period compared to the pre reservoir period the average duration and magnitude of the hd decreased significantly during the short term less than 12 months whereas the drought characteristics of the hd during the long term 12 months exhibited fewer changes in the similar md characteristics during the post reservoir period this indicates that the reservoir operation reduced the duration of the short term hd events but not those of the long term 12 months events the comparison of the three hydrometric stations showed that the hd characteristics at the heyuan station decreased at a faster rate than at the other stations especially for the periods of less than 12 months 4 2 correlation between hd and md 4 2 1 response of the hydrological conditions to the spi at different timescales fig 7 shows the pcc between the standardized series of monthly streamflow and the series of the spi at different timescales spi 1 spi 3 spi 6 spi 12 and spi 24 for different periods pre and post reservoir the highest pcc is observed for the 1 month period in the pre reservoir period in the post reservoir period the highest pccs are found at the lingxia station for the 3 months period and the heyuan and boluo stations for the 6 month period the results indicate that the changes in the river flow were more sensitive to the precipitation changes at the 1 month timescale than the other timescales in the pre reservoir period however in the post reservoir period this changed to 3 month or longer timescales e g 6 month therefore compared with the pre reservoir period the reservoir operation increased the response time of the hydrological variables to the spi during the post reservoir period 4 2 2 intra annual correlations between hd and md at multiple scales in different periods the results of the intra annual correlations between the ssi and spi time series at multiple scales and in different periods are shown in fig 8 the x axis represents the different months at the intra annual scale january february december and the y axis represents the different timescales of the drought indices 1 3 24 months the colored bars represent the correlations between the ssi and spi pcc where dark red indicates a higher correlation and deep blue a weaker correlation the up or down arrows represent an increase or decrease in the pcc values during the post reservoir period compared to the pre reservoir period the correlations of the ssi and spi series during 1960 2015 in the dongjiang river basin exhibit seasonal characteristics high pcc values 0 7 are observed for the long term scale 12 months annually from january to december low pcc values occur mostly from october to february at the short term scale 1 3 and 6 months the correlation was higher during the wet season from april to september than the dry season from october to february 1960 2015 additionally the correlation between the ssi and spi at the short term scale 12 months was lower during the post reservoir period than the pre reservoir period especially for the 1 and 3 month periods the correlation at the long term scale 12 months did not change between the post and pre reservoir periods the 12 months but it increased slightly 24 months in general the correlations between the ssi and spi at the heyuan station decreased significantly especially at the 1 and 3 month scale therefore only the 1 and 3 month results at the heyuan station are presented in the following sections 4 3 impacts of reservoir operation rules during the drought period on the correlation between hd and md we used the definitions applied in previous studies haro monteagudo et al 2017 and the operational rules of the xinfengjiang reservoir fig 2 to consider three drought operation rules namely pre alert alert and emergency the other operational rules during the non drought periods were collectively called normality fig 9 a in order to achieve satisfactory results with this classification of drought regulation rules the moving average of 12 consecutive months of the dvalue was calculated to determine the severe drought years in the historical records fig 9 b in addition for better clarity the larger values of dvalue are not shown on the y axis in fig 9 b according to the threshold of the dvalue the 1 and 3 months periods of the spi and ssi for the different drought regulation rules at the heyuan station were used to determine the correlations between the ssi and spi and their changes over time fig 9 c the most severe negative dvalue value during 1974 2010 for the xinfengjiang reservoir are observed in 1977 1983 1984 1991 1999 2003 and 2009 fig 9 b actually these years represent drought years reported in previous studies he et al 2014 in addition the degree of correlation between the ssi and spi differed among the three levels of drought operation rules of the xinfengjiang reservoir and between each level and the normality level fig 9 c the pcc declined significantly from normality to pre alert alert and emergency by 87 50 89 29 and 55 36 for the 1 month period and by 64 58 89 58 and 29 17 for the 3 month period respectively compared with normality the correlation coefficients between the ssi and spi decreased 69 25 on average during the implementation of the three drought operation rules pre alert alert and emergency 4 4 discussion 4 4 1 the impacts of the reservoir operation rules on the hd at multiple scales the impacts of the reservoir operation on the hd characteristics duration and magnitude fig 6 and the correlations between the ssi and spi fig 8 differed among the various timescales significant changes occurred at the short term scale but only slight changes occurred at the long term scale the reason is that the impacts of the reservoir operation on the evolution of the hd are weakened with the increase in the duration of the drought rangecroft et al 2016 for example the relationship between inflow and outflow is different at different timescales as demonstrated by the flow duration of the average inflow and outflow for 1 3 6 12 and 24 months from 1974 to 2010 fig 10 in this figure a logarithmic scale is used for the vertical axis the flows and the horizontal axis represents the flow exceeding the probability time flow exceeded there were no inflow and outflow records available for other reservoirs the results for the short term scales e g average inflow and outflow for consecutive 1 3 and 6 months show that the inflow was higher than the outflow when the discharge was high however when the discharge was low the inflow was lower than the outflow especially for 1 and 3 months for the long term scale average inflow and outflow of consecutive 12 and 24 months the flow durations were similar for the inflow and outflow in other words the management rules of the xinfengjiang reservoir tended to increase the water storage in the dry seasons by reducing the water availability in the wet seasons this was observed for the intra annual less than 12 months timescale but not for the inter annual timescale this explains why the duration and magnitude of the hd were significantly lower at the short term scale intra annual and why the correlation between the ssi series and spi series was higher during the short term intra annual than the long term 12 and 24 months during the post reservoir period 4 4 2 the impacts of the reservoir operation rules on the multi scale correlations between hd and md the correlations between the ssi and spi at the three hydrometric stations were lower during the post reservoir period fig 8 especially at the shorter timescale 12 months this result is inconsistent with another study wu et al 2017 conducted in another basin that showed that the reservoir activities resulted in higher correlations between the drought characteristics of the hd and md during the reservoir influenced period although the same drought analysis methods were used in both studies the discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the correlation between the ssi and spi fig 8 is different than the relationship between the hd and md characteristics the former only represents the correlation between the time series of two drought indices whereas the latter describes the relationship between the drought characteristics duration magnitude the correlations between the hd and md in the dongjiang river basin in south china exhibit seasonal characteristics fig 8 for example high pcc values 0 7 were observed for the long term scale 12 months whereas low pcc values were observed from october to february at the short term scale 1 3 and 6 months the correlation coefficients were higher in the wet season from april to september than the dry season from october to february 1960 2015 which is mainly related to the humid monsoon climate and its uneven precipitation zhang and lin 2011 the streamflow was much higher during the flood season than the drought season due to abundant precipitation and the correlation between rainfall and streamflow was therefore much higher during the flood seasons liu et al 2010 lv et al 2013 these results are in agreement with those reported by van loon et al 2014 who found that the drought characteristics exhibited seasonality with regard to precipitation and temperature in local areas additionally the response time of the hydrological conditions to the spi in the study area increased because of the reservoir operations in the post reservoir period from 1 month to 3 or 6 months fig 7 the reason is that the reservoirs regulate floods during the flood season and shorten the duration of the hd during the drought season lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 lorenzo moreno et al 2013 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 4 4 3 the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought period on the correlation between hd and md compared with normality the correlation coefficient values between the ssi and spi decreased 69 25 on average during the implementation of the drought regulation rules pre alert alert and emergency however there was an increasing trend in the correlation coefficients from the alert to the emergency rules thus different reservoir operations during the drought periods may have different influences on the evolution of the hd downstream for example previous studies conducted in different transboundary rivers led to the conclusion that the decreasing streamflow in the rivers during the dry periods may have prolonged the duration of the hd and increased the drought severity downstream because upstream countries used the stored water during wet seasons mostly for domestic needs e g water supply for agriculture industry and daily life which further contributed to the shortage of water in the downstream countries lopez moreno et al 2009 al faraj and scholz 2015 different results were reported for non international river basins li et al 2011 wu et al 2017 he et al 2017 in other words if the reservoirs tend to increase the water availability during drought periods by decreasing the water availability during wet periods the duration and magnitude of the hd could be decreased the results of li et al 2011 he et al 2017 and wu et al 2017 are consistent with those of our study differently they only used a drought index for a single timescale e g month seasonal or annual to ascertain the changes in the hd characteristics whereas in our study the changes in the hd characteristics were explored at multiple scales more importantly the influence of the reservoir operation rules during the drought i e normality pre alert alert and emergency on the correlations between hd and md at multiple scales were also examined although the response of the hydrological variables on the md was investigated we did not consider the temporal lag between the hd and md and this aspect requires further research due to the lack of the operation rule records for other reservoirs e g fengshuba reservoir in the study area the evolution of the hd characteristics under the influence of the operation rules of several reservoirs has not been analyzed and also needs to be further studied moreover with the global warming the response of the hd and md to climate change also has changed ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2017 dai 2013 marcos garcia et al 2017 which needs to be further researched 5 conclusions this study presented a useful framework to examine the influence of reservoir operation rules during a drought on the multi scale correlations between hd and md using two standardized drought indices spi and ssi to compare two different periods pre reservoir and post reservoir periods the dongjiang river basin located in the south of china was used to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of the analysis methodology our findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows the operation of the large reservoir had a significant influence on the hd characteristics reducing the duration and alleviating the magnitude of the drought at short term scales intra annual which in turn altered the correlation with the md and increased the response time of the hydrological variables to the spi during the post reservoir period however the effects of the reservoir operations on the correlation between the hd and md at long term inter annual scales were not apparent moreover the impacts of the reservoir operation under the drought rules on the relationship between the hd and md were clearly different from those under normal rules which provided additional information for optimizing the strategies of reservoir management to prevent and mitigate drought during drought periods the presented framework enables us to gain a better understanding of the evolution of hd within multi scales and correlations with md under the backdrop of high intensity of human activities especially the reservoir operation acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the financial support by the national key r d program of china

7170,although numerous studies have investigated the relationships between hydrological drought hd and meteorological drought md in different regions few studies have examined the influence of reservoir operations during drought periods on such relationships particularly at multiple time scales this study presents a useful framework to examine the influences of reservoir operation rules during drought periods on the multi scale correlations between hd and md two standardized drought indices standardized streamflow index ssi and standardized precipitation index spi with different timescales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months were used to compare the pre reservoir and post reservoir periods also a simple algorithm was proposed to examine the difference value dvalue between the inflow and outflow under different reservoir operation rules and it was used to evaluate the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought on the correlation of the hd and md monthly streamflow and precipitation records from 1960 to 2015 and monthly inflow and outflow records of a large reservoir xinfengjiang reservoir during 1974 2009 in the basin of the dongjiang river in south china were used to demonstrate the applicability of the analysis methodology the results indicate that 1 the reservoir operations during the post reservoir period 1974 2015 exerted a significant influence positive impact on the evolution of the short term 1 and 3 months hd by reducing the drought duration and alleviating its magnitude and altered the linear correlation between the hd and md compared to the pre reservoir period 1960 1972 however the effects on the long term e g 12 and 24 months hd and its correlation with the md were not apparent 2 the impacts of the reservoir operation under the drought condition on the relationship between the hd and md were clearly different from those under normal rules this study provides additional information for policy makers to regarding reservoir management during a drought keywords hydrological drought meteorological drought reservoir operation multiple scales standardized drought index 1 introduction drought is a recurring natural phenomenon that occurs at multiple time scales and affects large areas and every part of the hydrological cycle unlike flash flood producing rainfall peters et al 2006 it is common to categorize drought into three categories based on the type of water cycle deficit meteorological below normal precipitation agricultural below normal soil water levels and hydrological below normal river flow drought tallaksen and van lanen 2004 van loon et al 2016 meteorological droughts md may develop quickly however hydrological droughts hd follow md and are mainly caused by the continuation of the md barker et al 2016 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 tallaksen and van lanen 2004 in other words close relationships exist between hd and md van loon et al 2016 wu et al 2017 in order to describe and assess the drought characteristics such as severity duration and spatial extent many drought indices have been developed for certain drought types md indices such as the pdsi palmer drought severity index also called the agricultural drought index palmer 1965 the spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010 and the spi standardized precipitation index mckee et al 1993 are the most widely utilized indices to monitor md worldwide although the pdsi has been improved considerably in recent years wells et al 2004 liu et al 2017 the main shortcoming of the pdsi which include the fixed timescale the input data requirements and the complex computational demands have not been sufficiently improved lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 mishra and singh 2010 although the spei is a new md index that combines precipitation and potential evapotranspiration based on the calculation of the spi the results of the spei exhibit different sensitivities to different evapotranspiration data when the thornthwaite or penman monteith models li et al 2017 are used and the results need to be closely inspected stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2016 compared with the pdsi and spei the spi is more widely accepted because its calculation is simple and it cannot only be calculated for a variety of timescales but also has fewer input requirements only precipitation data are required mo 2008 andreadis et al 2005 wang et al 2011 aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 stagge et al 2015 the ssi standardized streamflow index vicente serrano et al 2011 has similar advantages as the spi and uses streamflow data to describe the hd at different time scales it has been commonly used in the analysis of hd niu et al 2015 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 usually the standardized drought indices e g spi and ssi are used to describe the drought characteristics because they do not only reflect the dry wet conditions at multiple scales but also facilitate the comparison of drought severity at different temporal spatial scales the shortcomings of standardized drought indices are that the water deficit of a drought event cannot be measured and quantified directly mishra and singh 2010 the linear and nonlinear relationships between the hd and md were determined in previous studies edossa et al 2010 wu et al 2017 the pearson correlation coefficient pcc method has been widely applied to analyze the linear correlation between the hd and md by using the correlation coefficients between the single timescale of the hd e g ssi 1 and different timescales of the md index e g 1 24 months of spi and by using the same method to determine the propagation time response time from the md to the hd lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 huang et al 2017 however the correlation between a single time scale of the hd and the different timescales of the md does not fully reflect their relationships the reason is that the streamflow response to precipitation differs at different timescales niu et al 2017 rathinasamy et al 2014 in addition increased anthropogenic activities have accelerated the changes in the hd through various pathways in recent years mo 2011 aghakouchak et al 2015 van loon et al 2016 such as land use land cover change cook et al 2009 irrigation droogers et al 2000 and construction of reservoirs or dams van loon and laaha 2015 van loon et al 2016 kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 in other words the high intensity of human activities results in a greater complexity of the hd and greater uncertainty especially for reservoir activities al faraj and scholz 2015 ahmadalipour et al 2017 zhang et al 2015a wu et al 2017 he et al 2017 for example al faraj and scholz 2015 conducted research in a transboundary river iraq and iran and used monthly streamflow observations to determine the changes in the downstream hydrological conditions the results indicated that the construction of upstream dams changed the downstream hydrological processes and aggravated the downstream hd zhang et al 2015a suggested that the reservoir storage function of smoothing the streamflow variation resulted in the reduction of the hd frequency and the increase in the drought duration by observing the changes in the spi and ssi for a 6 month period wu et al 2017 analyzed the response of an hd to an md and the impact of a large reservoir by using 3 month spi and ssi indices the authors pointed out that the regulation of large reservoirs significantly reduced the duration and magnitude of the hd downstream and thus altered the relationships between the hd and md previous studies have shown that certain reservoir operations tended to aggravate or mitigate the severity of hds downstream and their correlation with mds was also changed the reservoir induced long term changes of hd and its relationship to md have essential differences with their the hd and its relationship to md short term changes due to temporally varying reservoir discharges and runoff however most recent studies only used drought indices at a single timescale e g month seasonal or annual to determine the changes in the hd characteristics or the relationships between the hd and md moreover different reservoir operation rules have different impacts on hydrological processes zhang et al 2017 such as the correlation between hd and md therefore to further enhance our understanding of the relationship between hd and md under the influence of reservoir operations our study aims to present a useful methodology for determining the influence of the reservoir operation rules during a drought period on the multi scale correlations between hd and md at the basin level the dongjiang river basin in south china is used as the study area to examine the usefulness of the proposed methodology the main objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the changes in the hd characteristics at multiple scales 2 determine the changes in the multi scale correlations between hd and md 3 explore the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought period on the multi scale correlations between hd and md the results of this study have the potential to improve our decision making ability under highly uncertain hd conditions and to provide useful information for optimizing water resource allocations during droughts 2 study area and data preprocessing 2 1 study area the dongjiang river is one of the largest tributaries of the pearl river in south china fig 1 the dongjiang river basin has a humid monsoon climate which results in the uneven intra annual distribution of rainfall i e 70 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during april to september 896 hydraulic projects with total capacity of 19 109 m3 have been constructed in the basin among them the xinfengjiang reservoir is the largest reservoir in the dongjiang river basin fig 1 the xinfengjiang reservoir has a storage capacity of 13 9 billion m3 and is located on a tributary of the dongjiang river in its middle reach the xinfengjiang reservoir is a multi annual regulation reservoir and plays a key role in flood control drinking water supply power generation and drought mitigation in the downstream basin although the xinfengjiang reservoir dam was completed in 1961 it had less influence on the downstream hydrological processes prior to the construction of other reservoirs in the basin during 1961 1972 as reported by shi et al 2005 and zhang et al 2012 several studies have been conducted on the changes in the discharge regimes as a result of reservoir operations such as studies on hydrological deviations from normal patterns wang et al 2008 liu et al 2010 lv et al 2013 ecological flows zhang et al 2012 2015b and the changes in the relationship between runoff and precipitation shi et al 2005 lv et al 2013 however the evolution of hd at multiple scales under the influence of large reservoirs has not been investigated 2 2 management patterns at the xinfengjiang reservoir the management plans of the xinfengjiang reservoir in the dongjiang river basin outlines eight operational rules http zwgk gd gov cn 006941135 201301 t20130122 363881 html three of which are designed for drought regulation fig 2 the three drought regulation rules are as follows 1 when the water level of the xinfengjiang reservoir is below the threshold of prevent environmental damage the reservoir enters the drought regulation status 2 when the water level is between prevent environmental damage and prevent agricultural water deficits the majority of the water in the reservoir is allocated for industrial and domestic water use downstream and the agricultural water use is reduced by 20 downstream 3 when the water level is below the threshold of prevent industrial and domestic water deficits the entire region enters the drought emergency status and the industrial and agricultural water use must be reduced by 10 and 30 respectively under these conditions the water in the reservoir is mainly used for domestic consumption 2 3 data preprocessing the monthly discharge records from january 1 1960 to december 31 2015 at the heyuan lingxia and boluo hydrological stations in the mainstream of the dongjiang river basin see fig 1 were obtained from the water conservancy and electric power bureau in guangdong province china in addition monthly precipitation data from january 1 1960 through december 31 2015 of 22 rain stations were also obtained missing data less than 2 44 the missing data were replaced by the average of the respective months during 1960 2015 the information on the hydrometric and meteorological stations in the dongjiang river basin is lists in supporting information table 1 table si 1 all the original data of the hydrometric and meteorological gauges passed the homogenization test the monthly inflow and outflow records of the xinfengjiang reservoir from january 1974 to september 2010 were used to determine the drought operation rules of the reservoir because the water level or operational records were not available supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2018 06 053 the monthly discharge records from january 1 1960 to december 31 2015 at the heyuan lingxia and boluo hydrological stations in the mainstream of the dongjiang river basin see fig 1 were obtained from the water conservancy and electric power bureau in guangdong province china in addition monthly precipitation data from january 1 1960 through december 31 2015 of 22 rain stations were

outflow records of the xinfengjiang reservoir from january 1974 to september 2010 were used to determine the drought operation rules of the reservoir because the water level or operational records were not available in addition the study area was divided into three sub basins basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 by using the drainage extraction method of the soil and water assessment tool swat model based on a digital elevation model dem see fig 1 to calculate the average precipitation of the basins in the control area for the different hydrometric stations detailed information on the swat model and the drainage extraction method for the sub basins can be found in the swat operation manual neitsh et al 2009 the average precipitation of the basin was calculated using the arithmetic mean of the rain stations located in the sub basins fig 3 previous studies have used the mann kendall scanning t and rank sum tests to determine the change points in the annual streamflow series from 1952 to 2002 1951 to 2002 1954 to 2002 and 1954 to 2002 at the heyuan lingxia and boluo hydrometric stations to ascertain the impact of the reservoir activities in the basin the results indicated only one significant abrupt point in 1973 zhang et al 2012 2015b therefore 1973 was selected as the breakpoint between the pre reservoir and post reservoir periods for the heyuan lingxia and boluo hydrometric stations 3 methodology our analytical framework is comprised of four major steps 1 the monthly streamflow and precipitation data were used to calculate the drought indices spi and ssi at different timescales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months the ssi and spi time series were divided into the pre reservoir and post reservoir periods 2 we extracted the drought characteristics duration and magnitude at multiple scales using the run theory and its corresponding thresholds a correlation analysis method pcc was used to determine the correlations between the hd and md at different timescales 3 we analyzed the influence of the large reservoir rules on the evolution of the hd characteristics for each time scale by comparing the correlation coefficients of the two different periods i e pre reservoir and post reservoir periods 4 a difference value dvalue between the inflow and outflow of the large reservoir was defined to examine the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought period on the multi scale correlations between the hd and md fig 4 shows a schematic diagram of the methodology which is briefly described below 3 1 spi ssi precipitation and streamflow are often used to characterize the md and hd mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2011 in this study the spi mckee et al 1993 was used to describe the md at various timescales using long term 30 years monthly precipitation data different timescales of the spi reflect different dry wet conditions for example short timescales of the spi the one and three month scales of the spi were called spi 1 and spi 3 respectively better reflect the short term dry wet conditions e g soil moisture the long timescales of the spi e g spi 12 spi 24 better describe the long term dry wet conditions hayes et al 1999 for example the spi 12 and spi 24 represent the cumulative precipitation anomalies of consecutive 12 and 24 month periods respectively and these indices capture the characteristics of a long term drought note that the spi 12 and spi 24 represent the cumulative precipitation anomalies of consecutive 12 and 24 month periods respectively for example the spi 12 of june is based on the cumulative precipitation from july last year to june this year whereas that of december is based on the cumulative precipitation from january to december the ssi was used to represent the hd in this study because its calculation steps and advantages are similar to those of the spi aghakouchak and nakhjiri 2012 the detailed calculation procedures of the spi and ssi were reported in mckee et al 1993 and vicente serrano et al 2011 previous studies of the xijiang river basin whose rivers are tributaries to the pearl river indicated that the log normal function was a better fit for the precipitation and streamflow records at multiple timescales i e 1 3 6 and 12 months than the gamma or normal functions niu et al 2015 thus monthly precipitation and streamflow data from 1960 to 2015 were used to calculate the different timescales of the spi and ssi using log normal functions 1 3 6 12 and 24 months the spi and ssi classifications of the drought levels are listed in table 1 and correspond to classifications used in previous studies mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2011 3 2 run theory the drought duration and magnitude were extracted using the run theory and using the truncation level yevjevich 1967 according to the run theory the duration of a drought including the drought start and end time is defined as the time period during which the drought index remains below a truncation level the magnitude of the drought severity was defined by the accumulated drought index during the drought duration the drought magnitude is a standardized value rather than a direct measurement of the shortage of streamflow or precipitation because the spi and ssi time series were standardized in this study three run theory drought levels were used 1 0 1 to extract the drought duration and magnitude based on the spi or ssi drought level classification table 1 the method of extracting the drought duration and magnitude using the run theory has been described in our previous studies wu et al 2017 3 3 correlation analysis the pcc was used to determine the correlations between the ssi and spi for the different timescales at a 99 confidence level the pcc ranges from 1 to 1 and a pcc 0 indicates a positive correlation and a pcc 0 indicates a negative correlation furthermore the closer the pcc is to 1 or 1 the stronger the correlation is silva et al 2016 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2013 applied the pcc method to determine the response time of the hydrological variables to md at different timescales by comparing the correlation between a standardized series of monthly streamflows and a standardized series of an md index spi in this study the pcc method was also used to determine the response time of the hydrological variables to the md spi conditions for example if the standardized series of monthly streamflows and spi 4 have a higher correlation than other timescales of the spi it means that the response time of the hd to the md spi is about 4 months lorenzo moreno et al 2013 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 3 4 determination of the impacts of reservoir operation rules on drought the reservoir operation is dependent on the inflow and outflow to quantify the impacts of a large reservoir on the correlations of the hd and md as a result of different reservoir operation rules we designed a simple algorithm as follows 1 first we calculated the difference value dvalue using the equation d value i n f l o w i o u t f l o w i i 1 where i represents the times i e months of the inflow and outflow 2 the thresholds of the dvalue for the reservoir operation rule are determined by using the cumulative distribution function cdf of the dvalue and the corresponding reservoir operation rule for example assuming that a reservoir has n operation rules e g flood drought and other regulations the cdf is first divided into n 1 groups according to the operation rules fig 2 by using the equal interval classification method chen and wang 2009 then the thresholds of the dvalue e g threshold 1 threshold 2 threshold n in fig 5 for the different reservoir operation rules are calculated for each group by using the equal probability transformation method lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 finally the thresholds of the dvalue for the drought operation rules are used in the subsequent analysis 3 the final step is to quantify the changes in the correlations between hd and md as a result of the drought regulation rules the spi and ssi are extracted for the levels of the dvalue for each drought regulation rule as defined in step 2 then the correlations of the ssi and spi are calculated using the pcc method for all drought regulation rules the changes in the correlation are thus quantified by determining the differences in the pcc for the drought regulations we chose to use the drought regulation rules based on the dvalue between inflow and outflow because real time water levels and operation records of a large reservoir are difficult to obtain note that it would be good to derive dvalue by using water level and reservoir operation records when these information are available if they are not available which is not uncommon in many places other field data such as the flow discharge may be used to derive the value 4 results and discussion 4 1 hd and md characteristics the distribution of the drought characteristics at multiple scales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months was evaluated using box plots the drought duration and magnitude for the different periods including pre reservoir 1960 1972 post reservoir 1974 2015 and total period 1960 2015 are shown in fig 6 the average value is represented by the dot in the box the spi and ssi time series of the different timescales and the corresponding number of the hd md events are shown in supporting information fig si and table si 2 the distribution of the drought characteristics at multiple scales 1 3 6 12 and 24 months was evaluated using box plots the drought duration and magnitude for the different periods including pre reservoir 1960 1972 post reservoir 1974 2015 and total period 1960 2015 are shown in fig 6 the average value is represented by the dot in the box the spi and ssi time series of the different timescales and the corresponding number of the hd md events are shown in supporting information fig si and table si 2 as illustrated in fig 6 the average of the drought duration and magnitude increased with the increase in the timescales of the spi and ssi in general the average duration and magnitude were larger for the hd than the md because a short term md may not develop into hd whereas a series of mds can merge to form a long lasting hydrological drought and the streamflow would remain at a relatively low level for some time after the end of the hd lake 2006 van loon et al 2012 additionally the average duration and magnitude of the mds in the three sub basins were similar for the different periods however the average duration and magnitude of the hd differed significantly among the three hydrometric stations during the post reservoir period compared to the pre reservoir period the average duration and magnitude of the hd decreased significantly during the short term less than 12 months whereas the drought characteristics of the hd during the long term 12 months exhibited fewer changes in the similar md characteristics during the post reservoir period this indicates that the reservoir operation reduced the duration of the short term hd events but not those of the long term 12 months events the comparison of the three hydrometric stations showed that the hd characteristics at the heyuan station decreased at a faster rate than at the other stations especially for the periods of less than 12 months 4 2 correlation between hd and md 4 2 1 response of the hydrological conditions to the spi at different timescales fig 7 shows the pcc between the standardized series of monthly streamflow and the series of the spi at different timescales spi 1 spi 3 spi 6 spi 12 and spi 24 for different periods pre and post reservoir the highest pcc is observed for the 1 month period in the pre reservoir period in the post reservoir period the highest pccs are found at the lingxia station for the 3 months period and the heyuan and boluo stations for the 6 month period the results indicate that the changes in the river flow were more sensitive to the precipitation changes at the 1 month timescale than the other timescales in the pre reservoir period however in the post reservoir period this changed to 3 month or longer timescales e g 6 month therefore compared with the pre reservoir period the reservoir operation increased the response time of the hydrological variables to the spi during the post reservoir period 4 2 2 intra annual correlations between hd and md at multiple scales in different periods the results of the intra annual correlations between the ssi and spi time series at multiple scales and in different periods are shown in fig 8 the x axis represents the different months at the intra annual scale january february december and the y axis represents the different timescales of the drought indices 1 3 24 months the colored bars represent the correlations between the ssi and spi pcc where dark red indicates a higher correlation and deep blue a weaker correlation the up or down arrows represent an increase or decrease in the pcc values during the post reservoir period compared to the pre reservoir period the correlations of the ssi and spi series during 1960 2015 in the dongjiang river basin exhibit seasonal characteristics high pcc values 0 7 are observed for the long term scale 12 months annually from january to december low pcc values occur mostly from october to february at the short term scale 1 3 and 6 months the correlation was higher during the wet season from april to september than the dry season from october to february 1960 2015 additionally the correlation between the ssi and spi at the short term scale 12 months was lower during the post reservoir period than the pre reservoir period especially for the 1 and 3 month periods the correlation at the long term scale 12 months did not change between the post and pre reservoir periods the 12 months but it increased slightly 24 months in general the correlations between the ssi and spi at the heyuan station decreased significantly especially at the 1 and 3 month scale therefore only the 1 and 3 month results at the heyuan station are presented in the following sections 4 3 impacts of reservoir operation rules during the drought period on the correlation between hd and md we used the definitions applied in previous studies haro monteagudo et al 2017 and the operational rules of the xinfengjiang reservoir fig 2 to consider three drought operation rules namely pre alert alert and emergency the other operational rules during the non drought periods were collectively called normality fig 9 a in order to achieve satisfactory results with this classification of drought regulation rules the moving average of 12 consecutive months of the dvalue was calculated to determine the severe drought years in the historical records fig 9 b in addition for better clarity the larger values of dvalue are not shown on the y axis in fig 9 b according to the threshold of the dvalue the 1 and 3 months periods of the spi and ssi for the different drought regulation rules at the heyuan station were used to determine the correlations between the ssi and spi and their changes over time fig 9 c the most severe negative dvalue value during 1974 2010 for the xinfengjiang reservoir are observed in 1977 1983 1984 1991 1999 2003 and 2009 fig 9 b actually these years represent drought years reported in previous studies he et al 2014 in addition the degree of correlation between the ssi and spi differed among the three levels of drought operation rules of the xinfengjiang reservoir and between each level and the normality level fig 9 c the pcc declined significantly from normality to pre alert alert and emergency by 87 50 89 29 and 55 36 for the 1 month period and by 64 58 89 58 and 29 17 for the 3 month period respectively compared with normality the correlation coefficients between the ssi and spi decreased 69 25 on average during the implementation of the three drought operation rules pre alert alert and emergency 4 4 discussion 4 4 1 the impacts of the reservoir operation rules on the hd at multiple scales the impacts of the reservoir operation on the hd characteristics duration and magnitude fig 6 and the correlations between the ssi and spi fig 8 differed among the various timescales significant changes occurred at the short term scale but only slight changes occurred at the long term scale the reason is that the impacts of the reservoir operation on the evolution of the hd are weakened with the increase in the duration of the drought rangecroft et al 2016 for example the relationship between inflow and outflow is different at different timescales as demonstrated by the flow duration of the average inflow and outflow for 1 3 6 12 and 24 months from 1974 to 2010 fig 10 in this figure a logarithmic scale is used for the vertical axis the flows and the horizontal axis represents the flow exceeding the probability time flow exceeded there were no inflow and outflow records available for other reservoirs the results for the short term scales e g average inflow and outflow for consecutive 1 3 and 6 months show that the inflow was higher than the outflow when the discharge was high however when the discharge was low the inflow was lower than the outflow especially for 1 and 3 months for the long term scale average inflow and outflow of consecutive 12 and 24 months the flow durations were similar for the inflow and outflow in other words the management rules of the xinfengjiang reservoir tended to increase the water storage in the dry seasons by reducing the water availability in the wet seasons this was observed for the intra annual less than 12 months timescale but not for the inter annual timescale this explains why the duration and magnitude of the hd were significantly lower at the short term scale intra annual and why the correlation between the ssi series and spi series was higher during the short term intra annual than the long term 12 and 24 months during the post reservoir period 4 4 2 the impacts of the reservoir operation rules on the multi scale correlations between hd and md the correlations between the ssi and spi at the three hydrometric stations were lower during the post reservoir period fig 8 especially at the shorter timescale 12 months this result is inconsistent with another study wu et al 2017 conducted in another basin that showed that the reservoir activities resulted in higher correlations between the drought characteristics of the hd and md during the reservoir influenced period although the same drought analysis methods were used in both studies the discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the correlation between the ssi and spi fig 8 is different than the relationship between the hd and md characteristics the former only represents the correlation between the time series of two drought indices whereas the latter describes the relationship between the drought characteristics duration magnitude the correlations between the hd and md in the dongjiang river basin in south china exhibit seasonal characteristics fig 8 for example high pcc values 0 7 were observed for the long term scale 12 months whereas low pcc values were observed from october to february at the short term scale 1 3 and 6 months the correlation coefficients were higher in the wet season from april to september than the dry season from october to february 1960 2015 which is mainly related to the humid monsoon climate and its uneven precipitation zhang and lin 2011 the streamflow was much higher during the flood season than the drought season due to abundant precipitation and the correlation between rainfall and streamflow was therefore much higher during the flood seasons liu et al 2010 lv et al 2013 these results are in agreement with those reported by van loon et al 2014 who found that the drought characteristics exhibited seasonality with regard to precipitation and temperature in local areas additionally the response time of the hydrological conditions to the spi in the study area increased because of the reservoir operations in the post reservoir period from 1 month to 3 or 6 months fig 7 the reason is that the reservoirs regulate floods during the flood season and shorten the duration of the hd during the drought season lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 lorenzo moreno et al 2013 vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 4 4 3 the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought period on the correlation between hd and md compared with normality the correlation coefficient values between the ssi and spi decreased 69 25 on average during the implementation of the drought regulation rules pre alert alert and emergency however there was an increasing trend in the correlation coefficients from the alert to the emergency rules thus different reservoir operations during the drought periods may have different influences on the evolution of the hd downstream for example previous studies conducted in different transboundary rivers led to the conclusion that the decreasing streamflow in the rivers during the dry periods may have prolonged the duration of the hd and increased the drought severity downstream because upstream countries used the stored water during wet seasons mostly for domestic needs e g water supply for agriculture industry and daily life which further contributed to the shortage of water in the downstream countries lopez moreno et al 2009 al faraj and scholz 2015 different results were reported for non international river basins li et al 2011 wu et al 2017 he et al 2017 in other words if the reservoirs tend to increase the water availability during drought periods by decreasing the water availability during wet periods the duration and magnitude of the hd could be decreased the results of li et al 2011 he et al 2017 and wu et al 2017 are consistent with those of our study differently they only used a drought index for a single timescale e g month seasonal or annual to ascertain the changes in the hd characteristics whereas in our study the changes in the hd characteristics were explored at multiple scales more importantly the influence of the reservoir operation rules during the drought i e normality pre alert alert and emergency on the correlations between hd and md at multiple scales were also examined although the response of the hydrological variables on the md was investigated we did not consider the temporal lag between the hd and md and this aspect requires further research due to the lack of the operation rule records for other reservoirs e g fengshuba reservoir in the study area the evolution of the hd characteristics under the influence of the operation rules of several reservoirs has not been analyzed and also needs to be further studied moreover with the global warming the response of the hd and md to climate change also has changed ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2017 dai 2013 marcos garcia et al 2017 which needs to be further researched 5 conclusions this study presented a useful framework to examine the influence of reservoir operation rules during a drought on the multi scale correlations between hd and md using two standardized drought indices spi and ssi to compare two different periods pre reservoir and post reservoir periods the dongjiang river basin located in the south of china was used to demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of the analysis methodology our findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows the operation of the large reservoir had a significant influence on the hd characteristics reducing the duration and alleviating the magnitude of the drought at short term scales intra annual which in turn altered the correlation with the md and increased the response time of the hydrological variables to the spi during the post reservoir period however the effects of the reservoir operations on the correlation between the hd and md at long term inter annual scales were not apparent moreover the impacts of the reservoir operation under the drought rules on the relationship between the hd and md were clearly different from those under normal rules which provided additional information for optimizing the strategies of reservoir management to prevent and mitigate drought during drought periods the presented framework enables us to gain a better understanding of the evolution of hd within multi scales and correlations with md under the backdrop of high intensity of human activities especially the reservoir operation acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the financial support by the national key r d program of china

7171,soil water availability has a strong role on vegetation conservation and biodiversity particularly at vulnerable environments such as archipelagos subject to significant temporal changes of climate and rainfall which influence soil weathering and erosion processes few field studies on hydrology of volcanic islands in the atlantic ocean have been developed focusing on soil and water temporal dynamics and conservation mainly because such studies require data with high temporal resolution and also due to the financial costs involved with field data acquisition at such remote places considering the importance of soil moisture content to several hydrological processes and islands environmental sustainability this study aimed to investigate the soil water temporal dynamics in relation to different rainfall patterns and also the rainfall erosivity and its temporal variation and the resulting infiltration depths during a typical hydrological period in an experimental plot at the main watershed of fernando de noronha in the brazilian atlantic coast rainfall was recorded every 5 min and soil moisture was intensely monitored by 16 moisture probes installed at 10 40 cm and 40 70 cm layers during three years representing the typical local hydrological regime and seasons rainfall bursts pattern were identified and described experimental data allowed a hydrological model to be calibrated and validated providing estimates of infiltration depths which can be valuable for water resources planning and management hydrological patterns were determined for each erosive rainfall depending on the precipitation peak position as advanced intermediate and delayed the soil water effectiveness was also evaluated and related to the different rainfall patterns soil moisture is highest from april to june close to saturation whilst for the other months the values were close to the residual value the rainfall erosivity in the archipelago was identified as moderate to strong and the most frequent rainfall pattern was the advanced fast wetting drying cycles during the rainfall events were observed due to rainfall intermittency evapotranspiration and to soil hydraulic conductivity it was observed the prevalence of high moisture indexes with percentages higher than 40 extremely effective level for both investigated depths within the first 70 cm of soil essential for plant water uptake the observed rainfall erosivity highlights the importance of defining local strategies for soil and water conservation aimed at water security in the island based on a simulation model which was successfully calibrated nash sutcliffe efficiency index ns 0 76 and validated ns 0 81 for periods in the wet season high infiltration depths have been identified which contributes to canopy conservation in the archipelago keywords soil water effectiveness oceanic island rainfall patterns infiltration ratio 1 introduction rainfall characteristics and bursts patterns are of paramount importance for ecohydrology and biodiversity conservation affecting infiltration processes and spatio temporal soil moisture distribution intensities of rainfall bursts and their temporal distribution within an event can be more relevant in terms of hydrological processes than does the mean equivalent rainfall rate dunkerley 2011 table 1 rainfall profiles during storm events and their impacts on infiltration runoff and soil erosion have been largely addressed in literature de lima et al 2012 have verified that the rain storm temporal variability may have a strong influence on runoff discharge and soil losses the latter being correlated to the rainfall erosivity yin et al 2015 have pointed out that rainfall erosivity is usually better represented by the maximum 30 min intensities of the event moreover rainfall intermittency may affect hydrological processes such as infiltration depths conversion of rainfall to soil moisture and soil losses marani et al 1997 montenegro et al 2013 dunkerley 2015 indeed long no rain periods within an event may reduce soil surface moisture and enhance infiltration rates rainfall patterns can be classified as proposed by horner and jens 1942 as advanced intermediate and delayed according to the part of the event duration in which the peak falls several authors e g cassol et al 2007 carvalho et al 2009 bazzano et al 2010 aquino et al 2013 adopted the same methodology for the classification of rainfall patterns bazzano et al 2010 have observed higher soil water contents as a result of advanced rainfall patterns and xue and gavin 2008 also verified that early rainfall bursts generate more infiltration than events with late peaks according to flanagan et al 1988 and mehl et al 2011 higher soil loss is expected to take place for intermediate and delayed rainfall patterns this behavior is a consequence of higher antecedent soil moisture by the time storm peak occurs reducing infiltration capacity and thus enhancing runoff soil water content is one of the main abiotic factors controlling vegetation cover and biome sustainability moreover soil water content plays a hydrological control on partitioning rainfall between runoff and infiltration brocca et al 2014 the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture impacts a variety of ecosystem dynamics in semiarid environments vereecken et al 2008 porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2002 in such areas subject to strong seasonal climate variation infiltration capacity should vary along the hydrological year as result of changes in soil moisture cerdà 1997 castillo et al 2003 have showed that antecedent soil moisture might play a distinct role for runoff generation in semiarid catchments depending on rainfall intensity soil hydraulic conductivity and plant canopy where experimental soil moisture data is available with high temporal resolution soil water balance models can be very useful to investigate the main components of soil moisture dynamics in particular the infiltration component for instance brocca et al 2008 successfully applied the green ampt formulation for simulating infiltration and soil moisture temporal variations from unsteady rain and hence provided insights on the infiltration behavior for three different sites in europe based on extensive studies at an swedish baltic archipelago saona et al 2010 pointed out that soil water and nutrients gradients controlled vegetation spatial distribution soil moisture was scored from very dry to moist due to its strong seasonal variation and such scores highlighted the role soil moisture plays on the ecology of the studied islands fernando de noronha archipelago is located at the brazilian coast presents a semiarid climate has no springs or perennial rivers and rainfall during short raining season is the main fresh water source groundwater is limited and saline moreover surface water is subject to periods of water shortage during the dry season highlighting the importance of investigating hydrological processes such as infiltration directly related to water resources conservation and use in the region the archipelago has been largely studied for several aspects such as geology geomorphology biology soil mapping heavy metals in soils and climate aspects marques et al 2007 marques et al 2014 da silva et al 2014 lopes and ulbrich 2015 lacerda et al 2015 fabricio neta et al 2016 lacerda et al 2015 have highlighted that warming and drying trends are expected to reduce water availability at the noronha archipelago in near future previously addressing water resources availability motta et al 2008 have investigated surface water quality in reservoirs and montenegro et al 2009 have studied alternatives to increment fresh water accumulation at the main catchments and also have developed soil hydraulic in situ tests to support future infiltration analysis on the main soil types particularly for applying the green ampt formulation notwithstanding such efforts infiltration process studies are still lacking in the archipelago relating rainfall temporal structure to soil wetting occurrence such condition has motivated the development of a plot scale detailed experimental study for hydrological monitoring at the archipelagós main catchment in order to describe main rainfall patterns and investigate fine temporal resolution soil moisture dynamics essential to ecosystem sustainability similar environments around the world may also benefit from the results of such study hence the purpose of this study is to analyze rainfall erosivity investigate the influence of different rainfall temporal patterns on soil moisture dynamics and on soil water effectiveness to plants evaluating the infiltration component behavior during rainy seasons based on a three years intensive local scale experiment using high resolution data 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the archipelago of fernando de noronha lies offshore the brazilian coast at a distance of 360 km from natal rio grande do norte and 545 km from recife pernambuco between latitude 3 50 and 3 52 s and longitude 32 24 and 32 28 w fig 1 the group consists of 21 volcanic islands resulting from an eruption 12 million years ago the main island which gives the name to the archipelago has 17 6 km2 ribeiro et al 2006 a central plateau 50 70 m high forms the main island which is limited by steep slopes and scarps directly submitted to marine abrasion the climate is tropical semi arid with well defined dry and humid seasons aw based on 18 years of observations from an automatic meteorological station the average annual rainfall is 1418 mm with a rainy season between february and july and with potential evapotranspiration of 1038 mm per year there are two well defined seasons being the wet period usually from march to july and the dry season from august to january pessenda et al 2008 rainfall patterns long term cycles and trends temperatures and potential evapotranspiration time series are presented in fig 2 and also the monitored rainfall and soil moisture data due to dry tropical climate with oceanic influence the rainfall bursts and the recent volcanic or sedimentary parent material some soil weathering is observed in the island ribeiro et al 2006 with sediment accumulation at the main surface reservoirs montenegro et al 2009 a view of natural vegetation cover is provided 2 2 hydrology soils and vegetation concerning to the noronha island hydrology the maceió river is the main water course of the island and flows into the xaréu reservoir all surface reservoirs at the archipelago are intermittent drying quickly at the end of the rainy season pessenda et al 2008 for water availability assessment at the main island montenegro et al 2009 described the main catchments of the archipelago mapping the soil types and land cover and evaluated their potential to generate runoff based on the scs method for hydrological modeling for the xareu catchment in situ soil hydraulic characterizations were carried out marques et al 2007 analyzed morphological physical chemical and mineralogical soil properties and identified the predominant soil types of the noronha island as entisols vertisols and cambisols the soil in the study area is a vertic sodic cambisol wrb 2015 and cambissolo háplico sódico vértico embrapa 2013 the soil physical parameters and retention curves were evaluated from undisturbed soil samples the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity was determined using a guelph permeameter the saturated soil moisture content is 0 56 cm3cm 3 residual soil moisture content of 0 21 cm3cm 3 and soil moisture content at field capacity of 0 31 cm3cm 3 the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity is 4 32 mm h 1 the sand silt and clay percentages are 355 160 e 485 g kg 1 respectively more details can be found in montenegro et al 2009 regarding van genuchten parameters for soil water retention curves and parameter estimation for the green ampt infiltration formulation the natural vegetation is a tree shrub deciduous forest fig 1 similar to the continental caatinga vegetation of the semi arid northeast brazil such vegetation is strongly dependent on rainfall events as highlighted in fig 1 water lettuce pistia stratiotes specie has been identified at several surface reservoirs in noronha due to its long root zone this vegetation may increase water loss by evapotranspiration brezny et al 1973 2 3 experimental plot for hydrological monitoring the experimental site was installed at the xareu catchment hillslope which location is presented in fig 1 aiming to provide original high quality datasets on rainfall bursts with high temporal resolution one hour and on soil moisture at two distinct soil depths as discussed later in this document during a three years period the experimental plot in the xareu watershed was located at a representative area regarding soil type natural vegetation equipment safety hillslope and accessibility the plot was installed on vertic cambisol which corresponds to 51 6 of the main soils types of the xaréu catchment in an area under direct supervision of the fernando de noronha administration office the plot 4 5 m width 11 0 m length was delimited by wall bricks inserted 10 cm into the soil sixteen campbell cs 616 soil moisture probes connected to a cr1000 campbell scientific datalogger were installed in the vertical position at 10 40 and 40 70 cm soil layers fig 3 for detailed wetting and drying processes monitoring in the soil profile increasing precision of the experimental readings the vertical installation position allowed a better description of the mean hydrological behavior of the studied soil layers encompassing vertical heterogeneity a 108 temperature probe was inserted at 30 cm soil depth and connected to the cr 1000 datalogger for temperature compensation according to the campbell scientific manual campbell scientific 2006 probe calibration was carried out in the field for the two different layers 10 40 and 40 70 cm soil was initially saturated at surface and undisturbed soil samples were extracted during the wetting and drying process for volumetric soil moisture evaluation soil salinity was lower than 1 ds m 1 and thus does not have influenced on the soil moisture measurements the cs616 probes measure the volumetric soil water content using the fdr technique if site specific calibration is carried out such probes are able to produce precise results particularly when a temperature correction is adopted according to mittelbach et al 2012 comparing the cs616 and other sensor types to tdr readings in this study a mean value from 8 readings was used per soil layer for better soil moisture estimates moreover mean air temperature variations for noronha was only 5 3 c 1 1 c during the experimental period see also fig 2 which reduces cs616 uncertainties due to temperature effect field calibration equations between gravimetric moisture measurements θgrav and cs 616 readings were for 10 40 cm and 40 70 cm layers respectively eqs 1a and 1b 1a θ cs 616 4 45 e 0 03 θ grav r 2 0 93 1b θ

time data were transmitted to the continent federal rural university of pernambuco state and fernando de noronha general administration office by a campbell scientific analo module rainfall data were logged at 5 min intervals while soil moisture was recorded at 1 h time steps rainfall and soil moisture original data were obtained for the period from april 2009 to april 2011 and analyzed for the first time in this paper despite the installed telemetric transmission system data download procedures and equipment maintenance were regularly carried out once a month vegetation at the experimental

cleome spinosa jacq 2 4 erosivity determination and rainfall patterns characterization to determine the erosivity index ei30 two specific parameters of erosive rainfall had to be multiplied total kinetic energy of rainfall ec and the maximum rainfall intensity in 30 min i30 in mm h 1 according to wischmeier and smith 1978 and expressed in units of the international system mj mm ha 1h 1 as proposed by foster et al 1981 this methodology is widely reported in the literature yin et al 2007 shamshad et al 2008 karami et al 2012 santos and montenegro 2012 aquino et al 2013 yin et al 2015 2017 nearing et al 2017 risal et al 2018 for this study erosive rainfall are considered as the events with no rain periods lower than 6 h and total volume of 10 mm or higher or with minimum duration of 15 min and total volume of 6 mm or higher cabeda 1976 erosive rainfall events were then classified based on different hydrological patterns according to the methodology proposed by horner and jens 1942 by which rainfall events are classified in advanced intermediate and delayed patterns based on the position of the peak intensity within the rainfall duration in addition intra event rainfall intermittency was quantified based on the fraction of no rain periods during a rainfall event which might interfere on hydrological processes particularly infiltration rate and hence soil wetting mainly when complex rainfall events occurs with multi peak bursts direct rainfall measurements were carried out based on a 5 min time resolution recorded data allowing erosivity to be analyzed and also rainfall pattern characterization then rainfall events were aggregated into 1 h intervals for infiltration and soil wetting analysis 2 5 soil water effectiveness swe the soil water effectiveness swe was calculated by eqs 1a and 1b porporato et al 2004 as 2 sw e s i s w s fc s w where si is the actual soil moisture sfc is the soil moisture at field capacity and sw is the soil moisture at the permanent wilting point soil moisture effectiveness can be classified into five groups table 2 the soil water effectiveness index is useful when analyzing water availability for crops mainly in areas exhibiting strong seasonal variations porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2002 soil wetting as result of infiltration process increases swe while evapotranspiration and deep percolation reduce swe mainly in the dry season 2 6 soil wetting analysis and soil moisture modeling the soil water effectiveness was evaluated for the whole monitored period from april 2009 to april 2011 based on the temporal analysis of the experimental soil moisture records soil wetting as result of the rainfall events was investigated according to their respective hydrological patterns soil wetting was determined for all erosive events as the percentage change of soil moisture at the end and at the beginning of each rainfall event relative to the initial soil moisture value results were then grouped based on the antecedent soil moisture in two classes according to the soil moisture at field capacity soil moisture is dependent upon rainfall temporal characteristics which include intensity duration intermittency and hydrological pattern several modeling approaches have been proposed and validated to simulate the temporal dynamics of soil moisture in this study a conceptual bucket model based on the soil water balance by brocca et al 2008 has been adopted for investigating the infiltration component the formulation includes the three main component of the soil water balance infiltration percolation and evapotranspiration details about the formulation can be found in brocca et al 2008 the infiltration component is based on the green and ampt approach for computing the infiltration rate f t 3 f t k s 1 ψ b θ s θ i f f t r t f t r t f t r t where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity ψb is the wetting front soil suction head θi is the soil moisture at the beginning of the rainfall event f is the cumulated infiltration depth from the onset of the rainfall and r t is the rainfall rate in this formulation the soil layer is assumed as a lumped system with thickness l which is consistent with the vertical installation layout of the cs616 probes previous estimates for the green and ampt parameters were provided by montenegro et al 2009 for the same experimental site in noronha archipelago and applied here actual evapotranspiration was calculated adopting a gradual linear decrease of the potential evapotranspiration etp t 4 et a et p t θ t θ r θ s θ r where θr is the residual soil moisture the potential evapotranspiration was computed by the hargreaves 1977 model based on the air temperature and solar radiation performance of the hargreaves model to represent potential evapotranspiration in noronha archipelago was previously evaluated by da silva et al 2014 based on penman monteith formulation for the 2003 2005 period due to failure of the air humidity sensor of the noronha pcd penman monteith equation was not applied in this study free drainage assumption was adopted for deep percolation based on the darcy s law adopted by brocca et al 2014 and related to θ t by 5 d t k s θ t θ r θ s θ r 3 2 λ where λ denotes the pore size distribution index estimated in this study from the saturated hydraulic conductivity as developed by rawls et al 1982 model performance was evaluated by two different scores the nash sutcliffe efficiency index ns the determination coefficient r2 computed on hourly observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall patterns and erosivity according to rainfall records with 5 min time resolution a total of 104 rainfall events were recorded in 2009 83 being considered non erosive while 21 were classified as erosive events table 3 in 2010 a total of 133 rainfall events were recorded out of these 102 were non erosive and 31 erosive events in 2011 for the four analyzed months the rainfall percentage was the highest in january with consequently higher erosivity followed by april a total of 67 rainfall events were recorded being 23 erosive ones the annual erosivity index for 2009 2010 and 2011 were 3926 33 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 5184 53 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 and 4658 59 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 respectively according to table 2 rainfall erosivity values are moderate to strong it is worth observing that rainfall records in 2009 started from april and might have underestimated the annual value rainfall erosivity factor r factor is one of the six main variables included in the universal soil loss equation usle highly relevant hill and interhill erosion evaluation yin et al 2017 there are some differences on erosivity calculation methodologies adopted in distinct regions particularly regarding the individual event definition and the criteria to define an event as an erosive one among the several models commonly used for estimation of the r factor the ei30 proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 is largely used in literature yin et al 2015 2017 nearing et al 2017 risal et al 2018 allowing direct comparison for different regions models for estimation of the erosivity index r factor or ei30 are commonly found in the literature yin et al 2017 highlight general techniques used for erosivity estimation based on empirical relationships between erosivity from limited finer resolution data and coarse resolution rainfall yin et al 2015 developed and calibrated 21 models based on rainfall data collected across a range of temporal resolutions in china and recommended 17 of them for developing erosivity maps when different coarser resolution data are available the erosivity data ei30 presented in this study may be useful to validate such models for the noronha archipelago although such verification is beyond the scope of this study the rainfall erosivity values observed in brazil range from 1672 to 22 452 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 lower values are found at the northeastern region in the pernambuco state and the highest values are found for the north region oliveira et al 2012 these higher erosivity values observed in the tropics are caused by the high amount of precipitation intensity and kinetic energy of rain as well known high annual rainfall depth is not necessarily associated to high erosivity indexes fig 4 shows the distribution of the number of monthly erosive rainfalls per hydrological pattern it was verified that most erosive rainfall events in 2009 fig 4a had an advanced pattern followed by intermediate and delayed fig 4b 2010 shows that as in 2009 the advanced rainfall pattern occurred more frequently in march april may august and september while the intermediate pattern occurred mainly in june and july rainfall events with a delayed pattern occurred in may june and july in 2011 fig 4c as in 2009 and 2010 the advanced pattern was the most frequent one the advanced rainfall pattern was observed in all four analyzed months whereas the intermediate pattern did not occurred in february and the delayed pattern did not occurred in january in addition examples of 5 min resolution rainfall bursts within single events are presented highlighting the complex multi peak characteristic of some of rainfall events in noronha archipelago the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity in advanced intermediate and delayed patterns is also shown in fig 4 for the advanced pattern 50 of the values are above 45 6 mm h 1 reaching values of up to 91 2 mm h 1 for the intermediate pattern 50 of the values are higher than 30 mm h 1 reaching 80 4 mm h 1 whereas for the delayed pattern 50 of the values exceeded 55 2 mm h 1 and the maximum was 115 2 mm h 1 it can be noticed that the rainfall intensities are the highest for the delayed pattern as high rainfall erosivity is directly associated to risk of soil losses the values presented in this study highlights the importance of soil conservation practices to be pursued in the island this is especially important in this ecosystem regarding that the water supply in the island is mainly dependent on surface water reservoirs and their storage capacity may be seriously affected by siltation due to the soil losses jeopardizing water security in the island as observed by montenegro et al 2009 thus these results reinforce the need for adaptive management strategies as increase rainwater harvesting practices soil protection and conservation of the local natural vegetation 3 2 temporal dynamics of observed soil moisture and soil wetting fig 5 presents the soil moisture response to the rainfall splitted up into wet and dry periods from 2009 to 2011 the period of high soil moisture lasted from april to june 2009 fig 5a while for the rest of the year the soil moisture tended to decrease mainly due to reduced precipitation fig 5b reaching a residual value during the rainy season the soil moisture values were close to saturation despite the occurrence of rainfall from august 2009 the soil moisture values slowly decreased even occurring sparse rainfalls events generally lower than 2 mm the total precipitation in this period did not exceed 70 mm in six months rainfall is likely to be intercepted by the tree canopy and to evaporate without reaching the soil surface after nine months between june 2009 and march 2010 with soil moisture content value lower than 0 15 cm3 cm 3 a rainfall event of 22 7 mm in march 2010 fig 5c produced a sharp increase in the soil moisture content close to 0 5 cm3 cm 3 and for the period between april and august 2010 the mean values for the two investigated soil depths were around 0 33 cm3 cm 3 fig 6 d it was also observed that during the intervals between consecutive rainfall events the soil moisture values at 10 40 cm were lower than at 40 70 cm while after the first rainfall events in 2010 the soil moisture at the upper layer increased more rapidly than at 40 70 cm fig 5c reaching the highest values seneviratne et al 2010 observed in a semiarid area that soil moisture at the shallowest depths is more prone to be affected by rainfall vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation thus lower soil moisture is expected nearby the soil surface than at deeper layers due to high evapotranspiration at these regions yang et al 2014 it is observed in fig 5d that the dry period for 2010 spans from july to december with soil moisture values around 0 13 cm3 cm 3 very low for the two soil depths after that another wet period takes place from december 2010 to april 2011 fig 5e at which soil moisture reaches again values close to saturation as in the 2009 and 2010 years although some differences in soil moisture between the upper and the deeper soil layers have occurred as already discussed at the beginning of the raining season or after periods of rainfall intermittency the two studied layers exhibits a strong correlation as presented in fig 5f based on the time series of soil moisture the relationship between relative soil wetting and total precipitation per event was analyzed for each rainfall pattern grouping experimental data according to the antecedent soil moisture for each rainfall event fig 6a and c show the linear regression analysis between relative soil wetting and total rainfall for antecedent soil moisture content values below and above 0 33 cm3 cm 3 respectively the value of 0 33 cm3 cm 3 was adopted based on experimental records being close to the soil moisture value at field capacity for the cambisol and it is consistent with the value adopted for fitting the van genuchten water retention curve for the same soil according to montenegro et al 2009 for lower values of antecedent soil water content fig 6a slope coefficients were all significant for the three rainfall patterns according to the t tests at 95 confidence level moreover applying the t test to compare relative soil wetting to total rainfall ratio advanced profile rainfall events produce significant higher wetting than both the intermediate and the delayed profile ones whereas differences between the intermediate and delayed profile could not be detected on the other hand for higher antecedent soil water content differences among soil wetting from distinct rainfall profile are not significant thus for the advanced rainfall patterns early rainfall peaks occurring when soil moisture is lower enhance soil wetting as previously highlighted by xue and gavin 2008 such results are also in agreement with experimental observations of de lima et al 2012 and montenegro et al 2013 however if antecedent soil water is close to field capacity soil wetting at the experimental plot seems not to be dependent on rainfall pattern fig 6c such result highlights the control of antecedent soil moisture to the infiltration process during the raining season when soil is usually wetter in the same way castillo et al 2003 point out the role of the initial soil content on infiltration in vegetated semiarid areas this hypothesis for the experimental plot will be discussed later in this document based on the simulated infiltration depths fig 6b and d exhibit examples of the rainfall temporal structure for 5 min and 1 h resolutions and soil moisture temporal variation for 1 h recording interval in fact those events present a multi peak behavior and long no rain periods which poses a complexity on the soil wetting and drying processes and on predicting soil moisture from the measured rainfall this issue is discussed in the next section in fig 6b it can be verified the rainfall event in january 1st 2011 presented a high intermittency and four main bursts as the antecedent soil water content was low the intermediate peak and then the highest delayed burst produced a sharp rise for the soil moisture at the upper soil layer with a soil moistening higher than 30 while soil moisture at the deeper layer almost did not increased in fig 6d it can be verified the rainfall event starting in june 12th 2009 presented a high intermittency and two main bursts occurred the early main peak occurred when antecedent soil moisture was already high and hence soil wetting was very low for both the upper and the deeper layer using the same grouping criteria adopted for the 10 40 cm layer we analyzed the correlation between total rainfall and relative soil wetting for the 40 70 cm layer fig 7 a and b a threshold value for rainfall to promote soil wetting seems to occur which might be associated to the wetting front dynamics from soil surface as the soil moistening at the experimental site is predominantly vertical although determination coefficients are high for the linear regression models significant differences are not verified among datasets the distinct behavior for soil moistening in the upper and lower soil layer might be associated to the soil hydraulic conductivity which is then the main percolation control for wetting deeper soil layers hence the deeper layer 40 70 cm presents a lower connection with the soil surface particularly due to the soil clay content for instance wang et al 2016 highlight that the clay fraction distribution along the soil profile is correlated to the soil moisture profile controlling the wetting front to the deeper layers 3 3 soil water effectiveness the frequency distribution of soil water effectiveness is shown in fig 8 there was a marked predominance of high soil water effectiveness higher than 40 in both layers extremely effective level levels 4 and 5 occurred at a percentage of about 20 each and intermediate levels 2 and 3 at a percentage of only 10 respectively this shows that the soil wetting drying cycles were relatively short which was conditioned by the soil hydraulic conductivity soil water effectiveness was adopted by chen et al 2007 to evaluate vegetation restoration potential in the loess plateau china and by montenegro and ragab 2010 to characterize soil moisture dynamics in a brazilian semiarid catchment and its impact on actual evapotranspiration and water balance porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2002 used the soil water effectiveness to investigate the effects of soil moisture deficit on plant conditions predominance of levels 4 and 5 remarkable contributes to vegetation cover development as verified in noronha archipelago during the raining season see also fig 1 the coupling between soil water effectiveness and vegetation cover as stated by seneviratne et al 2010 was also verified by saona et al 2010 for an archipelago at the baltic sea based on the soil moisture time series for the 10 40 cm layer it can be noticed that an increase on soil water effectiveness according to table 2 occurred in 18 2 out of the total advanced rainfall pattern events a level 1 of soil water effectiveness at the end of the rainfall event was found in 91 of the total events corresponding to the best soil moisture effectiveness for plants for the intermediate rainfall pattern however increase in soil moisture effectiveness occurred in 36 8 of the events with maximum soil water effectiveness end of rain in all cases for the delayed rainfall pattern transition level occurred for 20 of the events for the 40 70 cm layer increase in effectiveness of soil moisture to plants occurred in 6 21 and 20 of rainfall events with advanced intermediate and delayed patterns respectively at the end of the rainfall events with advanced pattern in 72 7 of the events the soil water effectiveness level to plants was equal to 1 while for the intermediate rainfall pattern this percentage increased up to 84 2 reaching 100 for the delayed rainfall pattern 3 4 soil moisture modeling and infiltration depths in order to examine further the infiltration process resulting from rainfall profiles parameter values for the soil water retention curves hydraulic conductivity and the green ampt equation provided by montenegro et al 2009 were adopted for soil moisture modeling for the saturated residual soil moisture values were updated by visual inspection of the experimental series and initially adopted as equal to 0 50 0 13 the wetting front soil suction head was 407 9 mm and saturated hydraulic conductivity was assumed to be as equal to half of the value obtained by montenegro et al 2009 to account for air entrapment as suggested by whisler and bouwer 1970 and largely used brocca et al 2008 s formulationa successfully predicted soil moisture for the observed wet periods a canopy interception capacity value was set to 2 mm three contrasting periods in terms of total rainfall were selected for simulation one for each monitored year for part of the 2009 wet period from april 23th to june 30th period 1 ns value was 0 63 and determination coefficient of 0 70 adopting a saturated water content equal to 0 50 for 2010 from april 23th to june 30th period 2 however such value was slightly reduced to 0 48 producing a ns r2 value of 0 76 0 86 the model was then validated for january 20th to april 18th 2011 period 3 keeping the same parameters values with ns r2 equal to 0 81 0 81 observed and simulated time series are shown in fig 9 together with rainfall and infiltration depths time series total rainfall varied from 828 7 mm period 1 to 219 10 mm period 3 being equal to 220 19 mm for period 2 total simulated infiltration depths were 365 1 mm 219 1 mm and 220 2 mm for periods 1 to 3 respectively hence while 68 of the total rainfall have infiltrated for period 3 only 44 of the total rainfall was converted into infiltration in period 1 highlighting the complexity of the infiltration process in noronha and on the other hand the relevance of adopting high resolution temporal scale for rainfall monitoring in order to allow an appropriate prediction of soil wetting dynamics fig 10 relates rainfall and the associated natural infiltration depths for the three simulation periods although high dispersion is observed for individual events a general trend could be considered when rainfall is grouped and the mean infiltration depth estimated with an approximated exponential pattern being verified for the mean values at the box plots when natural events are considered and rainfall hydrological patterns analyzed differences for infiltration depths could not be detected among the three rainfall profiles indeed fig 10b presents the box plots for the infiltration ratios equal to infiltration depth divided by total rainfall for different classes of total rainfall although a general decay can be verified as expected differences for infiltration ratios among rainfall patterns are not observed during the raining season for scenarios of wetted soil as previously discussed the mean infiltration ratio is 0 65 0 16 for a total of 70 rainfall events for rainfall events lower than 20 mm a ratio value of 0 70 0 12 is obtained while for total rainfall 20 mm on average 56 18 infiltrates into the soil it can be verified that infiltration depths at the experimental plot are high being associated to soil characteristics complex rainfall events and vegetation cover the latter providing a biotic feedback enhancing soil moistening 4 conclusions this study produces information about erosive rainfall characteristics and temporal structure in the fernando de noronha archipelago the analysis investigates the influence of different rainfall patterns on infiltration depths the soil moisture dynamics and soil water effectiveness to sustain vegetation focusing on high temporal resolution data from an experimental plot with native species cover in the main watershed of the archipelago and during a time period representative of climate seasonal dynamics given the remarkably relevance of soil moisture to sustain archipelagós biodiversity the main outcomes are 1 rainfall events that occur in the archipelago have high erosive potential frequently exhibiting a complex temporal structure with multi peak bursts within an event and also intermittency 2 the most frequent rainfall pattern is the advanced which contributes to high infiltration depths and thus pronounced soil wetting particularly for the near surface soil layer and for low antecedent soil moisture condition 3 high moisture indexes are verified during the rainy season with percentages higher than 40 extremely effective level for the investigated depths and thus important for plant water uptake and development 4 green ampt formulation coupled to routines for percolation and evapotranspiration components successfully simulated observed soil moisture data based on hourly rainfall information and validated parameters previously obtained from field and laboratory measurements such model constitutes an important tool for estimating infiltration depths and simulating impacts of different land use and future climate scenarios on water resources availability for noronha archipelago 5 high simulated infiltration depths occur during the rainy season fully replenishing soil water levels 6 despite the short experimental period of three years proper analysis was performed on hydrological key variables for the noronha archipelago from high resolution

7171,soil water availability has a strong role on vegetation conservation and biodiversity particularly at vulnerable environments such as archipelagos subject to significant temporal changes of climate and rainfall which influence soil weathering and erosion processes few field studies on hydrology of volcanic islands in the atlantic ocean have been developed focusing on soil and water temporal dynamics and conservation mainly because such studies require data with high temporal resolution and also due to the financial costs involved with field data acquisition at such remote places considering the importance of soil moisture content to several hydrological processes and islands environmental sustainability this study aimed to investigate the soil water temporal dynamics in relation to different rainfall patterns and also the rainfall erosivity and its temporal variation and the resulting infiltration depths during a typical hydrological period in an experimental plot at the main watershed of fernando de noronha in the brazilian atlantic coast rainfall was recorded every 5 min and soil moisture was intensely monitored by 16 moisture probes installed at 10 40 cm and 40 70 cm layers during three years representing the typical local hydrological regime and seasons rainfall bursts pattern were identified and described experimental data allowed a hydrological model to be calibrated and validated providing estimates of infiltration depths which can be valuable for water resources planning and management hydrological patterns were determined for each erosive rainfall depending on the precipitation peak position as advanced intermediate and delayed the soil water effectiveness was also evaluated and related to the different rainfall patterns soil moisture is highest from april to june close to saturation whilst for the other months the values were close to the residual value the rainfall erosivity in the archipelago was identified as moderate to strong and the most frequent rainfall pattern was the advanced fast wetting drying cycles during the rainfall events were observed due to rainfall intermittency evapotranspiration and to soil hydraulic conductivity it was observed the prevalence of high moisture indexes with percentages higher than 40 extremely effective level for both investigated depths within the first 70 cm of soil essential for plant water uptake the observed rainfall erosivity highlights the importance of defining local strategies for soil and water conservation aimed at water security in the island based on a simulation model which was successfully calibrated nash sutcliffe efficiency index ns 0 76 and validated ns 0 81 for periods in the wet season high infiltration depths have been identified which contributes to canopy conservation in the archipelago keywords soil water effectiveness oceanic island rainfall patterns infiltration ratio 1 introduction rainfall characteristics and bursts patterns are of paramount importance for ecohydrology and biodiversity conservation affecting infiltration processes and spatio temporal soil moisture distribution intensities of rainfall bursts and their temporal distribution within an event can be more relevant in terms of hydrological processes than does the mean equivalent rainfall rate dunkerley 2011 table 1 rainfall profiles during storm events and their impacts on infiltration runoff and soil erosion have been largely addressed in literature de lima et al 2012 have verified that the rain storm temporal variability may have a strong influence on runoff discharge and soil losses the latter being correlated to the rainfall erosivity yin et al 2015 have pointed out that rainfall erosivity is usually better represented by the maximum 30 min intensities of the event moreover rainfall intermittency may affect hydrological processes such as infiltration depths conversion of rainfall to soil moisture and soil losses marani et al 1997 montenegro et al 2013 dunkerley 2015 indeed long no rain periods within an event may reduce soil surface moisture and enhance infiltration rates rainfall patterns can be classified as proposed by horner and jens 1942 as advanced intermediate and delayed according to the part of the event duration in which the peak falls several authors e g cassol et al 2007 carvalho et al 2009 bazzano et al 2010 aquino et al 2013 adopted the same methodology for the classification of rainfall patterns bazzano et al 2010 have observed higher soil water contents as a result of advanced rainfall patterns and xue and gavin 2008 also verified that early rainfall bursts generate more infiltration than events with late peaks according to flanagan et al 1988 and mehl et al 2011 higher soil loss is expected to take place for intermediate and delayed rainfall patterns this behavior is a consequence of higher antecedent soil moisture by the time storm peak occurs reducing infiltration capacity and thus enhancing runoff soil water content is one of the main abiotic factors controlling vegetation cover and biome sustainability moreover soil water content plays a hydrological control on partitioning rainfall between runoff and infiltration brocca et al 2014 the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture impacts a variety of ecosystem dynamics in semiarid environments vereecken et al 2008 porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2002 in such areas subject to strong seasonal climate variation infiltration capacity should vary along the hydrological year as result of changes in soil moisture cerdà 1997 castillo et al 2003 have showed that antecedent soil moisture might play a distinct role for runoff generation in semiarid catchments depending on rainfall intensity soil hydraulic conductivity and plant canopy where experimental soil moisture data is available with high temporal resolution soil water balance models can be very useful to investigate the main components of soil moisture dynamics in particular the infiltration component for instance brocca et al 2008 successfully applied the green ampt formulation for simulating infiltration and soil moisture temporal variations from unsteady rain and hence provided insights on the infiltration behavior for three different sites in europe based on extensive studies at an swedish baltic archipelago saona et al 2010 pointed out that soil water and nutrients gradients controlled vegetation spatial distribution soil moisture was scored from very dry to moist due to its strong seasonal variation and such scores highlighted the role soil moisture plays on the ecology of the studied islands fernando de noronha archipelago is located at the brazilian coast presents a semiarid climate has no springs or perennial rivers and rainfall during short raining season is the main fresh water source groundwater is limited and saline moreover surface water is subject to periods of water shortage during the dry season highlighting the importance of investigating hydrological processes such as infiltration directly related to water resources conservation and use in the region the archipelago has been largely studied for several aspects such as geology geomorphology biology soil mapping heavy metals in soils and climate aspects marques et al 2007 marques et al 2014 da silva et al 2014 lopes and ulbrich 2015 lacerda et al 2015 fabricio neta et al 2016 lacerda et al 2015 have highlighted that warming and drying trends are expected to reduce water availability at the noronha archipelago in near future previously addressing water resources availability motta et al 2008 have investigated surface water quality in reservoirs and montenegro et al 2009 have studied alternatives to increment fresh water accumulation at the main catchments and also have developed soil hydraulic in situ tests to support future infiltration analysis on the main soil types particularly for applying the green ampt formulation notwithstanding such efforts infiltration process studies are still lacking in the archipelago relating rainfall temporal structure to soil wetting occurrence such condition has motivated the development of a plot scale detailed experimental study for hydrological monitoring at the archipelagós main catchment in order to describe main rainfall patterns and investigate fine temporal resolution soil moisture dynamics essential to ecosystem sustainability similar environments around the world may also benefit from the results of such study hence the purpose of this study is to analyze rainfall erosivity investigate the influence of different rainfall temporal patterns on soil moisture dynamics and on soil water effectiveness to plants evaluating the infiltration component behavior during rainy seasons based on a three years intensive local scale experiment using high resolution data 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the archipelago of fernando de noronha lies offshore the brazilian coast at a distance of 360 km from natal rio grande do norte and 545 km from recife pernambuco between latitude 3 50 and 3 52 s and longitude 32 24 and 32 28 w fig 1 the group consists of 21 volcanic islands resulting from an eruption 12 million years ago the main island which gives the name to the archipelago has 17 6 km2 ribeiro et al 2006 a central plateau 50 70 m high forms the main island which is limited by steep slopes and scarps directly submitted to marine abrasion the climate is tropical semi arid with well defined dry and humid seasons aw based on 18 years of observations from an automatic meteorological station the average annual rainfall is 1418 mm with a rainy season between february and july and with potential evapotranspiration of 1038 mm per year there are two well defined seasons being the wet period usually from march to july and the dry season from august to january pessenda et al 2008 rainfall patterns long term cycles and trends temperatures and potential evapotranspiration time series are presented in fig 2 and also the monitored rainfall and soil moisture data due to dry tropical climate with oceanic influence the rainfall bursts and the recent volcanic or sedimentary parent material some soil weathering is observed in the island ribeiro et al 2006 with sediment accumulation at the main surface reservoirs montenegro et al 2009 a view of natural vegetation cover is provided 2 2 hydrology soils and vegetation concerning to the noronha island hydrology the maceió river is the main water course of the island and flows into the xaréu reservoir all surface reservoirs at the archipelago are intermittent drying quickly at the end of the rainy season pessenda et al 2008 for water availability assessment at the main island montenegro et al 2009 described the main catchments of the archipelago mapping the soil types and land cover and evaluated their potential to generate runoff based on the scs method for hydrological modeling for the xareu catchment in situ soil hydraulic characterizations were carried out marques et al 2007 analyzed morphological physical chemical and mineralogical soil properties and identified the predominant soil types of the noronha island as entisols vertisols and cambisols the soil in the study area is a vertic sodic cambisol wrb 2015 and cambissolo háplico sódico vértico embrapa 2013 the soil physical parameters and retention curves were evaluated from undisturbed soil samples the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity was determined using a guelph permeameter the saturated soil moisture content is 0 56 cm3cm 3 residual soil moisture content of 0 21 cm3cm 3 and soil moisture content at field capacity of 0 31 cm3cm 3 the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity is 4 32 mm h 1 the sand silt and clay percentages are 355 160 e 485 g kg 1 respectively more details can be found in montenegro et al 2009 regarding van genuchten parameters for soil water retention curves and parameter estimation for the green ampt infiltration formulation the natural vegetation is a tree shrub deciduous forest fig 1 similar to the continental caatinga vegetation of the semi arid northeast brazil such vegetation is strongly dependent on rainfall events as highlighted in fig 1 water lettuce pistia stratiotes specie has been identified at several surface reservoirs in noronha due to its long root zone this vegetation may increase water loss by evapotranspiration brezny et al 1973 2 3 experimental plot for hydrological monitoring the experimental site was installed at the xareu catchment hillslope which location is presented in fig 1 aiming to provide original high quality datasets on rainfall bursts with high temporal resolution one hour and on soil moisture at two distinct soil depths as discussed later in this document during a three years period the experimental plot in the xareu watershed was located at a representative area regarding soil type natural vegetation equipment safety hillslope and accessibility the plot was installed on vertic cambisol which corresponds to 51 6 of the main soils types of the xaréu catchment in an area under direct supervision of the fernando de noronha administration office the plot 4 5 m width 11 0 m length was delimited by wall bricks inserted 10 cm into the soil sixteen campbell cs 616 soil moisture probes connected to a cr1000 campbell scientific datalogger were installed in the vertical position at 10 40 and 40 70 cm soil layers fig 3 for detailed wetting and drying processes monitoring in the soil profile increasing precision of the experimental readings the vertical installation position allowed a better description of the mean hydrological behavior of the studied soil layers encompassing vertical heterogeneity a 108 temperature probe was inserted at 30 cm soil depth and connected to the cr 1000 datalogger for temperature compensation according to the campbell scientific manual campbell scientific 2006 probe calibration was carried out in the field for the two different layers 10 40 and 40 70 cm soil was initially saturated at surface and undisturbed soil samples were extracted during the wetting and drying process for volumetric soil moisture evaluation soil salinity was lower than 1 ds m 1 and thus does not have influenced on the soil moisture measurements the cs616 probes measure the volumetric soil water content using the fdr technique if site specific calibration is carried out such probes are able to produce precise results particularly when a temperature correction is adopted according to mittelbach et al 2012 comparing the cs616 and other sensor types to tdr readings in this study a mean value from 8 readings was used per soil layer for better soil moisture estimates moreover mean air temperature variations for noronha was only 5 3 c 1 1 c during the experimental period see also fig 2 which reduces cs616 uncertainties due to temperature effect field calibration equations between gravimetric moisture measurements θgrav and cs 616 readings were for 10 40 cm and 40 70 cm layers respectively eqs 1a and 1b 1a θ cs 616 4 45 e 0 03 θ grav r 2 0 93 1b θ

time data were transmitted to the continent federal rural university of pernambuco state and fernando de noronha general administration office by a campbell scientific analo module rainfall data were logged at 5 min intervals while soil moisture was recorded at 1 h time steps rainfall and soil moisture original data were obtained for the period from april 2009 to april 2011 and analyzed for the first time in this paper despite the installed telemetric transmission system data download procedures and equipment maintenance were regularly carried out once a month vegetation at the experimental

cleome spinosa jacq 2 4 erosivity determination and rainfall patterns characterization to determine the erosivity index ei30 two specific parameters of erosive rainfall had to be multiplied total kinetic energy of rainfall ec and the maximum rainfall intensity in 30 min i30 in mm h 1 according to wischmeier and smith 1978 and expressed in units of the international system mj mm ha 1h 1 as proposed by foster et al 1981 this methodology is widely reported in the literature yin et al 2007 shamshad et al 2008 karami et al 2012 santos and montenegro 2012 aquino et al 2013 yin et al 2015 2017 nearing et al 2017 risal et al 2018 for this study erosive rainfall are considered as the events with no rain periods lower than 6 h and total volume of 10 mm or higher or with minimum duration of 15 min and total volume of 6 mm or higher cabeda 1976 erosive rainfall events were then classified based on different hydrological patterns according to the methodology proposed by horner and jens 1942 by which rainfall events are classified in advanced intermediate and delayed patterns based on the position of the peak intensity within the rainfall duration in addition intra event rainfall intermittency was quantified based on the fraction of no rain periods during a rainfall event which might interfere on hydrological processes particularly infiltration rate and hence soil wetting mainly when complex rainfall events occurs with multi peak bursts direct rainfall measurements were carried out based on a 5 min time resolution recorded data allowing erosivity to be analyzed and also rainfall pattern characterization then rainfall events were aggregated into 1 h intervals for infiltration and soil wetting analysis 2 5 soil water effectiveness swe the soil water effectiveness swe was calculated by eqs 1a and 1b porporato et al 2004 as 2 sw e s i s w s fc s w where si is the actual soil moisture sfc is the soil moisture at field capacity and sw is the soil moisture at the permanent wilting point soil moisture effectiveness can be classified into five groups table 2 the soil water effectiveness index is useful when analyzing water availability for crops mainly in areas exhibiting strong seasonal variations porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2002 soil wetting as result of infiltration process increases swe while evapotranspiration and deep percolation reduce swe mainly in the dry season 2 6 soil wetting analysis and soil moisture modeling the soil water effectiveness was evaluated for the whole monitored period from april 2009 to april 2011 based on the temporal analysis of the experimental soil moisture records soil wetting as result of the rainfall events was investigated according to their respective hydrological patterns soil wetting was determined for all erosive events as the percentage change of soil moisture at the end and at the beginning of each rainfall event relative to the initial soil moisture value results were then grouped based on the antecedent soil moisture in two classes according to the soil moisture at field capacity soil moisture is dependent upon rainfall temporal characteristics which include intensity duration intermittency and hydrological pattern several modeling approaches have been proposed and validated to simulate the temporal dynamics of soil moisture in this study a conceptual bucket model based on the soil water balance by brocca et al 2008 has been adopted for investigating the infiltration component the formulation includes the three main component of the soil water balance infiltration percolation and evapotranspiration details about the formulation can be found in brocca et al 2008 the infiltration component is based on the green and ampt approach for computing the infiltration rate f t 3 f t k s 1 ψ b θ s θ i f f t r t f t r t f t r t where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity ψb is the wetting front soil suction head θi is the soil moisture at the beginning of the rainfall event f is the cumulated infiltration depth from the onset of the rainfall and r t is the rainfall rate in this formulation the soil layer is assumed as a lumped system with thickness l which is consistent with the vertical installation layout of the cs616 probes previous estimates for the green and ampt parameters were provided by montenegro et al 2009 for the same experimental site in noronha archipelago and applied here actual evapotranspiration was calculated adopting a gradual linear decrease of the potential evapotranspiration etp t 4 et a et p t θ t θ r θ s θ r where θr is the residual soil moisture the potential evapotranspiration was computed by the hargreaves 1977 model based on the air temperature and solar radiation performance of the hargreaves model to represent potential evapotranspiration in noronha archipelago was previously evaluated by da silva et al 2014 based on penman monteith formulation for the 2003 2005 period due to failure of the air humidity sensor of the noronha pcd penman monteith equation was not applied in this study free drainage assumption was adopted for deep percolation based on the darcy s law adopted by brocca et al 2014 and related to θ t by 5 d t k s θ t θ r θ s θ r 3 2 λ where λ denotes the pore size distribution index estimated in this study from the saturated hydraulic conductivity as developed by rawls et al 1982 model performance was evaluated by two different scores the nash sutcliffe efficiency index ns the determination coefficient r2 computed on hourly observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall patterns and erosivity according to rainfall records with 5 min time resolution a total of 104 rainfall events were recorded in 2009 83 being considered non erosive while 21 were classified as erosive events table 3 in 2010 a total of 133 rainfall events were recorded out of these 102 were non erosive and 31 erosive events in 2011 for the four analyzed months the rainfall percentage was the highest in january with consequently higher erosivity followed by april a total of 67 rainfall events were recorded being 23 erosive ones the annual erosivity index for 2009 2010 and 2011 were 3926 33 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 5184 53 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 and 4658 59 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 respectively according to table 2 rainfall erosivity values are moderate to strong it is worth observing that rainfall records in 2009 started from april and might have underestimated the annual value rainfall erosivity factor r factor is one of the six main variables included in the universal soil loss equation usle highly relevant hill and interhill erosion evaluation yin et al 2017 there are some differences on erosivity calculation methodologies adopted in distinct regions particularly regarding the individual event definition and the criteria to define an event as an erosive one among the several models commonly used for estimation of the r factor the ei30 proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 is largely used in literature yin et al 2015 2017 nearing et al 2017 risal et al 2018 allowing direct comparison for different regions models for estimation of the erosivity index r factor or ei30 are commonly found in the literature yin et al 2017 highlight general techniques used for erosivity estimation based on empirical relationships between erosivity from limited finer resolution data and coarse resolution rainfall yin et al 2015 developed and calibrated 21 models based on rainfall data collected across a range of temporal resolutions in china and recommended 17 of them for developing erosivity maps when different coarser resolution data are available the erosivity data ei30 presented in this study may be useful to validate such models for the noronha archipelago although such verification is beyond the scope of this study the rainfall erosivity values observed in brazil range from 1672 to 22 452 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 lower values are found at the northeastern region in the pernambuco state and the highest values are found for the north region oliveira et al 2012 these higher erosivity values observed in the tropics are caused by the high amount of precipitation intensity and kinetic energy of rain as well known high annual rainfall depth is not necessarily associated to high erosivity indexes fig 4 shows the distribution of the number of monthly erosive rainfalls per hydrological pattern it was verified that most erosive rainfall events in 2009 fig 4a had an advanced pattern followed by intermediate and delayed fig 4b 2010 shows that as in 2009 the advanced rainfall pattern occurred more frequently in march april may august and september while the intermediate pattern occurred mainly in june and july rainfall events with a delayed pattern occurred in may june and july in 2011 fig 4c as in 2009 and 2010 the advanced pattern was the most frequent one the advanced rainfall pattern was observed in all four analyzed months whereas the intermediate pattern did not occurred in february and the delayed pattern did not occurred in january in addition examples of 5 min resolution rainfall bursts within single events are presented highlighting the complex multi peak characteristic of some of rainfall events in noronha archipelago the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity in advanced intermediate and delayed patterns is also shown in fig 4 for the advanced pattern 50 of the values are above 45 6 mm h 1 reaching values of up to 91 2 mm h 1 for the intermediate pattern 50 of the values are higher than 30 mm h 1 reaching 80 4 mm h 1 whereas for the delayed pattern 50 of the values exceeded 55 2 mm h 1 and the maximum was 115 2 mm h 1 it can be noticed that the rainfall intensities are the highest for the delayed pattern as high rainfall erosivity is directly associated to risk of soil losses the values presented in this study highlights the importance of soil conservation practices to be pursued in the island this is especially important in this ecosystem regarding that the water supply in the island is mainly dependent on surface water reservoirs and their storage capacity may be seriously affected by siltation due to the soil losses jeopardizing water security in the island as observed by montenegro et al 2009 thus these results reinforce the need for adaptive management strategies as increase rainwater harvesting practices soil protection and conservation of the local natural vegetation 3 2 temporal dynamics of observed soil moisture and soil wetting fig 5 presents the soil moisture response to the rainfall splitted up into wet and dry periods from 2009 to 2011 the period of high soil moisture lasted from april to june 2009 fig 5a while for the rest of the year the soil moisture tended to decrease mainly due to reduced precipitation fig 5b reaching a residual value during the rainy season the soil moisture values were close to saturation despite the occurrence of rainfall from august 2009 the soil moisture values slowly decreased even occurring sparse rainfalls events generally lower than 2 mm the total precipitation in this period did not exceed 70 mm in six months rainfall is likely to be intercepted by the tree canopy and to evaporate without reaching the soil surface after nine months between june 2009 and march 2010 with soil moisture content value lower than 0 15 cm3 cm 3 a rainfall event of 22 7 mm in march 2010 fig 5c produced a sharp increase in the soil moisture content close to 0 5 cm3 cm 3 and for the period between april and august 2010 the mean values for the two investigated soil depths were around 0 33 cm3 cm 3 fig 6 d it was also observed that during the intervals between consecutive rainfall events the soil moisture values at 10 40 cm were lower than at 40 70 cm while after the first rainfall events in 2010 the soil moisture at the upper layer increased more rapidly than at 40 70 cm fig 5c reaching the highest values seneviratne et al 2010 observed in a semiarid area that soil moisture at the shallowest depths is more prone to be affected by rainfall vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation thus lower soil moisture is expected nearby the soil surface than at deeper layers due to high evapotranspiration at these regions yang et al 2014 it is observed in fig 5d that the dry period for 2010 spans from july to december with soil moisture values around 0 13 cm3 cm 3 very low for the two soil depths after that another wet period takes place from december 2010 to april 2011 fig 5e at which soil moisture reaches again values close to saturation as in the 2009 and 2010 years although some differences in soil moisture between the upper and the deeper soil layers have occurred as already discussed at the beginning of the raining season or after periods of rainfall intermittency the two studied layers exhibits a strong correlation as presented in fig 5f based on the time series of soil moisture the relationship between relative soil wetting and total precipitation per event was analyzed for each rainfall pattern grouping experimental data according to the antecedent soil moisture for each rainfall event fig 6a and c show the linear regression analysis between relative soil wetting and total rainfall for antecedent soil moisture content values below and above 0 33 cm3 cm 3 respectively the value of 0 33 cm3 cm 3 was adopted based on experimental records being close to the soil moisture value at field capacity for the cambisol and it is consistent with the value adopted for fitting the van genuchten water retention curve for the same soil according to montenegro et al 2009 for lower values of antecedent soil water content fig 6a slope coefficients were all significant for the three rainfall patterns according to the t tests at 95 confidence level moreover applying the t test to compare relative soil wetting to total rainfall ratio advanced profile rainfall events produce significant higher wetting than both the intermediate and the delayed profile ones whereas differences between the intermediate and delayed profile could not be detected on the other hand for higher antecedent soil water content differences among soil wetting from distinct rainfall profile are not significant thus for the advanced rainfall patterns early rainfall peaks occurring when soil moisture is lower enhance soil wetting as previously highlighted by xue and gavin 2008 such results are also in agreement with experimental observations of de lima et al 2012 and montenegro et al 2013 however if antecedent soil water is close to field capacity soil wetting at the experimental plot seems not to be dependent on rainfall pattern fig 6c such result highlights the control of antecedent soil moisture to the infiltration process during the raining season when soil is usually wetter in the same way castillo et al 2003 point out the role of the initial soil content on infiltration in vegetated semiarid areas this hypothesis for the experimental plot will be discussed later in this document based on the simulated infiltration depths fig 6b and d exhibit examples of the rainfall temporal structure for 5 min and 1 h resolutions and soil moisture temporal variation for 1 h recording interval in fact those events present a multi peak behavior and long no rain periods which poses a complexity on the soil wetting and drying processes and on predicting soil moisture from the measured rainfall this issue is discussed in the next section in fig 6b it can be verified the rainfall event in january 1st 2011 presented a high intermittency and four main bursts as the antecedent soil water content was low the intermediate peak and then the highest delayed burst produced a sharp rise for the soil moisture at the upper soil layer with a soil moistening higher than 30 while soil moisture at the deeper layer almost did not increased in fig 6d it can be verified the rainfall event starting in june 12th 2009 presented a high intermittency and two main bursts occurred the early main peak occurred when antecedent soil moisture was already high and hence soil wetting was very low for both the upper and the deeper layer using the same grouping criteria adopted for the 10 40 cm layer we analyzed the correlation between total rainfall and relative soil wetting for the 40 70 cm layer fig 7 a and b a threshold value for rainfall to promote soil wetting seems to occur which might be associated to the wetting front dynamics from soil surface as the soil moistening at the experimental site is predominantly vertical although determination coefficients are high for the linear regression models significant differences are not verified among datasets the distinct behavior for soil moistening in the upper and lower soil layer might be associated to the soil hydraulic conductivity which is then the main percolation control for wetting deeper soil layers hence the deeper layer 40 70 cm presents a lower connection with the soil surface particularly due to the soil clay content for instance wang et al 2016 highlight that the clay fraction distribution along the soil profile is correlated to the soil moisture profile controlling the wetting front to the deeper layers 3 3 soil water effectiveness the frequency distribution of soil water effectiveness is shown in fig 8 there was a marked predominance of high soil water effectiveness higher than 40 in both layers extremely effective level levels 4 and 5 occurred at a percentage of about 20 each and intermediate levels 2 and 3 at a percentage of only 10 respectively this shows that the soil wetting drying cycles were relatively short which was conditioned by the soil hydraulic conductivity soil water effectiveness was adopted by chen et al 2007 to evaluate vegetation restoration potential in the loess plateau china and by montenegro and ragab 2010 to characterize soil moisture dynamics in a brazilian semiarid catchment and its impact on actual evapotranspiration and water balance porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2002 used the soil water effectiveness to investigate the effects of soil moisture deficit on plant conditions predominance of levels 4 and 5 remarkable contributes to vegetation cover development as verified in noronha archipelago during the raining season see also fig 1 the coupling between soil water effectiveness and vegetation cover as stated by seneviratne et al 2010 was also verified by saona et al 2010 for an archipelago at the baltic sea based on the soil moisture time series for the 10 40 cm layer it can be noticed that an increase on soil water effectiveness according to table 2 occurred in 18 2 out of the total advanced rainfall pattern events a level 1 of soil water effectiveness at the end of the rainfall event was found in 91 of the total events corresponding to the best soil moisture effectiveness for plants for the intermediate rainfall pattern however increase in soil moisture effectiveness occurred in 36 8 of the events with maximum soil water effectiveness end of rain in all cases for the delayed rainfall pattern transition level occurred for 20 of the events for the 40 70 cm layer increase in effectiveness of soil moisture to plants occurred in 6 21 and 20 of rainfall events with advanced intermediate and delayed patterns respectively at the end of the rainfall events with advanced pattern in 72 7 of the events the soil water effectiveness level to plants was equal to 1 while for the intermediate rainfall pattern this percentage increased up to 84 2 reaching 100 for the delayed rainfall pattern 3 4 soil moisture modeling and infiltration depths in order to examine further the infiltration process resulting from rainfall profiles parameter values for the soil water retention curves hydraulic conductivity and the green ampt equation provided by montenegro et al 2009 were adopted for soil moisture modeling for the saturated residual soil moisture values were updated by visual inspection of the experimental series and initially adopted as equal to 0 50 0 13 the wetting front soil suction head was 407 9 mm and saturated hydraulic conductivity was assumed to be as equal to half of the value obtained by montenegro et al 2009 to account for air entrapment as suggested by whisler and bouwer 1970 and largely used brocca et al 2008 s formulationa successfully predicted soil moisture for the observed wet periods a canopy interception capacity value was set to 2 mm three contrasting periods in terms of total rainfall were selected for simulation one for each monitored year for part of the 2009 wet period from april 23th to june 30th period 1 ns value was 0 63 and determination coefficient of 0 70 adopting a saturated water content equal to 0 50 for 2010 from april 23th to june 30th period 2 however such value was slightly reduced to 0 48 producing a ns r2 value of 0 76 0 86 the model was then validated for january 20th to april 18th 2011 period 3 keeping the same parameters values with ns r2 equal to 0 81 0 81 observed and simulated time series are shown in fig 9 together with rainfall and infiltration depths time series total rainfall varied from 828 7 mm period 1 to 219 10 mm period 3 being equal to 220 19 mm for period 2 total simulated infiltration depths were 365 1 mm 219 1 mm and 220 2 mm for periods 1 to 3 respectively hence while 68 of the total rainfall have infiltrated for period 3 only 44 of the total rainfall was converted into infiltration in period 1 highlighting the complexity of the infiltration process in noronha and on the other hand the relevance of adopting high resolution temporal scale for rainfall monitoring in order to allow an appropriate prediction of soil wetting dynamics fig 10 relates rainfall and the associated natural infiltration depths for the three simulation periods although high dispersion is observed for individual events a general trend could be considered when rainfall is grouped and the mean infiltration depth estimated with an approximated exponential pattern being verified for the mean values at the box plots when natural events are considered and rainfall hydrological patterns analyzed differences for infiltration depths could not be detected among the three rainfall profiles indeed fig 10b presents the box plots for the infiltration ratios equal to infiltration depth divided by total rainfall for different classes of total rainfall although a general decay can be verified as expected differences for infiltration ratios among rainfall patterns are not observed during the raining season for scenarios of wetted soil as previously discussed the mean infiltration ratio is 0 65 0 16 for a total of 70 rainfall events for rainfall events lower than 20 mm a ratio value of 0 70 0 12 is obtained while for total rainfall 20 mm on average 56 18 infiltrates into the soil it can be verified that infiltration depths at the experimental plot are high being associated to soil characteristics complex rainfall events and vegetation cover the latter providing a biotic feedback enhancing soil moistening 4 conclusions this study produces information about erosive rainfall characteristics and temporal structure in the fernando de noronha archipelago the analysis investigates the influence of different rainfall patterns on infiltration depths the soil moisture dynamics and soil water effectiveness to sustain vegetation focusing on high temporal resolution data from an experimental plot with native species cover in the main watershed of the archipelago and during a time period representative of climate seasonal dynamics given the remarkably relevance of soil moisture to sustain archipelagós biodiversity the main outcomes are 1 rainfall events that occur in the archipelago have high erosive potential frequently exhibiting a complex temporal structure with multi peak bursts within an event and also intermittency 2 the most frequent rainfall pattern is the advanced which contributes to high infiltration depths and thus pronounced soil wetting particularly for the near surface soil layer and for low antecedent soil moisture condition 3 high moisture indexes are verified during the rainy season with percentages higher than 40 extremely effective level for the investigated depths and thus important for plant water uptake and development 4 green ampt formulation coupled to routines for percolation and evapotranspiration components successfully simulated observed soil moisture data based on hourly rainfall information and validated parameters previously obtained from field and laboratory measurements such model constitutes an important tool for estimating infiltration depths and simulating impacts of different land use and future climate scenarios on water resources availability for noronha archipelago 5 high simulated infiltration depths occur during the rainy season fully replenishing soil water levels 6 despite the short experimental period of three years proper analysis was performed on hydrological key variables for the noronha archipelago from high resolution

7172,marginal likelihood or bayesian evidence estimation is the basis for model evaluation and model selection which is the key research content of the uncertainty quantification of groundwater model structure recently the nested sampling estimator nse has been widely used as an efficient method to estimate the marginal likelihood the metropolis hasting m h algorithm is usually used to explore the model likelihood space for nse however m h is inefficient in searching complex likelihood functions especially for the multimodal distribution functions because of the sampling structure of m h algorithm the multi try differential evolution adaptive metropolis mt dreamzs algorithm is effective and robust in searching complex probability space and it is incorporated into nse to improve the performance of marginal likelihood estimation in this study in addition the developed mt dreamzs based nse nse mt is evaluated by comparing with several other marginal likelihood estimators including dreamzs based and m h based nses nse dr nse mh gaussian mixture importance game sampling and a new nested sampling algorithm polychord based on three analytical functions up to 100 dimensions and one groundwater solute transport case studies the results showed that nse mt outperforms nse mh in the convergence efficiency and accuracy of marginal estimation and nse mt is slightly more efficient and accurate than nse dr the accuracy of nse mh nse dr and nse mt deteriorates with increasing dimensionality of target distributions model parameters in addition game sampling and polychord sampling outperform other three nses in the accuracy and stability of estimation for high dimensional up to 100 variate distributions and polychord is slightly less accurate and stable than game compared with game and polychord nse mt and nse dr are competent for less than 10 dimensional distributions with higher computational efficiency keywords nested sampling marginal likelihood groundwater model likelihood function bayesian 1 introduction with the increasing population and pollution pressure on groundwater environment groundwater modeling has been widely used in groundwater exploitation and planning groundwater pollution prevention and remediation the uncertainty in groundwater flow and contaminant transport model affects the reliability of simulation results thus the uncertainty quantification of groundwater modeling is indispensable for effective decision making in groundwater resources management keating et al 2010 matott et al 2009 refsgaard et al 2012 refsgaard et al 2006 rojas et al 2008 groundwater environments are commonly open and complex rendering them open to multiple interpretations and conceptualizations poeter and anderson 2005 refsgaard et al 2012 ye et al 2008 when a set of plausible conceptual models are proposed to emulate flow and solute transport processes it is essential to evaluate different models and select proper ones in recent years multiple model analysis mma which takes advantage of multiple alternative models and predictions has been widely used in uncertainty quantification of groundwater modeling e g groundwater model selection poeter and anderson 2005 schoniger et al 2014 ye et al 2008 and groundwater model averaging lu et al 2015 neuman 2003 ye et al 2004 in the framework of mma different models are weighted according to their performance on fitting observations the model with higher weight indicates that this model is superior to others and has a higher probability to be the true groundwater model based on bayesian inference marginal likelihood also called bayesian evidence is used to evaluate the performance of alternative models as well as to calculate model weights for an alternative model mk with observation data d and parameter θ θ 1 θ 2 θ d the marginal likelihood of model mk can be defined as 1 p d m k p d θ m k p θ m k d θ where p d mk is the marginal likelihood of mk p d θ mk is the joint likelihood function of parameter θ p θ mk is the prior distribution of parameter θ under mk the marginal likelihood p d mk could be calculated accurately when the analytical expression of equation 1 is available however analytical solutions of p d mk are only available under strongly limited situations e g linear models with gaussian prior distribution liu et al 2016 schoniger et al 2014 when the likelihood function p d θ mk is complex and nonlinear or model parameter θ is a high dimensional vector it is hard to obtain analytical expressions of p d mk laplace approximation methods such as laplace maximum likelihood laplace ml and laplace maximum a posterior laplace map can be used to obtain semi analytical expressions of p d mk by taylor series expansion friel and wyse 2012 laplace approximation methods are firstly applied to estimate marginal likelihoods of groundwater models because of easy computation and low computational cost neuman 2003 ye et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 however these methods are vulnerable to truncation errors and heavily biased for nonlinear models schoniger et al 2014 this bias usually results from i an inadequate estimate of the maximum likelihood solution or maximum a posteriori density solution and ii incorrect assumption of multivariate normality of the target distribution volpi et al 2017 besides laplace approximation methods monte carlo mc methods are recently widely applied to estimate marginal likelihood these mc methods contain arithmetic mean estimator ame kass and raftery 1995 harmonic mean estimator hme friel and wyse 2012 newton and raftery 1994 thermodynamic integration estimator tie lartillot and philippe 2006 liu et al 2016 nested sampling estimator nse elsheikh et al 2013 skilling 2004 skilling 2006 etc ame usually needs a large number of random samples θ from the prior distribution p θ mk this method is conceptually straightforward and the estimation is theoretically accurate and stable so the estimation of ame can be used as reference value liu et al 2016 however ame suffers from heavy computation burden because samples from prior distribution with lower likelihood contribute little to the estimation volpi et al 2017 hme estimates marginal likelihood by the harmonic mean of posterior likelihood p d θ mk through markov chain monte carlo mcmc while hme is computationally more efficient than ame but it usually overestimates the marginal likelihood and suffers from instability compared with ame and hme tie and nse use more sophisticated strategies to estimate marginal likelihood p d mk based on path integration theory tie uses a series of mcmc to search likelihood space and generate samples for marginal likelihood estimation tie is superior in accuracy and stability but has low computational efficiency nse was first proposed by skilling 2004 skilling 2006 which estimates p d mk by translating complex high dimensional integral equation 1 into one dimensional integral 2 p d m k p d θ m k dx t i 1 x i 1 x i l i where dx is the differential of cumulative prior mass x 0 x 1 t is the number of discrete x i after that the one dimensional integral of equation 2 can be calculated by quadrature rule where l is the abbreviation of l θ d mk which equals to the joint likelihood p d θ mk the relationship of l and x is showed in equation 3 3 x λ l p θ m k d θ where λ can be any value of joint likelihood l θ d mk in the prior space the process of nse is illustrated in fig 1 with the increase of λ it means fewer and fewer parameter samples θ in the prior space can meet the constraint l θ d mk λ thus x λ decreases with the increase of λ during t evolutions of parameter samples θ the prior mass x decreases from 1 to 0 1 x 0 x 1 xt 1 xt greater than 0 and the joint likelihood threshold li increases from low to high value l 1 l 2 lt 1 lt the samples of li are obtained through the evolution of active set s in nse for the i th evolution of s the sample with worst likelihood in s is replaced by the new sample θ new with higher likelihood and then the joint likelihood of θ new is used as li 1 the process of generating θ new under the condition l θ new d mk li is called constrained local sampling elsheikh et al 2013 which can be realized by random sampling methods e g metropolis hasting m h algorithm in the process of evaluating xi and li in nse parameter samples θ i are gradually evolved from low probability space to high probability space rather than merely from prior distribution or posterior distribution schoniger et al 2014 liu et al 2016 and zeng et al 2018 evaluated several mc based marginal likelihood estimators and they demonstrated that nse is more computationally efficient in comparison with other estimators over the past decade nse has been successfully used for model evaluation and model selection in many fields such as cosmology mukherjee et al 2006 handley et al 2015 astronomy feroz and hobson 2008 and astrophysics feroz et al 2013 moreover nse has been recently applied for evaluating subsurface flow models elsheikh et al 2013 according to the structure of nse the performance of nse depends on the strength of constrained local sampling especially for high dimensional multimodal problems because it is difficult to generate qualified samples of θ i i e xi and li from complex model parameter space through constrained local sampling therefore in order to improve nse it is straightforward to construct a reliable constrained local sampling by incorporating an effective sampling algorithm schoniger et al 2014 made two modifications to the m h based constrained local sampling one is to use the ratio of prior probabilities instead of the ratio of likelihoods as the acceptance ratio the other is to use a suitable termination criterion e g end the procedure when the estimated marginal likelihood reach to convergence their results demonstrated that nse outperforms the laplace approximation methods through a real world hydrological test case however the estimation of this modified m h based nse is less reliable than other mc methods this is caused by the instability of the constrained local sampling in order to improve the stability and accuracy of nse elsheikh et al 2015 elsheikh et al 2014a elsheikh et al 2014b modified the constrained local sampling by incorporating non intrusive polynomial chaos hybrid monte carlo and multipoint statistics respectively liu et al 2016 made two modifications to the m h based nse developed by schoniger et al 2014 the first one is to use block wise updating to generate new sample the second one is the use of start over strategy to avoid premature termination their results showed this m h based nse is inefficient for the high dimensional and complex likelihood functions zeng et al 2018 developed an efficient nse by integrating dreamzs algorithm however their evaluation to several marginal likelihood estimators is only based on a synthetical groundwater flow model in addition we have noticed that some clustering algorithms are used to improve nse to handle complex multimodal likelihood functions e g multinest feroz et al 2009 and polychord handley et al 2015 mt dreamzs laloy and vrugt 2012 is a new effective and robust mcmc sampling method which integrates differential evolution sampling snooker updating and multiple try sampling etc mt dreamzs is designed to solve high dimensional and multimodal search problems many numerical experiment comparisons laloy and vrugt 2012 e g a 25 dimensional trimodal distribution and a 241 dimensional groundwater model showed that mt dreamzs has excellent performance on searching complex parameter space over other mcmc sampling algorithms e g dreamzs and m h algorithm laloy et al 2012 and linde and vrugt 2013 also shown that mt dreamzs converges nicely on other types of distributions in real world hydrologic cases it can be expected that the constrained local sampling would be competent for searching complex parameter space by integrating mt dreamzs algorithm such as generate a highly constrained sample from narrow region as well as avoid trapped in local optima as a result the performance of nse would be improved by the reliable samples of xi and li and this is the first focus of this study although previous studies have evaluated nse elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 schoniger et al 2014 most of them focused on m h based nse or its variants and based on low dimensional distribution or simple synthetical groundwater flow models it is still not clear the feasibility of the m h based and the mt dreamzs based nses to different type of likelihood functions such as multimodal and high dimensional distribution generally the likelihood function of the groundwater model under complex hydrogeological condition is usually not unimodal or low dimensional especially for reactive solute transport model multiphase flow model etc these models exhibit a remarkable characteristic of multimodal and multivariate likelihood functions moreover it is more challenging to generate reliable xi and li samples for those cases when using nse such as avoiding trapped in local optimum however the performance of different nses under high dimensional distributions e g up to 100 dimension is seldom compared in previous researches recognizing the way of mt dreamzs based nse to overcome the problem of searching complex likelihood space could provide insights into improving nse recently gaussian mixture importance game sampling volpi et al 2017 is developed to estimates marginal likelihood this sampling uses bridge sampling in the posterior samples generated by mcmc game combines the advantage of bridge sampling and mcmc to evaluate complex integral and it has been used for hydrologic model selection brunetti et al 2017 volpi et al 2017 their studies illustrated that the game is accurate and robust under some target distributions e g high dimensional distribution and multimodal distribution in addition polychord handley et al 2015 is a new developed nested sampling algorithm which combines the advantages of slice sampling cluster recognition and evolution as well as parallelization it has been used to search for high dimensional parameter spaces in astronomy field barbosa cendejas et al 2018 in this study the m h based dreamzs based and mt dreamzs based nses nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are evaluated through the marginal likelihood estimations for three complex and high dimensional analytical functions up to 100 dimension and one groundwater solute transport case and this is the second focus of this research the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of constructing nse mh and nse mt in section 3 the five marginal likelihood estimators nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are evaluated for four cases 1 a standard multivariate gaussian distribution with variable dimensionality up to 100 variate 2 a truncated multivariate gaussian distribution with variable dimensionality up to 100 variate 3 a multivariate rosenbrock function up to 100 variate 4 four heterogeneous groundwater solute transport models these marginal likelihood estimators are evaluated in terms of convergence accuracy efficiency and stability finally the summary and discussions of this study are drawn in section 4 2 methodologies this section starts with a brief description of nested sampling estimator nse in section 2 1 then section 2 2 describes the structure of m h algorithm based nse and the integration of nse and mt dreamzs algorithm is introduced in section 2 3 2 1 nested sampling estimator the marginal likelihood estimation by nse is achieved by means of generating the prior mass xi and likelihood function li through the evolution of parameter sample θ i as shown in equation 2 i 1 t is evolution number the expression of xi can be described as skilling 2006 4 x i e i n for notational convenience we use z to denote the marginal likelihood the procedure of nse begins with the evolution number i 1 x 0 1 and z 0 0 l 1 is the lowest likelihood l worst of the active set s which contains n samples generated from the prior distribution with the increase of evolution number i the sample with lowest likelihood in the active set is replaced by a new sample θ new with higher likelihood l θ new d mk l worst and θ new is generated through the constrained local sampling for ease of understanding the evolutions of active set s from i 1 to i t is termed as outer loop the iterations of constrained local sampling to generate θ new is termed as inner loop the procedure of nse can be described as following elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 skilling 2006 step 1 define the prior distribution of parameters the size of the active set n and the number of evolutions t the initial active set s is the assemble of samples generated randomly from the prior distribution s θ 1 θ 2 θ n calculate the joint likelihood for each sample of s step 2 start the outer loop to estimate marginal likelihood p d mk in two substeps step 2 1 for the ith i 1 2 t evolution select the sample θ worst with lowest likelihood l worst in the active set then calculate prior mass xi in equation 4 and zi zi 1 x i x i 1 li z0 0 li l worst step 2 2 replace θ worst in the active set with a new sample θ new generated by constrained local sampling the new sample θ new should satisfy with the restriction l θ new d mk l worst step 3 repeat step 2 until evolution number i reach to t calculate marginal likelihood z using equation 5 5 z z t x t n l θ 1 l θ 2 l θ n where l1 l2 ln is the likelihoods of final active set i t when implementing nse n and t are important parameters because n determines the size of active set and t decides the evolutions of outer loop of nse moreover t is depended on n because more parameter samples in the active set demands for more evolutions to evolve from low likelihood space into higher likelihood space with the increase of n and t the estimation of nse becomes more accurate and stable liu et al 2016 however larger n and t cause a higher computational cost some researches elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 have recommended to use n 25 and t 8 20 n to balance computational cost and accuracy in addition nse can be applied to obtain the posterior distribution of model parameters simultaneously by the discarded samples θ worst from the evolutions of active set 2 2 constrained local sampling via m h algorithm the procedure of constrained local sampling based on improved m h algorithm is described as following elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 schoniger et al 2014 step 1 define the number of iterations in constrained local sampling h h is also the iteration number of one inner loop step 2 for the jth j 1 2 h iteration generate a markov chain by using φ j φ j 1 δ ω and δ is a scaling factor ω is a random vector following gaussian distribution n 0 i the acceptance ratio is calculated as α min 1 p φ j p φ j 1 where p φ j and p φ j 1 are the prior probability of φ j and φ j 1 a random number u is generated from the uniform distribution u 0 1 if u α φ j φ j otherwise φ j φ j 1 step 3 repeat step 2 until j h and θ new φ h h is the length of markov chain generated by constrained local sampling via m h h 100 500 used in some researches elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 skilling 2006 in addition if likelihood ratio is used in step 2 instead of prior probability ratio constrained local sampling tends to accept samples with high likelihoods and the parameter samples would evolve into high likelihood space quickly it would lead to premature termination and inaccurate estimations 2 3 constrained local sampling via mt dreamzs algorithm on basis of dreamzs algorithm mt dreamzs uses multiple try metropolis sampling from an archive of past states to generate candidate points in each individual chain the detailed description of mt dreamzs algorithm is referred to laloy and vrugt 2012 and vrugt et al 2009 besides the regular use of mt dreamzs for posterior exploration three modifications are made to implement mt dreamzs for the inner loop of nse the first modification is that the mt dreamzs run for constrained local sampling does not need to be a complete run in the following two meanings on the one hand the total length of markov chains used in mt dreamzs is usually 100 1000 which is much smaller than conventional use i e usually thousands of samples because short markov chains are enough for finding parameter samples θ new that satisfy the restriction l θ new d mk l worst on the other hand the mt dreamzs algorithm can usually be divided into burn in period which generates enough length of markov chains to reach convergence and after burn in period which generates posterior parameter samples to reduce the computation cost the burn in period is executed before implementing nse and only the after burn in period is used to generate θ new for constrained local sampling it can ensure the convergence of markov chains and reduce unnecessary computation cost the second feature in the use of mt dreamzs for nse is that the markov chain is not start from active set s but from the sample matrix s randomly the sample matrix s has stored parameter samples generated from after burn in period of mt dreamzs the start point of inner loop influences the sampling trace of constrained local sampling if the start point is sampled from the evolved s for each inner loop of nse the generated parameter samples θ new by constrained local sampling might skip over the low likelihood region quickly starting from the samples of s would diversify the sampling traces of the constrained local sampling of nse the third feature in the use of mt dreamzs for nse is that the acceptance ratio of mt dreamzs as shown in eq 8 is replaced by the prior probability ratio when the inner loop of nse is the first time run to generate θ new for the i th outer loop when the first run of inner loop could not generate θ new meeting l θ new d mk l worst the eq 8 is used for the i th outer loop this is because the standard mt dreamzs is an efficient sampling method that samples of s would skip over low likelihood area and evolve to high likelihood space quickly this modification is similar to the modification of m h algorithm above the procedure of constrained local sampling based on modified mt dreamzs algorithm is described as following laloy and vrugt 2012 step 1 run a complete mt dreamzs to obtain the archive matrix z and sample matrix s where z contains parameter samples generated from the whole period and s contains samples generated from the after burn in period step 2 define the number of markov chains nchain the number of multi try samples k and the length of each markov chain h choose a sample θ from sample matrix s randomly as the start point of each markov chain φ 0 n n 1 nchain step 3 start an inner loop to generate a parameter sample θ new under the restriction l θ new d mk l worst in three substeps step 3 1 for the jth j 1 2 h iteration use eq 6 to generate k proposal samples ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ k for each markov chain 6 ξ k l φ j 1 l i d e d γ δ d j 1 δ z r 1 j n 1 δ z r 2 n ε d where δ means the number of samples in archive matrix z used to generate proposal samples z r 1 j and z r 2 n are parameter samples in z id is an identity matrix ed and εd are random numbers after that replace each element of ξ k l for the k proposal samples of each markov chain with crossover probability then calculate the joint likelihood of k new samples l ξ k l step 3 2 for each markov chain choose one sample ξ l with joint likelihood l ξ l from k new samples randomly then generate k 1 proposal samples ξ k l around ξ l using equation 7 7 ξ k l ξ l i d e d γ δ d j 1 δ z r 1 j n 1 δ z r 2 n ε d step 3 3 calculate the prior probability of k 1 new samples l ξ k 1 and the acceptance ratio is calculated by equation 8 8 α min 1 l ξ 1 l l ξ k l l ξ 1 l l ξ k 1 l l φ j 1 l a random number u is generated from uniform distribution u 0 1 if u α φ j l ξ l otherwise φ j l φ j 1 l step 4 repeat step 3 until the iteration number of markov chain j reaches to h and θ new φ h in order to maximize the efficiency of markov chain some parameters of mt dreamzs algorithm need to be specified carefully before integrated into nse which can refer to laloy and vrugt 2012 according to step 3 1 step 3 3 2k 1 samples are generated to obtain a new parameter sample φ at each iteration of each markov chain a larger k can lead to a better exploration of the likelihood space but demanding for more computational cost although parallel computing can alleviate this cost especially if k 1 the mt dreamzs based nse is equal to the dreamzs based nse more details about dreamzs based nse can refer to zeng et al 2018 to balance the computational cost and sampling capability we use k 2 in this study 3 marginal likelihood estimations for analytical and groundwater models the five marginal likelihood estimators nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are evaluated through 1 a standard multivariate gaussian distribution with variable dimensionality up to 100 variate and correlated dimensions 2 a truncated multivariate gaussian distribution with variable dimensionality up to 100 variate 3 a multivariate rosenbrock function up to 100 variate 4 four heterogeneous groundwater solute transport models by considering the model structure uncertainty of a laboratory column experiment lv et al 2016 which have multimodal likelihood functions in addition game sampling is implemented by means of the game package of matlab toolbox of vrugt 2016 polychord sampling is implemented by the open source packages of handley et al 2015 this study evaluated nse mt nse dr nse mh game and polychord in terms of convergence accuracy and stability convergence is evaluated by detecting the number of samples needed for accurately estimating the marginal likelihood accuracy is evaluated by comparing the estimates with the reference value ame converges to the theoretical value of estimate when the number of samples is large enough hence the estimation of ame is regarded as reference value in the real word cases liu et al 2016 stability is evaluated by examining the variability of repeated estimations of marginal likelihood 3 1 multivariate normal distribution with variable correlated dimensionality to test the performance of the five marginal likelihood estimators to distribution dimensionality followed with volpi et al 2017 the gaussian distributions with 5 to 100 dimensional multivariate and centered at the zero vector is used as the analytical cases the covariance matrix was set such that the variance of the j th variable was equal to j and all pairwise correlations were 0 5 the equation of the d variate normal distribution is defined as equation 9 9 f θ 0 σ 1 2 π d 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 θ t σ 1 θ there is no doubt that the reference value of marginal likelihood is equal to 1 table 1 summarizes the parameters used in nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord the parameters used in game and polychord are the recommended values by volpi et al 2017 and handley et al 2015 respectively the number of samples used in importance sampling m 0 in game is 1000 in this study the number of active set of polychord i e live points in polychord is n live 25 d the length of slice sampling chain of polychord is n repeats 3 d for each marginal likelihood estimator fifty repeated runs are conducted to verify the stability of estimations table 2 shows the average of fifty repeated estimations and the relative errors for different dimensionalities for the low dimensional d 5 10 distributions game and polychord outperform other three estimators in the accuracy because they have smaller average absolute value of relative errors aare moreover nse mt is more accurate than nse mh and nse dr nse mh is inaccurate for 10 dimensional distribution because of the large relative errors with the increase of dimension d 20 50 the estimations of nse dr and nse mt deviate from the reference value gradually nse mh cannot acquire the accurate estimation for more than 10 dimensional normal distribution nse dr and nse mt both underestimate the marginal likelihood for more than 20 dimensional distributions it illustrates that nse dr and nse mt are vulnerable to high dimensions nse dr and nse mt are not suitable for more than 10 dimensional distribution by contrast game and polychord are more accurate for medium dimensional distributions d 20 50 for the high dimensional d 75 100 distributions the superiority of game and polychord in accuracy is even more pronounced to other three estimators e g the aare of nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are 100 98 71 94 99 10 28 and 18 28 respectively thus with the increase of dimensionality the accuracy of game and polychord decrease slower than other three estimators nse dr and nse mt are only competent for less than 10 dimensional distributions in order to evaluate the convergence of these marginal likelihood estimators the best estimation which is closest to the reference value is examined fig 2 shows the convergence traces of nse mh nse dr and nse mt for 5 10 20 50 75 and 100 dimensional distributions denoted as 6 benchmark distributions hereafter for these five estimators the required sample numbers to reach convergence for these 6 benchmark distributions are 30 000 150 000 200 000 2 000 000 6 000 000 and 18 000 000 for nse mh 15 000 52 000 80 000 600 000 800 000 and 1 200 000 for nse dr 12 000 47 000 70 000 500 000 700 000 and 1 000 000 for nse mt 31 000 41 000 161 000 601 000 1 201 000 and 2 001 000 for game 95 000 840 000 1 600 000 80 000 000 100 000 000 and 120 000 000 for polychord therefore nse mt is significantly more efficient than nse mh and slightly more efficient than nse dr and game for multidimensional distribution moreover polychord seems the most inefficient estimator because it demands 10 100 times sample size than other estimators fig 3 plots the statistical boxplots of the repeated estimations of the five estimators based on the fifty repeated marginal likelihood estimations for 5 to 100 dimensional distributions it is easy to find that game has significantly higher stability than other estimators and polychord is slightly more stable than other three nses and nse mh has higher variability than nse dr and nse mt the repeated estimations of nse dr and nse mt have similar average values and the variability of nse mt is slightly smaller than that of nse dr thus nse mt is more stable than nse dr but the difference is very small 3 2 multivariate gaussian distribution with truncated dimensions considering the real world conditions the parameters estimated are usually with prior distributions which are often bounded in narrow space the second case study aimed to test the performance of these marginal likelihood estimators in the bounded parameter spaces so we truncated each dimension with a box car prior so that the reference value of marginal likelihood is reduced from 1 to 0 75 other conditions are the same as the first case the parameters used in five estimators are also the same as used in section 3 1 for each estimator fifty repeated implementations are conducted to verify the stability of results as shown in fig 5 the average of these repeated marginal likelihood estimations and the relative errors re are calculated as shown in table 3 for the low dimensional d 5 10 distribution game and polychord outperform other three estimators in the accuracy e g for d 10 the average absolute value of relative errors aare of marginal likelihood estimations for the five estimators are 60 17 11 85 6 75 5 28 and 4 27 respectively nse mt is more accurate than nse mh and nse dr and nse mh cannot acquire the accurate estimation for 10 dimensional normal distribution as for the medium dimensional d 20 50 the estimations of nse mh nse dr and nse mt deviate from the reference value gradually however game and polychord are still more accurate than other three estimators when it comes to high dimensional d 75 100 distributions only game and polychord can get accurate estimations e g for d 100 the aare of nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are 100 100 100 9 53 and 12 21 respectively thus nse dr and nse mt are only suitable for less than 10 dimensional truncated distributions moreover game and polychord have the consistent estimation accuracy to truncated and untruncated distributions the estimation which is closest to the reference value is chosen to examine the convergence for nse mh nse dr and nse mt as shown by fig 4 for these five estimators the required sample numbers to reach convergence for these 6 benchmark distributions are 28 000 120 000 170 000 1 900 000 5 000 000 and 17 000 000 for nse mh 11 000 30 000 70 000 560 000 740 000 and 1 800 000 for nse dr 10 000 25 000 60 000 500 000 700 000 and 1 000 000 for nse mt 31 000 41 000 161 000 601 000 1 201 000 and 2 001 000 for game 83 000 660 000 1 300 000 70 000 000 90 000 000 and 100 000 000 for polychord therefore similar with the results of multidimensional normal distributions section 3 1 nse mt is significantly more efficient than nse mh and slightly more efficient than nse dr and game for multidimensional truncated distributions moreover polychord seems the most inefficient estimator among these five estimators in addition compared with untruncated distribution the convergence rates of three nses and polychord for truncated distributions are higher than that for untruncated distributions this is because the constrained local sampling is easier to search samples satisfying the restriction l θ new d mk l worst under the bounded parameter space i e it is difficult to search the narrow and low probability density areas of the untruncated distributions fig 5 shows the statistical boxplots of the repeated estimations of these five marginal likelihood estimators it illustrates the same conclusion of stability as shown in section 3 1 3 3 multivariate rosenbrock function in this section the five marginal likelihood estimators are evaluated through estimating the multivariate rosenbrock function also called banana shaped function the relationship of each dimension of banana shaped function is tightly correlated and it can testify the performances of the five estimators to complex distributions the banana shaped function is defined by 10 f θ f ϕ θ 0 σ where ϕ θ θ1 θ2 bθ1 2 100b θ3 θd and σ i d the d d identify matrix except for σ 1 1 100 we use the value of b 0 1 to generate a banana shaped distribution the parameters used in the five estimators are also the same as used in section 3 1 for each estimator fifty repeated runs are conducted to verify the stability of estimations table 4 shows the average of fifty repeated estimations and the relative errors for different dimensionalities for the low dimensional d 5 10 distribution each estimator can obtain accurate estimation of marginal likelihood except nse mh e g for d 10 the average absolute value of relative errors aare of marginal likelihood estimations for the five estimators are 64 13 8 75 4 36 0 12 and 0 83 respectively with the increase of dimension d 20 50 the estimations of these estimators have the similar performance as showed in the case study of multivariate gaussian distribution nse mh cannot acquire the accurate estimation for more than 10 dimensional normal distribution nse dr and nse mt both underestimate the marginal likelihood for more than 20 dimensional distributions by contrast game and polychord are more accurate for medium dimensional distributions d 20 50 for the high dimensional d 75 100 distributions only game and polychord sampling can get accurate estimations with low relative error 7 97 and 14 41 respectively fig 6 shows convergences of estimations of nse mh nse dr and nse mt for 5 10 20 50 75 and 100 dimensional distributions as was the case in sections 3 1 and 3 2 nse mt is the most efficient estimator compared with above two case studies the convergence rates of these five estimators for multivariate rosenbrock function are slightly lower than that for multivariate normal distributions and untruncated distributions this is because the parameter space of rosenbrock function is more complex than normal distributions moreover the stability of estimators to rosenbrock function as shown in fig 7 is slightly lower than that to multivariate gaussian distributions in sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 4 heterogeneous solute transport model fig 8 shows a groundwater transport experiment in an acrylic column equipped by lv et al 2016 this column is 2 6 cm in inner diameter 20 cm in length and it is divided into two regions filled with two sands with different grain sizes the basic hydraulic properties of two sands are summarized in table 5 a pump was used to supply flow at a constant rate of 1 ml min 1 through the column in an up flow mode a tracer experiment of kno3 was conducted through this equipment and the kno3 concentrations of outflow were observed at 1 5 9 281 min 71 observations respectively considering model structure uncertainty as shown in fig 9 four plausible models m 1 m 2 m 3 and m 4 are proposed to represent the unknown groundwater system e g the model layer structure these four models vary in the distributions of two sand zones in column and have the same boundary conditions as the real model the groundwater flow and solute transport numerical models are built by using modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 respectively in order to evaluate the performances of these models on reproducing observations i e kno3 concentrations nse mh nse dr nse mt and game are used to estimate their marginal likelihoods and polychord is not implemented in this case study due to the infeasible computation burden suppose that four hydrogeological parameters k 1 k 2 α 1 and α 2 unknown of each model m 1 m 4 other parameters are set to true values in this study the prior distributions of four unknown parameters k 1 k 2 α 1 and α 2 are defined as uniform distributions the distribution ranges are given in table 6 the joint likelihood function l θ d mk is defined by gaussian function as equation 10 hamilton 1994 where c is a covariance matrix usually an identity matrix i d observations μ represents the measured concentrations of kno3 y represent the simulation value and n is the number of observations μ and y n 71 in this case 10 l θ d m k 1 2 π n 2 c 1 2 exp 1 2 y μ t c 1 y μ in this case study the parameters used in nse mh nse dr nse mt and game are same as that used in the 5 dimensional distribution in sections 3 1 the average marginal likelihoods of twenty repeated estimations by these estimators are listed in table 7 the estimation of ame is taken as the reference value liu et al 2016 the results show that the averaged estimations of three nses and game are all close to the reference values furthermore the average absolute values of relative errors of marginal likelihood estimations are 3 74 9 05 5 98 and 2 22 for nse mt nse mh nse dr and game respectively the order of accuracy of the four methods is game nse mt nse dr nse mh thus game outperforms other three estimators in the accuracy of model evidence estimation and nse mt is more accurate than nse mh and nse dr fig 10 exhibits the convergence of these estimators for the marginal likelihood estimations of models m 1 m 4 for three nses the estimation closest to reference value is chosen for convergence test it is easy to find that the estimations of ame demand about one million model executions to reach to convergence for these groundwater models except for the estimation of m 2 needs about 1 700 000 model executions to obtain convergence for the estimations of nse mh it demands about 50 000 80 000 model executions to reach to convergence for nse dr it demands about 30 000 40 000 model executions to reach the convergence as for nse mt the estimated marginal likelihoods converge to stable values within 26 000 30 000 model executions which is slightly smaller than the cost of game 31 000 model executions it demonstrates that nse mt is more computationally efficient than nse mh and slightly more efficient than nse dr and game fig 11 plots the statistical boxplots of the twenty repeated estimations of three nses and game it also shows game outperforms other three estimators in the stability of model evidence estimation and the estimations of nse mt has slightly smaller variation than that of nse mh and similar variation to nse dr this is because the model dimension is small d 4 the difference among the search ability of mt dreamzs and dreamzs is not significant thus nse mt and nse dr are more stable than nse mh and the improvement is not significant in order to investigate the difference between nse mh and nse mt fig 12 shows the searching processes of nse mh and nse mt in the likelihood spaces of m 1 m 4 for easy visualization the two dimensional projection k 1 and k 2 of parameter samples is used to exhibit the searching process from low likelihood region to high likelihood region the background is likelihood function distribution each point in fig 12 denotes a discarded parameter samples θ i from the i th evolution of active set step 2 2 in section 2 1 each plot in fig 12 has 200 points fig 12 a c e g shows the evolution process of nse mh the parameter samples of nse mh always concentrated at the high likelihood region and the low likelihood region is seldom explored fig 12 b d f h represents the evolution process of nse mt and the whole likelihood space is sufficiently explored this is because mt dreamzs is more reliable to explore high dimensional multimodal space and estimations of nse mt have higher accuracy than that of nse mh according to the estimated marginal likelihoods of models m 1 m 4 table 6 the model performances are ranked in ascending order m 2 m 3 m 4 m 1 it demonstrates model m 1 outperforms other alternative models because these models are assessed under same parameter uncertainty prior parameter distributions the model marginal likelihood represents the confidence of this model structure as a result model m 1 with the largest marginal likelihood is the best one among all plausible models 3 5 discussion based on the results mentioned above we can draw following conclusions 1 nse mt and nse dr are adequate for estimating marginal likelihood for less than 10 dimensional distributions 2 nse mt outperforms nse mh and nse dr in convergence accuracy and efficiency for marginal likelihood estimation but the improvement in stability is not significant nse mt needs about a half of computation cost required by nse mh to obtain convergence 3 for low dimensional distribution d 5 or 10 the difference between nse mt and nse dr is very small 4 nse mh nse dr and nse mt are vulnerable to the increasement of model parameter distribution dimensionality and they are inadequate for more than 10 dimensional distributions 5 game and polychord are more accurate and stable than nse mh nse dr and nse mt especially for more than 10 dimensional distributions 6 nse mt is slightly more efficient than game and significantly more efficient than polychord in this section we will discuss the reasons and possible solutions for improving the stability of nse fig 13 shows the curves of likelihood function l xi cumulative prior mass xi generated by the outer loop of nse the samples of l xi xi are then used to compute marginal likelihood by equation 2 at the early stage of outer loop 0 3 xi 1 the generated likelihood function l xi at same xi varies significantly for different implementations of nse after that the generated l xi varies slightly and tends to be a stable value at the later stage of outer loop 0 xi 0 3 fig 13 also shows that the l xi xi curves of nse mt have a small variability than that of nse mh and so the integral areas under the curves of l xi xi i e the marginal likelihood of nse mt have better stability than that of nse mh this is because mt dreamzs algorithm has more stable searching process for multidimensional multimodal likelihood space than m h according to eq 2 the estimation of marginal likelihood is composed of the product of li and δxi l xi δx i the interval of x δxi xi 1 xi decreases with the increase of evolution number i but l x i increases gradually with the increase of evolution number i in order to examine the contribution of l xi δx i to marginal likelihood estimation at each evolution of outer loop from i 1 to i t the l xi δx i i 1 t of nse mt and nse mh is calculated for the four groundwater models as shown by fig 14 it is easy to find that li δx i is very small at the primary stage of outer loop e g i 50 and gradually reach to its maximum at the middle stage e g 75 i 1 0 0 and then decreases to a very small value at the later stage e g i greater than 175 it illustrates that the searching of intermediate likelihood space has great influence on marginal likelihood estimation thus generating stable samples of l xi at the middle stage of outer loop is crucial to the stability of nse two strategies are potential beneficial to improve the stability of nse the first strategy is to tune the parameters of n and t n decides the distribution of xi i e the size of δx i through equation 4 t controls the length of outer loop i e the number of li δx i therefore t and n have significant influence on the stability of nse elsheikh et al 2013 and liu et al 2016 analyzed the effects of n on marginal likelihood estimation their results showed that the estimation is more accurate and consistent when using larger n it is because more samples in the active set allow a better chance to explore the parameter space however the larger n demands more model executions to obtain convergence and it needs to balance the efficiency and stability of nse the second strategy is to incorporate more elaborate sampling algorithm into the constrained local sampling of nse this is because the unstable samples of li from constrained local sampling will lead to the unstable estimations of nse the sampling algorithm having a stable path to search likelihood space from low likelihood region to high likelihood region would be the ideal one for nse in addition zhang et al 2017 have proposed a kalman filter based dreamzs algorithm dream zks which is more stable and efficient in exploring the posterior distribution for high dimensional models in future study the dream zks algorithm can be used to construct the constrained local sampling and to improve the stability of nse by incorporating slice sampling cluster recognition and evolution polychord has apparently higher estimation accuracy than other three nses nse mh nse dr and nse mt especially for high dimensional distributions and slightly more stable than other three nses however polychord requires significantly more computation cost to reach convergence than other three nses which hinders the application of this method in practice the required number of samples is proportion to d 3 for disparate dimensionality handley et al 2015 parallelization has been incorporated to improve the efficiency of marginal likelihood estimation the run time of polychord is significantly reduced when the module of parallelization is enabled especially for high dimensional distributions incorporating the advantages of nse mt and polychord would be the feasible way to improve nse 4 summary and conclusions the nested sampling estimator nse is recently used to estimate marginal likelihood for groundwater model selection and assessment both the prior and posterior likelihood spaces are searched through the evolution of active set used in nse in this study the mt dreamzs algorithm is incorporated into the constrained local sampling of nse to improve the performance of marginal likelihood estimation the five marginal likelihood estimators including mt dreamzs based m h based and dreamzs based nses nse mt nse mh and nse dr game and polychord are evaluated in terms of convergence accuracy efficiency and stability through four case studies the key findings of this study can be summarized as following 1 in comparison with nse mh the convergence rate and computational efficiency of nse are improved significantly by incorporating mt dreamzs algorithm the estimation accuracy is also improved apparently especially for less 10 dimensional distributions however the improvement in stability is small 2 nse mt outperforms nse dr slightly in convergence rate computational efficiency accuracy and stability of marginal likelihood estimation 3 game outperforms nse mt nse dr and nse mt in the accuracy and stability of estimation especially for the more than 10 dimensional distributions in addition nse mt is slightly more efficient than game for multidimensional distributions thus nse mt is feasible as the model parameter dimensionality is less than 10 and this is meaningful for realistic groundwater cases 4 polychord outperforms other three nses at accuracy and stability especially for high dimensional distributions d 10 and it is slightly less accurate and stable than game moreover polychord is significantly less efficient than other estimators the accuracy of nse mh nse dr and nse mt all deteriorates fast with the increase of dimensionality especially for nse mh by contrast game and polychord are more reliable with the increase of dimensionality the five marginal likelihood estimators used in this paper all take advantage of mcmc technique to search parameter space because of the sampling nature mcmc methods always need a large number of iterations and suffers from heavy computation expense using more efficient searching strategies e g fuzzy bayesian learning pan and bester 2017 or diffusive nested sampling trevisani and gelfand 2003 or surrogate techniques zeng et al

7172,marginal likelihood or bayesian evidence estimation is the basis for model evaluation and model selection which is the key research content of the uncertainty quantification of groundwater model structure recently the nested sampling estimator nse has been widely used as an efficient method to estimate the marginal likelihood the metropolis hasting m h algorithm is usually used to explore the model likelihood space for nse however m h is inefficient in searching complex likelihood functions especially for the multimodal distribution functions because of the sampling structure of m h algorithm the multi try differential evolution adaptive metropolis mt dreamzs algorithm is effective and robust in searching complex probability space and it is incorporated into nse to improve the performance of marginal likelihood estimation in this study in addition the developed mt dreamzs based nse nse mt is evaluated by comparing with several other marginal likelihood estimators including dreamzs based and m h based nses nse dr nse mh gaussian mixture importance game sampling and a new nested sampling algorithm polychord based on three analytical functions up to 100 dimensions and one groundwater solute transport case studies the results showed that nse mt outperforms nse mh in the convergence efficiency and accuracy of marginal estimation and nse mt is slightly more efficient and accurate than nse dr the accuracy of nse mh nse dr and nse mt deteriorates with increasing dimensionality of target distributions model parameters in addition game sampling and polychord sampling outperform other three nses in the accuracy and stability of estimation for high dimensional up to 100 variate distributions and polychord is slightly less accurate and stable than game compared with game and polychord nse mt and nse dr are competent for less than 10 dimensional distributions with higher computational efficiency keywords nested sampling marginal likelihood groundwater model likelihood function bayesian 1 introduction with the increasing population and pollution pressure on groundwater environment groundwater modeling has been widely used in groundwater exploitation and planning groundwater pollution prevention and remediation the uncertainty in groundwater flow and contaminant transport model affects the reliability of simulation results thus the uncertainty quantification of groundwater modeling is indispensable for effective decision making in groundwater resources management keating et al 2010 matott et al 2009 refsgaard et al 2012 refsgaard et al 2006 rojas et al 2008 groundwater environments are commonly open and complex rendering them open to multiple interpretations and conceptualizations poeter and anderson 2005 refsgaard et al 2012 ye et al 2008 when a set of plausible conceptual models are proposed to emulate flow and solute transport processes it is essential to evaluate different models and select proper ones in recent years multiple model analysis mma which takes advantage of multiple alternative models and predictions has been widely used in uncertainty quantification of groundwater modeling e g groundwater model selection poeter and anderson 2005 schoniger et al 2014 ye et al 2008 and groundwater model averaging lu et al 2015 neuman 2003 ye et al 2004 in the framework of mma different models are weighted according to their performance on fitting observations the model with higher weight indicates that this model is superior to others and has a higher probability to be the true groundwater model based on bayesian inference marginal likelihood also called bayesian evidence is used to evaluate the performance of alternative models as well as to calculate model weights for an alternative model mk with observation data d and parameter θ θ 1 θ 2 θ d the marginal likelihood of model mk can be defined as 1 p d m k p d θ m k p θ m k d θ where p d mk is the marginal likelihood of mk p d θ mk is the joint likelihood function of parameter θ p θ mk is the prior distribution of parameter θ under mk the marginal likelihood p d mk could be calculated accurately when the analytical expression of equation 1 is available however analytical solutions of p d mk are only available under strongly limited situations e g linear models with gaussian prior distribution liu et al 2016 schoniger et al 2014 when the likelihood function p d θ mk is complex and nonlinear or model parameter θ is a high dimensional vector it is hard to obtain analytical expressions of p d mk laplace approximation methods such as laplace maximum likelihood laplace ml and laplace maximum a posterior laplace map can be used to obtain semi analytical expressions of p d mk by taylor series expansion friel and wyse 2012 laplace approximation methods are firstly applied to estimate marginal likelihoods of groundwater models because of easy computation and low computational cost neuman 2003 ye et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 however these methods are vulnerable to truncation errors and heavily biased for nonlinear models schoniger et al 2014 this bias usually results from i an inadequate estimate of the maximum likelihood solution or maximum a posteriori density solution and ii incorrect assumption of multivariate normality of the target distribution volpi et al 2017 besides laplace approximation methods monte carlo mc methods are recently widely applied to estimate marginal likelihood these mc methods contain arithmetic mean estimator ame kass and raftery 1995 harmonic mean estimator hme friel and wyse 2012 newton and raftery 1994 thermodynamic integration estimator tie lartillot and philippe 2006 liu et al 2016 nested sampling estimator nse elsheikh et al 2013 skilling 2004 skilling 2006 etc ame usually needs a large number of random samples θ from the prior distribution p θ mk this method is conceptually straightforward and the estimation is theoretically accurate and stable so the estimation of ame can be used as reference value liu et al 2016 however ame suffers from heavy computation burden because samples from prior distribution with lower likelihood contribute little to the estimation volpi et al 2017 hme estimates marginal likelihood by the harmonic mean of posterior likelihood p d θ mk through markov chain monte carlo mcmc while hme is computationally more efficient than ame but it usually overestimates the marginal likelihood and suffers from instability compared with ame and hme tie and nse use more sophisticated strategies to estimate marginal likelihood p d mk based on path integration theory tie uses a series of mcmc to search likelihood space and generate samples for marginal likelihood estimation tie is superior in accuracy and stability but has low computational efficiency nse was first proposed by skilling 2004 skilling 2006 which estimates p d mk by translating complex high dimensional integral equation 1 into one dimensional integral 2 p d m k p d θ m k dx t i 1 x i 1 x i l i where dx is the differential of cumulative prior mass x 0 x 1 t is the number of discrete x i after that the one dimensional integral of equation 2 can be calculated by quadrature rule where l is the abbreviation of l θ d mk which equals to the joint likelihood p d θ mk the relationship of l and x is showed in equation 3 3 x λ l p θ m k d θ where λ can be any value of joint likelihood l θ d mk in the prior space the process of nse is illustrated in fig 1 with the increase of λ it means fewer and fewer parameter samples θ in the prior space can meet the constraint l θ d mk λ thus x λ decreases with the increase of λ during t evolutions of parameter samples θ the prior mass x decreases from 1 to 0 1 x 0 x 1 xt 1 xt greater than 0 and the joint likelihood threshold li increases from low to high value l 1 l 2 lt 1 lt the samples of li are obtained through the evolution of active set s in nse for the i th evolution of s the sample with worst likelihood in s is replaced by the new sample θ new with higher likelihood and then the joint likelihood of θ new is used as li 1 the process of generating θ new under the condition l θ new d mk li is called constrained local sampling elsheikh et al 2013 which can be realized by random sampling methods e g metropolis hasting m h algorithm in the process of evaluating xi and li in nse parameter samples θ i are gradually evolved from low probability space to high probability space rather than merely from prior distribution or posterior distribution schoniger et al 2014 liu et al 2016 and zeng et al 2018 evaluated several mc based marginal likelihood estimators and they demonstrated that nse is more computationally efficient in comparison with other estimators over the past decade nse has been successfully used for model evaluation and model selection in many fields such as cosmology mukherjee et al 2006 handley et al 2015 astronomy feroz and hobson 2008 and astrophysics feroz et al 2013 moreover nse has been recently applied for evaluating subsurface flow models elsheikh et al 2013 according to the structure of nse the performance of nse depends on the strength of constrained local sampling especially for high dimensional multimodal problems because it is difficult to generate qualified samples of θ i i e xi and li from complex model parameter space through constrained local sampling therefore in order to improve nse it is straightforward to construct a reliable constrained local sampling by incorporating an effective sampling algorithm schoniger et al 2014 made two modifications to the m h based constrained local sampling one is to use the ratio of prior probabilities instead of the ratio of likelihoods as the acceptance ratio the other is to use a suitable termination criterion e g end the procedure when the estimated marginal likelihood reach to convergence their results demonstrated that nse outperforms the laplace approximation methods through a real world hydrological test case however the estimation of this modified m h based nse is less reliable than other mc methods this is caused by the instability of the constrained local sampling in order to improve the stability and accuracy of nse elsheikh et al 2015 elsheikh et al 2014a elsheikh et al 2014b modified the constrained local sampling by incorporating non intrusive polynomial chaos hybrid monte carlo and multipoint statistics respectively liu et al 2016 made two modifications to the m h based nse developed by schoniger et al 2014 the first one is to use block wise updating to generate new sample the second one is the use of start over strategy to avoid premature termination their results showed this m h based nse is inefficient for the high dimensional and complex likelihood functions zeng et al 2018 developed an efficient nse by integrating dreamzs algorithm however their evaluation to several marginal likelihood estimators is only based on a synthetical groundwater flow model in addition we have noticed that some clustering algorithms are used to improve nse to handle complex multimodal likelihood functions e g multinest feroz et al 2009 and polychord handley et al 2015 mt dreamzs laloy and vrugt 2012 is a new effective and robust mcmc sampling method which integrates differential evolution sampling snooker updating and multiple try sampling etc mt dreamzs is designed to solve high dimensional and multimodal search problems many numerical experiment comparisons laloy and vrugt 2012 e g a 25 dimensional trimodal distribution and a 241 dimensional groundwater model showed that mt dreamzs has excellent performance on searching complex parameter space over other mcmc sampling algorithms e g dreamzs and m h algorithm laloy et al 2012 and linde and vrugt 2013 also shown that mt dreamzs converges nicely on other types of distributions in real world hydrologic cases it can be expected that the constrained local sampling would be competent for searching complex parameter space by integrating mt dreamzs algorithm such as generate a highly constrained sample from narrow region as well as avoid trapped in local optima as a result the performance of nse would be improved by the reliable samples of xi and li and this is the first focus of this study although previous studies have evaluated nse elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 schoniger et al 2014 most of them focused on m h based nse or its variants and based on low dimensional distribution or simple synthetical groundwater flow models it is still not clear the feasibility of the m h based and the mt dreamzs based nses to different type of likelihood functions such as multimodal and high dimensional distribution generally the likelihood function of the groundwater model under complex hydrogeological condition is usually not unimodal or low dimensional especially for reactive solute transport model multiphase flow model etc these models exhibit a remarkable characteristic of multimodal and multivariate likelihood functions moreover it is more challenging to generate reliable xi and li samples for those cases when using nse such as avoiding trapped in local optimum however the performance of different nses under high dimensional distributions e g up to 100 dimension is seldom compared in previous researches recognizing the way of mt dreamzs based nse to overcome the problem of searching complex likelihood space could provide insights into improving nse recently gaussian mixture importance game sampling volpi et al 2017 is developed to estimates marginal likelihood this sampling uses bridge sampling in the posterior samples generated by mcmc game combines the advantage of bridge sampling and mcmc to evaluate complex integral and it has been used for hydrologic model selection brunetti et al 2017 volpi et al 2017 their studies illustrated that the game is accurate and robust under some target distributions e g high dimensional distribution and multimodal distribution in addition polychord handley et al 2015 is a new developed nested sampling algorithm which combines the advantages of slice sampling cluster recognition and evolution as well as parallelization it has been used to search for high dimensional parameter spaces in astronomy field barbosa cendejas et al 2018 in this study the m h based dreamzs based and mt dreamzs based nses nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are evaluated through the marginal likelihood estimations for three complex and high dimensional analytical functions up to 100 dimension and one groundwater solute transport case and this is the second focus of this research the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of constructing nse mh and nse mt in section 3 the five marginal likelihood estimators nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are evaluated for four cases 1 a standard multivariate gaussian distribution with variable dimensionality up to 100 variate 2 a truncated multivariate gaussian distribution with variable dimensionality up to 100 variate 3 a multivariate rosenbrock function up to 100 variate 4 four heterogeneous groundwater solute transport models these marginal likelihood estimators are evaluated in terms of convergence accuracy efficiency and stability finally the summary and discussions of this study are drawn in section 4 2 methodologies this section starts with a brief description of nested sampling estimator nse in section 2 1 then section 2 2 describes the structure of m h algorithm based nse and the integration of nse and mt dreamzs algorithm is introduced in section 2 3 2 1 nested sampling estimator the marginal likelihood estimation by nse is achieved by means of generating the prior mass xi and likelihood function li through the evolution of parameter sample θ i as shown in equation 2 i 1 t is evolution number the expression of xi can be described as skilling 2006 4 x i e i n for notational convenience we use z to denote the marginal likelihood the procedure of nse begins with the evolution number i 1 x 0 1 and z 0 0 l 1 is the lowest likelihood l worst of the active set s which contains n samples generated from the prior distribution with the increase of evolution number i the sample with lowest likelihood in the active set is replaced by a new sample θ new with higher likelihood l θ new d mk l worst and θ new is generated through the constrained local sampling for ease of understanding the evolutions of active set s from i 1 to i t is termed as outer loop the iterations of constrained local sampling to generate θ new is termed as inner loop the procedure of nse can be described as following elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 skilling 2006 step 1 define the prior distribution of parameters the size of the active set n and the number of evolutions t the initial active set s is the assemble of samples generated randomly from the prior distribution s θ 1 θ 2 θ n calculate the joint likelihood for each sample of s step 2 start the outer loop to estimate marginal likelihood p d mk in two substeps step 2 1 for the ith i 1 2 t evolution select the sample θ worst with lowest likelihood l worst in the active set then calculate prior mass xi in equation 4 and zi zi 1 x i x i 1 li z0 0 li l worst step 2 2 replace θ worst in the active set with a new sample θ new generated by constrained local sampling the new sample θ new should satisfy with the restriction l θ new d mk l worst step 3 repeat step 2 until evolution number i reach to t calculate marginal likelihood z using equation 5 5 z z t x t n l θ 1 l θ 2 l θ n where l1 l2 ln is the likelihoods of final active set i t when implementing nse n and t are important parameters because n determines the size of active set and t decides the evolutions of outer loop of nse moreover t is depended on n because more parameter samples in the active set demands for more evolutions to evolve from low likelihood space into higher likelihood space with the increase of n and t the estimation of nse becomes more accurate and stable liu et al 2016 however larger n and t cause a higher computational cost some researches elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 have recommended to use n 25 and t 8 20 n to balance computational cost and accuracy in addition nse can be applied to obtain the posterior distribution of model parameters simultaneously by the discarded samples θ worst from the evolutions of active set 2 2 constrained local sampling via m h algorithm the procedure of constrained local sampling based on improved m h algorithm is described as following elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 schoniger et al 2014 step 1 define the number of iterations in constrained local sampling h h is also the iteration number of one inner loop step 2 for the jth j 1 2 h iteration generate a markov chain by using φ j φ j 1 δ ω and δ is a scaling factor ω is a random vector following gaussian distribution n 0 i the acceptance ratio is calculated as α min 1 p φ j p φ j 1 where p φ j and p φ j 1 are the prior probability of φ j and φ j 1 a random number u is generated from the uniform distribution u 0 1 if u α φ j φ j otherwise φ j φ j 1 step 3 repeat step 2 until j h and θ new φ h h is the length of markov chain generated by constrained local sampling via m h h 100 500 used in some researches elsheikh et al 2013 liu et al 2016 skilling 2006 in addition if likelihood ratio is used in step 2 instead of prior probability ratio constrained local sampling tends to accept samples with high likelihoods and the parameter samples would evolve into high likelihood space quickly it would lead to premature termination and inaccurate estimations 2 3 constrained local sampling via mt dreamzs algorithm on basis of dreamzs algorithm mt dreamzs uses multiple try metropolis sampling from an archive of past states to generate candidate points in each individual chain the detailed description of mt dreamzs algorithm is referred to laloy and vrugt 2012 and vrugt et al 2009 besides the regular use of mt dreamzs for posterior exploration three modifications are made to implement mt dreamzs for the inner loop of nse the first modification is that the mt dreamzs run for constrained local sampling does not need to be a complete run in the following two meanings on the one hand the total length of markov chains used in mt dreamzs is usually 100 1000 which is much smaller than conventional use i e usually thousands of samples because short markov chains are enough for finding parameter samples θ new that satisfy the restriction l θ new d mk l worst on the other hand the mt dreamzs algorithm can usually be divided into burn in period which generates enough length of markov chains to reach convergence and after burn in period which generates posterior parameter samples to reduce the computation cost the burn in period is executed before implementing nse and only the after burn in period is used to generate θ new for constrained local sampling it can ensure the convergence of markov chains and reduce unnecessary computation cost the second feature in the use of mt dreamzs for nse is that the markov chain is not start from active set s but from the sample matrix s randomly the sample matrix s has stored parameter samples generated from after burn in period of mt dreamzs the start point of inner loop influences the sampling trace of constrained local sampling if the start point is sampled from the evolved s for each inner loop of nse the generated parameter samples θ new by constrained local sampling might skip over the low likelihood region quickly starting from the samples of s would diversify the sampling traces of the constrained local sampling of nse the third feature in the use of mt dreamzs for nse is that the acceptance ratio of mt dreamzs as shown in eq 8 is replaced by the prior probability ratio when the inner loop of nse is the first time run to generate θ new for the i th outer loop when the first run of inner loop could not generate θ new meeting l θ new d mk l worst the eq 8 is used for the i th outer loop this is because the standard mt dreamzs is an efficient sampling method that samples of s would skip over low likelihood area and evolve to high likelihood space quickly this modification is similar to the modification of m h algorithm above the procedure of constrained local sampling based on modified mt dreamzs algorithm is described as following laloy and vrugt 2012 step 1 run a complete mt dreamzs to obtain the archive matrix z and sample matrix s where z contains parameter samples generated from the whole period and s contains samples generated from the after burn in period step 2 define the number of markov chains nchain the number of multi try samples k and the length of each markov chain h choose a sample θ from sample matrix s randomly as the start point of each markov chain φ 0 n n 1 nchain step 3 start an inner loop to generate a parameter sample θ new under the restriction l θ new d mk l worst in three substeps step 3 1 for the jth j 1 2 h iteration use eq 6 to generate k proposal samples ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ k for each markov chain 6 ξ k l φ j 1 l i d e d γ δ d j 1 δ z r 1 j n 1 δ z r 2 n ε d where δ means the number of samples in archive matrix z used to generate proposal samples z r 1 j and z r 2 n are parameter samples in z id is an identity matrix ed and εd are random numbers after that replace each element of ξ k l for the k proposal samples of each markov chain with crossover probability then calculate the joint likelihood of k new samples l ξ k l step 3 2 for each markov chain choose one sample ξ l with joint likelihood l ξ l from k new samples randomly then generate k 1 proposal samples ξ k l around ξ l using equation 7 7 ξ k l ξ l i d e d γ δ d j 1 δ z r 1 j n 1 δ z r 2 n ε d step 3 3 calculate the prior probability of k 1 new samples l ξ k 1 and the acceptance ratio is calculated by equation 8 8 α min 1 l ξ 1 l l ξ k l l ξ 1 l l ξ k 1 l l φ j 1 l a random number u is generated from uniform distribution u 0 1 if u α φ j l ξ l otherwise φ j l φ j 1 l step 4 repeat step 3 until the iteration number of markov chain j reaches to h and θ new φ h in order to maximize the efficiency of markov chain some parameters of mt dreamzs algorithm need to be specified carefully before integrated into nse which can refer to laloy and vrugt 2012 according to step 3 1 step 3 3 2k 1 samples are generated to obtain a new parameter sample φ at each iteration of each markov chain a larger k can lead to a better exploration of the likelihood space but demanding for more computational cost although parallel computing can alleviate this cost especially if k 1 the mt dreamzs based nse is equal to the dreamzs based nse more details about dreamzs based nse can refer to zeng et al 2018 to balance the computational cost and sampling capability we use k 2 in this study 3 marginal likelihood estimations for analytical and groundwater models the five marginal likelihood estimators nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are evaluated through 1 a standard multivariate gaussian distribution with variable dimensionality up to 100 variate and correlated dimensions 2 a truncated multivariate gaussian distribution with variable dimensionality up to 100 variate 3 a multivariate rosenbrock function up to 100 variate 4 four heterogeneous groundwater solute transport models by considering the model structure uncertainty of a laboratory column experiment lv et al 2016 which have multimodal likelihood functions in addition game sampling is implemented by means of the game package of matlab toolbox of vrugt 2016 polychord sampling is implemented by the open source packages of handley et al 2015 this study evaluated nse mt nse dr nse mh game and polychord in terms of convergence accuracy and stability convergence is evaluated by detecting the number of samples needed for accurately estimating the marginal likelihood accuracy is evaluated by comparing the estimates with the reference value ame converges to the theoretical value of estimate when the number of samples is large enough hence the estimation of ame is regarded as reference value in the real word cases liu et al 2016 stability is evaluated by examining the variability of repeated estimations of marginal likelihood 3 1 multivariate normal distribution with variable correlated dimensionality to test the performance of the five marginal likelihood estimators to distribution dimensionality followed with volpi et al 2017 the gaussian distributions with 5 to 100 dimensional multivariate and centered at the zero vector is used as the analytical cases the covariance matrix was set such that the variance of the j th variable was equal to j and all pairwise correlations were 0 5 the equation of the d variate normal distribution is defined as equation 9 9 f θ 0 σ 1 2 π d 2 σ 1 2 exp 1 2 θ t σ 1 θ there is no doubt that the reference value of marginal likelihood is equal to 1 table 1 summarizes the parameters used in nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord the parameters used in game and polychord are the recommended values by volpi et al 2017 and handley et al 2015 respectively the number of samples used in importance sampling m 0 in game is 1000 in this study the number of active set of polychord i e live points in polychord is n live 25 d the length of slice sampling chain of polychord is n repeats 3 d for each marginal likelihood estimator fifty repeated runs are conducted to verify the stability of estimations table 2 shows the average of fifty repeated estimations and the relative errors for different dimensionalities for the low dimensional d 5 10 distributions game and polychord outperform other three estimators in the accuracy because they have smaller average absolute value of relative errors aare moreover nse mt is more accurate than nse mh and nse dr nse mh is inaccurate for 10 dimensional distribution because of the large relative errors with the increase of dimension d 20 50 the estimations of nse dr and nse mt deviate from the reference value gradually nse mh cannot acquire the accurate estimation for more than 10 dimensional normal distribution nse dr and nse mt both underestimate the marginal likelihood for more than 20 dimensional distributions it illustrates that nse dr and nse mt are vulnerable to high dimensions nse dr and nse mt are not suitable for more than 10 dimensional distribution by contrast game and polychord are more accurate for medium dimensional distributions d 20 50 for the high dimensional d 75 100 distributions the superiority of game and polychord in accuracy is even more pronounced to other three estimators e g the aare of nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are 100 98 71 94 99 10 28 and 18 28 respectively thus with the increase of dimensionality the accuracy of game and polychord decrease slower than other three estimators nse dr and nse mt are only competent for less than 10 dimensional distributions in order to evaluate the convergence of these marginal likelihood estimators the best estimation which is closest to the reference value is examined fig 2 shows the convergence traces of nse mh nse dr and nse mt for 5 10 20 50 75 and 100 dimensional distributions denoted as 6 benchmark distributions hereafter for these five estimators the required sample numbers to reach convergence for these 6 benchmark distributions are 30 000 150 000 200 000 2 000 000 6 000 000 and 18 000 000 for nse mh 15 000 52 000 80 000 600 000 800 000 and 1 200 000 for nse dr 12 000 47 000 70 000 500 000 700 000 and 1 000 000 for nse mt 31 000 41 000 161 000 601 000 1 201 000 and 2 001 000 for game 95 000 840 000 1 600 000 80 000 000 100 000 000 and 120 000 000 for polychord therefore nse mt is significantly more efficient than nse mh and slightly more efficient than nse dr and game for multidimensional distribution moreover polychord seems the most inefficient estimator because it demands 10 100 times sample size than other estimators fig 3 plots the statistical boxplots of the repeated estimations of the five estimators based on the fifty repeated marginal likelihood estimations for 5 to 100 dimensional distributions it is easy to find that game has significantly higher stability than other estimators and polychord is slightly more stable than other three nses and nse mh has higher variability than nse dr and nse mt the repeated estimations of nse dr and nse mt have similar average values and the variability of nse mt is slightly smaller than that of nse dr thus nse mt is more stable than nse dr but the difference is very small 3 2 multivariate gaussian distribution with truncated dimensions considering the real world conditions the parameters estimated are usually with prior distributions which are often bounded in narrow space the second case study aimed to test the performance of these marginal likelihood estimators in the bounded parameter spaces so we truncated each dimension with a box car prior so that the reference value of marginal likelihood is reduced from 1 to 0 75 other conditions are the same as the first case the parameters used in five estimators are also the same as used in section 3 1 for each estimator fifty repeated implementations are conducted to verify the stability of results as shown in fig 5 the average of these repeated marginal likelihood estimations and the relative errors re are calculated as shown in table 3 for the low dimensional d 5 10 distribution game and polychord outperform other three estimators in the accuracy e g for d 10 the average absolute value of relative errors aare of marginal likelihood estimations for the five estimators are 60 17 11 85 6 75 5 28 and 4 27 respectively nse mt is more accurate than nse mh and nse dr and nse mh cannot acquire the accurate estimation for 10 dimensional normal distribution as for the medium dimensional d 20 50 the estimations of nse mh nse dr and nse mt deviate from the reference value gradually however game and polychord are still more accurate than other three estimators when it comes to high dimensional d 75 100 distributions only game and polychord can get accurate estimations e g for d 100 the aare of nse mh nse dr nse mt game and polychord are 100 100 100 9 53 and 12 21 respectively thus nse dr and nse mt are only suitable for less than 10 dimensional truncated distributions moreover game and polychord have the consistent estimation accuracy to truncated and untruncated distributions the estimation which is closest to the reference value is chosen to examine the convergence for nse mh nse dr and nse mt as shown by fig 4 for these five estimators the required sample numbers to reach convergence for these 6 benchmark distributions are 28 000 120 000 170 000 1 900 000 5 000 000 and 17 000 000 for nse mh 11 000 30 000 70 000 560 000 740 000 and 1 800 000 for nse dr 10 000 25 000 60 000 500 000 700 000 and 1 000 000 for nse mt 31 000 41 000 161 000 601 000 1 201 000 and 2 001 000 for game 83 000 660 000 1 300 000 70 000 000 90 000 000 and 100 000 000 for polychord therefore similar with the results of multidimensional normal distributions section 3 1 nse mt is significantly more efficient than nse mh and slightly more efficient than nse dr and game for multidimensional truncated distributions moreover polychord seems the most inefficient estimator among these five estimators in addition compared with untruncated distribution the convergence rates of three nses and polychord for truncated distributions are higher than that for untruncated distributions this is because the constrained local sampling is easier to search samples satisfying the restriction l θ new d mk l worst under the bounded parameter space i e it is difficult to search the narrow and low probability density areas of the untruncated distributions fig 5 shows the statistical boxplots of the repeated estimations of these five marginal likelihood estimators it illustrates the same conclusion of stability as shown in section 3 1 3 3 multivariate rosenbrock function in this section the five marginal likelihood estimators are evaluated through estimating the multivariate rosenbrock function also called banana shaped function the relationship of each dimension of banana shaped function is tightly correlated and it can testify the performances of the five estimators to complex distributions the banana shaped function is defined by 10 f θ f ϕ θ 0 σ where ϕ θ θ1 θ2 bθ1 2 100b θ3 θd and σ i d the d d identify matrix except for σ 1 1 100 we use the value of b 0 1 to generate a banana shaped distribution the parameters used in the five estimators are also the same as used in section 3 1 for each estimator fifty repeated runs are conducted to verify the stability of estimations table 4 shows the average of fifty repeated estimations and the relative errors for different dimensionalities for the low dimensional d 5 10 distribution each estimator can obtain accurate estimation of marginal likelihood except nse mh e g for d 10 the average absolute value of relative errors aare of marginal likelihood estimations for the five estimators are 64 13 8 75 4 36 0 12 and 0 83 respectively with the increase of dimension d 20 50 the estimations of these estimators have the similar performance as showed in the case study of multivariate gaussian distribution nse mh cannot acquire the accurate estimation for more than 10 dimensional normal distribution nse dr and nse mt both underestimate the marginal likelihood for more than 20 dimensional distributions by contrast game and polychord are more accurate for medium dimensional distributions d 20 50 for the high dimensional d 75 100 distributions only game and polychord sampling can get accurate estimations with low relative error 7 97 and 14 41 respectively fig 6 shows convergences of estimations of nse mh nse dr and nse mt for 5 10 20 50 75 and 100 dimensional distributions as was the case in sections 3 1 and 3 2 nse mt is the most efficient estimator compared with above two case studies the convergence rates of these five estimators for multivariate rosenbrock function are slightly lower than that for multivariate normal distributions and untruncated distributions this is because the parameter space of rosenbrock function is more complex than normal distributions moreover the stability of estimators to rosenbrock function as shown in fig 7 is slightly lower than that to multivariate gaussian distributions in sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 4 heterogeneous solute transport model fig 8 shows a groundwater transport experiment in an acrylic column equipped by lv et al 2016 this column is 2 6 cm in inner diameter 20 cm in length and it is divided into two regions filled with two sands with different grain sizes the basic hydraulic properties of two sands are summarized in table 5 a pump was used to supply flow at a constant rate of 1 ml min 1 through the column in an up flow mode a tracer experiment of kno3 was conducted through this equipment and the kno3 concentrations of outflow were observed at 1 5 9 281 min 71 observations respectively considering model structure uncertainty as shown in fig 9 four plausible models m 1 m 2 m 3 and m 4 are proposed to represent the unknown groundwater system e g the model layer structure these four models vary in the distributions of two sand zones in column and have the same boundary conditions as the real model the groundwater flow and solute transport numerical models are built by using modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 respectively in order to evaluate the performances of these models on reproducing observations i e kno3 concentrations nse mh nse dr nse mt and game are used to estimate their marginal likelihoods and polychord is not implemented in this case study due to the infeasible computation burden suppose that four hydrogeological parameters k 1 k 2 α 1 and α 2 unknown of each model m 1 m 4 other parameters are set to true values in this study the prior distributions of four unknown parameters k 1 k 2 α 1 and α 2 are defined as uniform distributions the distribution ranges are given in table 6 the joint likelihood function l θ d mk is defined by gaussian function as equation 10 hamilton 1994 where c is a covariance matrix usually an identity matrix i d observations μ represents the measured concentrations of kno3 y represent the simulation value and n is the number of observations μ and y n 71 in this case 10 l θ d m k 1 2 π n 2 c 1 2 exp 1 2 y μ t c 1 y μ in this case study the parameters used in nse mh nse dr nse mt and game are same as that used in the 5 dimensional distribution in sections 3 1 the average marginal likelihoods of twenty repeated estimations by these estimators are listed in table 7 the estimation of ame is taken as the reference value liu et al 2016 the results show that the averaged estimations of three nses and game are all close to the reference values furthermore the average absolute values of relative errors of marginal likelihood estimations are 3 74 9 05 5 98 and 2 22 for nse mt nse mh nse dr and game respectively the order of accuracy of the four methods is game nse mt nse dr nse mh thus game outperforms other three estimators in the accuracy of model evidence estimation and nse mt is more accurate than nse mh and nse dr fig 10 exhibits the convergence of these estimators for the marginal likelihood estimations of models m 1 m 4 for three nses the estimation closest to reference value is chosen for convergence test it is easy to find that the estimations of ame demand about one million model executions to reach to convergence for these groundwater models except for the estimation of m 2 needs about 1 700 000 model executions to obtain convergence for the estimations of nse mh it demands about 50 000 80 000 model executions to reach to convergence for nse dr it demands about 30 000 40 000 model executions to reach the convergence as for nse mt the estimated marginal likelihoods converge to stable values within 26 000 30 000 model executions which is slightly smaller than the cost of game 31 000 model executions it demonstrates that nse mt is more computationally efficient than nse mh and slightly more efficient than nse dr and game fig 11 plots the statistical boxplots of the twenty repeated estimations of three nses and game it also shows game outperforms other three estimators in the stability of model evidence estimation and the estimations of nse mt has slightly smaller variation than that of nse mh and similar variation to nse dr this is because the model dimension is small d 4 the difference among the search ability of mt dreamzs and dreamzs is not significant thus nse mt and nse dr are more stable than nse mh and the improvement is not significant in order to investigate the difference between nse mh and nse mt fig 12 shows the searching processes of nse mh and nse mt in the likelihood spaces of m 1 m 4 for easy visualization the two dimensional projection k 1 and k 2 of parameter samples is used to exhibit the searching process from low likelihood region to high likelihood region the background is likelihood function distribution each point in fig 12 denotes a discarded parameter samples θ i from the i th evolution of active set step 2 2 in section 2 1 each plot in fig 12 has 200 points fig 12 a c e g shows the evolution process of nse mh the parameter samples of nse mh always concentrated at the high likelihood region and the low likelihood region is seldom explored fig 12 b d f h represents the evolution process of nse mt and the whole likelihood space is sufficiently explored this is because mt dreamzs is more reliable to explore high dimensional multimodal space and estimations of nse mt have higher accuracy than that of nse mh according to the estimated marginal likelihoods of models m 1 m 4 table 6 the model performances are ranked in ascending order m 2 m 3 m 4 m 1 it demonstrates model m 1 outperforms other alternative models because these models are assessed under same parameter uncertainty prior parameter distributions the model marginal likelihood represents the confidence of this model structure as a result model m 1 with the largest marginal likelihood is the best one among all plausible models 3 5 discussion based on the results mentioned above we can draw following conclusions 1 nse mt and nse dr are adequate for estimating marginal likelihood for less than 10 dimensional distributions 2 nse mt outperforms nse mh and nse dr in convergence accuracy and efficiency for marginal likelihood estimation but the improvement in stability is not significant nse mt needs about a half of computation cost required by nse mh to obtain convergence 3 for low dimensional distribution d 5 or 10 the difference between nse mt and nse dr is very small 4 nse mh nse dr and nse mt are vulnerable to the increasement of model parameter distribution dimensionality and they are inadequate for more than 10 dimensional distributions 5 game and polychord are more accurate and stable than nse mh nse dr and nse mt especially for more than 10 dimensional distributions 6 nse mt is slightly more efficient than game and significantly more efficient than polychord in this section we will discuss the reasons and possible solutions for improving the stability of nse fig 13 shows the curves of likelihood function l xi cumulative prior mass xi generated by the outer loop of nse the samples of l xi xi are then used to compute marginal likelihood by equation 2 at the early stage of outer loop 0 3 xi 1 the generated likelihood function l xi at same xi varies significantly for different implementations of nse after that the generated l xi varies slightly and tends to be a stable value at the later stage of outer loop 0 xi 0 3 fig 13 also shows that the l xi xi curves of nse mt have a small variability than that of nse mh and so the integral areas under the curves of l xi xi i e the marginal likelihood of nse mt have better stability than that of nse mh this is because mt dreamzs algorithm has more stable searching process for multidimensional multimodal likelihood space than m h according to eq 2 the estimation of marginal likelihood is composed of the product of li and δxi l xi δx i the interval of x δxi xi 1 xi decreases with the increase of evolution number i but l x i increases gradually with the increase of evolution number i in order to examine the contribution of l xi δx i to marginal likelihood estimation at each evolution of outer loop from i 1 to i t the l xi δx i i 1 t of nse mt and nse mh is calculated for the four groundwater models as shown by fig 14 it is easy to find that li δx i is very small at the primary stage of outer loop e g i 50 and gradually reach to its maximum at the middle stage e g 75 i 1 0 0 and then decreases to a very small value at the later stage e g i greater than 175 it illustrates that the searching of intermediate likelihood space has great influence on marginal likelihood estimation thus generating stable samples of l xi at the middle stage of outer loop is crucial to the stability of nse two strategies are potential beneficial to improve the stability of nse the first strategy is to tune the parameters of n and t n decides the distribution of xi i e the size of δx i through equation 4 t controls the length of outer loop i e the number of li δx i therefore t and n have significant influence on the stability of nse elsheikh et al 2013 and liu et al 2016 analyzed the effects of n on marginal likelihood estimation their results showed that the estimation is more accurate and consistent when using larger n it is because more samples in the active set allow a better chance to explore the parameter space however the larger n demands more model executions to obtain convergence and it needs to balance the efficiency and stability of nse the second strategy is to incorporate more elaborate sampling algorithm into the constrained local sampling of nse this is because the unstable samples of li from constrained local sampling will lead to the unstable estimations of nse the sampling algorithm having a stable path to search likelihood space from low likelihood region to high likelihood region would be the ideal one for nse in addition zhang et al 2017 have proposed a kalman filter based dreamzs algorithm dream zks which is more stable and efficient in exploring the posterior distribution for high dimensional models in future study the dream zks algorithm can be used to construct the constrained local sampling and to improve the stability of nse by incorporating slice sampling cluster recognition and evolution polychord has apparently higher estimation accuracy than other three nses nse mh nse dr and nse mt especially for high dimensional distributions and slightly more stable than other three nses however polychord requires significantly more computation cost to reach convergence than other three nses which hinders the application of this method in practice the required number of samples is proportion to d 3 for disparate dimensionality handley et al 2015 parallelization has been incorporated to improve the efficiency of marginal likelihood estimation the run time of polychord is significantly reduced when the module of parallelization is enabled especially for high dimensional distributions incorporating the advantages of nse mt and polychord would be the feasible way to improve nse 4 summary and conclusions the nested sampling estimator nse is recently used to estimate marginal likelihood for groundwater model selection and assessment both the prior and posterior likelihood spaces are searched through the evolution of active set used in nse in this study the mt dreamzs algorithm is incorporated into the constrained local sampling of nse to improve the performance of marginal likelihood estimation the five marginal likelihood estimators including mt dreamzs based m h based and dreamzs based nses nse mt nse mh and nse dr game and polychord are evaluated in terms of convergence accuracy efficiency and stability through four case studies the key findings of this study can be summarized as following 1 in comparison with nse mh the convergence rate and computational efficiency of nse are improved significantly by incorporating mt dreamzs algorithm the estimation accuracy is also improved apparently especially for less 10 dimensional distributions however the improvement in stability is small 2 nse mt outperforms nse dr slightly in convergence rate computational efficiency accuracy and stability of marginal likelihood estimation 3 game outperforms nse mt nse dr and nse mt in the accuracy and stability of estimation especially for the more than 10 dimensional distributions in addition nse mt is slightly more efficient than game for multidimensional distributions thus nse mt is feasible as the model parameter dimensionality is less than 10 and this is meaningful for realistic groundwater cases 4 polychord outperforms other three nses at accuracy and stability especially for high dimensional distributions d 10 and it is slightly less accurate and stable than game moreover polychord is significantly less efficient than other estimators the accuracy of nse mh nse dr and nse mt all deteriorates fast with the increase of dimensionality especially for nse mh by contrast game and polychord are more reliable with the increase of dimensionality the five marginal likelihood estimators used in this paper all take advantage of mcmc technique to search parameter space because of the sampling nature mcmc methods always need a large number of iterations and suffers from heavy computation expense using more efficient searching strategies e g fuzzy bayesian learning pan and bester 2017 or diffusive nested sampling trevisani and gelfand 2003 or surrogate techniques zeng et al

7173,a warming climate is expected to perturb the hydrological cycle resulting in changes to both the frequency and duration of drought especially in arid and semiarid grassland although considerable attention has been paid to the responses of key water fluxes to severe drought few have explored the effects of prolonged drought on evapotranspiration et its partitioning into vegetation transpiration t and soil evaporation e and its relationship with vegetation productivity in this study we used a combination of the eddy covariance ec flux technique and satellite remote sensing products to evaluate the effects of prolonged drought on et components based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency uwue the results showed t accounted for about 51 standard deviation 0 03 of et during prolonged drought lower than those in normal and or wet years range 59 62 we detected strong positive relationships between the t et ratios and aboveground biomass agb leaf area index lai and precipitation r2 of 0 80 0 58 and 0 49 respectively the specific responses of ecosystem functioning to prolonged drought indicated that grassland ecosystem was able to resist the drought disturbance and retain vegetation growth to a certain extent unless extreme drought hit the results implied that more intense and prolonged droughts will result in ecological degradation and substantial changes in ecosystem functioning and these results improve our understanding of how the climate change will affect the function and structure of grassland ecosystem keywords semiarid grassland water fluxes et partitioning underlying water use efficiency uwue prolonged drought 1 introduction analyses of precipitation streamflow and soil moisture have shown a trend of increasing drought in the 21st century dai 2011a b more intense and persistent droughts are projected to cause major shifts in key processes in the water cycle which in turn will affect the carbon and nitrogen cycles in terrestrial ecosystems coners et al 2016 poncecampos et al 2013 suggested that large regions have become more arid starting with water limited low productivity grasslands grasslands are the main vegetation type in semi arid regions of china and are ecologically fragile and sensitive to climatic changes and anthropogenic disturbances li et al 2007 additionally grasslands supply numerous ecosystem service functions and have been recognized as the most significant ecological barriers in north china therefore grassland ecosystems especially those in arid and semiarid regions have attracted growing attention from researchers sun et al 2016 water fluxes were found to be the most crucial parameters influencing species composition and vegetation productivity in grassland ecosystems when drought induced water limitations was severe wilske et al 2010 trenberth et al 2014 variations in water fluxes are in large part due to changes in evapotranspiration et which is water loss via soil surface evaporation e and plant transpiration t fisher et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 the difference between t and e is considerable since the former is an ecohydrological link between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems and the latter is the direct process of water exchange between the soil surface and the atmosphere thus partitioning et into its two components may help us to understand the interaction mechanism between the land and atmosphere and the key processes of water and energy balances between plants and the atmosphere lawrence et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 recent research on the impact of climate change on key elements in the water cycle has focused on the response of et and vegetation growth to altered hydroclimatic conditions largely to flash drought years milly and dunne 2016 zhang and liu 2014 climatic extremes occurring over multiple and consecutive years have accumulated non linear effects on ecosystems that cannot be predicted from single year events weaver and albertson 1939 since prolonged drought may cross ecological thresholds and threaten the inherent characteristics of ecosystems resulting in biome reorganization poncecampos et al 2013 however our knowledge about the responses of et partitioning to more intense and prolonged droughts and about how to assess the factors that control et partitioning is still limited recent findings suggested that model simulations coupled with the eddy covariance ec technique is the most direct and common method to partition the contributions of e and t to water loss i e et the models used in recent studies include water and energy process based models e g the forest landscape productivity model flpm the grassland landscape productivity model glpm zhang and liu 2014 optimal partitioning berkelhammer et al 2016 isotope partitioning berkelhammer et al 2016 a bio meteorological approach based on priestley taylor fisher et al 2008 the penman monteith leuning pml model leuning et al 2008 and the underlying water use efficiency uwue method zhou et al 2014 2016 some models such as the flpm model or glpm and the stable isotope technique require the numerous complex parameters that rely on intensive field measurements hence it remains the challenge to continuously measure et components in field the uwue method uwue gpp vpd0 5 et proposed by zhou et al 2014 is based on the relationships between et and gross primary productivity gpp and vapor pressure deficit vpd and is considered as a relatively simple method to partition et the uwue method is mainly based on the assumption that the maximum of water use efficiency wue for a growing season is essentially constant over time for a given uniform ecosystem this simple method of obtaining uwue using available daily summed from half hourly measurements fluxnet eddy covariance ec measurements has been used to calculate et partitioning for various terrestrial ecosystems based on the relationship between gpp vpd0 5 and et vegetation indexes vis are effective indicators for exploring the interplay between climate change and vegetation growth pallett et al 2016 ren et al 2017 the enhanced vegetation index evi reflects the process of vegetation growth more exactly than does the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which might reach its saturation value in the phase of maximum vegetation cover huete et al 2002 grassland biomass especially aboveground biomass agb is widely used to represent vegetation growth because of its close relationship with the carbon cycle and grassland productivity han et al 2018 hall et al 2000 the agb has been used to analyze the dynamics of vegetation growth at long term and large spatial scales where vegetation growth is estimated by a regression between field measurements and remote sensing data ren et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 numerous findings suggested that an inversion model between agb and evi derived from modis to estimate agb has been commonly used which can accurately reflect the variations in ecosystem functioning under altered hydroclimatic conditions todd et al 1998 méndez barroso et al 2009 here the main objectives of this study were 1 to characterize the seasonal and interannual variations in droughts across the study area over the past 50 years 2 to evaluate and correct the modis et and gpp estimates against in situ measurements and to estimate the contribution of t to et under prolonged droughts using the uwue technique and 3 to elucidate the factors controlling the t et ratio under prolonged drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the northeast of inner mongolia china with an area of 2 9 105 km2 111 06 121 03 e 41 34 50 13 n fig 1 a it experiences a semiarid continental temperate climate and receives 300 500 mm of annual precipitation with significant inter annual variability the growing season is generally from may to september when 80 of annual precipitation occurs the mean temperature is within the range of 3 0 c to 2 c and the mean temperature of the growing season ranges from 20 c to 38 c the main vegetation type is semiarid typical steppe and leymus chinensis and stipa baicalensis are the dominant native species the soil types are chernozem soil gbt 17296 2009 black soil and aeolian sandy soils these are distributed across a wide range of elevations average range 400 1800 m above sea level fig 1c as reported by sun et al 2017 there are no significant differences in spatial patterns of climatic factors including precipitation and temperature in the study area thus the effect of elevation on spatial differences of temperature precipitation and other climatic factors are not considered in our study in the recent past increases in the severity and frequency of hydroclimatic disturbances have changed the distribution pattern of hydrothermal conditions and the physicochemical properties of soil wang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2014 these changes have profoundly influenced the function structure and species composition of the grassland ecosystems in this area 2 2 sampling and meteorological data preparation aboveground biomass agb and plant communities were surveyed and samples were collected from 75 sites all in grassland in early august in 2015 and from 55 sites all in grassland in early august in 2016 fig 1a we randomly assigned 3 5 samples each from 1 m2 plot to every 50 km the survey parameters recorded in each plot were the amount coverage height and density of all plants height and coverage of plant communities and location longitude latitude and altitude in each sample agb was harvested at ground level from the two random 0 25 m2 quadrats and then dried to constant weight at 100 c for 12 h before measuring dry weight coyle et al 2008 as shown in fig 1a the number of sampling sites was sufficiently large to obtain an accurate value for agb daily meteorological data were collected from 13 meteorological stations around the study area fig 1a the data included precipitation pre mm near surface 2 m air temperature tem c near surface 2 m wind speed wind m s 1 near surface 2 m specific humidity shum and near surface 2 m pressure pres pa these data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn site index html climate data covered the period from january 1961 to december 2015 for a small amount of missing data 1 the average was calculated from data collected in other years at the same station the daily data for each meteorological variable were summed to obtain monthly and annual data at the station level and were further interpolated to generate a new dataset with 1 km spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighting idw method kurtzman et al 2009 the interpolated meteorological values were averaged by all pixels which was identical to those across the study area the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was the difference between the saturated vapor pressure and the actual vapor pressure which was calculated based on the penman monteith p m method using the above meteorological data vörösmarty et al 1998 2 3 in situ flux data observation and processing to obtain potential uwue uwuep and to validate the remote sensing estimates in situ data from the neimenggu site nmg 43 32 n 116 40 e were collected from the chinaflux network http www chinaflux org fig 1a the site is characterized as a leymus chinensis ecological type in the temperature typical grassland of inner mongolia it experiences a temperate and semiarid continental climate with mean annual precipitation of 350 mm and mean annual temperature of 0 9 c the dominant plant species are leymus chinensis stipa baicalensis cleistogenes squarrosa and agropyron cristatum the canopy height is approximately 50 60 cm and the vegetation coverage is 30 40 the observed dataset consisted of half hourly air temperature ta c latent heat flux le w m 2 net ecosystem exchange nee g c m 2 d 1 and gpp g c m 2 d 1 between 2004 and 2005 half hourly measurements of et kg h2o m 2 d 1 were calculated using ta and le donatelli et al 2006 and half hourly et were summed to obtain daily amounts only original data not gap filled were used in the process and the dataset was quality filtered according to the following rejection criterion data under nocturnal low atmospheric turbulence conditions were excluded based on friction velocity u when u 0 20 m s 1 han et al 2014 negative le values were removed from the dataset 2 4 remote sensing data and its processing to cover the absence of in situ et and gpp measurements across the study area the remote sensing data were selected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16a2 we collected et estimates with a spatial resolution of 500 m and 8 day temporal resolution and gpp estimates from mod17a2 with a spatial resolution of 1 km and 8 day temporal resolution data during the period of 2000 2016 https modis gsfc nasa gov data the tiles of modis products h25v03 h25v04 h26v03 and h26v04 were mosaicked and redefined to an albers projection the 8 day summation of et kg m 2 and 8 day cumulative gpp kg c m 2 estimates between 2004 and 2005 at the in situ location were extracted and then both the products were corrected against in situ measurements at the daily scale 8 day intervals to test the technique for partitioning et using daily flux data in this study et and gpp estimates were averaged every 8 days in addition values at the administrative boundary vector data of the study area were obtained for the period of 2003 2012 quality assessment qa of the performance of the two modis products was documented using in situ measurements in the study area as shown later to conduct agb estimates at a large spatial scale the evi time series of satellite based images 250 m spatial and 8 day temporal resolution mod09q1 covering the period from 2003 to 2012 were obtained https modis gsfc nasa gov data dataprod mod09 php similar to et and gpp estimates evi mosaic images were obtained and geometric projection transformation was performed the evi estimates at the sampling locations and the administrative boundary vector for the study area were then extracted to ensure the accuracy of evi estimates we set all invalid values to 0 monthly evi images were averaged from three 8 day evis in the current month and the average evi during the growing season was obtained using the maximum value composite mvc holben 1986 the evi was calculated follows eq 1 1 evi g ρ nir ρ red ρ nir c 1 ρ red c 2 ρ blue l where ρ nir represents the reflectance of the near infrared band ρ blue and ρ red represent the reflectance of the blue and red spectral bands respectively and g c1 c2 and l are parameters set to 2 5 6 7 5 and 1 respectively then based on the dataset a statistical model was established for the inversion of agb according to wang et al 2014 the fraction of t is directly linked to vegetation morphological attributes in particular leaf area index lai therefore it is not surprising that lai can act as a control over et partitioning schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang et al 2014 scott and biederman 2017 in this study lai products derived from mod15a2 with a spatial resolution of 500 m and 8 day temporal resolution during the period 2000 to 2016 https modis gsfc nasa gov data were obtained to evaluate the effect of vegetation cover on t et the lai data were processed similarly to et and gpp data the lai values during the growing season each year were obtained by averaging all 8 day lai values 2 5 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei considerable research efforts have been devoted to quantifying drought and different drought indices can result in different patterns of change during droughts especially at small timescales burke 2011 drought events defined using a multiscalar drought metric i e monthly seasonally half yearly and annual can be well identified by the spei method based on a range of integration times e g 12 month spei is integrated over the previous 12 months vicente serrano et al 2015 beguería et al 2014 here the main steps for calculating spei were as follows 1 calculation of pet based on the p m method potential et pet refers to the maximum e from the land surface when water supply is not limited under certain meteorological conditions allen and ingram 2002 the p m method is used widely to estimate pet e g grassland ecosystems zhang et al 2016 thus pet was calculated as follows eq 2 2 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 v p s v p δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where the unit of pet is mm d r n is net radiation at the surface mj m 2 d g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 δ is the slope of saturated water vapor pressure kpa c 1 u 2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 vp s is mean saturated vapor pressure kpa vp is actual saturated vapor pressure kpa and t mean is mean temperature c for detailed calculations refer to relevant studies gong et al 2006 2 calculation of the difference d i between monthly precipitation and pet as follows eqs 3 and 4 3 d i p i p e t i 4 d n k i 0 k 1 2 i 1 k k 1 p n i p e t n i n k where d i is the water deficit for the i th month mm p j is the i th month precipitation mm pet i is the i th month pet mm d n k is the accumulated d i at different time scales based on linearly decreasing weight k is time scale month and n is the total calculated month 3 use of the log logistic probability distribution to fit the series of d i as follows eq 5 5 f x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 where x is d i and α β and γ are the scale shape and origin parameters which were calculated by the l moment method as follows eqs 6 8 6 β 2 w 1 w 0 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 7 α w 0 2 w 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 8 γ w 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β where γ β is the gamma function of β thus the cumulative density function of the d i probability density was calculated as showed below eq 9 9 f x 1 α 1 γ β 1 4 standardization of the normal distribution of the d i series and then obtain the corresponding spei eqs 10 and 11 10 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 p 0 5 p 1 f x 11 spei c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 p 0 5 p 1 p where w 2 ln p and the constants c 0 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 and d 3 are 2 51 0 80 0 01 1 43 0 19 and 0 001 respectively the spei values at the stations and across the study area were obtained using the interpolated daily meteorological data and then the drought severity at different timescales was classified according to table 1 where more negative values indicate more severe drought mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 the spei at shorter timescales i e 1 month spei 1 represented as dry spell reflects short term and medium term moisture conditions important for vegetation growth whereas the spei at longer timescales i e 12 month spei 12 is probably related to streamflows and groundwater levels 2 6 approach for partitioning evapotranspiration employment of partitioning et approach proposed by zhou et al 2014 2016 is a critical part of our study according to the essential differences between et components t provides a direct eco hydrological link since it is coupled with co2 transfer or co2 assimilation a which is related to stomatal conductance and atmospheric pressure based on the above concept a and t were calculated as follows eqs 12 and 13 12 a g s c a c i p a 13 t 1 6 g s e i e a p a where the units of a and t are μ m o l m 2 s 1 g s is the stomatal conductance of co2 μ m o l m 2 s 1 pa is the atmospheric pressure hpa c a c i and e i e a are the pressure difference between the inner leaf and ambient air for co2 and for water vapor hpa respectively according to the concept of uwue u wue gpp vp d 0 5 e t this method considered the effect of vpd on water use efficiency a linear relationship between t and vpd hpa was represented at the leaf scale water use efficiency i e the ratio of a over t was defined by vpd thus the uwue at the leaf scale uwuei was established considering the control of vpd on wue the uwuei was calculated as follows eq 14 14 uwu e i a vpd t the vpd was assumed to be basically same within the uniform environment from the leaf level to the ecosystem level and gpp was expressed as the accumulation of carbon assimilation in this method at the ecosystem level potential uwue uwuep is considered to be nearly identical to uwuei when applying the coupled carbon water relationship to all the leaves and apparent uwue uwuea is identical to observed uwue affected by soil evaporation the calculations of uwuep uwuea and the ratio of the two were as follows eqs 15 17 15 uwu e p g p p vpd t 16 uwu e a g p p vpd et 17 t et uwu e a uwu e p previous studies stated that t et follows a single peak diurnal pattern and the diurnal peak value will reach unity when soil evaporation is negligible villegas et al 2014 wang and yamanaka 2014 therefore there is a critical assumption in the concept of uwue that is when t is equal to et i e contribution of soil evaporation to et is negligible for a given uniform ecosystem uwuep is considered to be constant in this study two major analyses including identification of field based vegetation type and comparison of in situ uwuep and corrected uwuep calculations from corrected modis products using corresponding in situ measurements were used to test the constancy of uwuep for all years across the study area 2 7 data analysis all the dataset calculations and modelling were accomplished using matlab matrix laboratory mathworks arcgis 10 2 python arcgis 10 2 with the spatial analyst extension and python esri and r statistical software regression analyses were conducted and graphs were conducted using origin 2017 originlab usa coefficient of determination r2 spearman s correlation coefficients r root mean square error rmse relative error re and standard error sd were calculated to assess the performance of corrected models i e for correcting modis et and gpp estimates and the agb inversion model one way anova was used to test the difference among in situ uwuep measurements and corrected modis estimates statistical indicators and p values were calculated to quantify the relationships and identify statistical differences among treatments for all analyses the confidence level of p 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results 3 1 correction of satellite based estimates prior to estimate the uwuep and uwuea values in situ et and gpp observations were used to test the performance of modis estimates even though some studies suggested that the estimates of satellite based gpp and et were able to capture the region level seasonal variability in semiarid grassland of inner mongolia vetter et al 2012 to keep the temporal resolution consistent in situ daily et and gpp were integrated to values for 8 day intervals fig 2 a and b compared the two datasets modis et and gpp estimates and in situ et and gpp measurements at 8 day temporal scales during the 2004 and 2005 growing season in situ measurements were divided into two portions one training samples values in 2004 for model establishment and the other testing samples values in 2005 for model verification the results showed that modis et underestimated the in situ measurements by 13 similarly modis gpp underestimated the in situ gpp measurements by up to 28 9 to accurately evaluate et components based on the concept of uwue it was necessary to correct the modis products as illustrated in the inserts in fig 2 a and b the corrected values of both et and gpp were close to the observed values r of 0 97 and 0 98 respectively and rmse of 2 34 mm 8 d 1 and 8 45 g c m 2 8 d 1 respectively after correction the et and gpp values tracked the dynamics of the corresponding measurements well these results indicated that corrected modis et and gpp were accurate and preferable as parameters for developing the et partitioning model in this study 3 2 grassland aboveground biomass agb inversion based on previous research on agb inversion for grassland ecosystems we selected a linear regression between evi and agb to estimate grassland agb todd et al 1998 li et al 2007 here sampling dataset comprised 130 quadrats of 1 m 1 m and was divided into two portions one 55 samples in 2016 for model correction and the other 75 samples in 2015 for model verification the performance of the inversion model between evi and agb was evaluated using several statistical indexes e g r2 rmse and re the inversion model was as follows eq 16 16 agb i α evi i β this inversion model was used to characterize the variations in grassland agb during the growing season as shown in fig 3 there was a strong positive correlation between agb and evi at the site scale r2 0 65 p 0 01 to avoid over fitting we then verified the validity of the model for estimating grassland agb by calculating r2 the rmse and re using the validation dataset we detected a strong relationship between the agb estimated from the model and measured agb at the site scale r2 0 93 p 0 01 rmse 37 4 g m2 re 13 7 fig 3 thus the evi based agb inversion model showed good performance for estimating grassland agb in this study area representing the ability of evi to estimate agb across the study area 3 3 seasonal variations of droughts across the study area the sensitivity of the spei value differed on different time scales based on the spei drought index categories values lower than 0 5 indicate a drought event across the study area whereas those higher than 0 5 indicate a humid wet climate the fluctuation of wetness and dryness was more significant at the shorted timescales e g 1 month fig s1 than at longer timescales e g 12 month fig 4 a additionally there was a significant decrease p 0 01 in the interannual variation of spei values during the period of 1961 2015 this indicated that there were increases in the frequency and severity of droughts after 2000 fig 4a as reported previously by qu 2015 and the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa 2012 consecutive drought events spei 1 0 occurred across the study area during the period of 2004 2011 with an exception of 2008 it was noted that extreme droughts occurred in 2007 during the prolonged drought period of 2004 2011 dry spells were more frequent and severe during the growing season than during the non growing season especially in 2005 2007 and 2009 fig 4b there has been a combination of increased aridity and prolonged droughts at the 12 month timescale since 2000 and more frequent dry spells during the growing season were the main contributors to the prolonged yearly drought from 2004 to 2011 hence in this study we selected the period of 2003 2012 as the study period i e pre during and post drought to analyze the effects of prolonged drought on et components i e t et in this study and on vegetation productivity in water limited grasslands 3 4 ecosystem level potential uwue estimation in this study the flux site was established in a relatively homogeneous ecosystem where there is minimal spatial variation in the structural characteristics of the vegetation considering the field based results of vegetation type table s1 supplementary material and the relationships between geography and climate fig 1b and c this study area was considered to be a uniform ecosystem thus uwuep calculated from the flux data was reasonable and valid to apply for the whole grassland ecosystem to further test the assumption that uwuep was essentially constant across the study years the average uwuep for the study period was compared with the average uwuep values for site year as shown in fig 5 uwuep was estimated as the regression slope for the 95th quantile regression i e upper bound between gpp vpd0 5 and et with all the daily et and gpp data during the growing season in 2004 and 2005 for the flux site and the corresponding daily vpd the results showed that the slope of the 95th quantile regression line i e the uwuep was 14 7 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o for the flux site this study also calculated the uwuep using in situ 8 day interval measurements i e ec8d uwuep matching with the temporal resolution of the modis estimates the uwuep using corrected modis estimates hereafter cmod8d was calculated for the periods of 2004 2005 and 2003 2012 respectively the insert in fig 6 showed the comparison between the measured uwuep i e ecd and ec8d and the estimated i e cmod8d values for the periods of 2004 2005 and 2003 2012 as shown in the figure there was no significant difference between them p 0 05 more specifically in 2004 and 2005 ecd uwuep was higher than ec8d with an error of 11 the ec8d uwuep values were higher than cmod8d values for the periods of 2004 2005 and 2003 2012 with errors of 0 06 and 0 01 respectively additionally we compared annual and long term 2003 2012 average uwuep across the study area using corrected modis estimates the results showed that the departures of annual uwuep values from the mean was within 0 10 except in 2012 10 1 since there was little difference between the estimated annual uwuep and the mean value we concluded that uwuep was relatively consistent this confirmed that it was reasonable to assume that the long term uwuep was essentially constant across the study period the uwuep for the study area was higher than those listed in the ameriflux network http public ornl gov ameriflux which were estimated in previous studies for the same vegetation type i e grassland for example 13 83 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o for the us var site in 2001 2007 xu and baldocchi 2004 and 12 99 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o for the us wlr site between 2002 and 2004 coulter et al 2006 wilson and meyers 2007 those two sites experienced a humid climate with average annual precipitation of more than 500 mm and mean temperature higher than 13 c more details are shown in supplementary table s2 previous studies suggested that uwuep increases as the water supply changes from wet to dry e g wetlands lowlands dryland and sand poncecampos et al 2013 morecroft and woodward 1990 also found that the higher the humidity the lower the uwuep which supported our findings that the uwuep was higher than for the other two us grasslands mentioned above moreover the uwuep was higher under medium water stress than under severe water stress for vegetation therefore uwuep was estimated to be higher for the nmg site than for the other two sites mainly because of the climatic differences between the nmg semiarid region and the us var and us wlr sites humid climate region 3 5 variations in apparent uwue and t et to prolonged drought the variation in uwuea estimated as the linear regression slope using daily data 8 day intervals for et gpp and vpd was shown in fig 7 the results indicated that the linear regression slopes i e uwuea values varied under altered hydroclimatic conditions with values of 7 59 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o in 2003 fig 7a pre drought 6 50 0 44 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o during the drought period of 2004 2011 fig 7b i and 7 93 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o in 2012 fig 7j post drought there was a decrease in uwuea when drought initially occurred across the study area following a normal year fig 7a and b during the prolonged drought period there was no significant variation in uwuea with an exception of 2007 2008 fig 7b i these results illustrated that increases in the frequency and duration of drought did not necessarily lead to significant changes in ecosystem uwuea but the increasing severity of drought especially extreme drought following a continuing drought reduced uwuea fig 7e and f in the humid wet year following prolonged drought high precipitation increased the ecosystem uwuea resulting from replenishment of soil water available for vegetation growth fig 7j the corresponding annual t et ratios were in the range of 0 46 0 62 the estimated annual t et during the period of 2003 2012 was 0 53 0 05 0 59 in the pre drought year 0 51 0 03 during the prolonged drought period and 0 62 in the post drought year the t et ratio decreased when moderate drought occurred across the study area indicating that soil evaporation was the main contributor to the increase in et as the drought was more severe and persistent the t et basically remained constant then fell to its minimum value during and following the extreme drought the t et ratio returned to normal or even higher levels during the increase in water availability after the prolonged drought the estimated annual t et ratio 0 53 0 05 during the study period was slightly lower than those reported by zhou et al 2016 t et ratio of 0 56 0 05 and schlesinger and jasechko 2014 t et ratio of 0 57 0 19 4 discussion 4 1 contributions of precipitation and temperature to drought to identify the contributions of precipitation and temperature to prolonged drought we analyzed interannual variations in annual precipitation and mean temperature over the past 50 years as shown in fig 8 increases in precipitation deficits and mean temperature immediately led to increases in the frequency magnitude and duration of droughts the anomalies in precipitation and temperature indicated that alternation of water deficit and water surplus was frequent in the study area and that the study area has experienced continuous warming since the 2000s hence increases in the duration and severity of droughts since the 2000s resulted from the joint actions of increasing air temperature and decreasing precipitation the mean annual precipitation of 246 28 mm yr 1 during 2004 2011 prolonged drought was significantly lower than that during 1990 1997 average precipitation conditions 320 47 mm yr 1 it was also lower than the long term 50 yr average precipitation of 292 50 mm yr 1 the mean temperature was different significantly among decades warming from 0 90 0 57 c in 1961 1980 to 1 97 0 80 c in 1981 2015 the mean temperature of 2 41 0 69 c during the prolonged drought period was higher than that of 1 58 0 89 c over the last 50 years indicating that more regions experienced warming close to 1 c the variation in precipitation during the growing season explained 86 7 0 03 of annual precipitation in the last 50 years fig 8b and c precipitation during the growing season showed patterns of increases to decreases after the 1980s which differed from patterns during the non growing season during the non growing season the variation in mean temperature was in good agreement with average annual change indicating that temperature variation in the non growing season controlled annual mean temperature furthermore the mean temperatures increased significantly both in the growing season and the non growing season especially after 2000 p 0 05 overall the study area experienced consecutive droughts from 2004 to 2011 because of prolonged higher temperatures and less precipitation since 2000 although the highest mean precipitation in the non growing season appeared in 2008 2010 4 2 changing responses of agb and et partitioning to prolonged drought the climatic and surface controls of t et add complexity to the description of patterns of t et schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang et al 2014 scanlon and kustas 2012 reported that vegetation was a first order factor affecting et partitioning the lai as a key proxy of vegetation morphology was found to be positively related to t good et al 2014 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 we detected correlations between the annual t et ratios and precipitation temperature lai and estimated agb fig 9 a d the t et ratio was most strongly correlated with agb r2 0 80 p 1 0 followed by lai r2 0 58 p 0 01 across the study area during the growing season the correlation coefficient was relatively low for the relationship between t et ratio and precipitation r2 0 49 p 0 05 and the lowest for the relationship between the t et ratio and air temperature r2 0 31 p 0 1 the significant positive correlation between precipitation and t et indicated that precipitation controlled increases in lai and t et mainly via its effect to supply soil relative humidity rd wang et al 2014 we also found that the t et became larger as the agb and lai increased therefore agb or evi lai as well as some climatic variables precipitation or rd were most likely to reflect the variation in t et across the study area during the prolonged drought period to further explore the response of et partitioning to prolonged drought we plotted the interannual variations in agb et and the annual t et ratio under altered hydroclimatic conditions fig 10 the average t et ratio was lower during the study period of 2003 2012 0 55 0 06 than in the pre drought 0 65 and post drought years 0 72 vegetation growth i e agb was also responsive to altered hydroclimatic conditions according to the variations in agb this study divided the study period 2003 2012 into three stages ecosystem maintenance stage 1 ecosystem degradation stage 2 and ecosystem recovery stage 3 to further examine the response of vegetation growth to drought stress in different climates in the first stage the agb decreased from its pre drought value when moderate drought hit across the study area this revealed that the vegetation rapidly responded to changing water availability and that the ecosystem was sensitive to hydroclimatic disturbance vicente serrano et al 2013 the t would decrease since the water use efficiency increased to sustain productivity in that year thus the corresponding t et ratio decreased mainly owing to an increase in et which might imply an increase in soil evaporation with the persistent drought between 2005 and 2006 the variation in agb was only slightly linked to drought intensity indicating weak sensitivity of vegetation to consecutive drought continuous water loss contributed to the slight increase in the t et ratio indicating that soil evaporation loss was greater than that from plant transpiration additionally this result might be explained by the fact that the ecosystem could sustain vegetation growth by decreasing t i e increasing wue as reflected by the sharp decrease in et from 2005 to 2006 poncecampos et al 2013 on the basis of these results we concluded that at the first stage grassland ecosystem exhibited an ability to recover from disturbances and sustain productivity through self regulation to a certain extent in the second stage both agb and the t et ratio decreased when extreme drought occurred in 2007 that is the vegetation decreased in the study area under extreme drought knapp and smith 2001 reported that extreme drought resulted in plant dieback and mortality on the basis of the climatic conditions in 2007 fig 9 we suggested that this degradation was mainly caused by continuous water stress with the least precipitation and highest temperatures although precipitation was higher during the non growing season in 2008 than in the previous years the ecosystem continued to show the lowest agb levels without recovery thus the extreme drought at this stage decreased grassland productivity potentially resulting in vegetation mortality knapp and smith 2001 and the break down of its self regulating capacity he et al 2018 changes in the self regulating capacity of the ecosystem might result from a shift in species composition like that reported poncecampos et al 2013 during the third stage from 2009 to 2012 the increase in precipitation during the non growing season alleviated water stress for vegetation growth fig 8c both the agb and et increased indicating that more moisture was available for vegetation to support plant transpiration and soil evaporation the increases in the agb and et were accompanied by a corresponding increase in t et indicating vegetation had resumed growing by 2012 poncecampos et al 2013 in the humid year of 2012 following consecutive drought precipitation pulses vastly alleviated water deficits and increased soil water storage availability for ecosystem recovery thus the agb t et ratio and et increased to reach their maximum values in the third stage these results revealed the different responses of grassland ecosystems to altered hydroclimatic conditions by exploring the variation in t et to prolonged drought extreme drought during prolonged droughts would likely degenerate the ecosystem showing an obvious reduction in vegetation productivity thus our results indicated that the semiarid grassland ecosystem was sensitive to drought stress and had an ability to rapid recover with an increase in water availability 4 3 uncertainty and limitations in this study we examined the responses of et components to prolonged drought for grassland ecosystem based on the uwue method however there are some limitations and uncertainties first the uncertainties derived from in situ et and gpp measurements were not considered although they are commonly used as a benchmark to validate satellite based corresponding products yu et al 2006 lin 2015 natural vegetation often is less than homogeneous both vertically and horizontally so the vegetation characteristics in a flux site may not be representative of the vegetation of interest especially for a large region rana and katerji 2000 additionally the limited source area of the flux site mismatched with the satellite based pixels 500 and 1000 m these factors resulted in uncertainties in the validation of satellite based products to a certain extent another important constraint stemmed from field sampled biomass we have not considered the differences in these species in the sampling survey but assumed that all had an equal importance thus the agb may have been overestimated by the inversion model related to the evi second we found some degree of uncertainty in the corrected modis gpp and et estimates even though the satellite based estimates corrected against the corresponding measurements at the in situ level provided acceptable accuracy fig 2 in this study after corrections for modis et and gpp estimates corrected et values were approximately identical to measured values whereas the corrected gpp estimates still underestimated by 8 7 consequently both uwuep and uwuea were underestimated by 8 7 according to the eqs 15 and 16 third in our analyses we assumed a constant uwuep across all years in the study area zhou et al 2016 however the uwuep may be expected to change dramatically due to the extreme drought and or vegetation changes zhou et al 2014 2016 thus we tested this assumption by analyzing the difference between uwuep in each year and its long term average fig 6 and found that there were certain discrepancies in the annual uwuep during 2003 2012 the greatest departures of uwuep values from the average were around 10 in a humid and following an extreme drought year fig 6 according to zhou et al 2016 this relative small variation in uwuep may not induce large uncertainties in et partitioning and therefore the uwue method to estimate et partitioning could be used in our research area on the other hand additional data for more years are necessary to explore the possible changes in uwuep considering the expected drought in future in most of the published studies there were significant uncertainties around the contribution of t to et i e t et reflected by the wide range of t et values good et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 to quantitatively evaluate the difference resulting from the t et we compared the t et values in this study with those reported in the literature the assumption that t will be equal to et during the growing season with high vegetation cover may be imprecise because vegetation is relatively sparse and soil evaporation cannot be ignored in the study area consequently the uwuep may be underestimated and t et overestimated 5 conclusion we explored the responses of et partitioning to prolonged droughts based on ec measurements and modis estimates using the uwue method proposed by zhou et al 2014 2016 and identified the factors controlling t et prolonged drought during 2004 2011 substantially restricted vegetation growth and reduced grassland productivity further changed the contributions of the two components to et the t et ratio was well represented by agb lai and precipitation under long lasting and warming drought conditions the response of t et also indicated that the ecosystem was able to resist the drought disturbance and retain vegetation growth during the initial period of drought when extreme drought hit the decrease in t et demonstrated that the ecosystem was unable to sustain productivity due to an obvious reduction in water availability in the humid years following prolonged drought an increase in the t et ratio represented recovery of the ecosystem our results highlight the need to understand the major flux processes i e e t and et under prolonged drought conditions and the factors controlling et in a semiarid grassland these findings will improve our understanding of the specific responses of the grassland ecosystem to prolonged droughts acknowledgements this study was supported by the

7173,a warming climate is expected to perturb the hydrological cycle resulting in changes to both the frequency and duration of drought especially in arid and semiarid grassland although considerable attention has been paid to the responses of key water fluxes to severe drought few have explored the effects of prolonged drought on evapotranspiration et its partitioning into vegetation transpiration t and soil evaporation e and its relationship with vegetation productivity in this study we used a combination of the eddy covariance ec flux technique and satellite remote sensing products to evaluate the effects of prolonged drought on et components based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency uwue the results showed t accounted for about 51 standard deviation 0 03 of et during prolonged drought lower than those in normal and or wet years range 59 62 we detected strong positive relationships between the t et ratios and aboveground biomass agb leaf area index lai and precipitation r2 of 0 80 0 58 and 0 49 respectively the specific responses of ecosystem functioning to prolonged drought indicated that grassland ecosystem was able to resist the drought disturbance and retain vegetation growth to a certain extent unless extreme drought hit the results implied that more intense and prolonged droughts will result in ecological degradation and substantial changes in ecosystem functioning and these results improve our understanding of how the climate change will affect the function and structure of grassland ecosystem keywords semiarid grassland water fluxes et partitioning underlying water use efficiency uwue prolonged drought 1 introduction analyses of precipitation streamflow and soil moisture have shown a trend of increasing drought in the 21st century dai 2011a b more intense and persistent droughts are projected to cause major shifts in key processes in the water cycle which in turn will affect the carbon and nitrogen cycles in terrestrial ecosystems coners et al 2016 poncecampos et al 2013 suggested that large regions have become more arid starting with water limited low productivity grasslands grasslands are the main vegetation type in semi arid regions of china and are ecologically fragile and sensitive to climatic changes and anthropogenic disturbances li et al 2007 additionally grasslands supply numerous ecosystem service functions and have been recognized as the most significant ecological barriers in north china therefore grassland ecosystems especially those in arid and semiarid regions have attracted growing attention from researchers sun et al 2016 water fluxes were found to be the most crucial parameters influencing species composition and vegetation productivity in grassland ecosystems when drought induced water limitations was severe wilske et al 2010 trenberth et al 2014 variations in water fluxes are in large part due to changes in evapotranspiration et which is water loss via soil surface evaporation e and plant transpiration t fisher et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 the difference between t and e is considerable since the former is an ecohydrological link between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems and the latter is the direct process of water exchange between the soil surface and the atmosphere thus partitioning et into its two components may help us to understand the interaction mechanism between the land and atmosphere and the key processes of water and energy balances between plants and the atmosphere lawrence et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 recent research on the impact of climate change on key elements in the water cycle has focused on the response of et and vegetation growth to altered hydroclimatic conditions largely to flash drought years milly and dunne 2016 zhang and liu 2014 climatic extremes occurring over multiple and consecutive years have accumulated non linear effects on ecosystems that cannot be predicted from single year events weaver and albertson 1939 since prolonged drought may cross ecological thresholds and threaten the inherent characteristics of ecosystems resulting in biome reorganization poncecampos et al 2013 however our knowledge about the responses of et partitioning to more intense and prolonged droughts and about how to assess the factors that control et partitioning is still limited recent findings suggested that model simulations coupled with the eddy covariance ec technique is the most direct and common method to partition the contributions of e and t to water loss i e et the models used in recent studies include water and energy process based models e g the forest landscape productivity model flpm the grassland landscape productivity model glpm zhang and liu 2014 optimal partitioning berkelhammer et al 2016 isotope partitioning berkelhammer et al 2016 a bio meteorological approach based on priestley taylor fisher et al 2008 the penman monteith leuning pml model leuning et al 2008 and the underlying water use efficiency uwue method zhou et al 2014 2016 some models such as the flpm model or glpm and the stable isotope technique require the numerous complex parameters that rely on intensive field measurements hence it remains the challenge to continuously measure et components in field the uwue method uwue gpp vpd0 5 et proposed by zhou et al 2014 is based on the relationships between et and gross primary productivity gpp and vapor pressure deficit vpd and is considered as a relatively simple method to partition et the uwue method is mainly based on the assumption that the maximum of water use efficiency wue for a growing season is essentially constant over time for a given uniform ecosystem this simple method of obtaining uwue using available daily summed from half hourly measurements fluxnet eddy covariance ec measurements has been used to calculate et partitioning for various terrestrial ecosystems based on the relationship between gpp vpd0 5 and et vegetation indexes vis are effective indicators for exploring the interplay between climate change and vegetation growth pallett et al 2016 ren et al 2017 the enhanced vegetation index evi reflects the process of vegetation growth more exactly than does the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which might reach its saturation value in the phase of maximum vegetation cover huete et al 2002 grassland biomass especially aboveground biomass agb is widely used to represent vegetation growth because of its close relationship with the carbon cycle and grassland productivity han et al 2018 hall et al 2000 the agb has been used to analyze the dynamics of vegetation growth at long term and large spatial scales where vegetation growth is estimated by a regression between field measurements and remote sensing data ren et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 numerous findings suggested that an inversion model between agb and evi derived from modis to estimate agb has been commonly used which can accurately reflect the variations in ecosystem functioning under altered hydroclimatic conditions todd et al 1998 méndez barroso et al 2009 here the main objectives of this study were 1 to characterize the seasonal and interannual variations in droughts across the study area over the past 50 years 2 to evaluate and correct the modis et and gpp estimates against in situ measurements and to estimate the contribution of t to et under prolonged droughts using the uwue technique and 3 to elucidate the factors controlling the t et ratio under prolonged drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the northeast of inner mongolia china with an area of 2 9 105 km2 111 06 121 03 e 41 34 50 13 n fig 1 a it experiences a semiarid continental temperate climate and receives 300 500 mm of annual precipitation with significant inter annual variability the growing season is generally from may to september when 80 of annual precipitation occurs the mean temperature is within the range of 3 0 c to 2 c and the mean temperature of the growing season ranges from 20 c to 38 c the main vegetation type is semiarid typical steppe and leymus chinensis and stipa baicalensis are the dominant native species the soil types are chernozem soil gbt 17296 2009 black soil and aeolian sandy soils these are distributed across a wide range of elevations average range 400 1800 m above sea level fig 1c as reported by sun et al 2017 there are no significant differences in spatial patterns of climatic factors including precipitation and temperature in the study area thus the effect of elevation on spatial differences of temperature precipitation and other climatic factors are not considered in our study in the recent past increases in the severity and frequency of hydroclimatic disturbances have changed the distribution pattern of hydrothermal conditions and the physicochemical properties of soil wang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2014 these changes have profoundly influenced the function structure and species composition of the grassland ecosystems in this area 2 2 sampling and meteorological data preparation aboveground biomass agb and plant communities were surveyed and samples were collected from 75 sites all in grassland in early august in 2015 and from 55 sites all in grassland in early august in 2016 fig 1a we randomly assigned 3 5 samples each from 1 m2 plot to every 50 km the survey parameters recorded in each plot were the amount coverage height and density of all plants height and coverage of plant communities and location longitude latitude and altitude in each sample agb was harvested at ground level from the two random 0 25 m2 quadrats and then dried to constant weight at 100 c for 12 h before measuring dry weight coyle et al 2008 as shown in fig 1a the number of sampling sites was sufficiently large to obtain an accurate value for agb daily meteorological data were collected from 13 meteorological stations around the study area fig 1a the data included precipitation pre mm near surface 2 m air temperature tem c near surface 2 m wind speed wind m s 1 near surface 2 m specific humidity shum and near surface 2 m pressure pres pa these data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn site index html climate data covered the period from january 1961 to december 2015 for a small amount of missing data 1 the average was calculated from data collected in other years at the same station the daily data for each meteorological variable were summed to obtain monthly and annual data at the station level and were further interpolated to generate a new dataset with 1 km spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighting idw method kurtzman et al 2009 the interpolated meteorological values were averaged by all pixels which was identical to those across the study area the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was the difference between the saturated vapor pressure and the actual vapor pressure which was calculated based on the penman monteith p m method using the above meteorological data vörösmarty et al 1998 2 3 in situ flux data observation and processing to obtain potential uwue uwuep and to validate the remote sensing estimates in situ data from the neimenggu site nmg 43 32 n 116 40 e were collected from the chinaflux network http www chinaflux org fig 1a the site is characterized as a leymus chinensis ecological type in the temperature typical grassland of inner mongolia it experiences a temperate and semiarid continental climate with mean annual precipitation of 350 mm and mean annual temperature of 0 9 c the dominant plant species are leymus chinensis stipa baicalensis cleistogenes squarrosa and agropyron

obtain daily amounts only original data not gap filled were used in the process and the dataset was quality filtered according to the following rejection criterion data under nocturnal low atmospheric turbulence conditions were excluded based on friction velocity u when u 0 20 m s 1 han et al 2014 negative le values were removed from the dataset 2 4 remote sensing data and its processing to cover the absence of in situ et and gpp measurements across the study area the remote sensing data were selected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16a2 we collected et estimates with a spatial resolution of 500 m and 8 day temporal resolution and gpp estimates from mod17a2 with a spatial resolution of 1 km and 8 day temporal resolution data during the period of 2000 2016 https modis gsfc nasa gov data the tiles of modis products h25v03 h25v04 h26v03 and h26v04 were mosaicked and redefined to an albers projection the 8 day summation of et kg m 2 and 8 day cumulative gpp kg c m 2 estimates between 2004 and 2005 at the in situ location were extracted and then both the products were corrected against in situ measurements at the daily scale 8 day intervals to test the technique for partitioning et using daily flux data in this study et and gpp estimates were averaged every 8 days in addition values at the administrative boundary vector data of the study area were obtained for the period of 2003 2012 quality assessment qa of the performance of the two modis products was documented using in situ measurements in the study area as shown later to conduct agb estimates at a large spatial scale the evi time series of satellite based images 250 m spatial and 8 day temporal resolution mod09q1 covering the period from 2003 to 2012 were obtained https modis gsfc nasa gov data dataprod mod09 php similar to et and gpp estimates evi mosaic images were obtained and geometric projection transformation was performed the evi estimates at the sampling locations and the administrative boundary vector for the study area were then extracted to ensure the accuracy of evi estimates we set all invalid values to 0 monthly evi images were averaged from three 8 day evis in the current month and the average evi during the growing season was obtained using the maximum value composite mvc holben 1986 the evi was calculated follows eq 1 1 evi g ρ nir ρ red ρ nir c 1 ρ red c 2 ρ blue l where ρ nir represents the reflectance of the near infrared band ρ blue and ρ red represent the reflectance of the blue and red spectral bands respectively and g c1 c2 and l are parameters set to 2 5 6 7 5 and 1 respectively then based on the dataset a statistical model was established for the inversion of agb according to wang et al 2014 the fraction of t is directly linked to vegetation morphological attributes in particular leaf area index lai therefore it is not surprising that lai can act as a control over et partitioning schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang et al 2014 scott and biederman 2017 in this study lai products derived from mod15a2 with a spatial resolution of 500 m and 8 day temporal resolution during the period 2000 to 2016 https modis gsfc nasa gov data were obtained to evaluate the effect of vegetation cover on t et the lai data were processed similarly to et and gpp data the lai values during the growing season each year were obtained by averaging all 8 day lai values 2 5 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei considerable research efforts have been devoted to quantifying drought and different drought indices can result in different patterns of change during droughts especially at small timescales burke 2011 drought events defined using a multiscalar drought metric i e monthly seasonally half yearly and annual can be well identified by the spei method based on a range of integration times e g 12 month spei is integrated over the previous 12 months vicente serrano et al 2015 beguería et al 2014 here the main steps for calculating spei were as follows 1 calculation of pet based on the p m method potential et pet refers to the maximum e from the land surface when water supply is not limited under certain meteorological conditions allen and ingram 2002 the p m method is used widely to estimate pet e g grassland ecosystems zhang et al 2016 thus pet was calculated as follows eq 2 2 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 v p s v p δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where the unit of pet is mm d r n is net radiation at the surface mj m 2 d g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 δ is the slope of saturated water vapor pressure kpa c 1 u 2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 vp s is mean saturated vapor pressure kpa vp is actual saturated vapor pressure kpa and t mean is mean temperature c for detailed calculations refer to relevant studies gong et al 2006 2 calculation of the difference d i between monthly precipitation and pet as follows eqs 3 and 4 3 d i p i p e t i 4 d n k i 0 k 1 2 i 1 k k 1 p n i p e t n i n k where d i is the water deficit for the i th month mm p j is the i th month precipitation mm pet i is the i th month pet mm d n k is the accumulated d i at different time scales based on linearly decreasing weight k is time scale month and n is the total calculated month 3 use of the log logistic probability distribution to fit the series of d i as follows eq 5 5 f x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 where x is d i and α β and γ are the scale shape and origin parameters which were calculated by the l moment method as follows eqs 6 8 6 β 2 w 1 w 0 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 7 α w 0 2 w 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 8 γ w 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β where γ β is the gamma function of β thus the cumulative density function of the d i probability density was calculated as showed below eq 9 9 f x 1 α 1 γ β 1 4 standardization of the normal distribution of the d i series and then obtain the corresponding spei eqs 10 and 11 10 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 p 0 5 p 1 f x 11 spei c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 p 0 5 p 1 p where w 2 ln p and the constants c 0 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 and d 3 are 2 51 0 80 0 01 1 43 0 19 and 0 001 respectively the spei values at the stations and across the study area were obtained using the interpolated daily meteorological data and then the drought severity at different timescales was classified according to table 1 where more negative values indicate more severe drought mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 the spei at shorter timescales i e 1 month spei 1 represented as dry spell reflects short term and medium term moisture conditions important for vegetation growth whereas the spei at longer timescales i e 12 month spei 12 is probably related to streamflows and groundwater levels 2 6 approach for partitioning evapotranspiration employment of partitioning et approach proposed by zhou et al 2014 2016 is a critical part of our study according to the essential differences between et components t provides a direct eco hydrological link since it is coupled with co2 transfer or co2 assimilation a which is related to stomatal conductance and atmospheric pressure based on the above concept a and t were calculated as follows eqs 12 and 13 12 a g s c a c i p a 13 t 1 6 g s e i e a p a where the units of a and t are μ m o l m 2 s 1 g s is the stomatal conductance of co2 μ m o l m 2 s 1 pa is the atmospheric pressure hpa c a c i and e i e a are the pressure difference between the inner leaf and ambient air for co2 and for water vapor hpa respectively according to the concept of uwue u wue gpp vp d 0 5 e t this method considered the effect of vpd on water use efficiency a linear relationship between t and vpd hpa was represented at the leaf scale water use efficiency i e the ratio of a over t was defined by vpd thus the uwue at the leaf scale uwuei was established considering the control of vpd on wue the uwuei was calculated as follows eq 14 14 uwu e i a vpd t the vpd was assumed to be basically same within the uniform environment from the leaf level to the ecosystem level and gpp was expressed as the accumulation of carbon assimilation in this method at the ecosystem level potential uwue uwuep is considered to be nearly identical to uwuei when applying the coupled carbon water relationship to all the leaves and apparent uwue uwuea is identical to observed uwue affected by soil evaporation the calculations of uwuep uwuea and the ratio of the two were as follows eqs 15 17 15 uwu e p g p p vpd t 16 uwu e a g p p vpd et 17 t et uwu e a uwu e p previous studies stated that t et follows a single peak diurnal pattern and the diurnal peak value will reach unity when soil evaporation is negligible villegas et al 2014 wang and yamanaka 2014 therefore there is a critical assumption in the concept of uwue that is when t is equal to et i e contribution of soil evaporation to et is negligible for a given uniform ecosystem uwuep is considered to be constant in this study two major analyses including identification of field based vegetation type and comparison of in situ uwuep and corrected uwuep calculations from corrected modis products using corresponding in situ measurements were used to test the constancy of uwuep for all years across the study area 2 7 data analysis all the dataset calculations and modelling were accomplished using matlab matrix laboratory mathworks arcgis 10 2 python arcgis 10 2 with the spatial analyst extension and python esri and r statistical software regression analyses were conducted and graphs were conducted using origin 2017 originlab usa coefficient of determination r2 spearman s correlation coefficients r root mean square error rmse relative error re and standard error sd were calculated to assess the performance of corrected models i e for correcting modis et and gpp estimates and the agb inversion model one way anova was used to test the difference among in situ uwuep measurements and corrected modis estimates statistical indicators and p values were calculated to quantify the relationships and identify statistical differences among treatments for all analyses the confidence level of p 0 05 was considered as statistically significant 3 results 3 1 correction of satellite based estimates prior to estimate the uwuep and uwuea values in situ et and gpp observations were used to test the performance of modis estimates even though some studies suggested that the estimates of satellite based gpp and et were able to capture the region level seasonal variability in semiarid grassland of inner mongolia vetter et al 2012 to keep the temporal resolution consistent in situ daily et and gpp were integrated to values for 8 day intervals fig 2 a and b compared the two datasets modis et and gpp estimates and in situ et and gpp measurements at 8 day temporal scales during the 2004 and 2005 growing season in situ measurements were divided into two portions one training samples values in 2004 for model establishment and the other testing samples values in 2005 for model verification the results showed that modis et underestimated the in situ measurements by 13 similarly modis gpp underestimated the in situ gpp measurements by up to 28 9 to accurately evaluate et components based on the concept of uwue it was necessary to correct the modis products as illustrated in the inserts in fig 2 a and b the corrected values of both et and gpp were close to the observed values r of 0 97 and 0 98 respectively and rmse of 2 34 mm 8 d 1 and 8 45 g c m 2 8 d 1 respectively after correction the et and gpp values tracked the dynamics of the corresponding measurements well these results indicated that corrected modis et and gpp were accurate and preferable as parameters for developing the et partitioning model in this study 3 2 grassland aboveground biomass agb inversion based on previous research on agb inversion for grassland ecosystems we selected a linear regression between evi and agb to estimate grassland agb todd et al 1998 li et al 2007 here sampling dataset comprised 130 quadrats of 1 m 1 m and was divided into two portions one 55 samples in 2016 for model correction and the other 75 samples in 2015 for model verification the performance of the inversion model between evi and agb was evaluated using several statistical indexes e g r2 rmse and re the inversion model was as follows eq 16 16 agb i α evi i β this inversion model was used to characterize the variations in grassland agb during the growing season as shown in fig 3 there was a strong positive correlation between agb and evi at the site scale r2 0 65 p 0 01 to avoid over fitting we then verified the validity of the model for estimating grassland agb by calculating r2 the rmse and re using the validation dataset we detected a strong relationship between the agb estimated from the model and measured agb at the site scale r2 0 93 p 0 01 rmse 37 4 g m2 re 13 7 fig 3 thus the evi based agb inversion model showed good performance for estimating grassland agb in this study area representing the ability of evi to estimate agb across the study area 3 3 seasonal variations of droughts across the study area the sensitivity of the spei value differed on different time scales based on the spei drought index categories values lower than 0 5 indicate a drought event across the study area whereas those higher than 0 5 indicate a humid wet climate the fluctuation of wetness and dryness was more significant at the shorted timescales e g 1 month fig s1 than at longer timescales e g 12 month fig 4 a additionally there was a significant decrease p 0 01 in the interannual variation of spei values during the period of 1961 2015 this indicated that there were increases in the frequency and severity of droughts after 2000 fig 4a as reported previously by qu 2015 and the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa 2012 consecutive drought events spei 1 0 occurred across the study area during the period of 2004 2011 with an exception of 2008 it was noted that extreme droughts occurred in 2007 during the prolonged drought period of 2004 2011 dry spells were more frequent and severe during the growing season than during the non growing season especially in 2005 2007 and 2009 fig 4b there has been a combination of increased aridity and prolonged droughts at the 12 month timescale since 2000 and more frequent dry spells during the growing season were the main contributors to the prolonged yearly drought from 2004 to 2011 hence in this study we selected the period of 2003 2012 as the study period i e pre during and post drought to analyze the effects of prolonged drought on et components i e t et in this study and on vegetation productivity in water limited grasslands 3 4 ecosystem level potential uwue estimation in this study the flux site was established in a relatively homogeneous ecosystem where there is minimal spatial variation in the structural characteristics of the vegetation considering the field based results of vegetation type table s1 supplementary material and the relationships between geography and climate fig 1b and c this study area was considered to be a uniform ecosystem thus uwuep calculated from the flux data was reasonable and valid to apply for the whole grassland ecosystem to further test the assumption that uwuep was essentially constant across the study years the average uwuep for the study period was compared with the average uwuep values for site year as shown in fig 5 uwuep was estimated as the regression slope for the 95th quantile regression i e upper bound between gpp vpd0 5 and et with all the daily et and gpp data during the growing season in 2004 and 2005 for the flux site and the corresponding daily vpd the results showed that the slope of the 95th quantile regression line i e the uwuep was 14 7 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o for the flux site this study also calculated the uwuep using in situ 8 day interval measurements i e ec8d uwuep matching with the temporal resolution of the modis estimates the uwuep using corrected modis estimates hereafter cmod8d was calculated for the periods of 2004 2005 and 2003 2012 respectively the insert in fig 6 showed the comparison between the measured uwuep i e ecd and ec8d and the estimated i e cmod8d values for the periods of 2004 2005 and 2003 2012 as shown in the figure there was no significant difference between them p 0 05 more specifically in 2004 and 2005 ecd uwuep was higher than ec8d with an error of 11 the ec8d uwuep values were higher than cmod8d values for the periods of 2004 2005 and 2003 2012 with errors of 0 06 and 0 01 respectively additionally we compared annual and long term 2003 2012 average uwuep across the study area using corrected modis estimates the results showed that the departures of annual uwuep values from the mean was within 0 10 except in 2012 10 1 since there was little difference between the estimated annual uwuep and the mean value we concluded that uwuep was relatively consistent this confirmed that it was reasonable to assume that the long term uwuep was essentially constant across the study period the uwuep for the study area was higher than those listed in the ameriflux network http public ornl gov ameriflux which were estimated in previous studies for the same vegetation type i e grassland for example 13 83 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o for the us var site in 2001 2007 xu and baldocchi 2004 and 12 99 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o for the us wlr site between 2002 and 2004 coulter et al 2006 wilson and meyers 2007 those two sites experienced a humid climate with average annual precipitation of more than 500 mm and mean temperature higher than 13 c more details are shown in supplementary table s2 previous studies suggested that uwuep increases as the water supply changes from wet to dry e g wetlands lowlands dryland and sand poncecampos et al 2013 morecroft and woodward 1990 also found that the higher the humidity the lower the uwuep which supported our findings that the uwuep was higher than for the other two us grasslands mentioned above moreover the uwuep was higher under medium water stress than under severe water stress for vegetation therefore uwuep was estimated to be higher for the nmg site than for the other two sites mainly because of the climatic differences between the nmg semiarid region and the us var and us wlr sites humid climate region 3 5 variations in apparent uwue and t et to prolonged drought the variation in uwuea estimated as the linear regression slope using daily data 8 day intervals for et gpp and vpd was shown in fig 7 the results indicated that the linear regression slopes i e uwuea values varied under altered hydroclimatic conditions with values of 7 59 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o in 2003 fig 7a pre drought 6 50 0 44 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o during the drought period of 2004 2011 fig 7b i and 7 93 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o in 2012 fig 7j post drought there was a decrease in uwuea when drought initially occurred across the study area following a normal year fig 7a and b during the prolonged drought period there was no significant variation in uwuea with an exception of 2007 2008 fig 7b i these results illustrated that increases in the frequency and duration of drought did not necessarily lead to significant changes in ecosystem uwuea but the increasing severity of drought especially extreme drought following a continuing drought reduced uwuea fig 7e and f in the humid wet year following prolonged drought high precipitation increased the ecosystem uwuea resulting from replenishment of soil water available for vegetation growth fig 7j the corresponding annual t et ratios were in the range of 0 46 0 62 the estimated annual t et during the period of 2003 2012 was 0 53 0 05 0 59 in the pre drought year 0 51 0 03 during the prolonged drought period and 0 62 in the post drought year the t et ratio decreased when moderate drought occurred across the study area indicating that soil evaporation was the main contributor to the increase in et as the drought was more severe and persistent the t et basically remained constant then fell to its minimum value during and following the extreme drought the t et ratio returned to normal or even higher levels during the increase in water availability after the prolonged drought the estimated annual t et ratio 0 53 0 05 during the study period was slightly lower than those reported by zhou et al 2016 t et ratio of 0 56 0 05 and schlesinger and jasechko 2014 t et ratio of 0 57 0 19 4 discussion 4 1 contributions of precipitation and temperature to drought to identify the contributions of precipitation and temperature to prolonged drought we analyzed interannual variations in annual precipitation and mean temperature over the past 50 years as shown in fig 8 increases in precipitation deficits and mean temperature immediately led to increases in the frequency magnitude and duration of droughts the anomalies in precipitation and temperature indicated that alternation of water deficit and water surplus was frequent in the study area and that the study area has experienced continuous warming since the 2000s hence increases in the duration and severity of droughts since the 2000s resulted from the joint actions of increasing air temperature and decreasing precipitation the mean annual precipitation of 246 28 mm yr 1 during 2004 2011 prolonged drought was significantly lower than that during 1990 1997 average precipitation conditions 320 47 mm yr 1 it was also lower than the long term 50 yr average precipitation of 292 50 mm yr 1 the mean temperature was different significantly among decades warming from 0 90 0 57 c in 1961 1980 to 1 97 0 80 c in 1981 2015 the mean temperature of 2 41 0 69 c during the prolonged drought period was higher than that of 1 58 0 89 c over the last 50 years indicating that more regions experienced warming close to 1 c the variation in precipitation during the growing season explained 86 7 0 03 of annual precipitation in the last 50 years fig 8b and c precipitation during the growing season showed patterns of increases to decreases after the 1980s which differed from patterns during the non growing season during the non growing season the variation in mean temperature was in good agreement with average annual change indicating that temperature variation in the non growing season controlled annual mean temperature furthermore the mean temperatures increased significantly both in the growing season and the non growing season especially after 2000 p 0 05 overall the study area experienced consecutive droughts from 2004 to 2011 because of prolonged higher temperatures and less precipitation since 2000 although the highest mean precipitation in the non growing season appeared in 2008 2010 4 2 changing responses of agb and et partitioning to prolonged drought the climatic and surface controls of t et add complexity to the description of patterns of t et schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang et al 2014 scanlon and kustas 2012 reported that vegetation was a first order factor affecting et partitioning the lai as a key proxy of vegetation morphology was found to be positively related to t good et al 2014 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 we detected correlations between the annual t et ratios and precipitation temperature lai and estimated agb fig 9 a d the t et ratio was most strongly correlated with agb r2 0 80 p 1 0 followed by lai r2 0 58 p 0 01 across the study area during the growing season the correlation coefficient was relatively low for the relationship between t et ratio and precipitation r2 0 49 p 0 05 and the lowest for the relationship between the t et ratio and air temperature r2 0 31 p 0 1 the significant positive correlation between precipitation and t et indicated that precipitation controlled increases in lai and t et mainly via its effect to supply soil relative humidity rd wang et al 2014 we also found that the t et became larger as the agb and lai increased therefore agb or evi lai as well as some climatic variables precipitation or rd were most likely to reflect the variation in t et across the study area during the prolonged drought period to further explore the response of et partitioning to prolonged drought we plotted the interannual variations in agb et and the annual t et ratio under altered hydroclimatic conditions fig 10 the average t et ratio was lower during the study period of 2003 2012 0 55 0 06 than in the pre drought 0 65 and post drought years 0 72 vegetation growth i e agb was also responsive to altered hydroclimatic conditions according to the variations in agb this study divided the study period 2003 2012 into three stages ecosystem maintenance stage 1 ecosystem degradation stage 2 and ecosystem recovery stage 3 to further examine the response of vegetation growth to drought stress in different climates in the first stage the agb decreased from its pre drought value when moderate drought hit across the study area this revealed that the vegetation rapidly responded to changing water availability and that the ecosystem was sensitive to hydroclimatic disturbance vicente serrano et al 2013 the t would decrease since the water use efficiency increased to sustain productivity in that year thus the corresponding t et ratio decreased mainly owing to an increase in et which might imply an increase in soil evaporation with the persistent drought between 2005 and 2006 the variation in agb was only slightly linked to drought intensity indicating weak sensitivity of vegetation to consecutive drought continuous water loss contributed to the slight increase in the t et ratio indicating that soil evaporation loss was greater than that from plant transpiration additionally this result might be explained by the fact that the ecosystem could sustain vegetation growth by decreasing t i e increasing wue as reflected by the sharp decrease in et from 2005 to 2006 poncecampos et al 2013 on the basis of these results we concluded that at the first stage grassland ecosystem exhibited an ability to recover from disturbances and sustain productivity through self regulation to a certain extent in the second stage both agb and the t et ratio decreased when extreme drought occurred in 2007 that is the vegetation decreased in the study area under extreme drought knapp and smith 2001 reported that extreme drought resulted in plant dieback and mortality on the basis of the climatic conditions in 2007 fig 9 we suggested that this degradation was mainly caused by continuous water stress with the least precipitation and highest temperatures although precipitation was higher during the non growing season in 2008 than in the previous years the ecosystem continued to show the lowest agb levels without recovery thus the extreme drought at this stage decreased grassland productivity potentially resulting in vegetation mortality knapp and smith 2001 and the break down of its self regulating capacity he et al 2018 changes in the self regulating capacity of the ecosystem might result from a shift in species composition like that reported poncecampos et al 2013 during the third stage from 2009 to 2012 the increase in precipitation during the non growing season alleviated water stress for vegetation growth fig 8c both the agb and et increased indicating that more moisture was available for vegetation to support plant transpiration and soil evaporation the increases in the agb and et were accompanied by a corresponding increase in t et indicating vegetation had resumed growing by 2012 poncecampos et al 2013 in the humid year of 2012 following consecutive drought precipitation pulses vastly alleviated water deficits and increased soil water storage availability for ecosystem recovery thus the agb t et ratio and et increased to reach their maximum values in the third stage these results revealed the different responses of grassland ecosystems to altered hydroclimatic conditions by exploring the variation in t et to prolonged drought extreme drought during prolonged droughts would likely degenerate the ecosystem showing an obvious reduction in vegetation productivity thus our results indicated that the semiarid grassland ecosystem was sensitive to drought stress and had an ability to rapid recover with an increase in water availability 4 3 uncertainty and limitations in this study we examined the responses of et components to prolonged drought for grassland ecosystem based on the uwue method however there are some limitations and uncertainties first the uncertainties derived from in situ et and gpp measurements were not considered although they are commonly used as a benchmark to validate satellite based corresponding products yu et al 2006 lin 2015 natural vegetation often is less than homogeneous both vertically and horizontally so the vegetation characteristics in a flux site may not be representative of the vegetation of interest especially for a large region rana and katerji 2000 additionally the limited source area of the flux site mismatched with the satellite based pixels 500 and 1000 m these factors resulted in uncertainties in the validation of satellite based products to a certain extent another important constraint stemmed from field sampled biomass we have not considered the differences in these species in the sampling survey but assumed that all had an equal importance thus the agb may have been overestimated by the inversion model related to the evi second we found some degree of uncertainty in the corrected modis gpp and et estimates even though the satellite based estimates corrected against the corresponding measurements at the in situ level provided acceptable accuracy fig 2 in this study after corrections for modis et and gpp estimates corrected et values were approximately identical to measured values whereas the corrected gpp estimates still underestimated by 8 7 consequently both uwuep and uwuea were underestimated by 8 7 according to the eqs 15 and 16 third in our analyses we assumed a constant uwuep across all years in the study area zhou et al 2016 however the uwuep may be expected to change dramatically due to the extreme drought and or vegetation changes zhou et al 2014 2016 thus we tested this assumption by analyzing the difference between uwuep in each year and its long term average fig 6 and found that there were certain discrepancies in the annual uwuep during 2003 2012 the greatest departures of uwuep values from the average were around 10 in a humid and following an extreme drought year fig 6 according to zhou et al 2016 this relative small variation in uwuep may not induce large uncertainties in et partitioning and therefore the uwue method to estimate et partitioning could be used in our research area on the other hand additional data for more years are necessary to explore the possible changes in uwuep considering the expected drought in future in most of the published studies there were significant uncertainties around the contribution of t to et i e t et reflected by the wide range of t et values good et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 to quantitatively evaluate the difference resulting from the t et we compared the t et values in this study with those reported in the literature the assumption that t will be equal to et during the growing season with high vegetation cover may be imprecise because vegetation is relatively sparse and soil evaporation cannot be ignored in the study area consequently the uwuep may be underestimated and t et overestimated 5 conclusion we explored the responses of et partitioning to prolonged droughts based on ec measurements and modis estimates using the uwue method proposed by zhou et al 2014 2016 and identified the factors controlling t et prolonged drought during 2004 2011 substantially restricted vegetation growth and reduced grassland productivity further changed the contributions of the two components to et the t et ratio was well represented by agb lai and precipitation under long lasting and warming drought conditions the response of t et also indicated that the ecosystem was able to resist the drought disturbance and retain vegetation growth during the initial period of drought when extreme drought hit the decrease in t et demonstrated that the ecosystem was unable to sustain productivity due to an obvious reduction in water availability in the humid years following prolonged drought an increase in the t et ratio represented recovery of the ecosystem our results highlight the need to understand the major flux processes i e e t and et under prolonged drought conditions and the factors controlling et in a semiarid grassland these findings will improve our understanding of the specific responses of the grassland ecosystem to prolonged droughts acknowledgements this study was supported by the

7174,in this work we propose a mathematical model within a dynamic optimization framework to address the management of a salt lake in a semiarid region in argentina chasicó lake the main objective is to elaborate strategies to control recurrent floods and keep salinity values around the physiological optimum for the high commercial value fish silverside the model comprises dynamic mass balances for water and salt as well as evaporation calculation based on energy and momentum balances on a daily basis a collection of meteorological and hydraulic data in the basin for several decades and bathymetric information is included the simulation of different scenarios with historical data provide a deeper insight into the ecohydrological dynamics of chasicó lake basin model predictions under moderate drought conditions with rainfall about 70 of the historic average show a large increase in salinity after three years under that setting this would induce drastic changes in ecological conditions producing fish mass mortality what likely occurred repeatedly throughout the lake s history since such dry periods occurred repeatedly during the analyzed 1911 2016 period the comparison between drought and wet scenarios indicates a differential vulnerability dynamics in which the system shows less resistance to the effects of drought than to those due to floods the proposed model allows the determination of optimal lake tributary diversion flowrate to prevent flooding of croplands keeping lake salinity within optimal values for silverside and providing water for the creation of wetlands for wildlife and an artificial reservoir for alleviation of wet period effects keywords ecohydrological management sustainability mathematical model dynamic optimization salt lake control problem 1 introduction climate change will likely increase the frequency of floods and droughts and result in a new balance of water in salt lakes for this reason there might be alternating drought and wet periods affecting their hydrological dynamics and consequently the socioeconomic activities throughout the basin jellison et al 2008 during wet phases nearby fields can be affected by floods which cause damage due to soil salinisation and alkalinisation in drought periods dust storms together with salt accumulation on the lake shore and its dispersion over croplands affect land productivity aghakouchak et al 2015 damage can vary from superficial salt layers to complete soil restructuration taboada et al 2009 a large number of permanent salt lakes have decreased in size and increased in salinity jellison et al 2008 oren et al 2010 shadkam et al 2016 which is generally associated to drought periods hydrological uncertainty and shifting baselines should be considered as a key criterion in the management of salt lakes kopprio et al 2014 therefore the identification of the hydrologic components and driving forces behind this problem is the first step to develop useful tools for decision making in the management of these ecologically highly sensitive and socioeconomically vulnerable systems yihdego and webb 2012 the ecohydrology concept was developed within the framework of the unesco international hydrological programme ihp v zalewski et al 1997 and is defined as an integrative science focused on the effects of hydrological processes on the biotic processes and vice versa in freshwater and coastal zone ecosystems zalewski 2002 its methodological principle is the use of ecosystem properties for water management where the whole catchment is conceptualized as a superorganism possessing ecological resilience and resistance to stress wolanski et al 2004 kopprio et al 2014 salt lakes are typical of arid and semiarid zones where annual evaporation exceeds rainfall or runoff they are particularly vulnerable to climatic changes and salt and water levels can reach critical values in response to regime oscillations troin et al 2010 marjani and jamali 2014 in particular large area variations were reported for chasicó lake a salt lake in the semiarid southwest buenos aires province argentina throughout the last decades berasain et al 2014 volpedo and fernandez 2013 the increased evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures the uncertainty of climate projections and the interaction with global acting phenomena e g enso oscillations contribute to the fact that this region will be likely more endangered by mid to long term droughts kopprio et al 2014 for several decades a few authors have addressed the estimation of superficial and groundwater flows evaporation salt and water storage from different lakes to plan management strategies hutchison and midgley 1978 formulated a mathematical model for an estuary shallow lake they simulated climatic fluctuation and human activity showing that its interference on the ecology of the system is reflected in salinity levels tyler et al 1997 calculated evaporation of owens lake as the fundamental part of drought management planning in california several studies were carried out to analyse how climatic variables and river flowrates influence water storage in lakes haghighi and kløve 2015 more recently rusuli et al 2015 proposed a model comprising water and salt balances with a dynamic approach to estimate potential contributions of natural and socio economic factors to variations in the lake s level and salinity the study showed that increasingly efficient water management practices and better conservation of water resources are required to preserve bosten lake and its ecosystem in the semi arid or desert climate prevailing in xinjiang china shadkam et al 2016 used a simulation model to plan mitigation measures against the effects of drought on urmia lake iran in a scenario of climate change stan et al 2016 calculated evaporation and evapotranspiration for căldăruşani lake romania using statistical and mathematical methods however few authors formulated lake management problems as optimal control problems estrada et al 2009 2011 and rodriguez reartes et al 2016 addressed the restoration of eutrophic lakes in argentina paso de las piedras reservoir and los molinos lake respectively as optimal control problems through the formulation of lake ecological models within a dynamic optimization framework barjas et al 2010 and uysal et al 2016 proposed hydrological models for flood management in freshwater reservoirs during short term operations furthermore di maggio et al 2015 proposed an integrated management of lakes and artificial wetlands through the application of dynamic optimization strategies in recent work kopprio et al 2014 proposed a conceptual ecohydrological management model for chasicó lake in argentina stabilization of salinity values at the physiological optimum for the high commercial value fish odontesthes bonariensis silverside requires the damping of hydrological oscillations due to droughts or floods which can be achieved by constructing a system of alleviation channels and reservoirs linked to chasicó basin kopprio et al 2010 the damping of hydrological oscillations enables a more stable situation that can allow long term planning lower investment risk and more sustainable economic development in this work we propose a mathematical model by formulating dynamic mass balances for water and salt together with evaporation calculation to understand and help predict hydraulic dynamics in chasicó lake the model quantifies the key meteorological and hydrological variables and their potential impacts on chasicó lake volume and salinity which in turn affect its most important economic income the sports fisheries of silverside further this model is formulated within a dynamic optimization framework as an optimal control problem which allows water management planning to mitigate recurrent floods and reduce the vulnerability of the o bonariensis population in chasicó lake the paper also includes a detailed collection of meteorological and hydraulic data in the basin as well as lake volume determination through two bathymetries carried out in 2008 and 2016 respectively 2 methods and data 2 1 study site chasicó lake is located in a depression 20 m below sea level in the southwest of the chaco pampean plain 38 38 s 63 03 w the maximum and average depths of this water body are 13 2 and 8 m respectively it shows some differences from the typical pampean shallow lakes namely its tectonic and eolic origin greater depth and high salinity volpedo and fernandez 2013 this lake belongs to an endorheic basin of about 3765 km2 and a northeast to southwest development see fig 1 its hydrological limits are sauce chico stream to the east pigüe stream to the north and a flooded zone to the southwest bonorino et al 1989 the climate is semiarid and precipitations decrease from northeast to southwest along the basin viglizzo and frank 2006 diovisalvi et al 2015 which begins in sierras de curamaral part of the ventania system the drainage of these mountains is through the streams cochenleufú grande and chico aguas blancas and alfalfa which flow into the los chilenos lake source of the chasicó river in the middle basin san roman pelicurá and sanquiló streams are tributaries to chasicó river which in turn is the only tributary to chasicó lake fiorentino and paoloni 2001 the hydrologic regime of this basin is closely related to climatic conditions with decadal dry and humid cycles mariño et al 1988 viglizzo and frank 2006 d ambrosio et al 2013 during the humid stage heavy rainfall over the upper basin causes the natural overflow of los chilenos lake to the chasicó river and consequently to chasicó lake as the final recipient of the basin during dry cycles when the los chilenos lake acts as a natural reservoir temporarily interrupting the water outflow through chasicó river there is a significant decrease in the river contribution to chasicó lake since it only receives tributaries from the lower middle basin see fig 1 this basin integration disconnection process directly affects the volume and area of chasicó lake and its physico chemical characteristics during the last century there were flood events in 1918 1923 1924 1976 1978 1983 1993 2001 and 2002 alternating with dry periods during 1930 1970 and 2006 2014 herzer 2003 viglizzo and frank 2006 lara 2006 salinity values in the lake during the last fifty years ranged from 100 g l 1 1963 to 16 g l 1 1993 the wide variation in salinity and lake extension is the result of natural periods of drought

meat is exported and there are silverside hatcheries in countries like japan colautti et al 2006 berasain 2016 this economic resource is threatened due to the large variability of salinity in chasicó lake kopprio et al 2010 the severe impact that droughts and floods cause to inland water resources and to the associated socioeconomic activities requires close monitoring of this and other threatened pampean lakes drought is considered as one of the most complex and least understood of all natural hazards affecting more people than any other climate event shahbazbegian and bagheri 2010 2 2 meteorological and hydraulic data meteorological and hydraulic data were obtained from different sources rainfall data for the 1911 2016 period in the upper basin were taken from a meteorological

considered for model validation 2008 2016 regarding groundwater bonorino et al 1989 showed that the average input from groundwater is around 24 of precipitations over the lake area for a long term estimation of groundwater contribution to the chasicó lake water budget we collected precipitation data in the lake area from two inta meteorological stations médanos and ascasubi 38 s 62 w and 39 s

usa operating at 50 and 200 khz frequencies the echosounder low frequency 50 khz was employed in order to penetrate superficial sediment layer and also to differentiate soft sediments fluid mud from

bonorino et al 1989 2 4 2 optimal control problem in this work we formulate an optimal control problem to manage the water resource during wet periods not only to prevent flooding of the nearby fields but also to address an important ecological and economic problem the maintenance of optimal environmental conditions for silverside the goal is to keep lake salinity cs around a desired value of 23 kg m 3 considered as optimal for silverside reproduction while fulfilling the differential algebraic equations dae model presented in the preceding section the resulting optimisation problem is as follows 19 m i n z q o u t t 0 tf c s t 23 2 d t s t dae hydrological model eqs 1 18 cs 0 c s 0 v 0 v 0 c s l c s t c s u v l v t v u q river t q in t q out t where cs 0 corresponds to initial

river flowrate that actually enters chasicó lake finally q out t is the diverted flowrate to a nearby reservoir to keep salinity around the desired value in a wet scenario and is the problem optimisation variable degree of freedom of the optimisation problem 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 volume calculation two bathymetric surveys were carried out in chasicó lake the first one was performed in march 2008 and the second one in march 2016 in this study ten crosses between transects from both surveys were used in order to determine consistency and variation in water level height differences between both surveys showed a decrease in water height of 1 68 m between 2008 and 2016 by digitizing the edge of the lake through a landsat tm satellite image taken in march 2008 the 0 m height was determined chasicó lake area was calculated from this image and together with the bathymetric data the lake volume was computed by using the software surfer v8 applying extended simpson method the calculated lake volume was 448 3 0 05 hm3 in march 2008 and 323 7 0 05 hm3 in march 2016 fig 2 shows the lake bathymetric map fig 3 shows lake area and volume as function of water height in the 2016 bathymetry it can be seen that at heights below 11 5 m lake volume and area smoothly increase with height however between 11 5 and 12 m height there is a steep increase in lake area 40 ca 1800 hm2 corresponding to the flooding of a shallow sector part of which has developed within few years into an extended highly diverse natural wetland supporting a large bird population for water height above 12 m lake area remains constant with further volume increase due to geomorphological constraints given by dune barriers 3 2 meteorological and salinity data analysis fig 4 shows available data for rainfall annual variability on a nearby meteorological station inta bordenave 50 km away from chasicó lake during a 56 year period 1960 2016 the median value for this period is 680 mm average value is 718 194 mm during the 1960 1970 a drought phase precipitations were below the average with 590 110 mm 18 lower than the average there were floods during the mid 1970 s 1976 1978 in 1982 1985 1991 1992 and 1998 2001 when precipitations were 25 58 above the period average values fig 5 shows precipitation data on the upper basin inta bordenave for a 105 year period 1911 2016 with average of 675 182 mm yr 1 and median of 647 mm between 1930 and 1960 the chasicó catchment went through an extended drought period when rainfall was below the average with ten years having a mean annual value of 450 mm after 1960 there was an increase in rainfall with associated flooding annual average 720 mm with three years having an annual rainfall of 900 mm in correspondence with floods in mid 70 s in 2005 2013 a short drought occurred again annual average in the period 590 mm with six years having a mean value of 450 mm fig 6 shows a diagram for rainfall evaporation data in drought and floods years along the period 1960 2016 typical yearly average river discharges were 5 4 4 and 89 5 53 hm3 for drought and flood years respectively to assess annual evaporation to precipitations ratio in the period 1960 2016 we have further grouped years according to annual precipitations as very dry vd dry d normal n wet w and very wet vw as shown in table 2 evaporation ranged from 925 to 1145 mm while precipitations ranged from 445 and 1077 mm the correlation between grouped average precipitations and evaporation for the 1960 2016 period is as follows r2 0 99 n 5 p 0 01 20 y 7 1 0 7 x 3 2 1 0 2 x 2 1 889 x 1609 2 where y stands for annual precipitations mm and x corresponds to annual evaporation mm fig 7 shows that evaporation is almost three times precipitation values during drought periods total salt mass ms in the lake is calculated based on total volume estimation from a 2008 bathymetry and 2008 salinity values eq 4 where v is 4 483 108 m3 this work and cs is 23 1 kg m 3 kopprio et al 2014 total salt mass is 1 035 107 ton and is assumed constant due to the fact that inflows from the tributary and groundwater correspond to freshwater puntoriero et al 2015 showed that the chemical composition of chasicó lake is close to that of seawater and is mainly controlled by the crystallization evaporation process 3 3 mathematical model validation the proposed hydrological model eqs 1 18 is validated with field data for the period 2008 2016 for which a complete data set for all relevant variables was available forcing functions in the model were obtained as correlations based on experimental data main model output variables daily lake volume salinity and evaporation are in agreement with the corresponding field data as detailed in the following sections 3 3 1 meteorological variables as model forcing functions meteorological variable profiles in the 2008 2016 period including precipitation l d 1 m 2 air mean daily temperature c net radiation ly d 1 wind speed km d 1 relative humidity as well as chasicó river flowrate are provided as forcing functions in the mathematical model fig 8 a e show collected data and correlations obtained in this work rainfall temperature net radiation wind speed and relative humidity are represented by fourier series chasicó river flowrate is represented by piecewise polynomials and its variability was between 5 6 106 and 1 6 108 l d 1 0 06 and 1 85 m3 s 1 with increasing flowrate due to strong precipitations during 2014 2016 groundwater flowrate is calculated as 24 of rainfall on chasicó lake bonorino et al 1989 3 3 2 model validation in the period 2008 2016 we implemented the differential algebraic dae model represented by eqs 1 18 in an equation oriented environment gproms ps enterprise 2017 the time horizon is nine years 2008 2016 with initial conditions v 2008 4 483 108 m3 cs 2008 23 1 kg m 3 fig 9 shows chasicó lake volume profile along the analysed time horizon it can be seen that the predicted volume for 2016 is in close agreement with the experimental value determined by the 2016 bathymetry 3 43 108 m3 with a relative error lower than 4 calculated lake volume variations are in agreement with rainfall and salinity data registered during the period regarding salt concentration fig 10 shows chasicó lake salinity predicted profile in the period 2008 2016 as well as reported salinity values kopprio 2013 berasain et al 2014 puntoriero et al 2015 in this case there is also good agreement between experimental data and model results even taking into account that measured salinity values were obtained from different sources the largest relative error is 11 3 in september 2014 calculated evaporation profiles are shown in fig 11 the average value for the period 2008 2016 is 1182 11 l d 1 m 2 while accumulated evaporation throughout this time horizon is 5 74 108 l 57 4 hm3 table 3 reports annual evaporation and precipitation balances showing that annual evaporation is always higher than annual precipitations in the period 2008 2016 this fact highlights the importance of chasicó river contribution to the lake for maintaining appropriate and stable ecohydrological conditions for aquatic biota tweed et al 2011 evaluate the response of saline lakes to severe droughts and conclude that in lakes with similar characteristics to chasicó salinity is mostly controlled by evaporation there are several estimation methods for evaporation rate of lakes januario dos reis and dias 1998 penman equation 1948 is appropriate for evaporation estimation in chasicó lake because it includes wind speed data which is a predominant climatic factor in the studied geographic area viglizzo et al 1997 as it can be seen in table 3 throughout the 2008 2016 period annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation resulting in a decrease of 29 of the lake volume and in an increase of 39 in its salinity the resulting salinity value of 32 kg m 3 largely exceeds optimal conditions 17 23 kg m 3 for the development of silverside at its younger stages chasicó lake has evaporation rates of 1 2 0 01 m yr 1 similar estimations for dead sea range from 1 05 to 2 m yr 1 stanhill 1994 salameh and el naser 1999 and 1 1 1 2 m yr 1 lensky et al 2005 although chasicó and dead sea are in different climatic regions semi arid and arid respectively evaporation values are similar it is important to point out that the mathematical model formulated in this work provides good estimates of daily evaporation rates and the daily evolution of the lake volume and salinity 3 4 analysis of drought and flood cases 3 4 1 drought scenario after validating the model with field data we analysed different scenarios including drought and flood periods as a first step we considered a drought period of eight years with initial conditions v 2 2 108 m3 cs 44 kg m 3 these conditions correspond to calculated values for 2014 when chasicó lake had the lowest volume and highest salinity for the analysed period 2008 2016 see figs 9 and 10 fig 12 shows precipitation correlations piecewise polynomials repeatedly taking the annual profiles of 2008 and evaporation profiles calculated for that year these profiles render average annual precipitations of 500 mm and an annual accumulated evaporation of 1200 mm profiles shown in fig 12 a in this case the river average flowrate is 1 6 106 l d 1 range 0 024 0 3 m3 s 1 profiles for these forcing functions are shown in fig 12 b model predictions show a large increase in salinity reaching up to 112 g l 1 at the end of the time horizon fig 13 dotted line this situation is similar to the one reported in 1963 with 100 g l 1 salt concentration in the lake kopprio 2013 chasicó lake volume profile is also shown in fig 13 with a final value of 84 hm3 it is important to remark that salinity reaches an extremely high value of 70 kg m 3 already after 4 years under these precipitation and evaporation conditions which occurred repeatedly during the 1911 2016 period fig 5 thus recurrent drastic changes in ecological conditions with fish mass mortality likely occurred repeatedly throughout the lake s history and are probably registered in its sedimentary record 3 4 2 flood scenario as a second step we simulated a nine year slightly wet period in which annual precipitations are around 700 mm and average annual accumulated evaporation is approximately 900 mm fig 14 shows rainfall and evaporation profiles for this scenario initial conditions for volume and salinity correspond to 2016 they are 343 hm3 and 33 kg m 3 respectively the maximum river flowrate is 4 1 108 l d 1 4 7 m3 s 1 in this case model predictions provide a final salinity value of 19 kg m 3 as shown in fig 15 with a corresponding volume increase to 560 hm3 at the end of the time horizon this situation represents a flooding case similar to the one that occurred in 1976 negative evaporation values indicate condensation of atmospheric moisture the simulation of different scenarios with historical data allowed a deeper insight into the ecohydrological dynamics of chasicó lake basin as well as the identification of the main variables that dominate the water system this tool is the basis to plan strategies for the ecosystem services management the comparison between drought and wet scenarios shows a differential vulnerability dynamics the system shows less resistance to the effects of drought than to those due to floods the simulation of a dry scenario shows that starting from an initial salinity value of 44 kg m 3 2014 2015 conditions three consecutive dry years are enough for the lake to reach a salinity value of 60 kg m 3 a situation that would severely affect sports fishing in addition to causing other serious ecological problems such as eutrophication cyanobacteria blooms anoxia and fish kills kopprio et al 2014 on the other hand within the simulated hypothetical slightly wet scenario it would take 5 5 years for the lake to overflow and flood the nearby fields 3 5 flood management as an optimal control problem to prevent flooding during wet periods recent projects proposed the construction of a derivation channel connecting chasicó river to the bahía blanca estuary through the vidriera salitral more sustainable approaches for this semiarid region involve the construction of a dam reservoir system thus allowing a more rational use of freshwater as well as preventing further cropland flooding overflow of the lake and flooding of the neighbouring saltworks kopprio et al 2014 another issue associated to the lake economic value is related to silverside sports fishing in this sense salinity values around 23 kg m 3 are considered as optimal for silverside reproduction tsuzuki et al 2000 this value corresponds to an approximate lake volume of 480 hm3 which is a desired target in this work we address the management of the water resource by formulating the dynamic optimisation problem proposed in section 2 4 2 eq 19 to keep lake salinity cs around a value of 23 kg m 3 as the objective function the control variable is the portion of the tributary that is diverted in this way when salt concentration is below 23 kg m 3 a fraction of chasicó river is diverted through an alleviation channel the control interval is 30 days fig 16 a shows optimization results for chasicó river profile and the diverted stream flowrate profile as well as the river profile without management this figure shows that no diversion is required in the wet scenario until the fifth year of the time horizon fig 16 b shows a detail of that period furthermore water diverted from chasicó river during the last four years in the time horizon could be accumulated within a reservoir of 9 km2 fixed area and final depth of 6 42 m and used for crop irrigation livestock watering or to maintain lake salinity at low values in drought periods optimal volume and salinity lake profiles for this case are shown in fig 17 a and b respectively it can be seen that diverting a fraction of the river keeps salinity values close to 23 kg m 3 and the lake volume around 480 hm3 this strategy does not only preserve the fishing resource of odontesthes bonariensis but also avoids flooding of the nearby village and the surrounding farms finally we consider the same time horizon of nine years with control intervals of 15 and 7 days respectively in the preceding analysis we considered 30 days there are slight changes in numerical results figs 18 and 19 show main variable profiles for the last year after the application of management strategies throughout the entire period fig 18 a shows precipitations and evaporation profiles in this year the accumulated annual rainfall is 658 03 mm and accumulated evaporation is 1048 78 mm fig 18 b shows chasicó river profile forcing function and diverted flowrate control variable with control intervals of 30 15 and 7 days length respectively fig 19 a shows lake volume profiles it can be seen that volume values without control during the nine year period are between 535 hm3 and 570 hm3 while these values range between 480 and 499 hm3 after optimization with control interval of 30 days when considering control intervals of 15 and 7 days volume values range between 470 and 486 hm3 being closer to the desired volume of 480 hm3 fig 19 b shows that salinity values in this period vary between 19 5 and 20 5 kg l 1 without control and they are between 21 8 and 22 9 kg l 1 when river diversion is carried out as management strategy with control interval length of 30 days with control intervals of 7 and 15 days salinity values range between 22 6 and 23 4 kg l 1 fig 17 b keeping closer to the target value 23 kg l 1 current work deals with the scaling up of the proposed ecohydrological approach to basin level aiming to increase the resilience of the river lake system to climate change through the damping of hydrological oscillations preservation of environmental flows and connectivity between water bodies a network of interconnected channels dams and small lakes will be used to link and regulate constructed wetlands kopprio et al 2014 according to needs for fish nursery and migration nutrient retention and wildlife diversity 4 conclusions climate sensitivity of pampean lakes is related to the fact that even moderate climate driven changes cause severe hydrological changes that affect the biota and bring about severe problems like floods hypersalinisation and loss of economic resources in this flat windy and semiarid environmental setting in this work we propose a mathematical model for a salt pampean lake chasicó which provides a tool for management strategies chasicó lake volume depends on both its tributary flowrate and precipitations as well as upstream precipitation regime and groundwater flowrate the model is formulated within a dynamic optimization framework and allows the determination of optimal river diversion flowrate to prevent flooding of the nearby fields and to keep the lake salinity value within optimal values for silverside reproduction this issue is related to sports fishing an important economic ecosystem service provided by chasicó lake it can be seen that constant monitoring of the river flowrate is required when determining optimal management strategies to avoid floods and preserve the economic resource related to silverside sports fishing furthermore the diverted river stream can be stored within a reservoir and alleviation channels system can be a solution to flooding problems as well as creating environments for tourism and recreation additionally this reservoir can be a buffer for future drought scenarios acknowledgments authors greatly acknowledge the national research council

7174,in this work we propose a mathematical model within a dynamic optimization framework to address the management of a salt lake in a semiarid region in argentina chasicó lake the main objective is to elaborate strategies to control recurrent floods and keep salinity values around the physiological optimum for the high commercial value fish silverside the model comprises dynamic mass balances for water and salt as well as evaporation calculation based on energy and momentum balances on a daily basis a collection of meteorological and hydraulic data in the basin for several decades and bathymetric information is included the simulation of different scenarios with historical data provide a deeper insight into the ecohydrological dynamics of chasicó lake basin model predictions under moderate drought conditions with rainfall about 70 of the historic average show a large increase in salinity after three years under that setting this would induce drastic changes in ecological conditions producing fish mass mortality what likely occurred repeatedly throughout the lake s history since such dry periods occurred repeatedly during the analyzed 1911 2016 period the comparison between drought and wet scenarios indicates a differential vulnerability dynamics in which the system shows less resistance to the effects of drought than to those due to floods the proposed model allows the determination of optimal lake tributary diversion flowrate to prevent flooding of croplands keeping lake salinity within optimal values for silverside and providing water for the creation of wetlands for wildlife and an artificial reservoir for alleviation of wet period effects keywords ecohydrological management sustainability mathematical model dynamic optimization salt lake control problem 1 introduction climate change will likely increase the frequency of floods and droughts and result in a new balance of water in salt lakes for this reason there might be alternating drought and wet periods affecting their hydrological dynamics and consequently the socioeconomic activities throughout the basin jellison et al 2008 during wet phases nearby fields can be affected by floods which cause damage due to soil salinisation and alkalinisation in drought periods dust storms together with salt accumulation on the lake shore and its dispersion over croplands affect land productivity aghakouchak et al 2015 damage can vary from superficial salt layers to complete soil restructuration taboada et al 2009 a large number of permanent salt lakes have decreased in size and increased in salinity jellison et al 2008 oren et al 2010 shadkam et al 2016 which is generally associated to drought periods hydrological uncertainty and shifting baselines should be considered as a key criterion in the management of salt lakes kopprio et al 2014 therefore the identification of the hydrologic components and driving forces behind this problem is the first step to develop useful tools for decision making in the management of these ecologically highly sensitive and socioeconomically vulnerable systems yihdego and webb 2012 the ecohydrology concept was developed within the framework of the unesco international hydrological programme ihp v zalewski et al 1997 and is defined as an integrative science focused on the effects of hydrological processes on the biotic processes and vice versa in freshwater and coastal zone ecosystems zalewski 2002 its methodological principle is the use of ecosystem properties for water management where the whole catchment is conceptualized as a superorganism possessing ecological resilience and resistance to stress wolanski et al 2004 kopprio et al 2014 salt lakes are typical of arid and semiarid zones where annual evaporation exceeds rainfall or runoff they are particularly vulnerable to climatic changes and salt and water levels can reach critical values in response to regime oscillations troin et al 2010 marjani and jamali 2014 in particular large area variations were reported for chasicó lake a salt lake in the semiarid southwest buenos aires province argentina throughout the last decades berasain et al 2014 volpedo and fernandez 2013 the increased evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures the uncertainty of climate projections and the interaction with global acting phenomena e g enso oscillations contribute to the fact that this region will be likely more endangered by mid to long term droughts kopprio et al 2014 for several decades a few authors have addressed the estimation of superficial and groundwater flows evaporation salt and water storage from different lakes to plan management strategies hutchison and midgley 1978 formulated a mathematical model for an estuary shallow lake they simulated climatic fluctuation and human activity showing that its interference on the ecology of the system is reflected in salinity levels tyler et al 1997 calculated evaporation of owens lake as the fundamental part of drought management planning in california several studies were carried out to analyse how climatic variables and river flowrates influence water storage in lakes haghighi and kløve 2015 more recently rusuli et al 2015 proposed a model comprising water and salt balances with a dynamic approach to estimate potential contributions of natural and socio economic factors to variations in the lake s level and salinity the study showed that increasingly efficient water management practices and better conservation of water resources are required to preserve bosten lake and its ecosystem in the semi arid or desert climate prevailing in xinjiang china shadkam et al 2016 used a simulation model to plan mitigation measures against the effects of drought on urmia lake iran in a scenario of climate change stan et al 2016 calculated evaporation and evapotranspiration for căldăruşani lake romania using statistical and mathematical methods however few authors formulated lake management problems as optimal control problems estrada et al 2009 2011 and rodriguez reartes et al 2016 addressed the restoration of eutrophic lakes in argentina paso de las piedras reservoir and los molinos lake respectively as optimal control problems through the formulation of lake ecological models within a dynamic optimization framework barjas et al 2010 and uysal et al 2016 proposed hydrological models for flood management in freshwater reservoirs during short term operations furthermore di maggio et al 2015 proposed an integrated management of lakes and artificial wetlands through the application of dynamic optimization strategies in recent work kopprio et al 2014 proposed a conceptual ecohydrological management model for chasicó lake in argentina stabilization of salinity values at the physiological optimum for the high commercial value fish odontesthes bonariensis silverside requires the damping of hydrological oscillations due to droughts or floods which can be achieved by constructing a system of alleviation channels and reservoirs linked to chasicó basin kopprio et al 2010 the damping of hydrological oscillations enables a more stable situation that can allow long term planning lower investment risk and more sustainable economic development in this work we propose a mathematical model by formulating dynamic mass balances for water and salt together with evaporation calculation to understand and help predict hydraulic dynamics in chasicó lake the model quantifies the key meteorological and hydrological variables and their potential impacts on chasicó lake volume and salinity which in turn affect its most important economic income the sports fisheries of silverside further this model is formulated within a dynamic optimization framework as an optimal control problem which allows water management planning to mitigate recurrent floods and reduce the vulnerability of the o bonariensis population in chasicó lake the paper also includes a detailed collection of meteorological and hydraulic data in the basin as well as lake volume determination through two bathymetries carried out in 2008 and 2016 respectively 2 methods and data 2 1

respectively it shows some differences from the typical pampean shallow lakes namely its tectonic and eolic origin greater depth and high salinity volpedo and fernandez 2013 this lake belongs to an endorheic basin of about 3765 km2 and a northeast to southwest development see fig 1 its hydrological limits are sauce chico stream to the east pigüe stream to the north and a flooded zone to the southwest bonorino et al 1989 the climate is semiarid and precipitations decrease from northeast to southwest along the basin viglizzo and frank 2006 diovisalvi et al 2015 which begins in sierras de curamaral part of the ventania system the drainage of these mountains is through the streams cochenleufú grande and chico aguas blancas and alfalfa which flow into the los chilenos lake source of the chasicó river in the middle basin san roman pelicurá and sanquiló streams are tributaries to chasicó river which in turn is the only tributary to chasicó lake fiorentino and paoloni 2001 the hydrologic regime of this basin is closely related to climatic conditions with decadal dry and humid cycles mariño et al 1988 viglizzo and frank 2006 d ambrosio et al 2013 during the humid stage heavy rainfall over the upper basin causes the natural overflow of los chilenos lake to the chasicó river and consequently to chasicó lake as the final recipient of the basin during dry cycles when the los chilenos lake acts as a natural reservoir temporarily interrupting the water outflow through chasicó river there is a significant decrease in the river contribution to chasicó lake since it only receives tributaries from the lower middle basin see fig 1 this basin integration disconnection process directly affects the volume and area of chasicó lake and its physico chemical characteristics during the last century there were flood events in 1918 1923 1924 1976 1978 1983 1993 2001 and 2002 alternating with dry periods during 1930 1970 and 2006 2014 herzer 2003 viglizzo and frank 2006 lara 2006 salinity values in the lake during the last fifty years ranged from 100 g l 1 1963 to 16 g l 1 1993 the wide variation in salinity and lake extension is the result of natural periods of drought and flooding and is reflected on changes in water quality and biota kopprio et al 2010 2014 it also affects the economy of the region through losses in cropland area and investment uncertainty in relation to tourism and sport fishing of silverside odontesthes bonariensis this species has a high commercial value with a wide geographical distribution in argentina avigliano et al 2015 silverside meat is exported and there are silverside hatcheries in countries like japan colautti et al 2006 berasain 2016 this economic resource is threatened due to the large variability of salinity in chasicó lake kopprio et al 2010 the severe impact that droughts and floods cause to inland water resources and to the associated socioeconomic activities requires close monitoring of this and other threatened pampean lakes drought is considered as one of the most complex and least understood of all natural hazards affecting more people than any other climate event shahbazbegian and bagheri 2010 2 2 meteorological and hydraulic data meteorological and hydraulic data were obtained from different sources rainfall data for the 1911 2016 period in the upper basin were taken from a meteorological station from the national institute of agricultural technology inta located in bordenave town 37 48 s 63 02 w table 1 the annual historic average for this period is 674 mm data for average temperature average wind speed relative humidity at atmospheric pressure were taken from an inta meteorological station in ascasubi evaporation calculation from the free superficial water by period 2008 2016 was carried out with penman method 1948 based on the available daily data for these meteorological variables bonorino et al 1989 reported chasicó river flowrate data along the basin and throughout a period of one year 1986 1987 as data for chasicó river were only available for this period we used precipitation data in the upper basin to adjust chasicó river flowrate profiles along the period considered for model validation 2008 2016 regarding groundwater bonorino et al 1989 showed that the average input from groundwater is around 24 of precipitations over the lake area for a long term estimation of groundwater contribution to the chasicó lake water budget we collected precipitation data in the lake area from two inta meteorological stations médanos and ascasubi 38 s 62 w and 39 s

indicated periods are complete with daily data in this work most data were also used to develop correlations that were considered inputs for the mathematical model salinity values were used as initial value for model integration and for validation of model performance 2 3 volume calculation two bathymetric surveys were performed in chasicó lake with a digital echosounder bathy 500 mf from syqwest usa operating at 50 and 200 khz frequencies the echosounder low frequency 50 khz was employed in order to penetrate superficial sediment layer and also to differentiate soft sediments fluid mud from hard materials water height measurement error is lower than 0 1 m while data positioning was determined with a satloc usa gp with an error smaller than 5 m 2 4 mathematical modelling 2 4 1 simulation

bonorino et al 1989 2 4 2 optimal control problem in this work we formulate an optimal control problem to manage the water resource during wet periods not only to prevent flooding of the nearby fields but also to address an important ecological and economic problem the maintenance of optimal environmental conditions for silverside the goal is to keep lake salinity cs around a desired value of 23 kg m 3 considered as optimal for silverside reproduction while fulfilling the differential algebraic equations dae model presented in the preceding section the resulting optimisation problem is as follows 19 m i n z q o u t t 0 tf c s t 23 2 d t s t dae hydrological model eqs 1 18 cs 0 c s 0 v 0 v 0 c s l c s t c s u v l v t v u q river t q in t q out t where cs 0 corresponds to initial

river flowrate that actually enters chasicó lake finally q out t is the diverted flowrate to a nearby reservoir to keep salinity around the desired value in a wet scenario and is the problem optimisation variable degree of freedom of the optimisation problem 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 volume calculation two bathymetric surveys were carried out in chasicó lake the first one was performed in march 2008 and the second one in march 2016 in this study ten crosses between transects from both surveys were used in order to determine consistency and variation in water level height differences between both surveys showed a decrease in water height of 1 68 m between 2008 and 2016 by digitizing the edge of the lake through a landsat tm satellite image taken in march 2008 the 0 m height was determined chasicó lake area was calculated from this image and together with the bathymetric data the lake volume was computed by using the software surfer v8 applying extended simpson method the calculated lake volume was 448 3 0 05 hm3 in march 2008 and 323 7 0 05 hm3 in march 2016 fig 2 shows the lake bathymetric map fig 3 shows lake area and volume as function of water height in the 2016 bathymetry it can be seen that at heights below 11 5 m lake volume and area smoothly increase with height however between 11 5 and 12 m height there is a steep increase in lake area 40 ca 1800 hm2 corresponding to the flooding of a shallow sector part of which has developed within few years into an extended highly diverse natural wetland supporting a large bird population for water height above 12 m lake area remains constant with further volume increase due to geomorphological constraints given by dune barriers 3 2 meteorological and salinity data analysis fig 4 shows available data for rainfall annual variability on a nearby meteorological station inta bordenave 50 km away from chasicó lake during a 56 year period 1960 2016 the median value for this period is 680 mm average value is 718 194 mm during the 1960 1970 a drought phase precipitations were below the average with 590 110 mm 18 lower than the average there were floods during the mid 1970 s 1976 1978 in 1982 1985 1991 1992 and 1998 2001 when precipitations were 25 58 above the period average values fig 5 shows precipitation data on the upper basin inta bordenave for a 105 year period 1911 2016 with average of 675 182 mm yr 1 and median of 647 mm between 1930 and 1960 the chasicó catchment went through an extended drought period when rainfall was below the average with ten years having a mean annual value of 450 mm after 1960 there was an increase in rainfall with associated flooding annual average 720 mm with three years having an annual rainfall of 900 mm in correspondence with floods in mid 70 s in 2005 2013 a short drought occurred again annual average in the period 590 mm with six years having a mean value of 450 mm fig 6 shows a diagram for rainfall evaporation data in drought and floods years along the period 1960 2016 typical yearly average river discharges were 5 4 4 and 89 5 53 hm3 for drought and flood years respectively to assess annual evaporation to precipitations ratio in the period 1960 2016 we have further grouped years according to annual precipitations as very dry vd dry d normal n wet w and very wet vw as shown in table 2 evaporation ranged from 925 to 1145 mm while precipitations ranged from 445 and 1077 mm the correlation between grouped average precipitations and evaporation for the 1960 2016 period is as follows r2 0 99 n 5 p 0 01 20 y 7 1 0 7 x 3 2 1 0 2 x 2 1 889 x 1609 2 where y stands for annual precipitations mm and x corresponds to annual evaporation mm fig 7 shows that evaporation is almost three times precipitation values during drought periods total salt mass ms in the lake is calculated based on total volume estimation from a 2008 bathymetry and 2008 salinity values eq 4 where v is 4 483 108 m3 this work and cs is 23 1 kg m 3 kopprio et al 2014 total salt mass is 1 035 107 ton and is assumed constant due to the fact that inflows from the tributary and groundwater correspond to freshwater puntoriero et al 2015 showed that the chemical composition of chasicó lake is close to that of seawater and is mainly controlled by the crystallization evaporation process 3 3 mathematical model validation the proposed hydrological model eqs 1 18 is validated with field data for the period 2008 2016 for which a complete data set for all relevant variables was available forcing functions in the model were obtained as correlations based on experimental data main model output variables daily lake volume salinity and evaporation are in agreement with the corresponding field data as detailed in the following sections 3 3 1 meteorological variables as model forcing functions meteorological variable profiles in the 2008 2016 period including precipitation l d 1 m 2 air mean daily temperature c net radiation ly d 1 wind speed km d 1 relative humidity as well as chasicó river flowrate are provided as forcing functions in the mathematical model fig 8 a e show collected data and correlations obtained in this work rainfall temperature net radiation wind speed and relative humidity are represented by fourier series chasicó river flowrate is represented by piecewise polynomials and its variability was between 5 6 106 and 1 6 108 l d 1 0 06 and 1 85 m3 s 1 with increasing flowrate due to strong precipitations during 2014 2016 groundwater flowrate is calculated as 24 of rainfall on chasicó lake bonorino et al 1989 3 3 2 model validation in the period 2008 2016 we implemented the differential algebraic dae model represented by eqs 1 18 in an equation oriented environment gproms ps enterprise 2017 the time horizon is nine years 2008 2016 with initial conditions v 2008 4 483 108 m3 cs 2008 23 1 kg m 3 fig 9 shows chasicó lake volume profile along the analysed time horizon it can be seen that the predicted volume for 2016 is in close agreement with the experimental value determined by the 2016 bathymetry 3 43 108 m3 with a relative error lower than 4 calculated lake volume variations are in agreement with rainfall and salinity data registered during the period regarding salt concentration fig 10 shows chasicó lake salinity predicted profile in the period 2008 2016 as well as reported salinity values kopprio 2013 berasain et al 2014 puntoriero et al 2015 in this case there is also good agreement between experimental data and model results even taking into account that measured salinity values were obtained from different sources the largest relative error is 11 3 in september 2014 calculated evaporation profiles are shown in fig 11 the average value for the period 2008 2016 is 1182 11 l d 1 m 2 while accumulated evaporation throughout this time horizon is 5 74 108 l 57 4 hm3 table 3 reports annual evaporation and precipitation balances showing that annual evaporation is always higher than annual precipitations in the period 2008 2016 this fact highlights the importance of chasicó river contribution to the lake for maintaining appropriate and stable ecohydrological conditions for aquatic biota tweed et al 2011 evaluate the response of saline lakes to severe droughts and conclude that in lakes with similar characteristics to chasicó salinity is mostly controlled by evaporation there are several estimation methods for evaporation rate of lakes januario dos reis and dias 1998 penman equation 1948 is appropriate for evaporation estimation in chasicó lake because it includes wind speed data which is a predominant climatic factor in the studied geographic area viglizzo et al 1997 as it can be seen in table 3 throughout the 2008 2016 period annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation resulting in a decrease of 29 of the lake volume and in an increase of 39 in its salinity the resulting salinity value of 32 kg m 3 largely exceeds optimal conditions 17 23 kg m 3 for the development of silverside at its younger stages chasicó lake has evaporation rates of 1 2 0 01 m yr 1 similar estimations for dead sea range from 1 05 to 2 m yr 1 stanhill 1994 salameh and el naser 1999 and 1 1 1 2 m yr 1 lensky et al 2005 although chasicó and dead sea are in different climatic regions semi arid and arid respectively evaporation values are similar it is important to point out that the mathematical model formulated in this work provides good estimates of daily evaporation rates and the daily evolution of the lake volume and salinity 3 4 analysis of drought and flood cases 3 4 1 drought scenario after validating the model with field data we analysed different scenarios including drought and flood periods as a first step we considered a drought period of eight years with initial conditions v 2 2 108 m3 cs 44 kg m 3 these conditions correspond to calculated values for 2014 when chasicó lake had the lowest volume and highest salinity for the analysed period 2008 2016 see figs 9 and 10 fig 12 shows precipitation correlations piecewise polynomials repeatedly taking the annual profiles of 2008 and evaporation profiles calculated for that year these profiles render average annual precipitations of 500 mm and an annual accumulated evaporation of 1200 mm profiles shown in fig 12 a in this case the river average flowrate is 1 6 106 l d 1 range 0 024 0 3 m3 s 1 profiles for these forcing functions are shown in fig 12 b model predictions show a large increase in salinity reaching up to 112 g l 1 at the end of the time horizon fig 13 dotted line this situation is similar to the one reported in 1963 with 100 g l 1 salt concentration in the lake kopprio 2013 chasicó lake volume profile is also shown in fig 13 with a final value of 84 hm3 it is important to remark that salinity reaches an extremely high value of 70 kg m 3 already after 4 years under these precipitation and evaporation conditions which occurred repeatedly during the 1911 2016 period fig 5 thus recurrent drastic changes in ecological conditions with fish mass mortality likely occurred repeatedly throughout the lake s history and are probably registered in its sedimentary record 3 4 2 flood scenario as a second step we simulated a nine year slightly wet period in which annual precipitations are around 700 mm and average annual accumulated evaporation is approximately 900 mm fig 14 shows rainfall and evaporation profiles for this scenario initial conditions for volume and salinity correspond to 2016 they are 343 hm3 and 33 kg m 3 respectively the maximum river flowrate is 4 1 108 l d 1 4 7 m3 s 1 in this case model predictions provide a final salinity value of 19 kg m 3 as shown in fig 15 with a corresponding volume increase to 560 hm3 at the end of the time horizon this situation represents a flooding case similar to the one that occurred in 1976 negative evaporation values indicate condensation of atmospheric moisture the simulation of different scenarios with historical data allowed a deeper insight into the ecohydrological dynamics of chasicó lake basin as well as the identification of the main variables that dominate the water system this tool is the basis to plan strategies for the ecosystem services management the comparison between drought and wet scenarios shows a differential vulnerability dynamics the system shows less resistance to the effects of drought than to those due to floods the simulation of a dry scenario shows that starting from an initial salinity value of 44 kg m 3 2014 2015 conditions three consecutive dry years are enough for the lake to reach a salinity value of 60 kg m 3 a situation that would severely affect sports fishing in addition to causing other serious ecological problems such as eutrophication cyanobacteria blooms anoxia and fish kills kopprio et al 2014 on the other hand within the simulated hypothetical slightly wet scenario it would take 5 5 years for the lake to overflow and flood the nearby fields 3 5 flood management as an optimal control problem to prevent flooding during wet periods recent projects proposed the construction of a derivation channel connecting chasicó river to the bahía blanca estuary through the vidriera salitral more sustainable approaches for this semiarid region involve the construction of a dam reservoir system thus allowing a more rational use of freshwater as well as preventing further cropland flooding overflow of the lake and flooding of the neighbouring saltworks kopprio et al 2014 another issue associated to the lake economic value is related to silverside sports fishing in this sense salinity values around 23 kg m 3 are considered as optimal for silverside reproduction tsuzuki et al 2000 this value corresponds to an approximate lake volume of 480 hm3 which is a desired target in this work we address the management of the water resource by formulating the dynamic optimisation problem proposed in section 2 4 2 eq 19 to keep lake salinity cs around a value of 23 kg m 3 as the objective function the control variable is the portion of the tributary that is diverted in this way when salt concentration is below 23 kg m 3 a fraction of chasicó river is diverted through an alleviation channel the control interval is 30 days fig 16 a shows optimization results for chasicó river profile and the diverted stream flowrate profile as well as the river profile without management this figure shows that no diversion is required in the wet scenario until the fifth year of the time horizon fig 16 b shows a detail of that period furthermore water diverted from chasicó river during the last four years in the time horizon could be accumulated within a reservoir of 9 km2 fixed area and final depth of 6 42 m and used for crop irrigation livestock watering or to maintain lake salinity at low values in drought periods optimal volume and salinity lake profiles for this case are shown in fig 17 a and b respectively it can be seen that diverting a fraction of the river keeps salinity values close to 23 kg m 3 and the lake volume around 480 hm3 this strategy does not only preserve the fishing resource of odontesthes bonariensis but also avoids flooding of the nearby village and the surrounding farms finally we consider the same time horizon of nine years with control intervals of 15 and 7 days respectively in the preceding analysis we considered 30 days there are slight changes in numerical results figs 18 and 19 show main variable profiles for the last year after the application of management strategies throughout the entire period fig 18 a shows precipitations and evaporation profiles in this year the accumulated annual rainfall is 658 03 mm and accumulated evaporation is 1048 78 mm fig 18 b shows chasicó river profile forcing function and diverted flowrate control variable with control intervals of 30 15 and 7 days length respectively fig 19 a shows lake volume profiles it can be seen that volume values without control during the nine year period are between 535 hm3 and 570 hm3 while these values range between 480 and 499 hm3 after optimization with control interval of 30 days when considering control intervals of 15 and 7 days volume values range between 470 and 486 hm3 being closer to the desired volume of 480 hm3 fig 19 b shows that salinity values in this period vary between 19 5 and 20 5 kg l 1 without control and they are between 21 8 and 22 9 kg l 1 when river diversion is carried out as management strategy with control interval length of 30 days with control intervals of 7 and 15 days salinity values range between 22 6 and 23 4 kg l 1 fig 17 b keeping closer to the target value 23 kg l 1 current work deals with the scaling up of the proposed ecohydrological approach to basin level aiming to increase the resilience of the river lake system to climate change through the damping of hydrological oscillations preservation of environmental flows and connectivity between water bodies a network of interconnected channels dams and small lakes will be used to link and regulate constructed wetlands kopprio et al 2014 according to needs for fish nursery and migration nutrient retention and wildlife diversity 4 conclusions climate sensitivity of pampean lakes is related to the fact that even moderate climate driven changes cause severe hydrological changes that affect the biota and bring about severe problems like floods hypersalinisation and loss of economic resources in this flat windy and semiarid environmental setting in this work we propose a mathematical model for a salt pampean lake chasicó which provides a tool for management strategies chasicó lake volume depends on both its tributary flowrate and precipitations as well as upstream precipitation regime and groundwater flowrate the model is formulated within a dynamic optimization framework and allows the determination of optimal river diversion flowrate to prevent flooding of the nearby fields and to keep the lake salinity value within optimal values for silverside reproduction this issue is related to sports fishing an important economic ecosystem service provided by chasicó lake it can be seen that constant monitoring of the river flowrate is required when determining optimal management strategies to avoid floods and preserve the economic resource related to silverside sports fishing furthermore the diverted river stream can be stored within a reservoir and alleviation channels system can be a solution to flooding problems as well as creating environments for tourism and recreation additionally this reservoir can be a buffer for future drought scenarios acknowledgments authors greatly acknowledge the national research council
