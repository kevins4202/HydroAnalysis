8065,study region wuding river catchment the wind water erosion crisscross region on the chinese loess plateau study focus the wind water erosion crisscross region suffers severe soil erosion in the world and various catchment properties control fluvial processes this study investigated suspended sediment ss transport characteristics in a typical catchment with two geomorphological types aeolian sand and loess hilly lorenz curves and partial least squares regression were used to quantify the ss transport characteristics and attributions new hydrological insights for the region there were significant differences in the ss transport characteristics between the two geomorphological regions in the aeolian sand region the mean annual ss loads were much lower than that in the loess hilly region p 0 01 under similar precipitation and runoff conditions rivers in this region transported ss all year round the relatively lower concentration indicated that extreme events did not dominate total ss load conversely ss transport in the loess hilly region was highly concentrated during a few events in rainy season with the largest 10 of the events transporting exceed 80 of the total ss load statistical analysis showed that drainage density catchment slope and soil texture were the dominant factors controlling ss load while the concentration of ss transport events was more related to the perimeter area fractal these findings have important implications for fluvial sediment transport in arid and semi arid environments keywords suspended sediment transport fluvial process aeolian sand region loess hilly region lorenz curve concentration index 1 introduction a majority of global lands are subject to fluvial systems fryirs 2013 which are important for shaping the earth s surface and modifying landforms liu and coulthard 2017 they also play fundamental roles in soil erosion and sediment transport from local to global scales belnap et al 2011 the fluvial sediment transport process is an important indicator of catchment properties and critically affect geomorphology and ecology li et al 2020a yang et al 2018 thus it is essential to understand the fluvial sediment transport dynamics and identify its main drivers choubin et al 2018 the arid and semi arid wind water erosion crisscross region on the chinese loess plateau suffers the most intensive soil erosion worldwide tang 2000 the combination of aeolian and fluvial processes has formed complicated geomorphological conditions thus affecting soil erosion and sediment transport licht et al 2016 xu et al 2006 previous studies have reported the sediment transport regime in arid and semi arid catchments mueller et al 2009 wang et al 2016 zheng et al 2021 episodic processes are one of the most notable features of sediment transport aalto et al 2003 li et al 2021 e g a few extreme events can produce 60 90 of the annual total sediment load fang et al 2015 garcia ruiz 2010 li et al 2020b however the characteristics of fluvial sediment transport in the wind water erosion crisscross region are supposed to be spatially heterogeneous due to catchment complexity ma et al 2010 hydrological processes in river catchments are affected by multiple environmental elements kisi and yaseen 2019 under similar meteorological conditions hydrological processes are mainly determined by catchment properties li et al 2019a therefore a better understanding of sediment transport characteristics and controlling factors will be helpful for optimizing catchment management many studies have evaluated the effects of catchment properties such as topography soil characteristics and landscape patterns on soil erosion and sediment yield in areas dominated by water erosion rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 soil properties greatly influence precipitation infiltration and runoff production li et al 2019a topographical factors such as slope and drainage density affect the kinetic energy of surface flow and sediment transport capacity zhang et al 2015 landscape patterns reflect the fragmentation complexity and diversity of catchment landscapes indicating the impact of landscape patch connectivity on sediment transport shi et al 2014 in the wind water erosion crisscross region the complicated geomorphologic composition has caused significant differences in catchment properties and has affected the hydrologic processes in the region ma et al 2010 xu et al 2006 therefore the dominant factors controlling sediment transport may be different from those in areas influenced by water erosion alone this study analyzed the fluvial sediment transport processes in the wind water erosion crisscross region on the chinese loess plateau a catchment and its eight sub catchments with different earth surface conditions were selected to study the fluvial sediment transport processes the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to reveal the characteristics of fluvial sediment transport in the wind water erosion crisscross region especially the effects of extreme events on suspended sediment ss transport and 2 to identify the dominant catchment properties controlling sediment transport processes 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the present research was conducted in the wuding river catchment located in the wind water erosion crisscross region on the chinese loess plateau where influenced by both aeolian and fluvial processes the wuding river catchment drains a total area of 30261 km2 zhao et al 2019 the elevation within the catchment ranges from 583 m to 1826 m and the slope ranges from 2 70 to 16 19 the mean annual precipitation is 450 9 mm with more than 70 concentrated in the rainy season july to september and mostly occurring in the form of intensive rainstorms li et al 2007 this catchment is also the primary source of coarse particles input to the yellow river zhao et al 2017 the mean annual runoff and sediment load are 11 2 108 m3 and 1 1 108 t respectively han et al 2019 the wuding river flows from the northwestern aeolian sand region to the southeastern loess hilly region the catchment properties of the two geomorphological regions are significantly different which results in variable hydrological and sediment transport processes we selected the wuding river catchment and its eight sub catchments with drainage areas ranging from 187 km2 to 29662 km2 table 1 catchments as1 to as3 belong to the aeolian sand region fig 1 this region has a relatively flat topography with a low drainage density yang et al 2014 the vegetation cover is sparse and soil is mostly highly permeable aeolian sand conducive to rainfall infiltration ma et al 2010 catchments lh1 to lh6 are located in the loess hilly region fig 1 which has a wide distribution of dense drainage networks and steep slopes and the soil is less permeable zhang et al 2018a fig 1 and table 1 2 2 data collecting the daily ss load data 2006 2014 for nine catchments came from the hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china published by the ministry of water resources a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m was obtained from the geospatial data cloud the corresponding catchment boundaries were extracted from the dem using arcgis 10 5 fig 1 this study extracted 16 underlying surface indicators from each catchment to describe catchment properties the selected 16 indicators can be divided into four classes topographic factors soil properties vegetation cover and landscape metrics table 2 we used the spatial analyst tools to count topographic factors in arcgis 10 5 data on land use soil properties and vegetation cover were obtained from the resource and environmental science data center chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn based on the land use maps of 2005 2010 and 2015 with the resolution of 30 m a total of six landscape indicators were calculated in fragstats 4 2 software li et al 2019b shi et al 2013 2 3 methods to evaluate the relative importance of daily ss transport events especially the contribution of extreme events to the total amount the cumulative percentage of the ss load contributed by the cumulative percentage of the daily ss transport events was calculated the relationship between the cumulative percentage of daily ss transport events x and ss load y can be expressed as an exponential lorenz curve fig 2 masaki et al 2014 the lorenz curve is in the range of 0 100 which can indicate the temporally asymmetrical distribution of daily ss transport events additionally the concentration of daily ss transport events can be quantified by the gini concentration index ci the value of ci is the fraction of area enclosed by lorenz curve and line of equality a and area of the triangle under the line of equality 1 ci a 5000 5000 a 5000 where a is the area enclosed by the lorenz curve and line of equality and a is the area under the lorenz curve the ci value ranges from 0 to 1 a high ci value indicates that the temporal distribution of the daily ss transport events in a specific period is asymmetrical and the contributions of extreme ss transport events to the total ss load are relatively large two partial least squares regression plsr models were built to identify the dominant catchment properties controlling ss transport plsr is a multiple regression method that has been widely used to address multicollinearity among influencing factors yan et al 2013 considering the overfitting of influencing factors we used cross validation to determine the appropriate component numbers shi et al 2014 the ability of influencing factors to explain variations of dependent variables was indicated by the variable importance for the projection vip factors with high vip values can explain most of the variation of the dependent variables zhang et al 2015 component weights and regression coefficients were used to demonstrate the direction of the relationship between each factor and dependent variables this study used simca p umetrics ab sweden to develop the plsr models yan et al 2013 3 results 3 1 characteristics of ss transport at annual and monthly scales great differences in ss transport characteristics were detected between the aeolian sand region and the loess hilly region the mean annual ss load for the nine selected catchments varied from 13 86 t km 2 in as2 to 2886 11 t km 2 in lh4 table 1 with a variation coefficient of 90 indicating substantial variability among different catchments fig 3 presents the mean annual precipitation runoff depth and ss load of the nine catchments no significant differences in the annual precipitation and runoff depth were found the annual ss load in the aeolian sand region ranged from 0 82 to 525 t km 2 with an average load less than 100 t km 2 while the corresponding value in the loess hilly region ranged from 0 19 to 10468 t km 2 with an average load exceeding 1000 t km 2 the results indicate that the ss transport in the aeolian sand region was significantly lower p 0 01 and presented less variability than in the loess hilly region variations in the ss load on the monthly temporal scale are shown in fig 4 in the aeolian sand catchments as1 to as3 the contribution of ss load in the dry season october to june to the annual total ranged from 36 to 61 which was almost equal to that in the rainy season july to september with the contributions ranging from 39 to 64 there were no significant differences among the mean monthly ss loads indicating that rivers in the aeolian sand region transported ss throughout the year and the monthly ss loads were relatively uniform in the loess hilly region lh1 to lh6 ss mainly transported in the rainy season with a contribution exceeding 90 for most catchments and there was little or even no ss load in other months 3 2 concentration of daily ss transport events the ci values of the daily ss load from 2006 to 2014 were estimated for the nine catchments using the lorenz approach shown in eq 1 the ci values in the aeolian sand region ranged from 0 35 to 0 71 which were lower than those in the loess hilly region ranged from 0 88 to 0 97 table 3 the contributions of different percentages of extreme daily events to the total ss load in the aeolian sand region were also lower than those in the loess hilly region the largest 10 of daily events could transport more than 80 of the total ss load in the loess hilly region while the contribution of the same percentage of events was less than 50 in the aeolian sand region these results indicate a relatively uniform temporal distribution of the daily ss load in the aeolian sand region conversely ss transport exhibited greater temporal inequality and higher concentration for most loess hilly region catchments an analysis of the lorenz curves may contribute to a more visualized understanding of the temporal distribution of daily ss transport events fig 5 displays the cumulative transport percentages for the nine catchments from 2006 to 2014 the lorenz curves of ss load indicated that the temporal distribution of ss transport in the aeolian sand region demonstrated a lower variability than that in the loess hilly region therefore extreme ss transport events did not dominate the annual total ss load in the aeolian sand region in contrast ss transport in the loess hilly region was a more episodic process and was controlled by a few extreme events 3 3 relating the catchment properties to ss transport two plsr models were developed for the ss load and ci table 4 the q2 cum values for the ss load and ci models were 0 551 and 0 534 respectively indicating the good predictive ability of the two models for the ss load model the first component explained 65 of the ss load variation the second component cumulatively accounted for 79 of the variability fig 6 presents the weights of the influencing factors in the first and second components for the ss load and ci models the vip values and regression coefficients rcs exerted a more integrated expression on the importance of the selected influencing factors fig 7 the highest vip value in the ss load was observed with drainage density dd vip 1 27 rcs 0 18 followed by catchment slope s vip 1 24 rcs 0 14 soil texture also showed a significant effect on the ss load with vip values larger than 1 the ss load increased with higher dd and s values but decreased with higher sand content for the ci model the first component explained 60 of the variation in the ci the addition of one more component cumulatively accounted for 72 of the total variance the maximum vip value was detected for the pafrac vip 1 41 rcs 0 17 reflecting the complexity of landscape patches this was followed by the catchment slope s vip 1 24 rcs 0 11 and sand content vip 1 19 rcs 0 10 the ci values appeared to increase with higher pafrac and s and decrease with higher sand content 4 discussion 4 1 runoff sediment relationships in different geomorphological regions in most arid and semi arid catchments ss is transported episodically and mainly occurs in summer and autumn with frequent rainstorms fryirs 2013 the top five extreme events transported more than 90 of the annual total sediment load rustomji et al 2008 zheng et al 2020 however rivers in the aeolian sand region transported ss throughout the year fig 4 the ci values which characterize the concentration of daily ss transport events were much lower in the aeolian sand region table 3 and the lorenz curves were closer to the line of equality fig 5 the average contributions of the largest 10 of daily events were less than 50 table 3 indicating that extreme events did not dominate the total ss load in this region in contrast the largest 10 of daily events contributed more than 80 of the total ss load in the loess hilly region table 3 and the mean annual ss load far exceeded that in the aeolian sand region fig 3 these results indicated that heterogeneous catchment properties might have a significant influence on ss transport the fluvial ss transport process is highly related to the streamflow regime li et al 2020a here we analyzed the river discharge characteristics and runoff sediment relationships to explain the characteristics of ss transport further significant correlations between flow discharge and precipitation were found in more than 70 of the world s large rivers li et al 2020a fig 8 shows that the two geomorphological regions had similar precipitation patterns mainly concentrated from july to september the streamflow regime in the loess hilly region rivers were basically consistent with precipitation the peak flow occurred during july to september when rainfall concentrated and march when snow melted by contrast streamflow in the aeolian sand region had a relatively steady discharge all year round fig 8 fig 9 compares the daily runoff sediment relationships between two representative catchments of the aeolian sand region and loess hilly region strong correlations were found between the daily runoff depth and the ss load in both the aeolian sand region r2 0 90 and the loess hilly region r2 0 95 however the correlations between precipitation and runoff depth were relatively weak especially in the aeolian sand region r2 0 11 therefore we concluded that precipitation was not the main factor leading to the difference in streamflow regime and ss transport characteristics between the two geomorphological regions and the influence of underlying surface factors need to further discuss 4 2 controlling factors of ss transport characteristics catchment properties have significant impacts on hydrological processes and ss transport rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 plsr analysis showed that catchment slope drainage density soil texture and pafrac were the main factors affecting the ss load and ci wind and fluvial processes alternate seasonally in the aeolian sand region xu et al 2006 wind action predominates from march to june with an average wind speed of 5 6 m s and the largest wind speed exceeds 20 m s guo et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 exposed aeolian sand is widely distributed in this region which can be blown and deposited on the river bank and become the primary source of ss catchments with a large proportion of sand content usually generate low sediment loads li et al 2019a the soil in the aeolian sand region is dominated by coarse particles with more than 90 of the grain size being greater than 0 1 mm xu 2008 the wide distribution of aeolian sand on the land surface has a large porosity promoting high infiltration and reducing surface runoff generation during precipitation events ma et al 2010 therefore sediment yields are not mainly produced by rainstorms this region has a large amount of base flow yang et al 2012 resulting in relatively stable river discharge throughout the year as a result rivers in the aeolian sand region transported ss all year round fig 9 shows that the ss load in the aeolian sand region was lower than in the loess hilly region at the same runoff depth the flat land surface in the aeolian sand region reduces the occurrence of large floods and the flow capacity for transporting sediment sun et al 2020 yang et al 2012 combined with insufficient fine grained materials available for transport in the aeolian sand region yang et al 2012 the ss load was much lower than that in the loess hilly region low and moderate flow events account for the largest proportion in the aeolian sand region zhou et al 2013 which results in limited variation in both the annual and the interannual flow regimes ma et al 2010 therefore the daily ss load variations were much smaller than those in the loess hilly region and extreme events did not dominate the total ss load in contrast in the loess hilly region the low porosity of soil reduces infiltration and accelerates surface flow production during precipitation events cheng et al 2017 the higher drainage density and steep slopes provide sufficient kinetic energy for surface flow thus facilitating sediment transport li et al 2019a zhang et al 2018b additionally sufficient fine grained materials are available for transport in this region which generates a relatively high ss load during extreme events zheng et al 2020 landscape metrics especially pafrac significantly impacted concentration reflecting the complexity of the landscape within the catchment a highly fragmented and heterogeneous landscape is more likely to reduce connectivity among landscape patches shi et al 2013 causing sediment transport to be mainly limited to episodic extreme events therefore the loess hilly region was characterized by a higher ss load and a higher concentration 5 conclusions in this study ss transport in the aeolian sand region and loess hilly region were investigated and the dominant catchment properties were quantified the mean annual ss load in rivers of the aeolian sand region was much lower than that of the loess hilly region p 0 01 while no significant differences were observed in the mean annual precipitation and runoff depth rivers in the aeolian sand region transported ss throughout the year with the contributions of the ss load in the dry season to the annual total 36 61 almost equal to those in the rainy season 39 64 the relatively low ci values indicated that extreme events did not dominate the total ss load in this region in contrast the ss transport in the loess hilly region mainly occurred in the rainy season and was highly concentrated in a few events the largest 10 of daily events contributed more than 80 of the total ss load plsr analysis showed that drainage density catchment slope and soil texture were the most relevant factors controlling the ss load while the concentration of daily ss transport events was more related to the perimeter area fractal the complexity of catchment properties resulted in variable ss transport processes between the two geomorphological regions our findings have implications for understanding fluvial sediment transport process in other arid and semi arid catchments with complex underlying surface properties

study area and methods 2 1 study area the present research was conducted in the wuding river catchment located in the wind water erosion crisscross region on the chinese loess plateau where influenced by both aeolian and fluvial processes the wuding river catchment drains a total area of 30261 km2 zhao et al 2019 the elevation within the catchment ranges from 583 m to 1826 m and the slope ranges from 2 70 to 16 19 the mean annual precipitation is 450 9 mm with more than 70 concentrated in the rainy season july to september and mostly occurring in the form of intensive rainstorms li et al 2007 this catchment is also the primary source of coarse particles input to the yellow river zhao et al 2017 the mean annual runoff and sediment load are 11 2 108 m3 and 1 1 108 t respectively han et al 2019 the wuding river flows from the northwestern aeolian sand region to the southeastern loess hilly region the catchment properties of the two geomorphological regions are significantly different which results in variable hydrological and sediment transport processes we selected the wuding river catchment and its eight sub catchments with drainage areas ranging from 187 km2 to 29662 km2 table 1 catchments as1 to as3 belong to the aeolian sand region fig 1 this region has a relatively flat topography with a low drainage density yang et al 2014 the vegetation cover is sparse and soil is mostly highly permeable aeolian sand conducive to rainfall infiltration ma et al 2010 catchments lh1 to lh6 are located in the loess hilly region fig 1 which has a wide distribution of dense drainage networks and steep slopes and the soil is less permeable zhang et al 2018a fig 1 and table 1 2 2 data collecting the daily ss load data 2006 2014 for nine catchments came from the hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china published by the ministry of water resources a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m was obtained from the geospatial data cloud the corresponding catchment boundaries were extracted from the dem using arcgis 10 5 fig 1 this study extracted 16 underlying surface indicators from each catchment to describe catchment properties the selected 16 indicators can be divided into four classes topographic factors soil properties vegetation cover and landscape metrics table 2 we used the spatial analyst tools to count topographic factors in arcgis 10 5 data on land use soil properties and vegetation cover were obtained from the resource and environmental science data center chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn based on the land use maps of 2005 2010 and 2015 with the resolution of 30 m a total of six landscape indicators were calculated in fragstats 4 2 software li et al 2019b shi et al 2013 2 3 methods to evaluate the relative importance of daily ss transport events especially the contribution of extreme events to the total amount the cumulative percentage of the ss load contributed by the cumulative percentage of the daily ss transport events was calculated the relationship between the cumulative percentage of daily ss transport events x and ss load y can be expressed as an exponential lorenz curve fig 2 masaki et al 2014 the lorenz curve is in the range of 0 100 which can indicate the temporally asymmetrical distribution of daily ss transport events additionally the concentration of daily ss transport events can be quantified by the gini concentration index ci the value of ci is the fraction of area enclosed by lorenz curve and line of equality a and area of the triangle under the line of equality 1 ci a 5000 5000 a 5000 where a is the area enclosed by the lorenz curve and line of equality and a is the area under the lorenz curve the ci value ranges from 0 to 1 a high ci value indicates that the temporal distribution of the daily ss transport events in a specific period is asymmetrical and the contributions of extreme ss transport events to the total ss load are relatively large two partial least squares regression plsr models were built to identify the dominant catchment properties controlling ss transport plsr is a multiple regression method that has been widely used to address multicollinearity among influencing factors yan et al 2013 considering the overfitting of influencing factors we used cross validation to determine the appropriate component numbers shi et al 2014 the ability of influencing factors to explain variations of dependent variables was indicated by the variable importance for the projection vip factors with high vip values can explain most of the variation of the dependent variables zhang et al 2015 component weights and regression coefficients were used to demonstrate the direction of the relationship between each factor and dependent variables this study used simca p umetrics ab sweden to develop the plsr models yan et al 2013 3 results 3 1 characteristics of ss transport at annual and monthly scales great differences in ss transport characteristics were detected between the aeolian sand region and the loess hilly region the mean annual ss load for the nine selected catchments varied from 13 86 t km 2 in as2 to 2886 11 t km 2 in lh4 table 1 with a variation coefficient of 90 indicating substantial variability among different catchments fig 3 presents the mean annual precipitation runoff depth and ss load of the nine catchments no significant differences in the annual precipitation and runoff depth were found the annual ss load in the aeolian sand region ranged from 0 82 to 525 t km 2 with an average load less than 100 t km 2 while the corresponding value in the loess hilly region ranged from 0 19 to 10468 t km 2 with an average load exceeding 1000 t km 2 the results indicate that the ss transport in the aeolian sand region was significantly lower p 0 01 and presented less variability than in the loess hilly region variations in the ss load on the monthly temporal scale are shown in fig 4 in the aeolian sand catchments as1 to as3 the contribution of ss load in the dry season october to june to the annual total ranged from 36 to 61 which was almost equal to that in the rainy season july to september with the contributions ranging from 39 to 64 there were no significant differences among the mean monthly ss loads indicating that rivers in the aeolian sand region transported ss throughout the year and the monthly ss loads were relatively uniform in the loess hilly region lh1 to lh6 ss mainly transported in the rainy season with a contribution exceeding 90 for most catchments and there was little or even no ss load in other months 3 2 concentration of daily ss transport events the ci values of the daily ss load from 2006 to 2014 were estimated for the nine catchments using the lorenz approach shown in eq 1 the ci values in the aeolian sand region ranged from 0 35 to 0 71 which were lower than those in the loess hilly region ranged from 0 88 to 0 97 table 3 the contributions of different percentages of extreme daily events to the total ss load in the aeolian sand region were also lower than those in the loess hilly region the largest 10 of daily events could transport more than 80 of the total ss load in the loess hilly region while the contribution of the same percentage of events was less than 50 in the aeolian sand region these results indicate a relatively uniform temporal distribution of the daily ss load in the aeolian sand region conversely ss transport exhibited greater temporal inequality and higher concentration for most loess hilly region catchments an analysis of the lorenz curves may contribute to a more visualized understanding of the temporal distribution of daily ss transport events fig 5 displays the cumulative transport percentages for the nine catchments from 2006 to 2014 the lorenz curves of ss load indicated that the temporal distribution of ss transport in the aeolian sand region demonstrated a lower variability than that in the loess hilly region therefore extreme ss transport events did not dominate the annual total ss load in the aeolian sand region in contrast ss transport in the loess hilly region was a more episodic process and was controlled by a few extreme events 3 3 relating the catchment properties to ss transport two plsr models were developed for the ss load and ci table 4 the q2 cum values for the ss load and ci models were 0 551 and 0 534 respectively indicating the good predictive ability of the two models for the ss load model the first component explained 65 of the ss load variation the second component cumulatively accounted for 79 of the variability fig 6 presents the weights of the influencing factors in the first and second components for the ss load and ci models the vip values and regression coefficients rcs exerted a more integrated expression on the importance of the selected influencing factors fig 7 the highest vip value in the ss load was observed with drainage density dd vip 1 27 rcs 0 18 followed by catchment slope s vip 1 24 rcs 0 14 soil texture also showed a significant effect on the ss load with vip values larger than 1 the ss load increased with higher dd and s values but decreased with higher sand content for the ci model the first component explained 60 of the variation in the ci the addition of one more component cumulatively accounted for 72 of the total variance the maximum vip value was detected for the pafrac vip 1 41 rcs 0 17 reflecting the complexity of landscape patches this was followed by the catchment slope s vip 1 24 rcs 0 11 and sand content vip 1 19 rcs 0 10 the ci values appeared to increase with higher pafrac and s and decrease with higher sand content 4 discussion 4 1 runoff sediment relationships in different geomorphological regions in most arid and semi arid catchments ss is transported episodically and mainly occurs in summer and autumn with frequent rainstorms fryirs 2013 the top five extreme events transported more than 90 of the annual total sediment load rustomji et al 2008 zheng et al 2020 however rivers in the aeolian sand region transported ss throughout the year fig 4 the ci values which characterize the concentration of daily ss transport events were much lower in the aeolian sand region table 3 and the lorenz curves were closer to the line of equality fig 5 the average contributions of the largest 10 of daily events were less than 50 table 3 indicating that extreme events did not dominate the total ss load in this region in contrast the largest 10 of daily events contributed more than 80 of the total ss load in the loess hilly region table 3 and the mean annual ss load far exceeded that in the aeolian sand region fig 3 these results indicated that heterogeneous catchment properties might have a significant influence on ss transport the fluvial ss transport process is highly related to the streamflow regime li et al 2020a here we analyzed the river discharge characteristics and runoff sediment relationships to explain the characteristics of ss transport further significant correlations between flow discharge and precipitation were found in more than 70 of the world s large rivers li et al 2020a fig 8 shows that the two geomorphological regions had similar precipitation patterns mainly concentrated from july to september the streamflow regime in the loess hilly region rivers were basically consistent with precipitation the peak flow occurred during july to september when rainfall concentrated and march when snow melted by contrast streamflow in the aeolian sand region had a relatively steady discharge all year round fig 8 fig 9 compares the daily runoff sediment relationships between two representative catchments of the aeolian sand region and loess hilly region strong correlations were found between the daily runoff depth and the ss load in both the aeolian sand region r2 0 90 and the loess hilly region r2 0 95 however the correlations between precipitation and runoff depth were relatively weak especially in the aeolian sand region r2 0 11 therefore we concluded that precipitation was not the main factor leading to the difference in streamflow regime and ss transport characteristics between the two geomorphological regions and the influence of underlying surface factors need to further discuss 4 2 controlling factors of ss transport characteristics catchment properties have significant impacts on hydrological processes and ss transport rajbanshi and bhattacharya 2020 plsr analysis showed that catchment slope drainage density soil texture and pafrac were the main factors affecting the ss load and ci wind and fluvial processes alternate seasonally in the aeolian sand region xu et al 2006 wind action predominates from march to june with an average wind speed of 5 6 m s and the largest wind speed exceeds 20 m s guo et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 exposed aeolian sand is widely distributed in this region which can be blown and deposited on the river bank and become the primary source of ss catchments with a large proportion of sand content usually generate low sediment loads li et al 2019a the soil in the aeolian sand region is dominated by coarse particles with more than 90 of the grain size being greater than 0 1 mm xu 2008 the wide distribution of aeolian sand on the land surface has a large porosity promoting high infiltration and reducing surface runoff generation during precipitation events ma et al 2010 therefore sediment yields are not mainly produced by rainstorms this region has a large amount of base flow yang et al 2012 resulting in relatively stable river discharge throughout the year as a result rivers in the aeolian sand region transported ss all year round fig 9 shows that the ss load in the aeolian sand region was lower than in the loess hilly region at the same runoff depth the flat land surface in the aeolian sand region reduces the occurrence of large floods and the flow capacity for transporting sediment sun et al 2020 yang et al 2012 combined with insufficient fine grained materials available for transport in the aeolian sand region yang et al 2012 the ss load was much lower than that in the loess hilly region low and moderate flow events account for the largest proportion in the aeolian sand region zhou et al 2013 which results in limited variation in both the annual and the interannual flow regimes ma et al 2010 therefore the daily ss load variations were much smaller than those in the loess hilly region and extreme events did not dominate the total ss load in contrast in the loess hilly region the low porosity of soil reduces infiltration and accelerates surface flow production during precipitation events cheng et al 2017 the higher drainage density and steep slopes provide sufficient kinetic energy for surface flow thus facilitating sediment transport li et al 2019a zhang et al 2018b additionally sufficient fine grained materials are available for transport in this region which generates a relatively high ss load during extreme events zheng et al 2020 landscape metrics especially pafrac significantly impacted concentration reflecting the complexity of the landscape within the catchment a highly fragmented and heterogeneous landscape is more likely to reduce connectivity among landscape patches shi et al 2013 causing sediment transport to be mainly limited to episodic extreme events therefore the loess hilly region was characterized by a higher ss load and a higher concentration 5 conclusions in this study ss transport in the aeolian sand region and loess hilly region were investigated and the dominant catchment properties were quantified the mean annual ss load in rivers of the aeolian sand region was much lower than that of the loess hilly region p 0 01 while no significant differences were observed in the mean annual precipitation and runoff depth rivers in the aeolian sand region transported ss throughout the year with the contributions of the ss load in the dry season to the annual total 36 61 almost equal to those in the rainy season 39 64 the relatively low ci values indicated that extreme events did not dominate the total ss load in this region in contrast the ss transport in the loess hilly region mainly occurred in the rainy season and was highly concentrated in a few events the largest 10 of daily events contributed more than 80 of the total ss load plsr analysis showed that drainage density catchment slope and soil texture were the most relevant factors controlling the ss load while the concentration of daily ss transport events was more related to the perimeter area fractal the complexity of catchment properties resulted in variable ss transport processes between the two geomorphological regions our findings have implications for understanding fluvial sediment transport process in other arid and semi arid catchments with complex underlying surface properties the results of this study can help decision makers implement appropriate watershed management in areas with different geomorphological types credit authorship contribution statement tongge jing

8066,study region mcclelland lake athabasca oil sands region study focus effective environmental monitoring requires knowledge of inherent natural variation in the absence of pre development monitoring of aquatic ecosystems paleolimnological approaches have been championed as a scientifically rigorous method to define pre development conditions motivated by regulatory processes and absence of pre development data we conducted a comprehensive paleolimnological study at mcclelland lake to determine an appropriate timeframe for defining natural ranges of variation nrvs in hydroecological variables before potential onset of mining within its catchment new hydrological insights for the region during the past 325 years five distinctive intervals of hydroecological conditions were identified the first phase ca 1695 1750 coincided with the little ice age lia when arid conditions supported lake levels 2 6 3 5 m below present phase ii ca 1750 1840 encompassed subsequent warming lake level rise to 1 2 2 6 m below present and increased aquatic productivity phase iii included frequent natural disturbance by wildfires ca 1840 1900 during phase iv ca 1900 1970 the lake deepened and algal communities diversified phase v post 1970 captured influence of regional industrial development climate warming and lake level decline and wildfires we propose quantitative definitions of nrvs for mcclelland lake be derived from paleolimnological indicators since 1750 which provide a conservative and relevant range of hydroecological conditions and explore merits and drawbacks of shorter duration nrv definition for monitoring change keywords paleolimnology athabasca oil sands region environmental baseline natural range of variation monitoring hydroecology 1 introduction environmental monitoring programs are designed to detect if and when deleterious changes occur to aquatic ecosystems because of human activities effective monitoring frameworks for major industrial projects hinge on comparing measurements on samples collected during and after the project has begun to pre development conditions to detect departures from natural or reference conditions arciszewski et al 2017b however long term monitoring programs often are not implemented until after a development has begun or a potential anthropogenic effect has been observed in the environment in these situations the characterization of pre development conditions of aquatic ecosystems is poor or missing which challenges the capability to detect industry driven change lindenmayer and likens 2010 smol 2008 the use of reference sites i e other ecosystems assumed to be similar to the hypothetical pre development or normal conditions can strengthen monitoring programs but can be problematic as reference sites are assumed to mimic the focal ecosystem through time including interannual natural variability yet this assumption may not always hold true see arciszewski and munkittrick 2015 in canada current regulatory requirements frequently require or necessitate the collection of pre development data such processes include the impact assessment process under the canadian impact assessment act impact assessment act iaa 2019 and environmental assessment program in alberta government of alberta 2013 however this is often limited to short term assessments which may not adequately characterize the natural variability of the ecosystem s in question in the athabasca oil sands region aosr systematic aquatic ecosystem monitoring began almost 30 years after initial industrial exploitation of the abundant bituminous sand deposits dowdeswell et al 2010 humphries 2008 in the absence of sufficient pre development monitoring data paleolimnology the scientific analysis of sediment cores to reconstruct past changes in environmental conditions of aquatic basins has been championed as a source of hydroecological and or geochemical information to characterize the natural range of variation for aquatic ecosystems and contaminant deposition in the aosr arciszewski et al 2017a dowdeswell et al 2010 klemt et al 2021 mills et al 2017 munkittrick and arciszewski 2017 somers et al 2018 lake sediments typically accrete vertically preserving an archive of components of the lake ecosystem as well as contributions from its catchment and regional airmasses sediments deeper in this natural archive reflect older pre development periods of ecosystem history stratigraphic analysis of lake sediment cores allows for inferences to be made about past lake and environmental conditions and qualitative to quantitative reconstructions of environmental change and natural ranges of variability can be defined to establish baseline conditions before potential impact from industrial activities contemporary monitoring programs can integrate paleolimnological reconstructions to enhance their ability to detect changes during and after development thereby supporting ecosystem protection information preserved in lake sediment cores has been critical to characterize the pre development conditions of the aosr and to define the area enriched by contaminants of concern emitted from oil sands industrial development which is currently considered to be within about 50 km of fort mackay ab e g cooke et al 2017 hazewinkel et al 2008 jautzy et al 2013 klemt et al 2020 2021 kurek et al 2013 summers et al 2016 wiklund et al 2012 these studies agree well with spatial analysis of snowpack samples throughout the aosr kelly et al 2009 2010 cho et al 2014 kirk et al 2014 manzano et al 2016 other paleolimnological studies have focused on environmental and ecological conditions in lakes regional hydroclimatology and changes due to climatic trends e g curtis et al 2010 summers et al 2016 2019 these studies have been instrumental in quantifying and expanding our understanding of the magnitude and extent of industrial effects within the aosr as well as elucidating aspects of the pre development history of the region despite common advocacy paleolimnological data have yet to be used proactively by industry in the aosr to quantify the range of natural variation for use by monitoring programs to improve ability to detect if and when environmental change has occurred as a result of industrial development ongoing resource development interests within the northern aosr prompted a study of the mcclelland lake watershed located approximately 34 km nne of fort mackay ab fig 1 the watershed is located within the surface mineable region of the aosr and includes a wetland complex dominated by a large alkaline patterned fen several sinkhole lakes old growth pine forests and the fort hills landform a dissected kame that borders mcclelland lake several of these features have been identified as alberta environmentally significant areas esa nos 633 638 679 mcclelland lake is used as a staging area for numerous waterfowl species and as nesting habitat for bald eagle haliaeetus leucocephalus and sandhill crane antigone canadensis two sensitive species of concern sweetgrass consultants ltd 1997 fiera biological consulting 2009 other features near the lake are also significant the patterned fen located on the western shore of the lake is one of the largest in alberta the fort hills kame and numerous sinkholes lakes located to the south and throughout the watershed respectively are both rare landforms in the boreal region and the lakes may be vulnerable to water table alteration the fort mcmurray athabasca oil sands subregional integrated resource plan alberta environment 1996 amended 2002 has restricted surface access for resource development within the eastern portion of the patterned fen as well as mcclelland lake while development is permissible in the western portion of the fen numerous guidelines in the resource plan require the maintenance of natural hydrological conditions that include seasonal variability in the wetland complex sinkhole lakes and upland tributary streams of mcclelland lake alberta environment 1996 the mcclelland lake wetland complex is located on the periphery of the area of measurable effects from industrial aosr activities including atmospheric deposition of organic contaminants and metals cho et al 2014 kelly et al 2009 2010 kirk et al 2014 and as a result has received little scientific study the paucity of environmental monitoring data for mcclelland lake renders that potential disturbance to the lake from proposed future mining activities will be difficult to identify thus the objective of this study was to determine an appropriate timeframe for defining the natural range of past hydroecological conditions in mcclelland lake using a comprehensive paleolimnological approach before the potential onset of mining within its catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site mcclelland lake fig 1 is a large surface area 30 5 km2 catchment area 198 km2 shallow zmax 5 5 m alkaline mean ph 8 60 mean total alkalinity as caco3 142 mg l lake located in the aosr approximately 50 km north of the centre of oil sands industrial activity the lake is located within the firebag river watershed and is intermittently fed by runoff from surrounding streams including upper mcclelland creek the large 9 km2 adjacent patterned fen and smaller peatlands the fen and peatlands are the primary sources of runoff to the lake mcclelland lake is a seasonally closed basin intermittently drained by lower mcclelland creek as lake levels fluctuate throughout the year the water balance of the lake is thought to comprise inputs from precipitation and surface and shallow groundwater inflows along the western patterned fen and losses due to evaporation and diffuse groundwater outflow along the eastern edge of the lake lake water oxygen isotope values measured on several occasions from august 2017 august 2019 narrowly range from 10 5 to 8 7 and closely correspond to an estimate of the terminal basin isotopic steady state value where evaporation is equal to inflow δssl 9 18 for nearby lakes in the peace athabasca delta remmer et al 2018 several oil sands leases and or developments are located nearby or within the catchment of the lake the hydrogeological setting has been studied extensively to support development of resources in the area e g true north 2001 the lake and wetland complex are situated in relatively flat topography 5 m relief and are underlain by a quaternary sand aquifer 10 20 m and low permeability clay till the patterned fen has a maximum peat thickness of about 8 m and slopes gently towards the lake the orientation of strings and flarks within the fen is consistent with groundwater flow towards the lake quinton and roulet 1998 the patterned fen and lake complex are bounded by sandy upland areas of the fort hills kame to the north and south and hydraulic head distributions indicate groundwater flow within the sand aquifer from the south towards the wetland complex however the dilute geochemical composition of the peat groundwaters along the boundary of the fen and lake itself lake water specific conductance 242 μs cm do not indicate significant contributions from the underlying sand aquifer 2 2 sediment core collection this study reports analyses of sediment cores collected from three sites within the deep water basin of the lake 3 3 5 5 m fig 1 cores were collected during september 2 4 2018 using a uwitec gravity corer uwitec mondsee austria two cores were collected from each site for a total of six sediment cores sectioning was completed at 0 5 cm increments using a vertical push rod type extruder telford et al 2021 sediment samples were collected in whirlpak bags and stored in the dark at 4 c during shipping and until analysis 2 3 sediment core analyses preliminary analysis of sediment composition by loss on ignition loi was completed on contiguous samples from all cores collected based on these results including stratigraphic agreement of paired cores and downcore changes in composition sediment cores were selected for additional analyses detailed below table 1 the sediment cores presented in this study showed similar stratigraphic variability fig s1 implying a unified preserved lake history in the sediment records 2 3 1 sediment composition loi analysis was used to determine stratigraphic variation in water organic matter carbonate and residual mineral matter content of each sediment core smith 2003 results from loi analysis of each core were used to align core pairs from each sampling location align chronologies of sediment cores among sites and select cores for subsequent analysis fig s1 table 1 inorganic sediment particle size distributions were characterized using a horiba partica la 950v2 laser particle size analyzer at wilfrid laurier university sediments were digested using 5 sodium hypochlorite solution for 24 h at room temperature to remove organic matter mikutta et al 2005 and rinsed with deionized water until sodium hypochlorite residues were removed digested sediment samples were dispersed in 0 1 sodium hexametaphosphate solution during analysis particle size classes were defined following blott and pye 2001 2 3 2 radiometric dating age depth modelling radioisotope activities of 210pb 226ra as weighted mean 214bi and 214pb activities and 137cs were measured to quantify age depth relations in the sediment cores during the past ca 150 years sediments were freeze dried packed into 8 ml polypropylene tubes and sealed with a tfa silicone septum supelco and 1 cm3 epoxy resin devcon product no 14310 samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least 21 days prior to analysis measurements of radioisotope activities were collected using an ortec co axial hpge digital gamma ray spectrometer interfaced with maestro 32 software at the university of waterloo chronologies based on 210pb activity were developed using the constant rate of supply crs model appleby 2001 sanchez cabeza and ruiz fernández 2012 analysis of stratigraphic trends in several cores using the crs modelled age depth relationships revealed several conspicuous layers of sediments deposited throughout mcclelland lake indicating key correlated events in the lake s history these marker sediment layers contained distinct loi and particle size characteristics figs s1 s5 which were used in a bayesian age depth modelling framework blaauw and christen 2019 to develop more consistent age depth relations among sediment cores including beyond the range of the crs models markov chain monte carlo model convergence an indication that the markov chain had reached a stationary distribution was determined using the gelman and rubin reduction factor brooks and gelman 1997 2 3 3 phototrophic community abundance and composition of past communities of phototrophs were reconstructed from analysis of photosynthetic pigments diatom frustules and chrysophyte stomatocysts preserved in the sediments pigments were extracted following established methods briefly freeze dried sediments were soaked in a solution of acetone methanol and water 80 15 5 by volume for 24 h at 20 c and filtered through 0 22 μm filters the filtrate was dried under inert n2 gas and the residue was stored at 20 c until analysis dried pigments were re eluted in 500 µl of injection solution using sudan ii as an internal standard leavitt and findlay 1994 and were injected into a waters hplc reverse phase system fitted with a symmetry c18 column the system was run following methods by mantoura and llewellyn 1983 as modified by leavitt et al 1989 pigments were identified based on their retention times and elution sequence and comparison of their spectra to known standards jeffrey et al 1997 roy et al 2011 identified pigments were assigned to specific groups of phototrophs including algae and bacteria ringelberg 1980 jeffrey et al 1997 steinman et al 1998 pandolfini et al 2000 buchaca and catalan 2007 romero viana et al 2010 roy et al 2011 hplc analysis was conducted at the university of waterloo microscope slides used to analyze diatoms and stomatocysts were prepared from wet sediment subsamples digested in a 10 hcl solution followed by a 30 h2o2 solution consistent with methods reported by renberg 1990 and hall and smol 1996 a known number of microspheres were added to the resulting cleaned diatom slurries for each sample to determine diatom valve and chrysophyte stomatocyst concentrations battarbee and keen 1982 diatom slurries were then dispensed onto circular coverslips air dried and mounted onto slides using naphrax diatom slides were analyzed using a zeiss axioskop ii plus oil immersion compound light microscope diatom taxonomy followed krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1991 and lavoie et al 2008 ecological and habitat preferences for diatom taxa followed established literature studies in northern canada e g moser et al 2004 rühland et al 2002 summers et al 2019 diatom and chrysophytes stomatocyst enumeration were conducted at the university of waterloo 2 3 4 stable isotope geochemistry 2 3 4 1 organic carbon nitrogen stable isotope analysis organic carbon c and nitrogen n elemental content and stable isotope ratios were determined on two sediment components fine fraction organic materials and coarse macrophyte remains subsamples of wet sediment were treated with 10 hcl at 80 oc for 2 h to remove carbonates and subsequently washed with deionized water until neutral samples were then freeze dried and were sieved into coarse 250 µm and fine fractions 250 µm plant fragments and seeds from the coarse fraction 250 µm were hand picked and described qualitatively seeds were identified using published taxonomic guides and reference collections martin and barkley 1961 brayshaw 2000 myrbo et al 2011 one sample of small shiny lanceolate seeds from t2 s2 c1 73 5 cm was submitted for identification to paleoscapes archaeobotancial services team llc past in bailey colorado usa fragments were examined under a bausch and lomb stereozoom microscope at magnifications of 10 70x plant fragments from the coarse fraction and sediment from the fine fraction were analyzed for organic c and n elemental and isotope composition using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms at the university of waterloo environmental isotope laboratory stable c and n isotope ratios are reported as δ13corg units relative to the vienna peedee belemnite vpdb standard and δ15n units relative to atmospheric n air respectively analytical uncertainty was 0 2 and 0 3 for δ13corg and δ15n respectively 2 3 4 2 cellulose oxygen isotope analysis cellulose oxygen isotope composition was determined following methods detailed in wolfe et al 2001 using the acid washed fine fraction 250 µm of the sediment subsamples as described above solvent extraction bleaching and alkaline hydrolysis were used to remove non cellulose organic constituents and hydroxylamine leaching was used to remove iron and manganese oxyhydroxides the purified cellulose samples were freeze dried weighed and analyzed using a cf irms at the university of waterloo environmental isotope laboratory cellulose oxygen isotope results were used to infer lake water oxygen isotope composition δ18olw using a cellulose water oxygen isotope fractionation factor of 1 028 wolfe et al 2001 savage et al 2021 and are expressed as δ values relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard and normalized to δ18oslap analytical uncertainty was 0 4 for δ18ocell 2 3 4 3 carbonate oxygen isotope analysis carbonates in freeze dried sediment samples were analyzed using a delta v advantage mass spectrometer and a gasbench ii peripheral following established methods spötl and vennemann 2003 skrzypek and paul 2006 briefly solid carbonate samples were added to a vial flushed with helium and then acidified after a minimum digestion period of 18 h at room temperature a ctc analytics autosampler transferred evolved headspace gas to the gasbench ii where multiple injections of the sample carbon as co2 were measured versus a pure co2 monitoring gas in house standards established by analyses of nbs18 nbs19 and lsvec were analyzed as samples to permit results reported as δ18ocarb values relative to the vpdb standard with analytical uncertainty of 0 3 2 3 4 4 isotope inferred lake water temperature lake water temperature was reconstructed at 5 year increments from depth averaged δ18ocarb and δ18olw values using the calcite water equilibrium equation kim and o neil 1997 leng and marshall 2004 t c 13 8 4 58 δ 18 o carb δ 18 o lw 0 08 δ 18 o carb δ 18 o lw 2 this calculation assumes endogenic carbonate and aquatic cellulose are produced in the lake at the same time during the open water season and that carbonate precipitation occurs under equilibrium conditions to account for the possibility that seasonal precipitation of carbonate occurred in early ice free season waters that had undergone less evaporation than during subsequent photosynthesis of aquatic cellulose an estimated 1 0 correction was applied to δ18olw we also imposed an estimated correction of 4 2 c to address the possibility of rapid carbonate precipitation and associated kinetic fractionation effects rozanski et al 2010 lake water temperatures were re calculated using the seasonal offset correction and both corrections combined we regard the raw temperature reconstruction as an estimate of the maximum possible value whereas the combined correction temperature reconstruction reflects an estimate of the minimum possible value 2 3 5 macrocharcoal analysis samples of sediment were freeze dried and passed through a 250 µm sieve the coarse portion retained on the sieve was hand picked and charcoal fragments were enumerated using a dissecting microscope charcoal fragments were identified using published charcoal morphology enache and cumming 2006 jensen et al 2007 mustaphi and pisaric 2014 macro charcoal accumulation rates mchar macro charcoal pieces cm 2 yr 1 were calculated using sedimentation rates determined by age depth modelling macro charcoal enumeration was conducted at the university of waterloo in order to identify periods of past wildfires mchar values were decomposed using published approaches clark and royall 1996 long et al 1998 higuera et al 2010 macro charcoal accumulation rates were interpolated into 2 year intervals representing the median age span of analyzed sediment sections background charcoal concentrations were estimated by fitting a robust locally weighted regression to log x 1 transformed interpolated mchar values using a 30 year smoothing window cleveland 1979 higuera et al 2010 a transform index detrending model was chosen to develop an interpolated mchar index using estimated background and total mchar values higuera et al 2010 the transformation index was calculated by dividing log x 1 transformed interpolated mchar values by estimated log x 1 transformed background mchar values a threshold value of 1 4 for the mchar index was selected by comparing mchar values and the associated error in the age depth model with published wildfire records for alberta government of alberta 2017 higuera et al 2010 mchar index values greater than this threshold were used to infer localized wildfire events 2 3 6 numerical analyses and data visualization numerical analyses and data visualization were conducted using r statistical language version 3 6 0 r core team 2019 c2 data analysis version 1 7 7 juggins 2014 and qgis version 3 4 2 maderia qgis development team 2019 core r packages were used in addition to analogue simpson and oksanen 2020 rbacon blaauw and christen 2019 and rioja juggins 2020 packages 3 results and interpretation 3 1 sediment core chronologies radiometric analysis was used to develop chronologies for one sediment core from each of the three sites t1 s2 c2 t2 s3 c1 and t2 s4 c1 fig 2 total 210pb activity declined with depth in all cores reaching background or supported 210pb activity between 18 0 and 30 0 cm depth fig 2 stratigraphic profiles of 137cs activity suggested cesium mobility in all cores and therefore it could not be used to confirm crs modelled dates bayesian model results produced mean core bottom ages of 1682 for t1 s2 c2 1731 for t2 s3 c1 and 1792 for t2 s4 c1 fig 2 core bottom ages for paired cores aligned using wiggle matching of loi profiles were 1711 for t1 s2 c1 and 1749 for t2 s3 c2 3 2 hydroecological reconstruction select physical geochemical and biological variables measured in cores collected from the three sample locations are presented in fig 3 to highlight key findings about variation in hydroecological conditions during the past ca 325 years at mcclelland lake key variables to inform our interpretations include inorganic particle size sediment organic matter content organic carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of the sediment fine fraction 250 µm and coarse macrophyte remains δ13corg and δ15n respectively cellulose inferred lake water δ18o values δ18olw relative to the range of contemporary measured lake water δ18o values carbonate oxygen isotope composition δ18ocarb lake water temperature inferred from δ18olw and δ18ocarb indicator pigments for total algal production as the sum concentration of chlorophyll a and derivatives and abundance of purple sulphur bacteria as the sum concentration of okenone rhodopin and rhodovibrin benthic cyanobacteria as scytonemin and diatoms as diatoxanthin relative abundances of select diatom taxa long navicula species small fragilaroid taxa aulacoseira species and other centric diatom taxa and the macrocharcoal index relative lake level is semi quantitatively inferred based on macrophyte remains diatom community composition stable isotope compositions and inorganic particle size distributions also included are mean annual air temperature and annual precipitation data for the past 100 years measured at fort mcmurray alberta by environment and climate change canada five hydroecological phases were delineated through qualitative inspection of stratigraphic variations and numerical analyses of all measured sedimentary variables separately for all cores used in this study and used as a descriptive tool to reconstruct the environmental history of mcclelland lake in coherent time periods detailed stratigraphic profiles of loss on ignition elemental c n ratios stable isotope ratios pigment concentrations and diatom community composition in select cores are included in the supplemental material figs s1 s5 table s1 3 2 1 phase i ca 1695 1750 the earliest phase ca 1695 1750 fig 3 corresponds with a peak of cold arid conditions of the little ice age lia luckman 2000 only the sediment cores collected from site t1 s2 included this phase sediments from this phase were organic rich 80 and peaty the minor 20 inorganic fraction consisted mainly of silt with some sand and rare gravel which is coarser than inorganic sediment deposited during the subsequent phases when organic content became substantially lower relatively coarse inorganic sediments suggest frequent contributions or in washing from the catchment håkanson and jansson 1983 as soils in the mcclelland lake watershed are silt and sand rich natural regions committee 2006 both coarse and fine sediment fractions had similarly low δ15n values ranging from 4 3 to 0 5 fig 3 as well as relatively low δ13corg values range 29 6 to 23 5 fig s2 and c n ratios range 11 99 13 26 fig s2 low δ13corg and c n ratios are generally indicative of organic matter sourced from aquatic primary production lazerte and szalados 1982 leng et al 2005 meyers 1994 low δ15n values have been associated with macrophyte production leng et al 2005 and atmospheric nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria gu 2009 peterson and fry 1987 talbot 2001 conspicuous organic fragments and seeds of najas flexilis slender naiad a submergent aquatic plant nuphar variegata yellow pondlily a floating leaved aquatic plant and potamogeton friesii fries pondweed a submergent aquatic plant were observed during core sectioning and sample processing together this suggests that habitat in mcclelland lake was dominated by submergent floating leaved and emergent macrophytes the presence of n variagata seeds suggests that lake levels were lower than present at site t1 s2 present day water depth 4 2 m as this species is only found in shallow water typically 2 m deep dieffenbacher krall and halteman 2000 nichols 1999 following the study by dieffenbacher krall and halteman 2000 who used seeds found in lake sediments as a tool to infer lake depth we infer that lake levels were 2 0 2 5 m lower than present day during this phase mcclelland lake was likely much smaller than present and restricted to the present day boomerang shaped deep water region at the east end of the present day lake fig 4 algal communities present were likely diverse but consisted mainly of benthic and epiphytic taxa and those tolerant of higher uv exposure due to lower lake levels such as scytonemin producing cyanobacteria fig 3 presence of the pigments okenone rhodopin and rhodovibrin produced by strictly anaerobic purple sulphur bacteria family chromatiaceae madigan and jung 1995 identifies that lake bottom waters were anoxic at least seasonally long duration of ice cover and relatively small lake volume likely fostered seasonal anoxia hypoxia as a consequence of organic matter decomposition 3 2 2 phase ii ca 1750 1840 the second phase ca 1750 1840 fig 3 includes the end of the lia luckman 2000 when climate warmed after a preceding colder period sediment organic matter content decreased sharply from approximately 75 in phase i to approximately 25 at the onset of phase ii despite this change macrophyte remains and coarse organic fragments remained relatively abundant a sharp increase in sediment clay content from 1 to 50 occurred after ca 1770 identifying increased supply of fine grained inorganic sediment to the lake and or redistribution of fine mineral sediment within the lake håkanson and jansson 1983 the increase in fine grained inorganic sediments and marked decline of organic matter content fig 3 suggest potential suppression of algal primary production in the water column and or a decline in organic matter preservation while remains of n variegata were no longer found among the macrophyte fragments of this phase seeds of p friesii were still present given n variegata requires shallow water habitats but potamogeton can grow in deeper water dieffenbacher krall and halteman 2000 we infer that lake levels likely increased during this period to approximately 0 5 1 0 m lower than present i e maximum depth was 4 0 4 5 m water balance remained relatively stable and strongly influenced by evaporation during this phase indicated by relatively consistent values of cellulose inferred δ18olw mean sd 10 6 0 6 that are slightly lower than the estimated modern isotope value where evaporation is equal to inflow for lakes in the nearby peace athabasca delta δssl 9 18 remmer et al 2018 carbonate δ18o values were relatively high likely driven by both evaporation and relatively low isotope inferred water temperatures 4 19 c higher inferred water level and warming climate coincided with increased algal production and a proliferation and diversification of the benthic and epiphytic diatom community as indicated by increased concentrations of algal pigments figs 3 s4 relatively high concentrations of diatom frustules compared to later phases fig s3 and high δ13corg values fig 3 the dominant diatom taxa are those that occupy mainly benthic and epiphytic habitats including cymbellafalsa diluviana long navicula species and amphora species fig s3 fragilaria capucina and f tenera were also relatively abundant during this phase fig s3 however these taxa are relatively adaptable and can occupy both planktonic and periphytic habitats rühland and smol 2002 2005 potentially indicating a modest expansion of planktonic habitat in the lake as water levels increased the composition of the diatom community indicates limnological conditions during this phase were likely slightly more acidic than at present with higher water column concentrations of doc and total nitrogen rühland and smol 2002 2005 moser et al 2004 increased abundance of pigments from purple sulfur bacteria fig 3 indicates continued seasonal anoxia likely driven by higher lake primary production macrocharcoal analysis detected 2 3 episodes of substantial local wildfire but these episodes resulted in few if any discernable changes in the sedimentary variables analyzed 3 2 3 phase iii ca 1840 1900 the third phase ca 1840 1900 fig 3 was defined by notable change in several paleolimnological variables marked declines in δ13corg and δ18ocarb were observed as well as greater variation of cellulose inferred δ18olw values which suggest a period of increased hydrologic variability carbonate δ18o values declined likely in response to a rise in isotope inferred water temperature 8 26 oc relative to phase ii as the climate warmed following the end of the lia inorganic sediment grain size sediment organic matter content and δ15n did not vary greatly during this phase increasing concentrations of several algal pigments fig s3 suggests a shift in algal community composition driven by steady increases in algal production by several algal groups leng et al 2005 likely in response to increasing water temperatures and associated longer growth season duration fig 3 the disappearance of purple sulfur bacterial pigments fig 3 supports increasing lake levels greater wind driven water column mixing and or longer ice free season which would have reduced the incidence and duration of lake bottom anoxia abundant fine sediments obscured the few diatom frustules present in sediments during this phase making quantitative diatom enumeration impossible the few identifiable diatom remains visible were from heavily silicified taxa thus variation in lake depth temperature ph zooplankton grazing and or post depositional bioturbation could have resulted in poorer preservation of diatom frustules battarbee et al 2001 hassan et al 2018 ryves et al 2003 2006 2013 increases in macrocharcoal index values ca 1840 indicate a period 10 years of extensive frequent wildfire activity around the lake or possibly one major wildfire event fire could be a potential driver of the variable hydrological and limnological conditions in mcclelland lake at the onset of this phase while the inferred conditions during phase iii appear well supported by the data we cannot exclude the possibility that other interpretations of the hydroecological conditions are possible given the complex morphometry of the lake i e extensive shallow margin with small deep water basin and underlying karst bedrock porous for groundwater movement it is possible that decline of lake levels could have resulted in values measured in the paleolimnological variables during the second half of phase iii for example rise of cellulose inferred δ18olw values to those approaching present day δssl combined with rising isotope inferred water temperature could suggest increased evaporative drawdown of lake levels decline of water level could lead to transport of fine sediment from the littoral zones and to the deep water basin and result in the abundant fine sediments observed on diatom slides resultant increase in influence of groundwater flux undersaturated in silica on water balance of a reduced lake that occupied only the deep water basin could account for dissolution of lightly silicified diatom frustules rippey 1983 ryves et al 2006 2009 despite uncertainty of interpretations for the second half of phase iii inference of increased water depth during the first half of phase iii is well supported by sharp decline of cellulose inferred δ18olw values indicative of positive water balance fig 3 marked rise in inorganic sediment particle size fig s5 and increase of sediment on diatom slides figs 3 s3 via transport to the coring site by input waters and loss of pigments from purple sulfur bacteria indicating loss of deep water anoxia figs 3 s4 3 2 4 phase iv ca 1900 1970 the fourth phase ca 1900 1970 fig 3 was characterized by rising δ13corg values core t2 s3 fig 3 sharp increases and high concentrations of several algal pigments fig s4 a shift to dominance of epiphytic and fragilarioid diatom taxa and the appearance of planktonic aulacoseira taxa figs 3 s3 relatively low cellulose inferred δ18olw values 12 during ca 1910 1950 indicates reduced influence of evaporation and strongly positive lake water balance and rising values after 1920 are indicative of a shift towards increasing importance of evaporation carbonate δ18o values continue to decline during most of this phase mainly in response to shifting hydrological conditions given isotope inferred water temperatures 8 25 oc are similar to phase iii an abrupt increase in δ18ocarb values between ca 1950 and 1970 appears to be in response to an increase in evaporation as influence of evaporation increased during the latter portion of phase iv increases in algal production were observed indicated by increase in concentrations of several pigments and rise of δ13corg values fig 3 and increase in concentrations of diatoms and chrysophyte stomatocysts fig s3 peak algal production during this phase ca 1940 1965 was coincident with the appearance of other planktonic diatoms including cyclotella spp and tabellaria flocculosa their presence suggests deeper water levels in mcclelland lake during this phase and stronger stratification of the water column that persisted until the end of this phase rühland and smol 2002 moser et al 2004 the diatom community during this phase differed markedly from previous phases and was composed mainly of small fragilarioid and achnanthoid taxa figs 3 s3 these taxa are tolerant of lower light availability and are associated with abundant submergent macrophyte growth as many achnanthoid and some fragilarioid species are epiphytic more alkaline conditions and higher dic and lower doc concentrations rühland and smol 2002 2005 moser et al 2004 several small wildfires reconstructed using macrocharcoal in the sediment record occurred during the ca 1950s and 1960s fig 3 in agreement with the historical wildfire record government of alberta 2017 wildfire activity as well as changing lake level likely resulted in more turbid waters shifting the diatom community from dominance by large benthic species during the first two phases of lake history to small disturbance tolerant benthic species during phase iv figs 3 s3 3 2 5 phase v ca 1970 2018 the fifth phase ca 1970 2018 fig 3 is marked by rising sediment organic matter content cellulose inferred δ18olw fig 3 relative abundance of benthic diatom taxa and diatom chrysophyte ratio fig s3 and by declining δ13corg values fig 3 and concentration of pigments produced by green algae and cryptophytes fig s4 during this phase cellulose inferred δ18olw values increase steadily from 11 0 to 9 2 and approach contemporary measured lake water δ18o values fig 3 indicating continued increase in importance of evaporation which aligns with declining total annual precipitation and warming air temperature in the meteorological record a brief excursion to the highest cellulose inferred δ18olw values in the mid 2010s may reflect increasingly arid conditions increasing isotope inferred water temperature 11 28 c relative to phase iv also corresponds with rising mean annual air temperature increasing concentration of algal pigments and diatom concentrations figs 3 s3 s4 indicate increasing algal production during this phase perhaps in response to climate warming and associated longer growth season duration fig 3 changes in pigment concentrations figs 3 s4 indicate that increasing total algal production is associated with rise in chlorophyte cyanobacteria and diatom biomass a sharp increase in diatom chrysophyte ratio fig s3 suggests possible nutrient enrichment favouring the production of diatoms over chrysophytes smol 1985 warmer drier conditions may be slowly lowering lake level leading to increased relative abundance of benthic diatoms such as cymbellafalsa diluviana and long navicula spp which were previously abundant when low inferred lake levels occurred during phase ii recent post 2000 increases in centric planktonic diatoms suggest a longer ice free season and greater availability of planktonic habitat fig 3 rühland and smol 2005 similar changes in diatom community composition have been reconstructed at lakes throughout the aosr libera et al 2020 summers et al 2017 2019 several wildfires occurred during the 1980s and 2000s with macrocharcoal reconstructed events agreeing with the documented wildfire record government of alberta 2017 4 discussion 4 1 summary of the mcclelland lake multi proxy stratigraphic record in this study we used multiple lake sediment cores to reconstruct the past ca 325 years of environmental history of mcclelland lake from analysis of several key paleolimnological variables results were used to identify five distinctive phases characterized by differing climatic hydrological and ecological conditions the first phase ca 1695 1750 included the little ice age lia when lake depth in mcclelland lake was inferred to be 2 m or less i e 2 0 2 5 m lower than at present fig 4 and primary production was dominated by macrophytes and benthic and epiphytic diatom taxa phase ii ca 1750 1840 was a period of inferred lake expansion due to rising water levels and was accompanied by a proliferation of primary production as the climate warmed following the end of the lia a period of inferred hydrologic variability followed during phase iii ca 1840 1900 marked by increase of isotope inferred water temperature and poor diatom frustules preservation phase iv ca 1900 1970 was characterized by a return to relative hydrological stability and increased lake levels with high concentrations of algal pigments and a diatom community dominated by small epiphytic taxa phase v ca 1970 2018 was marked by increases in several variables that indicated rising isotope inferred water temperatures and primary production lower lake levels and relatively frequent wildfires meteorological records during phase v align with the water temperature and lake level reconstructions the paleolimnological record provides a detailed account of past hydrological and ecological conditions at mcclelland lake the largely coherent reconstruction is indicative of the strength of our extensive multi proxy approach which furnishes opportunity to consider an appropriate interval of time to define the natural range of variability nrv 4 2 temporal bounds for defining natural ranges of variability nrvs the term natural range of variability nrv is a concept used to describe the range of environmental conditions prior to potentially deleterious human activities also referred to as the normal range or baseline conditions in the literature this concept aims to define relevant environmental conditions prior to onset of anthropogenic activity or those conditions representative of acceptable normal or unimpacted ecosystems kilgour et al 2015 typically the natural range of variability is characterized prior to development through monitoring and the systematically collected data are considered relevant and representative of the natural range despite issues with duration and frequency of pre development monitoring and potential for effects due to timing resulting in poor representation of the true range of natural variability schmitt and osenberg 1996 in this study very few contemporary monitoring data are available for mcclelland lake and so a paleolimnological approach was identified as the preferred method to reconstruct pre development conditions as a result we are faced with the opposite problem an abundance of pre development data characterizing several phases of lake history given the abundance of data and extensive amount of time the stratigraphic record comprises the relevance and representativeness of the reconstructed data and the timeframe for defining nrvs for mcclelland lake require evaluation setting the timeframe for defining nrvs for mcclelland lake requires careful consideration of the modern environmental setting for the lake and the goals for a monitoring program including anticipation of potential future impacts from development activities within the catchment the expected project life span and the value system s of the multiple stakeholders involved in the future of mcclelland lake while the explicit definition of nrvs for mcclelland lake and the development and application of methods for their quantification are outside the scope of this paper below we discuss the merits and potential drawbacks of various temporal bounds that could be used to define nrvs for mcclelland lake based on scientific understanding indeed this critical decision is needed to inform definition and quantification of nrvs ultimately to develop an effective monitoring program capable of detecting changes attributable to local development guidance on nrv definition and quantification should be provided by all stakeholders and founded on rigorous scientific monitoring frameworks several studies have demonstrated effects of anthropogenic climate change on lakes in northern alberta and that hydroecological changes are already underway kurek et al 2013 summers et al 2016 2017 meteorological data for the aosr indicate warming air temperatures and declining annual precipitation since about 1970 our paleolimnological results indicate the hydroecological responses to these climatic changes at mcclelland lake include increasing primary production shifts in algal community composition warmer isotope inferred water temperatures and rising influence of evaporation on water balance with continued climate change expected in the aosr the time period used to define nrvs should capture climatic and environmental conditions and trends expected in the future phase i ca 1680 1750 occurred during the lia a period of cooler and drier climate luckman 2000 when the lake was significantly smaller in area than at present peat rich sediments accumulated at the bottom of the deep water basin of mcclelland lake at this time which are absent during the subsequent four phases the smaller lake area lower water levels and very different sediment characteristics during phase i suggest that this phase may not be relevant to the modern day at the nearby peace athabasca delta paleolimnological evidence identified near complete desiccation of a perched basin during the lia hydrological conditions that are also outside the range of variability since that time wolfe et al 2005 although lower water levels in lakes and ponds are anticipated for this region based on climate change models thompson et al 2017 we suggest the analogous conditions during phase i are unlikely to be environmentally relevant to the current lake state we consider these conditions to be outside the limits of acceptable change gell 2017 for defining nrvs upon which change induced by future potential mining development should be evaluated paleolimnological data at mcclelland lake during subsequent phases ii through v reveal marked variation in lake levels from lower to higher than at present and water balance and associated changes in biotic communities sediment composition nutrient cycling and aquatic productivity these data appear well suited for defining nrvs capable of capturing a range of potential future ecosystem states due to the potentially combined effects of mining development within the lake s catchment and regional climate change including increase and decrease of water inputs relative to losses despite somewhat cooler conditions reconstructed hydroecological conditions at mcclelland lake during phase ii ca 1750 1840 have the potential to resemble anticipated lower lake and pond levels caused by ongoing climate change thompson et al 2017 this phase included demonstrably lower water levels in mcclelland lake while the lake maintained a similar area to present the inclusion of phase ii in defining nrvs would thus likely accommodate analogous future conditions in mcclelland lake due to processes unrelated to mining development within the catchment such as climate induced lower water levels the observed variability reconstructed during phase iii including potential influence of one or more wildfires is highly likely to occur in the future of the lake as wildfire frequency and extent are expected to increase with continued climate change de groot et al 2013 phase iv encompasses the most recent conditions in the lake that are similar to present but still prior to industrial development in the aosr finally phase v includes the current state of the lake and includes effects of recent regional climate change although we recommend that 1750 to present is the relevant time period for defining nrvs for mcclelland lake based on paleolimnological data spanning phases ii through v arguments can be made to include or exclude some portions of these temporal bounds the two most recent phases phases iv and v span just over a century and capture a period of rising air and isotope inferred water temperatures declining precipitation and increasing influence of evaporation on lake water balance at mcclelland lake hydroecological conditions during these phases likely represent the narrowest definition of the range of natural variability for mcclelland lake that are most similar to present and near future conditions thus phases iv and v may be sufficient for quantitative definition of nrvs for the lake upon which a monitoring program can be based with a sound scientific basis the nrvs will not capture a broader range of natural variation experienced by the lake during preceding phases but this approach would result in conservative nrvs ensuring strong protection for mcclelland lake and greater likelihood of change detection this could be a preferred and beneficial approach for early detection and warning of changes in the lake which could prompt enhanced surveillance of lake conditions and possibly additional studies on the other hand narrower temporal definition of nrvs comes with increased likelihood of detecting a false positive or committing type i error i e detection of hydroecological changes at mcclelland lake that are not a result of mining development but instead are a result of other factors such as regional climate change investigation of false positives would result in increased expenditure of time and resources for developers who are not responsible for these changes conversely inclusion of older phases ii and iii that highlight the dynamic nature of mcclelland lake and past responses to differing climatic conditions and disturbance events including wildfires will lead to broader definition of nrvs and are more likely to encompass hydroecological changes that have potential to occur with ongoing climate change a broader definition may more accurately reflect the true nature of variability in mcclelland lake from an environmental perspective as it more fulsomely acknowledges the pre development history of the lake however a broad definition would be less sensitive to departures from the range of natural variability and provide protection for developers in avoiding unnecessary studies broader definition would however increase the likelihood of false negatives or committing type ii error i e not detecting changes caused by development to minimize the likelihood of detection errors and help discern effects due to local mining development versus climate change monitoring programs could utilize one or more reference sites this would afford the lake greater protection while balancing the cost to developers implementing monitoring programs by incorporating a regional hydroecological definition of natural variability arciszewski and munkittrick 2015 hanson 2011 lindenmayer and likens 2010 ultimately decisions to include or exclude phases of the natural environmental history of mcclelland lake should be made collaboratively by all stakeholders involved in any development project s and they should be founded on solid scientific principles stakeholder priorities and risk management frameworks careful attention should be paid to balancing potential risk of harm to the environment with risk of harm to the industrial development such that the likelihood of false negatives is equal to that of false positives as has been done for federal environmental effects monitoring eem programs in canada environment canada eccc 2012 part of managing these risks is understanding the implications of various temporal bounds for defining the range of natural variability for mcclelland lake which can be informed using the paleolimnological reconstruction presented herein once the temporal bounds have been established by stakeholders the range of natural variability can be quantified while beyond the scope of this study various perspectives methods and issues in quantitatively defining natural ranges of variability have been discussed in the literature e g barrett et al 2015 kilgour et al 1998 kilgour et al 2015 munkittrick and arciszewski 2017 5 conclusion paleolimnological analyses of multiple sediment cores have revealed temporally dynamic hydroecological conditions at mcclelland lake during the past ca 325 years water levels water balance water clarity primary production algal community composition and abundance sediment properties and nutrient cycling have responded to past climatic variations and disturbance events here we use these data to suggest that pre impact baselines or natural ranges of variation nrvs be defined using phases ii through iv of the five phase history which span the past 270 years since ca 1750 of the ca 325 year long sediment record obtained in this study phase ii ca 1750 1840 captured lake conditions during the end of the cool arid little ice age which may not provide good analogues to future projected climatic conditions but it captured a period of lower lake levels and inferred seasonal anoxia which could be possible under future climate change scenarios ultimately the timeframe used to bound definitions of nrvs should be decided collaboratively by all stakeholders and based on scientific rigour stakeholder priorities and risk management frameworks approaches and formulae for quantitative definition of nrvs for paleolimnological variables as well as monitoring programs can then be developed after consensus has been reached on relevant timeframes for defining natural variation we echo previous authors in championing the use of paleolimnology as a valuable approach for characterizing baseline ecosystem condition and we further support the incorporation of paleolimnology during the

8066,study region mcclelland lake athabasca oil sands region study focus effective environmental monitoring requires knowledge of inherent natural variation in the absence of pre development monitoring of aquatic ecosystems paleolimnological approaches have been championed as a scientifically rigorous method to define pre development conditions motivated by regulatory processes and absence of pre development data we conducted a comprehensive paleolimnological study at mcclelland lake to determine an appropriate timeframe for defining natural ranges of variation nrvs in hydroecological variables before potential onset of mining within its catchment new hydrological insights for the region during the past 325 years five distinctive intervals of hydroecological conditions were identified the first phase ca 1695 1750 coincided with the little ice age lia when arid conditions supported lake levels 2 6 3 5 m below present phase ii ca 1750 1840 encompassed subsequent warming lake level rise to 1 2 2 6 m below present and increased aquatic productivity phase iii included frequent natural disturbance by wildfires ca 1840 1900 during phase iv ca 1900 1970 the lake deepened and algal communities diversified phase v post 1970 captured influence of regional industrial development climate warming and lake level decline and wildfires we propose quantitative definitions of nrvs for mcclelland lake be derived from paleolimnological indicators since 1750 which provide a conservative and relevant range of hydroecological conditions and explore merits and drawbacks of shorter duration nrv definition for monitoring change keywords paleolimnology athabasca oil sands region environmental baseline natural range of variation monitoring hydroecology 1 introduction environmental monitoring programs are designed to detect if and when deleterious changes occur to aquatic ecosystems because of human activities effective monitoring frameworks for major industrial projects hinge on comparing measurements on samples collected during and after the project has begun to pre development conditions to detect departures from natural or reference conditions arciszewski et al 2017b however long term monitoring programs often are not implemented until after a development has begun or a potential anthropogenic effect has been observed in the environment in these situations the characterization of pre development conditions of aquatic ecosystems is poor or missing which challenges the capability to detect industry driven change lindenmayer and likens 2010 smol 2008 the use of reference sites i e other ecosystems assumed to be similar to the hypothetical pre development or normal conditions can strengthen monitoring programs but can be problematic as reference sites are assumed to mimic the focal ecosystem through time including interannual natural variability yet this assumption may not always hold true see arciszewski and munkittrick 2015 in canada current regulatory requirements frequently require or necessitate the collection of pre development data such processes include the impact assessment process under the canadian impact assessment act impact assessment act iaa 2019 and environmental assessment program in alberta government of alberta 2013 however this is often limited to short term assessments which may not adequately characterize the natural variability of the ecosystem s in question in the athabasca oil sands region aosr systematic aquatic ecosystem monitoring began almost 30 years after initial industrial exploitation of the abundant bituminous sand deposits dowdeswell et al 2010 humphries 2008 in the absence of sufficient pre development monitoring data paleolimnology the scientific analysis of sediment cores to reconstruct past changes in environmental conditions of aquatic basins has been championed as a source of hydroecological and or geochemical information to characterize the natural range of variation for aquatic ecosystems and contaminant deposition in the aosr arciszewski et al 2017a dowdeswell et al 2010 klemt et al 2021 mills et al 2017 munkittrick and arciszewski 2017 somers et al 2018 lake sediments typically accrete vertically preserving an archive of components of the lake ecosystem as well as contributions from its catchment and regional airmasses sediments deeper in this natural archive reflect older pre development periods of ecosystem history stratigraphic analysis of lake sediment cores allows for inferences to be made about past lake and environmental conditions and qualitative to quantitative reconstructions of environmental change and natural ranges of variability can be defined to establish baseline conditions before potential impact from industrial activities contemporary monitoring programs can integrate paleolimnological reconstructions to enhance their ability to detect changes during and after development thereby supporting ecosystem protection information preserved in lake sediment cores has been critical to characterize the pre development conditions of the aosr and to define the area enriched by contaminants of concern emitted from oil sands industrial development which is currently considered to be within about 50 km of fort mackay ab e g cooke et al 2017 hazewinkel et al 2008 jautzy et al 2013 klemt et al 2020 2021 kurek et al 2013 summers et al 2016 wiklund et al 2012 these studies agree well with spatial analysis of snowpack samples throughout the aosr kelly et al 2009 2010 cho et al 2014 kirk et al 2014 manzano et al 2016 other paleolimnological studies have focused on environmental and ecological conditions in lakes regional hydroclimatology and changes due to climatic trends e g curtis et al 2010 summers et al 2016 2019 these studies have been instrumental in quantifying and expanding our understanding of the magnitude and extent of industrial effects within the aosr as well as elucidating aspects of the pre development history of the region despite common advocacy paleolimnological data have yet to be used proactively by industry in the aosr to quantify the range of natural variation for use by monitoring programs to improve ability to detect if and when environmental change has occurred as a result of industrial development ongoing resource development interests within the northern aosr prompted a study of the mcclelland lake watershed located approximately 34 km nne of fort mackay ab fig 1 the watershed is located within the surface mineable region of the aosr and includes a wetland complex dominated by a large alkaline patterned fen several sinkhole lakes old growth pine forests and the fort hills landform a dissected kame that borders mcclelland lake several of these features have been identified as alberta environmentally significant areas esa nos 633 638 679 mcclelland lake is used as a staging area for numerous waterfowl species and as nesting habitat for bald eagle haliaeetus leucocephalus and sandhill crane antigone canadensis two sensitive species of concern sweetgrass consultants ltd 1997 fiera biological consulting 2009 other features near the lake are also significant the patterned fen located on the western shore of the lake is one of the largest in alberta the fort hills kame and numerous sinkholes lakes located to the south and throughout the watershed respectively are both rare landforms in the boreal region and the lakes may be vulnerable to water table alteration the fort mcmurray athabasca oil sands subregional integrated resource plan alberta environment 1996 amended 2002 has restricted surface access for resource development within the eastern portion of the patterned fen as well as mcclelland lake while development is permissible in the western portion of the fen numerous guidelines in the resource plan require the maintenance of natural hydrological conditions that include seasonal variability in the wetland complex sinkhole lakes and upland tributary streams of mcclelland lake alberta environment 1996 the mcclelland lake wetland complex is located on the periphery of the area of measurable effects from industrial aosr activities including atmospheric deposition of organic contaminants and metals cho et al 2014 kelly et al 2009 2010 kirk et al 2014 and as a result has received little scientific study the paucity of environmental monitoring data for mcclelland lake renders that potential disturbance to the lake from proposed future mining activities will be difficult to identify thus the objective of this study was to determine an appropriate timeframe for defining the natural range of past hydroecological conditions in mcclelland lake using a comprehensive paleolimnological approach before the potential onset of mining within its catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site mcclelland lake fig 1 is a large surface area 30 5 km2 catchment area 198 km2 shallow zmax 5 5 m alkaline mean ph 8 60 mean total alkalinity as caco3 142 mg l lake located in the aosr approximately 50 km north of the centre of oil sands industrial activity the lake is located within the firebag river watershed and is intermittently fed by runoff from surrounding streams including upper mcclelland creek the large 9 km2 adjacent patterned fen and smaller peatlands the fen and peatlands are the primary sources of runoff to the lake mcclelland lake is a seasonally closed basin intermittently drained by lower mcclelland creek as lake levels fluctuate throughout the year the water balance of the lake is thought to comprise inputs from precipitation and surface and shallow groundwater inflows along the western patterned fen and losses due to evaporation and diffuse groundwater outflow along the eastern edge of the lake lake water oxygen isotope values measured on several occasions from august 2017 august 2019 narrowly range from 10 5 to 8 7 and closely correspond to an estimate of the terminal basin isotopic steady state value where evaporation is equal to inflow δssl 9 18 for nearby lakes in the peace athabasca delta remmer et al 2018 several oil sands leases and or developments are located nearby or within the catchment of the lake the hydrogeological setting has been studied extensively to support development of resources in the area e g true north 2001 the lake and wetland complex are situated in relatively flat topography 5 m relief and are underlain by a quaternary sand aquifer 10 20 m and low permeability clay till the patterned fen has a maximum peat thickness of about 8 m and slopes gently towards the lake the orientation of strings and flarks within the fen is consistent with groundwater flow towards the lake quinton and roulet 1998 the patterned fen and lake complex are bounded by sandy upland areas of the fort hills kame to the north and south and hydraulic head distributions indicate groundwater flow within the sand aquifer from the south towards the wetland complex however the dilute geochemical composition of the peat groundwaters along the boundary of the fen and lake itself lake water specific conductance 242 μs cm do not indicate significant contributions from the underlying sand aquifer 2 2 sediment core collection this study reports analyses of sediment cores collected from three sites within the deep water basin of the lake 3 3 5 5 m fig 1 cores were collected during september 2 4 2018 using a uwitec gravity corer uwitec mondsee austria two cores were collected from each site for a total of six sediment cores sectioning was completed at 0 5 cm increments using a vertical push rod type extruder telford et al 2021 sediment samples were collected in whirlpak bags and stored in the dark at 4 c during shipping

study showed similar stratigraphic variability fig s1 implying a unified preserved lake history in the sediment records 2 3 1 sediment composition loi analysis was used to determine stratigraphic variation in water organic matter carbonate and residual mineral matter content of each sediment core smith 2003 results from loi analysis of each core were used to align core pairs from each sampling location align chronologies of sediment cores among sites and select cores for subsequent analysis fig s1 table 1 inorganic sediment particle size distributions were characterized using a horiba partica la 950v2 laser particle size analyzer at wilfrid laurier university sediments were digested using 5 sodium hypochlorite solution for 24 h at room temperature to remove organic matter mikutta et al 2005 and rinsed with deionized water until sodium hypochlorite residues were removed digested sediment samples were dispersed in 0 1 sodium hexametaphosphate solution during analysis particle size classes were defined following blott and pye 2001 2 3 2 radiometric dating age depth modelling radioisotope activities of 210pb 226ra as weighted mean 214bi and 214pb activities and 137cs were measured to quantify age depth relations in the sediment cores during the past ca 150 years sediments were freeze dried packed into 8 ml polypropylene tubes and sealed with a tfa silicone septum supelco and 1 cm3 epoxy resin devcon product no 14310 samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least 21 days prior to analysis measurements of radioisotope activities were collected using an ortec co axial hpge digital gamma ray spectrometer interfaced with maestro 32 software at the university of waterloo chronologies based on 210pb activity were developed using the constant rate of supply crs model appleby 2001 sanchez cabeza and ruiz fernández 2012 analysis of stratigraphic trends in several cores using the crs modelled age depth relationships revealed several conspicuous layers of sediments deposited throughout mcclelland lake indicating key correlated events in the lake s history these marker sediment layers contained distinct loi and particle size characteristics figs s1 s5 which were used in a bayesian age depth modelling framework blaauw and christen 2019 to develop more consistent age depth relations among sediment cores including beyond the range of the crs models markov chain monte carlo model convergence an indication that the markov chain had reached a stationary distribution was determined using the gelman and rubin reduction factor brooks and gelman 1997 2 3 3 phototrophic community abundance and composition of past communities of phototrophs were reconstructed from analysis of photosynthetic pigments diatom frustules and chrysophyte stomatocysts preserved in the sediments pigments were extracted following established methods briefly freeze dried sediments were soaked in a solution of acetone methanol and water 80 15 5 by volume for 24 h at 20 c and filtered through 0 22 μm filters the filtrate was dried under inert n2 gas and the residue was stored at 20 c until analysis dried pigments were re eluted in 500 µl of injection solution using sudan ii as an internal standard leavitt and findlay 1994 and were injected into a waters hplc reverse phase system fitted with a symmetry c18 column the system was run following methods by mantoura and llewellyn 1983 as modified by leavitt et al 1989 pigments were identified based on their retention times and elution sequence and comparison of their spectra to known standards jeffrey et al 1997 roy et al 2011 identified pigments were assigned to specific groups of phototrophs including algae and bacteria ringelberg 1980 jeffrey et al 1997 steinman et al 1998 pandolfini et al 2000 buchaca and catalan 2007 romero viana et al 2010 roy et al 2011 hplc analysis was conducted at the university of waterloo microscope slides used to analyze diatoms and stomatocysts were prepared from wet sediment subsamples digested in a 10 hcl solution followed by a 30 h2o2 solution consistent with methods reported by renberg 1990 and hall and smol 1996 a known number of microspheres were added to the resulting cleaned diatom slurries for each sample to determine diatom valve and chrysophyte stomatocyst concentrations battarbee and keen 1982 diatom slurries were then dispensed onto circular coverslips air dried and mounted onto slides using naphrax diatom slides were analyzed using a zeiss axioskop ii plus oil immersion compound light microscope diatom taxonomy followed krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1991 and lavoie et al 2008 ecological and habitat preferences for diatom taxa followed established literature studies in northern canada e g moser et al 2004 rühland et al 2002 summers et al 2019 diatom and chrysophytes stomatocyst enumeration were conducted at the university of waterloo 2 3 4 stable isotope geochemistry 2 3 4 1 organic carbon nitrogen stable isotope analysis organic carbon c and nitrogen n elemental content and stable isotope ratios were determined on two sediment components fine fraction organic materials and coarse macrophyte remains subsamples of wet sediment were treated with 10 hcl at 80 oc for 2 h to remove carbonates and subsequently washed with deionized water until neutral samples were then freeze dried and were sieved into coarse 250 µm and fine fractions 250 µm plant fragments and seeds from the coarse fraction 250 µm were hand picked and described qualitatively seeds were identified using published taxonomic guides and reference collections martin and barkley 1961 brayshaw 2000 myrbo et al 2011 one sample of small shiny lanceolate seeds from t2 s2 c1 73 5 cm was submitted for identification to paleoscapes archaeobotancial services team llc past in bailey colorado usa fragments were examined under a bausch and lomb stereozoom microscope at magnifications of 10 70x plant fragments from the coarse fraction and sediment from the fine fraction were analyzed for organic c and n elemental and isotope composition using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms at the university of waterloo environmental isotope laboratory stable c and n isotope ratios are reported as δ13corg units relative to the vienna peedee belemnite vpdb standard and δ15n units relative to atmospheric n air respectively analytical uncertainty was 0 2 and 0 3 for δ13corg and δ15n respectively 2 3 4 2 cellulose oxygen isotope analysis cellulose oxygen isotope composition was determined following methods detailed in wolfe et al 2001 using the acid washed fine fraction 250 µm of the sediment subsamples as described above solvent extraction bleaching and alkaline hydrolysis were used to remove non cellulose organic constituents and hydroxylamine leaching was used to remove iron and manganese oxyhydroxides the purified cellulose samples were freeze dried weighed and analyzed using a cf irms at the university of waterloo environmental isotope laboratory cellulose oxygen isotope results were used to infer lake water oxygen isotope composition δ18olw using a cellulose water oxygen isotope fractionation factor of 1 028 wolfe et al 2001 savage et al 2021 and are expressed as δ values relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard and normalized to δ18oslap analytical uncertainty was 0 4 for δ18ocell 2 3 4 3 carbonate oxygen isotope analysis carbonates in freeze dried sediment samples were analyzed using a delta v advantage mass spectrometer and a gasbench ii peripheral following established methods spötl and vennemann 2003 skrzypek and paul 2006 briefly solid carbonate samples were added to a vial flushed with helium and then acidified after a minimum digestion period of 18 h at room temperature a ctc analytics autosampler transferred evolved headspace gas to the gasbench ii where multiple injections of the sample carbon as co2 were measured versus a pure co2 monitoring gas in house standards established by analyses of nbs18 nbs19 and lsvec were analyzed as samples to permit results reported as δ18ocarb values relative to the vpdb standard with analytical uncertainty of 0 3 2 3 4 4 isotope inferred lake water temperature lake water temperature was reconstructed at 5 year increments from depth averaged δ18ocarb and δ18olw values using the calcite water equilibrium equation kim and o neil 1997 leng and marshall 2004 t c 13 8 4 58 δ 18 o carb δ 18 o lw 0 08 δ 18 o carb δ 18 o lw 2 this calculation assumes endogenic carbonate and aquatic cellulose are produced in the lake at the same time during the open water season and that carbonate precipitation occurs under equilibrium conditions to account for the possibility that seasonal precipitation of carbonate occurred in early ice free season waters that had undergone less evaporation than during subsequent photosynthesis of aquatic cellulose an estimated 1 0 correction was applied to δ18olw we also imposed an estimated correction of 4 2 c to address the possibility of rapid carbonate precipitation and associated kinetic fractionation effects rozanski et al 2010 lake water temperatures were re calculated using the seasonal offset correction and both corrections combined we regard the raw temperature reconstruction as an estimate of the maximum possible value whereas the combined correction temperature reconstruction reflects an estimate of the minimum possible value 2 3 5 macrocharcoal analysis samples of sediment were freeze dried and passed through a 250 µm sieve the coarse portion retained on the sieve was hand picked and charcoal fragments were enumerated using a dissecting microscope charcoal fragments were identified using published charcoal morphology enache and cumming 2006 jensen et al 2007 mustaphi and pisaric 2014 macro charcoal accumulation rates mchar macro charcoal pieces cm 2 yr 1 were calculated using sedimentation rates determined by age depth modelling macro charcoal enumeration was conducted at the university of waterloo in order to identify periods of past wildfires mchar values were decomposed using published approaches clark and royall 1996 long et al 1998 higuera et al 2010 macro charcoal accumulation rates were interpolated into 2 year intervals representing the median age span of analyzed sediment sections background charcoal concentrations were estimated by fitting a robust locally weighted regression to log x 1 transformed interpolated mchar values using a 30 year smoothing window cleveland 1979 higuera et al 2010 a transform index detrending model was chosen to develop an interpolated mchar index using estimated background and total mchar values higuera et al 2010 the transformation index was calculated by dividing log x 1 transformed interpolated mchar values by estimated log x 1 transformed background mchar values a threshold value of 1 4 for the mchar index was selected by comparing mchar values and the associated error in the age depth model with published wildfire records for alberta government of alberta 2017 higuera et al 2010 mchar index values greater than this threshold were used to infer localized wildfire events 2 3 6 numerical analyses and data visualization numerical analyses and data visualization were conducted using r statistical language version 3 6 0 r core team 2019 c2 data analysis version 1 7 7 juggins 2014 and qgis version 3 4 2 maderia qgis development team 2019 core r packages were used in addition to analogue simpson and oksanen 2020 rbacon blaauw and christen 2019 and rioja juggins 2020 packages 3 results and interpretation 3 1 sediment core chronologies radiometric analysis was used to develop chronologies for one sediment core from each of the three sites t1 s2 c2 t2 s3 c1 and t2 s4 c1 fig 2 total 210pb activity declined with depth in all cores reaching background or supported 210pb activity between 18 0 and 30 0 cm depth fig 2 stratigraphic profiles of 137cs activity suggested cesium mobility in all cores and therefore it could not be used to confirm crs modelled dates bayesian model results produced mean core bottom ages of 1682 for t1 s2 c2 1731 for t2 s3 c1 and 1792 for t2 s4 c1 fig 2 core bottom ages for paired cores aligned using wiggle matching of loi profiles were 1711 for t1 s2 c1 and 1749 for t2 s3 c2 3 2 hydroecological reconstruction select physical geochemical and biological variables measured in cores collected from the three sample locations are presented in fig 3 to highlight key findings about variation in hydroecological conditions during the past ca 325 years at mcclelland lake key variables to inform our interpretations include inorganic particle size sediment organic matter content organic carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of the sediment fine fraction 250 µm and coarse macrophyte remains δ13corg and δ15n respectively cellulose inferred lake water δ18o values δ18olw relative to the range of contemporary measured lake water δ18o values carbonate oxygen isotope composition δ18ocarb lake water temperature inferred from δ18olw and δ18ocarb indicator pigments for total algal production as the sum concentration of chlorophyll a and derivatives and abundance of purple sulphur bacteria as the sum concentration of okenone rhodopin and rhodovibrin benthic cyanobacteria as scytonemin and diatoms as diatoxanthin relative abundances of select diatom taxa long navicula species small fragilaroid taxa aulacoseira species and other centric diatom taxa and the macrocharcoal index relative lake level is semi quantitatively inferred based on macrophyte remains diatom community composition stable isotope compositions and inorganic particle size distributions also included are mean annual air temperature and annual precipitation data for the past 100 years measured at fort mcmurray alberta by environment and climate change canada five hydroecological phases were delineated through qualitative inspection of stratigraphic variations and numerical analyses of all measured sedimentary variables separately for all cores used in this study and used as a descriptive tool to reconstruct the environmental history of mcclelland lake in coherent time periods detailed stratigraphic profiles of loss on ignition elemental c n ratios stable isotope ratios pigment concentrations and diatom community composition in select cores are included in the supplemental material figs s1 s5 table s1 3 2 1 phase i ca 1695 1750 the earliest phase ca 1695 1750 fig 3 corresponds with a peak of cold arid conditions of the little ice age lia luckman 2000 only the sediment cores collected from site t1 s2 included this phase sediments from this phase were organic rich 80 and peaty the minor 20 inorganic fraction consisted mainly of silt with some sand and rare gravel which is coarser than inorganic sediment deposited during the subsequent phases when organic content became substantially lower relatively coarse inorganic sediments suggest frequent contributions or in washing from the catchment håkanson and jansson 1983 as soils in the mcclelland lake watershed are silt and sand rich natural regions committee 2006 both coarse and fine sediment fractions had similarly low δ15n values ranging from 4 3 to 0 5 fig 3 as well as relatively low δ13corg values range 29 6 to 23 5 fig s2 and c n ratios range 11 99 13 26 fig s2 low δ13corg and c n ratios are generally indicative of organic matter sourced from aquatic primary production lazerte and szalados 1982 leng et al 2005 meyers 1994 low δ15n values have been associated with macrophyte production leng et al 2005 and atmospheric nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria gu 2009 peterson and fry 1987 talbot 2001 conspicuous organic fragments and seeds of najas flexilis slender naiad a submergent aquatic plant nuphar variegata yellow pondlily a floating leaved aquatic plant and potamogeton friesii fries pondweed a submergent aquatic plant were observed during core sectioning and sample processing together this suggests that habitat in mcclelland lake was dominated by submergent floating leaved and emergent macrophytes the presence of n variagata seeds suggests that lake levels were lower than present at site t1 s2 present day water depth 4 2 m as this species is only found in shallow water typically 2 m deep dieffenbacher krall and halteman 2000 nichols 1999 following the study by dieffenbacher krall and halteman 2000 who used seeds found in lake sediments as a tool to infer lake depth we infer that lake levels were 2 0 2 5 m lower than present day during this phase mcclelland lake was likely much smaller than present and restricted to the present day boomerang shaped deep water region at the east end of the present day lake fig 4 algal communities present were likely diverse but consisted mainly of benthic and epiphytic taxa and those tolerant of higher uv exposure due to lower lake levels such as scytonemin producing cyanobacteria fig 3 presence of the pigments okenone rhodopin and rhodovibrin produced by strictly anaerobic purple sulphur bacteria family chromatiaceae madigan and jung 1995 identifies that lake bottom waters were anoxic at least seasonally long duration of ice cover and relatively small lake volume likely fostered seasonal anoxia hypoxia as a consequence of organic matter decomposition 3 2 2 phase ii ca 1750 1840 the second phase ca 1750 1840 fig 3 includes the end of the lia luckman 2000 when climate warmed after a preceding colder period sediment organic matter content decreased sharply from approximately 75 in phase i to approximately 25 at the onset of phase ii despite this change macrophyte remains and coarse organic fragments remained relatively abundant a sharp increase in sediment clay content from 1 to 50 occurred after ca 1770 identifying increased supply of fine grained inorganic sediment to the lake and or redistribution of fine mineral sediment within the lake håkanson and jansson 1983 the increase in fine grained inorganic sediments and marked decline of organic matter content fig 3 suggest potential suppression of algal primary production in the water column and or a decline in organic matter preservation while remains of n variegata were no longer found among the macrophyte fragments of this phase seeds of p friesii were still present given n variegata requires shallow water habitats but potamogeton can grow in deeper water dieffenbacher krall and halteman 2000 we infer that lake levels likely increased during this period to approximately 0 5 1 0 m lower than present i e maximum depth was 4 0 4 5 m water balance remained relatively stable and strongly influenced by evaporation during this phase indicated by relatively consistent values of cellulose inferred δ18olw mean sd 10 6 0 6 that are slightly lower than the estimated modern isotope value where evaporation is equal to inflow for lakes in the nearby peace athabasca delta δssl 9 18 remmer et al 2018 carbonate δ18o values were relatively high likely driven by both evaporation and relatively low isotope inferred water temperatures 4 19 c higher inferred water level and warming climate coincided with increased algal production and a proliferation and diversification of the benthic and epiphytic diatom community as indicated by increased concentrations of algal pigments figs 3 s4 relatively high concentrations of diatom frustules compared to later phases fig s3 and high δ13corg values fig 3 the dominant diatom taxa are those that occupy mainly benthic and epiphytic habitats including cymbellafalsa diluviana long navicula species and amphora species fig s3 fragilaria capucina and f tenera were also relatively abundant during this phase fig s3 however these taxa are relatively adaptable and can occupy both planktonic and periphytic habitats rühland and smol 2002 2005 potentially indicating a modest expansion of planktonic habitat in the lake as water levels increased the composition of the diatom community indicates limnological conditions during this phase were likely slightly more acidic than at present with higher water column concentrations of doc and total nitrogen rühland and smol 2002 2005 moser et al 2004 increased abundance of pigments from purple sulfur bacteria fig 3 indicates continued seasonal anoxia likely driven by higher lake primary production macrocharcoal analysis detected 2 3 episodes of substantial local wildfire but these episodes resulted in few if any discernable changes in the sedimentary variables analyzed 3 2 3 phase iii ca 1840 1900 the third phase ca 1840 1900 fig 3 was defined by notable change in several paleolimnological variables marked declines in δ13corg and δ18ocarb were observed as well as greater variation of cellulose inferred δ18olw values which suggest a period of increased hydrologic variability carbonate δ18o values declined likely in response to a rise in isotope inferred water temperature 8 26 oc relative to phase ii as the climate warmed following the end of the lia inorganic sediment grain size sediment organic matter content and δ15n did not vary greatly during this phase increasing concentrations of several algal pigments fig s3 suggests a shift in algal community composition driven by steady increases in algal production by several algal groups leng et al 2005 likely in response to increasing water temperatures and associated longer growth season duration fig 3 the disappearance of purple sulfur bacterial pigments fig 3 supports increasing lake levels greater wind driven water column mixing and or longer ice free season which would have reduced the incidence and duration of lake bottom anoxia abundant fine sediments obscured the few diatom frustules present in sediments during this phase making quantitative diatom enumeration impossible the few identifiable diatom remains visible were from heavily silicified taxa thus variation in lake depth temperature ph zooplankton grazing and or post depositional bioturbation could have resulted in poorer preservation of diatom frustules battarbee et al 2001 hassan et al 2018 ryves et al 2003 2006 2013 increases in macrocharcoal index values ca 1840 indicate a period 10 years of extensive frequent wildfire activity around the lake or possibly one major wildfire event fire could be a potential driver of the variable hydrological and limnological conditions in mcclelland lake at the onset of this phase while the inferred conditions during phase iii appear well supported by the data we cannot exclude the possibility that other interpretations of the hydroecological conditions are possible given the complex morphometry of the lake i e extensive shallow margin with small deep water basin and underlying karst bedrock porous for groundwater movement it is possible that decline of lake levels could have resulted in values measured in the paleolimnological variables during the second half of phase iii for example rise of cellulose inferred δ18olw values to those approaching present day δssl combined with rising isotope inferred water temperature could suggest increased evaporative drawdown of lake levels decline of water level could lead to transport of fine sediment from the littoral zones and to the deep water basin and result in the abundant fine sediments observed on diatom slides resultant increase in influence of groundwater flux undersaturated in silica on water balance of a reduced lake that occupied only the deep water basin could account for dissolution of lightly silicified diatom frustules rippey 1983 ryves et al 2006 2009 despite uncertainty of interpretations for the second half of phase iii inference of increased water depth during the first half of phase iii is well supported by sharp decline of cellulose inferred δ18olw values indicative of positive water balance fig 3 marked rise in inorganic sediment particle size fig s5 and increase of sediment on diatom slides figs 3 s3 via transport to the coring site by input waters and loss of pigments from purple sulfur bacteria indicating loss of deep water anoxia figs 3 s4 3 2 4 phase iv ca 1900 1970 the fourth phase ca 1900 1970 fig 3 was characterized by rising δ13corg values core t2 s3 fig 3 sharp increases and high concentrations of several algal pigments fig s4 a shift to dominance of epiphytic and fragilarioid diatom taxa and the appearance of planktonic aulacoseira taxa figs 3 s3 relatively low cellulose inferred δ18olw values 12 during ca 1910 1950 indicates reduced influence of evaporation and strongly positive lake water balance and rising values after 1920 are indicative of a shift towards increasing importance of evaporation carbonate δ18o values continue to decline during most of this phase mainly in response to shifting hydrological conditions given isotope inferred water temperatures 8 25 oc are similar to phase iii an abrupt increase in δ18ocarb values between ca 1950 and 1970 appears to be in response to an increase in evaporation as influence of evaporation increased during the latter portion of phase iv increases in algal production were observed indicated by increase in concentrations of several pigments and rise of δ13corg values fig 3 and increase in concentrations of diatoms and chrysophyte stomatocysts fig s3 peak algal production during this phase ca 1940 1965 was coincident with the appearance of other planktonic diatoms including cyclotella spp and tabellaria flocculosa their presence suggests deeper water levels in mcclelland lake during this phase and stronger stratification of the water column that persisted until the end of this phase rühland and smol 2002 moser et al 2004 the diatom community during this phase differed markedly from previous phases and was composed mainly of small fragilarioid and achnanthoid taxa figs 3 s3 these taxa are tolerant of lower light availability and are associated with abundant submergent macrophyte growth as many achnanthoid and some fragilarioid species are epiphytic more alkaline conditions and higher dic and lower doc concentrations rühland and smol 2002 2005 moser et al 2004 several small wildfires reconstructed using macrocharcoal in the sediment record occurred during the ca 1950s and 1960s fig 3 in agreement with the historical wildfire record government of alberta 2017 wildfire activity as well as changing lake level likely resulted in more turbid waters shifting the diatom community from dominance by large benthic species during the first two phases of lake history to small disturbance tolerant benthic species during phase iv figs 3 s3 3 2 5 phase v ca 1970 2018 the fifth phase ca 1970 2018 fig 3 is marked by rising sediment organic matter content cellulose inferred δ18olw fig 3 relative abundance of benthic diatom taxa and diatom chrysophyte ratio fig s3 and by declining δ13corg values fig 3 and concentration of pigments produced by green algae and cryptophytes fig s4 during this phase cellulose inferred δ18olw values increase steadily from 11 0 to 9 2 and approach contemporary measured lake water δ18o values fig 3 indicating continued increase in importance of evaporation which aligns with declining total annual precipitation and warming air temperature in the meteorological record a brief excursion to the highest cellulose inferred δ18olw values in the mid 2010s may reflect increasingly arid conditions increasing isotope inferred water temperature 11 28 c relative to phase iv also corresponds with rising mean annual air temperature increasing concentration of algal pigments and diatom concentrations figs 3 s3 s4 indicate increasing algal production during this phase perhaps in response to climate warming and associated longer growth season duration fig 3 changes in pigment concentrations figs 3 s4 indicate that increasing total algal production is associated with rise in chlorophyte cyanobacteria and diatom biomass a sharp increase in diatom chrysophyte ratio fig s3 suggests possible nutrient enrichment favouring the production of diatoms over chrysophytes smol 1985 warmer drier conditions may be slowly lowering lake level leading to increased relative abundance of benthic diatoms such as cymbellafalsa diluviana and long navicula spp which were previously abundant when low inferred lake levels occurred during phase ii recent post 2000 increases in centric planktonic diatoms suggest a longer ice free season and greater availability of planktonic habitat fig 3 rühland and smol 2005 similar changes in diatom community composition have been reconstructed at lakes throughout the aosr libera et al 2020 summers et al 2017 2019 several wildfires occurred during the 1980s and 2000s with macrocharcoal reconstructed events agreeing with the documented wildfire record government of alberta 2017 4 discussion 4 1 summary of the mcclelland lake multi proxy stratigraphic record in this study we used multiple lake sediment cores to reconstruct the past ca 325 years of environmental history of mcclelland lake from analysis of several key paleolimnological variables results were used to identify five distinctive phases characterized by differing climatic hydrological and ecological conditions the first phase ca 1695 1750 included the little ice age lia when lake depth in mcclelland lake was inferred to be 2 m or less i e 2 0 2 5 m lower than at present fig 4 and primary production was dominated by macrophytes and benthic and epiphytic diatom taxa phase ii ca 1750 1840 was a period of inferred lake expansion due to rising water levels and was accompanied by a proliferation of primary production as the climate warmed following the end of the lia a period of inferred hydrologic variability followed during phase iii ca 1840 1900 marked by increase of isotope inferred water temperature and poor diatom frustules preservation phase iv ca 1900 1970 was characterized by a return to relative hydrological stability and increased lake levels with high concentrations of algal pigments and a diatom community dominated by small epiphytic taxa phase v ca 1970 2018 was marked by increases in several variables that indicated rising isotope inferred water temperatures and primary production lower lake levels and relatively frequent wildfires meteorological records during phase v align with the water temperature and lake level reconstructions the paleolimnological record provides a detailed account of past hydrological and ecological conditions at mcclelland lake the largely coherent reconstruction is indicative of the strength of our extensive multi proxy approach which furnishes opportunity to consider an appropriate interval of time to define the natural range of variability nrv 4 2 temporal bounds for defining natural ranges of variability nrvs the term natural range of variability nrv is a concept used to describe the range of environmental conditions prior to potentially deleterious human activities also referred to as the normal range or baseline conditions in the literature this concept aims to define relevant environmental conditions prior to onset of anthropogenic activity or those conditions representative of acceptable normal or unimpacted ecosystems kilgour et al 2015 typically the natural range of variability is characterized prior to development through monitoring and the systematically collected data are considered relevant and representative of the natural range despite issues with duration and frequency of pre development monitoring and potential for effects due to timing resulting in poor representation of the true range of natural variability schmitt and osenberg 1996 in this study very few contemporary monitoring data are available for mcclelland lake and so a paleolimnological approach was identified as the preferred method to reconstruct pre development conditions as a result we are faced with the opposite problem an abundance of pre development data characterizing several phases of lake history given the abundance of data and extensive amount of time the stratigraphic record comprises the relevance and representativeness of the reconstructed data and the timeframe for defining nrvs for mcclelland lake require evaluation setting the timeframe for defining nrvs for mcclelland lake requires careful consideration of the modern environmental setting for the lake and the goals for a monitoring program including anticipation of potential future impacts from development activities within the catchment the expected project life span and the value system s of the multiple stakeholders involved in the future of mcclelland lake while the explicit definition of nrvs for mcclelland lake and the development and application of methods for their quantification are outside the scope of this paper below we discuss the merits and potential drawbacks of various temporal bounds that could be used to define nrvs for mcclelland lake based on scientific understanding indeed this critical decision is needed to inform definition and quantification of nrvs ultimately to develop an effective monitoring program capable of detecting changes attributable to local development guidance on nrv definition and quantification should be provided by all stakeholders and founded on rigorous scientific monitoring frameworks several studies have demonstrated effects of anthropogenic climate change on lakes in northern alberta and that hydroecological changes are already underway kurek et al 2013 summers et al 2016 2017 meteorological data for the aosr indicate warming air temperatures and declining annual precipitation since about 1970 our paleolimnological results indicate the hydroecological responses to these climatic changes at mcclelland lake include increasing primary production shifts in algal community composition warmer isotope inferred water temperatures and rising influence of evaporation on water balance with continued climate change expected in the aosr the time period used to define nrvs should capture climatic and environmental conditions and trends expected in the future phase i ca 1680 1750 occurred during the lia a period of cooler and drier climate luckman 2000 when the lake was significantly smaller in area than at present peat rich sediments accumulated at the bottom of the deep water basin of mcclelland lake at this time which are absent during the subsequent four phases the smaller lake area lower water levels and very different sediment characteristics during phase i suggest that this phase may not be relevant to the modern day at the nearby peace athabasca delta paleolimnological evidence identified near complete desiccation of a perched basin during the lia hydrological conditions that are also outside the range of variability since that time wolfe et al 2005 although lower water levels in lakes and ponds are anticipated for this region based on climate change models thompson et al 2017 we suggest the analogous conditions during phase i are unlikely to be environmentally relevant to the current lake state we consider these conditions to be outside the limits of acceptable change gell 2017 for defining nrvs upon which change induced by future potential mining development should be evaluated paleolimnological data at mcclelland lake during subsequent phases ii through v reveal marked variation in lake levels from lower to higher than at present and water balance and associated changes in biotic communities sediment composition nutrient cycling and aquatic productivity these data appear well suited for defining nrvs capable of capturing a range of potential future ecosystem states due to the potentially combined effects of mining development within the lake s catchment and regional climate change including increase and decrease of water inputs relative to losses despite somewhat cooler conditions reconstructed hydroecological conditions at mcclelland lake during phase ii ca 1750 1840 have the potential to resemble anticipated lower lake and pond levels caused by ongoing climate change thompson et al 2017 this phase included demonstrably lower water levels in mcclelland lake while the lake maintained a similar area to present the inclusion of phase ii in defining nrvs would thus likely accommodate analogous future conditions in mcclelland lake due to processes unrelated to mining development within the catchment such as climate induced lower water levels the observed variability reconstructed during phase iii including potential influence of one or more wildfires is highly likely to occur in the future of the lake as wildfire frequency and extent are expected to increase with continued climate change de groot et al 2013 phase iv encompasses the most recent conditions in the lake that are similar to present but still prior to industrial development in the aosr finally phase v includes the current state of the lake and includes effects of recent regional climate change although we recommend that 1750 to present is the relevant time period for defining nrvs for mcclelland lake based on paleolimnological data spanning phases ii through v arguments can be made to include or exclude some portions of these temporal bounds the two most recent phases phases iv and v span just over a century and capture a period of rising air and isotope inferred water temperatures declining precipitation and increasing influence of evaporation on lake water balance at mcclelland lake hydroecological conditions during these phases likely represent the narrowest definition of the range of natural variability for mcclelland lake that are most similar to present and near future conditions thus phases iv and v may be sufficient for quantitative definition of nrvs for the lake upon which a monitoring program can be based with a sound scientific basis the nrvs will not capture a broader range of natural variation experienced by the lake during preceding phases but this approach would result in conservative nrvs ensuring strong protection for mcclelland lake and greater likelihood of change detection this could be a preferred and beneficial approach for early detection and warning of changes in the lake which could prompt enhanced surveillance of lake conditions and possibly additional studies on the other hand narrower temporal definition of nrvs comes with increased likelihood of detecting a false positive or committing type i error i e detection of hydroecological changes at mcclelland lake that are not a result of mining development but instead are a result of other factors such as regional climate change investigation of false positives would result in increased expenditure of time and resources for developers who are not responsible for these changes conversely inclusion of older phases ii and iii that highlight the dynamic nature of mcclelland lake and past responses to differing climatic conditions and disturbance events including wildfires will lead to broader definition of nrvs and are more likely to encompass hydroecological changes that have potential to occur with ongoing climate change a broader definition may more accurately reflect the true nature of variability in mcclelland lake from an environmental perspective as it more fulsomely acknowledges the pre development history of the lake however a broad definition would be less sensitive to departures from the range of natural variability and provide protection for developers in avoiding unnecessary studies broader definition would however increase the likelihood of false negatives or committing type ii error i e not detecting changes caused by development to minimize the likelihood of detection errors and help discern effects due to local mining development versus climate change monitoring programs could utilize one or more reference sites this would afford the lake greater protection while balancing the cost to developers implementing monitoring programs by incorporating a regional hydroecological definition of natural variability arciszewski and munkittrick 2015 hanson 2011 lindenmayer and likens 2010 ultimately decisions to include or exclude phases of the natural environmental history of mcclelland lake should be made collaboratively by all stakeholders involved in any development project s and they should be founded on solid scientific principles stakeholder priorities and risk management frameworks careful attention should be paid to balancing potential risk of harm to the environment with risk of harm to the industrial development such that the likelihood of false negatives is equal to that of false positives as has been done for federal environmental effects monitoring eem programs in canada environment canada eccc 2012 part of managing these risks is understanding the implications of various temporal bounds for defining the range of natural variability for mcclelland lake which can be informed using the paleolimnological reconstruction presented herein once the temporal bounds have been established by stakeholders the range of natural variability can be quantified while beyond the scope of this study various perspectives methods and issues in quantitatively defining natural ranges of variability have been discussed in the literature e g barrett et al 2015 kilgour et al 1998 kilgour et al 2015 munkittrick and arciszewski 2017 5 conclusion paleolimnological analyses of multiple sediment cores have revealed temporally dynamic hydroecological conditions at mcclelland lake during the past ca 325 years water levels water balance water clarity primary production algal community composition and abundance sediment properties and nutrient cycling have responded to past climatic variations and disturbance events here we use these data to suggest that pre impact baselines or natural ranges of variation nrvs be defined using phases ii through iv of the five phase history which span the past 270 years since ca 1750 of the ca 325 year long sediment record obtained in this study phase ii ca 1750 1840 captured lake conditions during the end of the cool arid little ice age which may not provide good analogues to future projected climatic conditions but it captured a period of lower lake levels and inferred seasonal anoxia which could be possible under future climate change scenarios ultimately the timeframe used to bound definitions of nrvs should be decided collaboratively by all stakeholders and based on scientific rigour stakeholder priorities and risk management frameworks approaches and formulae for quantitative definition of nrvs for paleolimnological variables as well as monitoring programs can then be developed after consensus has been reached on relevant timeframes for defining natural variation we echo previous authors in championing the use of paleolimnology as a valuable approach for characterizing baseline ecosystem condition and we further support the incorporation of paleolimnology during the early design stages of monitoring programs at mcclelland lake and lakes elsewhere credit authorship contribution statement n a zabel conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation

in the eastern and mid southern regions of the glb merra 2 prectotcorr severely underestimates precipitation along the eastern shores of the great lakes within the eastern glb where lake effect snowfall is common accordingly the merra 2 prectotcorr driven hydrological modelling typically significantly underpredicts streamflow in those areas in contrast merra 2 prectotcorr performs very well for precipitation estimation and stream discharge simulations in the mid southern portion of the basin i e the southern portion of the u s state of michigan however the northernmost region of the glb exhibits streamflow overprediction from the prectotcorr driven hydrological modelling on average era5 tp overestimates precipitation especially in winter and spring accordingly era5 tp typically

2017 x xu et al 2019 with the continuous evolution of gridded precipitation products quantifying their performance is an important contribution towards hydro climatological studies the second modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 and the fifth generation of european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era5 hersbach et al 2020 represent the current state of the art in their respective atmospheric reanalysis systems i e nasa s goddard earth observing system geos model and ecmwf s integrated forecasting system ifs the two analysis products incorporate many advances in precipitation analysis as compared to other data sets in particular bias correction is employed in the merra 2 total precipitation prectotcorr reichle et al 2017 while era5 assimilates observed precipitation information hersbach et al 2020 in recent years merra 2 prectotcorr and era5 total precipitation tp have received extensive attention in hydro climatological analysis and modelling e g xu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 hamal et al 2020 kolluru et al 2020 chen et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 rivoire et al 2021 however caution should be taken while assessing and interpreting the performance of the two precipitation products for different regions since the data sources vary spatially for both era5 s precipitation assimilation scheme and merra 2 s precipitation bias correction scheme satellite precipitation information is assimilated in the era5 system for global areas but with the additional assimilation of radar rain gauge merged precipitation exclusively over the conterminous united states conus hersbach et al 2020 in merra 2 prectotcorr the precipitation over africa is fully corrected to the cmap product rescaled while a latitude dependent correction scheme using gauge only gridded precipitation analysis is applied to the remaining areas reichle et al 2017 therefore for instance it is not surprising that the cmap and merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation products indicated nearly the same drying trend over the congo river basin in africa between 1988 and 2013 y jiang et al 2019 merra 2 prectotcorr and era5 tp have been evaluated across different regions e g xu et al 2019 hamal et al 2020 kolluru et al 2020 chen et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 rivoire et al 2021 the main findings from the previous work include i era 5 tp had a good performance in capturing light or moderate precipitation xu et al 2019 kolluru et al 2020 rivoire et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 but typically resulted in biased streamflow simulations kolluru et al 2020 ii era5 tp overestimated precipitation over the northern great plains whereas prectotcorr tended to specifically underestimate summer precipitation xu et al 2019 and iii in nepal merra 2 prectotcorr underestimated observed precipitation hamal et al 2020 while era5 tp provided a precipitation overestimation y chen et al 2021 with the previous work in mind there are still outstanding questions related to regional performance characteristics for the two precipitation products firstly the bias correction scheme is latitude dependent for the merra 2 prectotcorr product with the full correction to the cpc unified daily precipitation cpcu over the 42 5 s 42 5 n land areas except for africa and null correction in high latitude lands poleward of 62 5 latitude prectotcorr is a weighted average of cpcu and merra 2 pure model precipitation between 42 5 62 5 latitudes in both hemispheres with the weight of cpcu decreasing from 1 0 at 42 5 latitude to 0 at 62 5 latitude reichle et al 2017 cpcu is a gauge only gridded precipitation analysis xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 it remains unanswered how the latitude dependent precipitation correction scheme and the rain gauge network density impact the performance of merra 2 prectotcorr in transition regions between 42 5 62 5 latitudes secondly in era5 the radar rain gauge merged precipitation estimates are assimilated exclusively over conus hersbach et al 2020 but it is not known to what extent the performance of era5 tp can be improved through the addition of radar rain gauge precipitation over conus thirdly lake effect precipitation detection continues to pose a challenge to weather and climate modelling and it is not clear how era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr perform in lake affected areas to address the aforementioned questions the study herein examines the hydrological performance of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr over the laurentian great lakes basin glb in north america the glb which straddles the u s and canadian border and contains the largest body of fresh surface water on earth is critical to the economies and ecosystems of u s and canada the glb region has also been the focus of many of hydro climatological studies e g pietroniro et al 2007 huang et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 haghnegahdar et al 2014 gaborit et al 2017 peltier et al 2018 xu et al 2015 2017a 2020 kiefer et al 2019 xu 2020 xu et al 2021 the glb basin is located between 40 and 50 n which facilitates an assessment of the impact that the linearly changing precipitation correction scheme between 42 5 62 5 latitude used in merra 2 prectotcorr has on product performance the basin straddles the u s and canadian border thus offering the opportunity to verify the added benefit from the assimilation of radar rain gauge precipitation over conus in era5 additionally lake effect precipitation is an important phenomenon within the glb norton and bolsenga 1993 liu and moore 2004 kristovich and spinar 2005 zhao et al 2012 king et al 2020 during fall and winter when very cold and dry continental arctic air masses move across the warmer great lakes the temperature and moisture differences between the lake surface and the air can lead to evaporation and trigger rapidly developing cumulus clouds or storms which in turn bring considerable lake effect precipitation to downwind shore areas hence the glb is also well suited for examining the skill of era5 and merra 2 products in detecting lake effect precipitation the present study is organized as follows section 2 outlines the reanalysis precipitation products study domain reference data hydrological model and the verification metrics for precipitation estimation and simulated streamflow section 3 presents the precipitation assessment results and is followed in section 4 by an investigation of precipitation influences on streamflow simulations finally discussion and conclusions are provided in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 data and methods 2 1 study region this work examines the hydrological performance of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr products over the glb land area the glb includes the five great lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario and the surrounding lands in the canadian province of ontario and a few u s states fig 1 in fig 1 the glb boundary is delineated based upon the aster global digital elevation model data and agrees with that as shown in other studies norton and bolsenga 1993 pietroniro et al 2007 huang et al 2012 haghnegahdar et al 2014 xu et al 2015 2017a 2017b the glb is characterized by a humid continental climate the land cover types mainly include cropland deciduous forest coniferous forest mixed forest built up urban and water bodies xu et al 2015 as previously mentioned the glb is well suited for the study herein due to its locational and physiographic characteristics that facilitate an analysis of the linearly shifting precipitation bias correction scheme between 42 5 and 62 5 latitude in merra 2 prectotcorr and the added benefit from the assimilation of radar rain gauge precipitation over conus in era5 additionally the glb is suited for evaluating the skill of the two precipitation products in estimating lake effect precipitation lake effect precipitation activities typically snowfalls play an important role in the climate of the glb e g norton and bolsenga 1993 liu and moore 2004 zhao et al 2012 notaro et al 2014 however in practice difficulties in measuring snowfall often pose a challenge for lake effect precipitation estimation the snow gauge captured snowfalls need to be converted to the water equivalent values which increases the uncertainty in measuring lake effect snowfalls further the relatively low density of the weather station network in lake effect areas may not sufficiently capture the lake effect pattern the deficiencies in weather and climate models also pose a challenge for capturing lake effect precipitation e g when the model spatial resolution is too coarse to represent the lake effect morphology notaro et al 2014 or the model lacks the sufficient representation of ice cover impacts sharma et al 2018 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 reanalysis products in this work two sets of state of the art reanalysis products era5 and merra 2 are used era5 is the latest generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis based on ecmwf s integrated forecasting system ifs cycle 41r2 hersbach et al 2020 era5 offers a higher spatial resolution 31 km and many other improvements as compared to its predecessors era interim era 40 era 15 etc including the assimilation of radar rain gauge merged precipitation ncep stage iv quantitative precipitation estimates exclusively over conus hersbach et al 2020 merra 2 is a reanalysis product derived from nasa s goddard earth observing system model version 5 12 4 geos 5 12 4 and its data assimilation system gelaro et al 2017 merra 2 represents the latest progress from nasa in atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era the released merra 2 data fields are provided at a spatial resolution of 0 5º in latitude and 0 625º in longitude a latitude dependent bias correction is employed to generate prectotcorr reichle et al 2017 specifically the merra 2 model derived precipitation is fully corrected to the cpcu product in low to midlatitude land areas equatorward of 42 5 latitude except africa but with null correction over high latitude lands poleward of 62 5 latitude over middle to high latitudes of land between 42 5 and 62 5 latitude in both hemispheres a gradually changing precipitation correction scheme was applied to ensure a linear shift from a full use of cpcu at 42 5 latitude to a full use of the merra 2 model derived precipitation at 62 5 latitude the era5 hourly data including tp surface air temperature surface incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface pressure surface dewpoint temperature and 10 meter wind and the merra 2 hourly data including prectotcorr surface air temperature surface incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface pressure surface specific humidity and surface wind speed were acquired from copernicus data and services https www copernicus eu en access data and nasa ges disc data archive https disc gsfc nasa gov respectively for the time period from january 1 2014 to december 31 2018 the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr products are herein evaluated on a daily 24 h basis using reference daily observations of precipitation whereas other quantities along with precipitation are used to drive a hydrologic model see section 2 2 3 based on the work of xu et al 2019 which demonstrated that the relative performance of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr as well as other precipitation products was not changed for three different time intervals 2002 2012 2012 2015 and 2002 2015 the 5 year time period january 1 2014 to december 31 2018 is considered sufficient to capture the performance of the two precipitation products hence the use of a longer study period would be expected to result in the same conclusions albeit with a significant increase in computational burden for the hydrological model calibration 2 2 2 reference precipitation observations daily precipitation observations from the global historical climatology network ghcn menne et al 2012 are used as the reference to validate era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr for a 5 year period extending from january 1 2014 to december 31 2018 a standard quality control procedure is employed to exclude daily points with flags indicating missing or estimated precipitation values the ghcn stations with less than 1000 valid daily precipitation observations during the 5 year study period are also excluded and only the stations shown in fig 1 are used for validation 2 2 3 hydrological model and streamflow observations the comparison of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr with the ghcn precipitation observations is the first phase of evaluation the second phase of evaluation examines the influence of the two precipitation products on hydrologic simulations environment and climate change canada s mesh modélisation environmentale communautaire surface

method as used in other models e g slater and clark 2006 xu et al 2014 skoulikaris et al 2020 the predictive capability of the mesh model for soil moisture and streamflow in the glb was well documented e g pietroniro et al 2007 haghnegahdar et al 2014 gaborit et al 2017 xu et al 2015 2017a 2017b the standalone mesh version 1 4 1398 https wiki usask ca display mesh releases is used in this work the hourly precipitation data from era5 and merra 2 are used to drive the respective mesh model simulations the same set of additional hourly meteorological forcing inputs including surface air temperature incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface wind speed pressure and specific humidity which were obtained either from the merra 2 analysis product or from the era5 analysis product see section 4 are used with the two sets of precipitation inputs for driving the mesh model to facilitate the assessment of precipitation input data influences on stream flow simulation to optimize the streamflow simulations for each precipitation input each mesh model run is calibrated to the streamflow observations for the target subbasins fig 2 based upon a global calibration scheme haghnegahdar et al 2014 the list of calibrated parameters which is same as in haghnegahdar et al 2014 includes the soil physiography properties for crop grass deciduous forest coniferous forest and mixed forest gru types the calibration objective function is formulated using the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency criterion for the square root of daily flows the model is run at a resolution of 1 6th of a degree 15 km using a time step of 30 min the calibration period is from january 1 2015 to december 31 2018 with a spin up of 365 days january 1 2014 to december 31 2014 the model calibration was conducted on the niagara supercomputer at the scinet high performance computing consortium of the university of toronto using parallel dynamically dimensioned search dds as implemented in the ostrich software matott 2017 dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 is a model independent automatic calibration algorithm for computationally expensive and heavily parameterized hydrologic models the algorithm can automatically scale the search i e from globally to locally to find the best solutions within the specified number of model evaluations by dynamically and probabilistically narrowing the parameter value search neighborhood the 18 target subbasins for streamflow evaluation are located within three distinct regions of the glb corresponding to the three boxes as shown in fig 2 with 7 subbasins in the eastern region 5 in the mid southern region and 6 in the northwestern region streamflow measurements are derived from the hydat hydrometric database at water survey of canada for the canadian subbasins and the usgs national water information system for the u s subbasins 2 3 evaluation metrics the precipitation validation is conducted at point scale i e the gridded precipitation products are resampled onto the reference stations fig 1 using a nearest neighbor approach before comparison to station observations at each reference station the mean error me mean absolute error mae root

to 1 with 1 as the optimal value 3 assessment of precipitation products 3 1 intercomparison of mean daily precipitation there is a high degree of spatial and seasonal variations in precipitation for the glb basin lake effect snowfalls can significantly enhance fall and winter precipitation in the lake effect zones adjacent to the great lakes norton and bolsenga 1993 scott and huff 1996 fig 3 presents the mean daily precipitation from era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr respectively over the glb land surfaces as indicated by era5 tp fig 3a the areas located east and south east of the great lakes typically receive the highest average winter precipitation which is mainly attributed to lake effect snowfalls lake effect precipitation is typically evident to the south and east of lake superior and along the eastern coasts of other great lakes norton and bolsenga 1993 zhao et al 2012 indeed the spatial pattern of era5 mean daily winter precipitation fig 3a is very similar to that of snowfall climatology over the basin norton and bolsenga 1993 fig 2 therein although partial lake effect precipitation such as that to the south and east of lake superior is also detected in merra 2 prectotcorr fig 3d the winter precipitation enhancement in lake effect areas relative to non lake effect regions is less evident in merra 2 prectotcorr fig 3d than in era5 tp fig 3a in particular the merra 2 prectotcorr product indicates minimum winter precipitation received in the shore areas east of lake huron fig 3d which is inconsistent with the expected heavy lake effect snowfalls in the area e g norton and bolsenga 1993 zhao et al 2012 both precipitation products indicate that the glb receives more precipitation in summer figs 3b and 3e than in winter figs 3a and 3d clearly era5 tp provides higher annual mean precipitation than merra 2 prectotcorr over the glb in the eastern glb where significant lake effect precipitation is expected era5 tp fig 3c exceeds merra 2 prectotcorr fig 3 f by up to 2 mm day for annual mean daily precipitation in contrast era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr tend to be similar in terms of annual mean precipitation for the non lake effect zones e g the western sides of the great lakes michigan and superior and the inland regions east of lake michigan 3 2 performance scores here the in situ verification performance of the two precipitation data sets is compared against reference observations from ghcn fig 4 shows the mean daily precipitation errors for era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr the era5 tp precipitation typically shows me close to or greater than 0 across the validation stations fig 4a the largest positive me i e precipitation overestimation in era5 tp tends to occur in the eastern part of the glb especially in areas located east and south east of lake ontario fig 4a in the western glb west of the 82 w meridian the era5 tp precipitation overestimation is less evident however it should be noted that reference stations are very sparse within the canadian portion of this region fig 4a merra 2 prectotcorr severely underestimates precipitation i e it shows strong negative me errors in the lake effect zones adjacent to the eastern shores of lakes huron ontario and erie fig 4b over the glb land area merra 2 prectotcorr is equivalent to cpcu in the region south of 42 5 n and is a weighted average of cpcu and merra 2 pure model derived precipitation in the area north of 42 5 n with the model s weight increasing with latitude reichle et al 2017 in the eastern glb the significant precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr is likely to stem from cpcu because the weights for the merra 2 pure model precipitation in this region are very small 0 0 15 depending upon the latitude cpcu is a gauge based gridded precipitation product xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 and the quality of cpcu analysis is highly related to the gauge network density chen et al 2008 in the eastern shore areas of lakes huron ontario and erie precipitation gauges are relatively sparse this may degrade the skill of cpcu in capturing lake effect snowfalls or summer convective precipitation events which are typically associated with considerable spatial precipitation gradients and are difficult to accurately capture by a low density gauge network e g m chen et al 2008 in contrast to the lake effect areas me is typically close to 0 for merra 2 prectotcorr in the non lake effect regions such as west of lake michigan and the inland area surrounded by lakes michigan huron and erie fig 4b in these areas located between 40 and 45 n cpcu dominates merra 2 prectotcorr and the relatively high gauge network density and less heterogeneous precipitation spatial pattern favors the performance of cpcu figs 5 and 6 present the rmse and correlation coefficient r results obtained for the two daily precipitation products it is important to note that the climatological day difference between reference daily observations and daily precipitation products under evaluation can adversely impact rmse and r results when a precipitation analysis is evaluated on a daily basis it is important to align the climatological days between the analysis and reference data as closely as possible in this study the ghcn reference precipitation observations were provided on a daily basis while the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation values were available on an hourly basis to this end using the hourly spaced data the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr daily precipitation time series should be constructed with respect to the 24 h windows that align with the climatological day for ghcn daily precipitation observations however a common climatological day does not exist for the ghcn stations because the recording time of ghcn daily precipitation varies substantially in space and for different station data sources menne et al 2012 hence for the ghcn reference stations in the u s portion of the glb the site dependent climatological days as indicated in menne table 2 therein et al 2012 are used in this study in the canadian portion most of the ghcn stations are provided by the environment and climate change canada eccc weather station network which typically has a climatological day ending at 0700 local time i e 1200 utc for the glb of the following day for daily precipitation observations hutchinson et al 2009 hopkinson et al 2011 therefore a common climatological day i e a 24 hr period ending at 1200 utc of the following day is used for all the reference stations in the canadian portion the climatological day issue has no impact on the me metric which is based upon the long term mean information the rmse values for merra 2 prectotcorr are typically around 3 0 5 0 mm day for the canadian and northern state of michigan i e the land area east of lake michigan and west of lake huron regions and about 5 0 7 0 mm day in the remaining regions fig 5b a similar spatial pattern of rmse is shown for era5 tp but with slightly greater rmse errors fig 5a mae not shown is very similar to rmse in terms of spatial pattern for both precipitation products the r values for era5 tp typically exceed 0 4 across the validation stations with overall higher r skill for the canadian region fig 6a merra 2 prectotcorr fig 6b generally provides higher r values than era5 tp fig 6a across the glb the region that shows consistently high r values exceeding 0 6 for merra 2 prectotcorr lies to the west of lake michigan fig 6b overall in the eastern glb the two precipitation products perform better in the canadian portion relative to the u s portion in terms of both rmse and r metrics which differs from the me score skill assessment fig 4 fig 7 provides the average performance scores stratified by season for the western glb west of the 82 w meridian the eastern glb east of the 82 w meridian and the entire glb respectively in the eastern glb merra 2 prectotcorr substantially underestimates mean daily precipitation for all seasons with an average me of approximately 0 4 mm day fig 7a cyan the merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation underestimation east of 82 w is larger in winter and fall me below 0 4 mm day than in summer and spring me above 0 4 mm day this may indicate that lake effect snowfall typically occurring in winter and fall is relative to summer rainfall even more underestimated by merra 2 prectotcorr in the western glb the mean precipitation from merra 2 prectotcorr tends to be very close to the reference i e the average me is close to 0 in all seasons fig 7a pink this is related to the limited lake effect snowfall and the high cpcu gauge network density in the region in addition for the lake effect precipitation that does occur in the western glb there is limited representation in the validation results as stations are very sparse for lake effect zones to the east and south of lake superior fig 4b the average me errors for era5 tp exhibit similar seasonal variability for the western fig 7a red and eastern fig 7a blue regions of the glb the average me for era5 tp is close to 0 in summer and autumn and exceeds 0 2 mm day in winter and spring with slightly greater precipitation overestimation in the eastern glb the two precipitation products both exhibit the largest mae and rmse errors in summer and the lowest mae and rmse in winter fig 7b and c this reflects the sensitivity of the two error metrics to precipitation intensity and the time series correlation between reference values and the precipitation products under assessment in summer the glb receives the largest mean precipitation and the two precipitation products exhibit the lowest correlation with the reference data fig 7d which corresponds to the large mae and rmse errors fig 7b and c a possible explanation for the relatively low r fig 7d in summer is that the precipitation products underestimate the frequency of strong precipitation but overestimate the occurrences of weak precipitation in the season additionally the relatively low performance skills may also be related to the disparity in spatial representativeness between gridded precipitation products and point reference observations the gridded precipitation analysis due to spatial interpolation related smoothing is often unable to accurately capture short lived localized intense precipitation events which are common in the glb during summer in contrast the two precipitation products exhibit better time series correlation with the reference data in winter fig 7d which in combined with overall weaker mean winter precipitation leads to lower mae and rmse errors fig 7b and c overall merra 2 prectotcorr is superior to era5 tp in terms of mae rmse and r metrics across the different seasons and different regions of the glb fig 7b d in particular the summertime mae and rmse correlation r for merra 2 prectotcorr are considerably lower higher than their counterparts for the era5 tp precipitation 4 impact of differing precipitation products on hydrological simulations the variation in precipitation forcing inputs is expected to translate into discrepancies in hydrologic simulations however the high degree of spatial variability along with nonlinearity in hydrological response may increase the complexity associated with quantifying the magnitude of uncertainties induced into hydrologic model output via precipitation forcing inputs e g kitzmiller et al 2011 masih et al 2011 getirana et al 2011 yen et al 2014 gabriel et al 2014 faramarzi et al 2015 in this section the impacts of the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr products on mesh streamflow simulations within the glb are addressed as mentioned in section 2 2 3 we construct two sets of hourly meteorological forcing inputs where the precipitation data were taken from era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr respectively but with the remaining meteorological forcing inputs including surface air temperature incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface wind speed pressure and specific humidity all taken from the merra 2 reanalysis product gelaro et al 2017 the two sets of forcing data are then respectively used to drive the mesh model the model simulations are calibrated to the streamflow observations for the target subbasins fig 2 to optimize the performance of each input forcing data set the model calibration period is from january 1 2015 to december 31 2018 with a spin up of 365 days january 1 2014 to december 31 2014 fig 8 provides the pbias and ns values from the two sets of mesh simulations for the target subbasins as shown in fig 2 the metrics are calculated based upon the daily stream discharge time series from january 1 2015 to december 31 2018 the metrics pbias and ns for the subbasins that are located within the eastern glb corresponding to box 1 as shown in fig 2 in the mid southern region corresponding to box 2 as shown in fig 2 and in the northwestern glb corresponding to box 3 as shown in fig 2 are shown in the top middle and bottom portions of fig 8a and b respectively the hydrographs for the subbasins in the three regions are provided in figs 9 to 11 the performance of streamflow simulations in the eastern part of the basin is discussed here first the merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation driven modelling tends to underestimate the observed stream discharge in the eastern region fig 9 the pbias values exceed 20 and can reach 40 80 for the majority of gauge stations fig 8a orange bars in the top portion which is thought to be related to the precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr in the eastern region figs 4b and 7a the subbasins 02dc012 02hl004 04256000 and 04213000 all show higher pbias and lower ns values than other subbasins in this region fig 8 these four subbasins are in close proximity to the prectotcorr precipitation minimum that is centered near the east shore of lake huron 02dc012 and 02hl004 or near the lake effect zones east of lakes ontario and erie 04256000 and 04213000 also the underpredicted peak stream flows for the four subbasins mainly occur in late fall to early summer of the following year fig 9a b f and g which further reflects the influence of lake effect precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr the summer precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr also influences streamflow simulations as demonstrated during the summer of 2017 for the subbasins 02ed003 fig 9c and 04256000 fig 9f in the eastern glb the era5 tp precipitation relative to merra 2 prectotcorr typically produces higher simulated stream discharge fig 9 in accordance with the average discrepancy between the two precipitation data sets for this region figs 3 and 4 the era tp precipitation driven modelling performed best for the subbasin 02dc012 figs 8 and 9a the pbias values from the era5 tp precipitation driven modelling are within 20 for most gauge stations in the eastern region fig 8a blue bars in the top portion in terms of the ns value in the area the streamflow simulations forced by the era5 tp precipitation are also typically superior to their merra 2 prectotcorr counterpart fig 8b in contrast the merra 2 prectotcorr forced modelling typically outperformed the era5 tp precipitation forced simulations in the mid southern region of the glb fig 10 the significant underestimation in simulated discharge observed in the eastern glb was not observed for the merra 2 prectotcorr forced simulations in this region the pbias values from both the merra 2 prectotcorr and era5 tp forced simulations are all within 20 for the subbasins in the region fig 8a middle portion the largest pbias 20 and lowest ns from the merra 2 prectotcorr forced modelling in the mid southern region occurred for the subbasin 04122200 fig 8 which is near the east shore of lake michigan fig 2 a typical lake effect precipitation zone this further reflects the influence of lake effect precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr fig 10b in contrast the relatively weak pbias within 10 and high ns values exceeding 0 5 produced by the prectotcorr forced simulations for the subbasins in the southeastern inland portion east of lake michigan 04119000 04101500 and 04185000 fig 8b coincide with the relatively high skill of merra 2 prectotcorr in detecting the precipitation intensity and variability in non lake effect regions see section 3 2 for subbasin 04154000 merra 2 prectotcorr resulted in a pbias close to 0 fig 8a however the corresponding ns value 0 17 is relatively low fig 8b this is in part caused by the 2017 mid summer extreme stream discharge event which is an outlier for the subbasin and not adequately captured in either the merra 2 prectotcorr or era5 tp forced simulations fig 10a the ns values obtained from the era5 tp precipitation forced modeling are typically very low or even negative for the subbasins in the mid southern region of the glb fig 8b blue bars in the middle portion this is mainly because the era5 tp precipitation input in combination with the water loss via evapotranspiration determined by the merra 2 reanalysis product typically overpredicts wet conditions in spring and winter but underpredicts dry conditions in late summer and early fall fig 10 which is consistent with the seasonal variability in average era5 tp me in this region fig 7a additionally the lower r for era5 tp compared to merra 2 prectotcorr in the mid southern region fig 6 also corresponds with the relatively low ns values produced by the era5 tp forced simulations for subbasins in the northwestern region of the glb the two sets of hydrologic simulations perform similarly with the exception of the area north and east of lake superior on average both sets of simulations tend to either match or overestimate the observed streamflow in the region fig 8a bottom portion the merra 2 prectotcorr forced modelling produces the largest streamflow overestimation a pbias of around 30 for the far north subbasin 02bb003 fig 8a which may partly reflect the influence of precipitation bias in this area the possible causes for the merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation bias in subbasin 02bb003 include the degraded cpcu skill due to the sparse precipitation gauges as well as the increased weight of merra 2 pure model precipitation 0 3 at this latitude in prectotcorr although precipitation verification stations are very sparse in the region north and east of lake superior fig 4b it is clear that subbasin 02bb003 receives less summer and annual precipitation in the era5 tp dataset compared to merra 2 prectotcorr fig 3 which corresponds to a smaller streamflow overestimation a pbias of about 10 for the simulations forced with era5 tp fig 8a and fig 11a however both sets of hydrologic simulations provide ns values in the same range 0 35 0 46 for subbasin 02bb003 fig 8b primarily because flow overprediction mainly occurred in summer and fall and spring snowmelt peak flows were generally well captured fig 11a for subbasins 04024430 and 04027000 located in the near shore areas southwest of lake superior the overall flow underestimation is minimal for both sets of simulations fig 8a however mid summer extreme stream discharge events are often difficult to predict figs 11b and 11c thus leading to relatively low ns values fig 8b for subbasin 04059500 both sets of hydrologic simulations produced a pbias of about 20 and low ns values fig 8 reflective of summer streamflow overprediction fig 11d that corresponds to the modest precipitation overestimation in the area that extends from the northwest of lake michigan to the south of lake superior fig 4 the two sets of hydrologic simulations perform well in terms of both pbias and ns values for subbasins 04056500 and 04045500 located in the area southeast of lake superior fig 8 clearly the performance of the two sets of mesh model runs associated with each region of the glb is reasonably consistent with the skill of the two precipitation input data sets as compared against the ghcn precipitation observations it should be noted that the specific performance metric values for the streamflow simulations are also potentially impacted by meteorological forcing inputs other than precipitation although the relative performance of the two precipitation products in driving hydrological models is the focus of the present study to further characterize the relative performance between the two precipitation products the two sets of mesh hydrologic simulations are repeated after replacing the non precipitation meteorological forcing inputs including surface air temperature incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface wind speed pressure and specific humidity from merra 2 with those from the era5 reanalysis product the acquired era5 reanalysis product does not directly provide the surface specific humidity that is required for driving the mesh model hence the specific humidity forcing input is derived from the era5 surface dewpoint temperature and surface pressure in addition according to the conversion equation provided in zotarelli et al 2010 the acquired 10 meter wind speed of era5 is adjusted to the surface 2 meter wind speed that is also required for driving mesh the resulting pbias and ns values for the streamflow simulations are shown in fig 12 as expected the specific metric values associated with each model run are different between fig 12 and fig 8 which reflects the influence of the era5 vs merra 2 reanalysis products with respect to the meteorological forcing inputs other than precipitation however the relative hydrological simulation performance of the two precipitation data sets associated with each region remains unchanged in the eastern region of the glb substantial positive pbias values i e stream discharge underestimation still prevail in the merra 2 prectotcorr driven modelling fig 12a orange bars in the top portion this is again attributed to the precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr for this region the era5 tp precipitation driven mesh modelling again produces higher relative to merra 2 prectotcorr simulated streamflow and tends to exhibit a negative pbias for most subbasins in the eastern region of the glb fig 12a blue bars in top portion which is again consistent with the mean differences between era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr for this region the ns values obtained from the two sets of model runs are typically low 0 2 with the exception of subbasin 02dc012 where the era5 tp based modelling produced a ns close to 0 6 fig 12b for mean stream flow both sets of precipitation products again perform very well in the south central region of the glb with pbias ranging from 16 to 8 fig 12a middle portion the prectotcorr driven modelling again outperforms the era5 tp counterpart in the context of ns values in the south central region fig 12b middle portion the merra 2 prectotcorr forced modelling provides ns values that approach or exceed 0 5 for subbasins 04119000 04101500 and 04185000 in the southeastern area of the state of michigan fig 12b middle portion in the northwestern glb the relative hydrological modelling performance of the two precipitation products also remains unchanged when the additional non precipitation meteorological forcing inputs are changed mean stream flow is considerably overpredicted i e a large negative pbias in the northernmost subbasin 02bb003 with prectotcorr forced modelling and for subbasin 04059500 with both prectotcorr and era5 tp precipitation forced modelling fig 12a bottom portion pbias values for all other subbasins within the northwestern region are within 10 both precipitation products again produced relatively high ns values for the 02bb003 04056500 and 04045500 subbasins 5 discussion 5 1 differences between era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr products as well as their relative influence on hydrological modelling were compared and assessed over the glb the two precipitation products performed differently especially in the eastern and mid southern portions of the glb this is not surprising since the two products are derived from different data sources era5 tp is produced by ecmwf s ifs cycle 41r2 with the assimilation of radar rain gauge merged precipitation ncep stage iv qpe over conus hersbach et al 2020 in contrast merra 2 prectotcorr is a weighted average of cpcu and merra 2 pure model derived precipitation derived from nasa s geos 5 12 4 and its data assimilation system in the glb region with the cpcu s weight decreasing with increasing latitude gelaro et al 2017 their performance differences are also related to their discrepancy in spatial resolution era5 tp has a spatial resolution of 0 28º 31 km while merra 2 prectotcorr is provided at a spatial resolution of 0 5º in latitude and 0 625º in longitude the two precipitation products typically also performed differently in other regions e g the northern great plains and nepal as pointed out in section 1 in era5 the ncep stage iv qpe analysis nelson et al 2016 is assimilated over conus hersbach et al 2020 one of the objectives for the present study is to quantify the improved performance of era5 tp over the u s due to the assimilation of ncep stage iv qpe results show that the assimilation of the ncep stage iv qpe over conus substantially suppresses warm season mean precipitation biases in era5 tp however the assimilation provides a relatively low benefit to era5 tp in winter and spring fig 7a which is in part due to the relatively low skill of radar based qpe in the cool season nelson et al 2016 also in the u s portion of the eastern glb era5 tp does not significantly benefit from the assimilation of ncep stage iv qpe the era5 tp precipitation overestimation i e positive me dominates in both the u s and canadian regions of the eastern glb fig 4a in particular era5 tp provides pronounced precipitation overestimation in the u s region near the eastern end of lake ontario fig 4a where the average precipitation from ncep stage iv qpe is remarkedly higher than the prism precipitation nelson et al 2016 fig 2 therein this may imply the presence of substantial biases in ncep stage iv qpe over this area since prism is a gauge based gridded precipitation analysis generated by applying a statistical precipitation elevation model to station precipitation observations daly et al 1994 2008 many of which are included in the ghcn dataset menne et al 2012 in a bias blind assimilation system i e based upon the assumption of unbiased errors in observation and model as used in era5 hersbach et al 2020 observational biases if present would produce a suboptimal analysis dee 2005 on average the era5 tp product overestimates precipitation over the glb fig 7a in the era5 reanalysis system air temperatures over the great lakes are typically underestimated in winter and overestimated in summer hersbach et al 2020 which may lead to the precipitation biases in era5 tp over the glb region in other regions e g xu et al 2019 chen et al 2021 although the similar biases in surface air temperatures were unknown the overall precipitation overestimation in era5 tp has also been observed hersbach et al 2020 also found unrealistically high era5 tp for some locations a possible explanation for the era5 tp overestimation in other areas without the assimilation of radar gauge based qpe is that the era5 atmospheric model moist physics parameterization resulted in overly frequent precipitation occurrences which is common for weather and climate models stephens et al 2010 the glb region facilitates an assessment of the impact that the latitude dependent precipitation correction scheme used in merra 2 prectotcorr has on the product performance which is another objective for this study when cpcu is the dominant component i e at latitudes in the vicinity of 42 5 n or lower merra 2 prectotcorr typically underestimates heavy precipitation with considerable spatial precipitation gradients e g lake effect snowfall and summer convective precipitation in areas with a low density precipitation gauge network as a result the merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation driven hydrologic modelling often underpredicts observed streamflow in these areas this is especially evident in the eastern region of the glb where lake effect precipitation and summer convective precipitation events are common in the areas east of lakes huron ontario and erie in this region precipitation gauges used for producing cpcu are relatively sparse which degrades the skill of cpcu in capturing localized intense precipitation events in contrast merra 2 prectotcorr performs very well for precipitation estimation and streamflow simulation in cpcu dominated areas with a relatively high density rain gauge network as found in the southern region east of lake michigan however when merra 2 modeled precipitation is a substantial component of prectotcorr typically at the latitudes higher than 48 n precipitation overestimation is a concern for regions receiving low to moderate annual precipitation since the merra 2 atmospheric modelling tends to overestimate the frequency of weak precipitation such a condition is especially applicable to the far north areas of the glb where streamflow overprediction is evident in the hydrologic modelling forced by merra 2 prectotcorr 5 2 limitations in this study the precipitation evaluation is unavoidably influenced by certain limitations firstly there is disparity in spatial representativeness between gridded precipitation products and point reference observations in practice gridded precipitation products or forecasts are typically verified against either point station observations via resampling of gridded precipitation products or forecasts onto observational stations with a nearest neighbor approach or gridded precipitation observations via averaging of point station observations within the grid cells of precipitation products or forecasts brown et al 2008 tustison et al 2001 the two verifications approaches have their respective pros and cons verification against gridded observations can mitigate the spatial scale mismatch but uncertainties related to smoothing and insufficient sampling often exist in the gridded reference data in contrast the point station records do not contain any smoothing issue and can be viewed as true observations but the point scale verification is often subject to representativeness error in this study given that era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr have different grid cell sizes they are evaluated at an equivalent spatial scale point scale which facilitates the performance comparison between the two precipitation products although the verification may contain some errors associated with the spatial mismatch the evaluation results for the two precipitation products are consistent with their impacts on streamflow simulations at the subbasin scale this demonstrates that the relative performance between merra 2 prectotcorr and era5 tp which is of primary interest for the study herein is functionally independent of the spatial mismatch in point scale precipitation evaluation as a topic of future research sensitivity of glb precipitation product validation to spatial matching approaches could be evaluated however that goes beyond the scope of the study herein a second limitation of the study is that the reference ghcn dataset is not entirely independent of the two precipitation products under assessment the ncep stage iv qpe assimilated in era5 ingests gauge precipitation information causing a possible dependence between era5 tp and ghcn however the dependence between era5 tp and ghcn is expected to be weak since i radar observations rather than gauge precipitation information are the dominant data source for precipitation estimation in ncep stage iv qpe and ii era5 tp is still predominantly governed by the era5 atmospheric model system a dependence may also exist between merra 2 prectotcorr and ghcn via cpcu which may ingest partial precipitation information from the ghcn dataset such a limitation is unavoidable for this study because the withholding or leave one out verification methodology e g m chen et al 2008 hutchinson et al 2009 cannot be employed herein a third limitation relates to the relative sparsity of reference stations in the canadian portion of the western glb which in turn leads to spatially restrained precipitation validation in this area to help fill this gap future work could include a comparison between era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr and satellite precipitation e g trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis chomps and imegr for the glb region 6 conclusions the main findings of this study are as follows i the latitude dependent precipitation correction scheme used in merra 2 prectotcorr has a significant impact on the product performance at latitudes in the vicinity of 42 5 n or lower the performance of merra 2 prectotcorr is governed by the skill of cpcu which typically performs very well but often underestimates intensive precipitation e g lake effect snowfalls and summer convective precipitation in sparsely gauged areas in the cpcu analysis when the merra 2 model precipitation component becomes substantial in prectotcorr typically at latitudes higher than 48 n precipitation overestimation is a concern ii era5 tp often overestimates precipitation especially in winter and spring the assimilation of ncep stage iv qpe over conus in era5 can benefit era5 tp although any added benefit is strongly influenced by the skill of ncep stage iv qpe iii unsurprisingly due to the discrepancy in data sources era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr performed differently overall era tp is superior to prectotcorr in detecting lake effect precipitation the relative performance for the two precipitation products is also spatially varying prectotcorr tends to outperform era5 tp in precipitation estimation in the cpcu rain gauge dense areas which are typically located at latitudes below or in the vicinity of 42 5 n in contrast at higher latitudes or in the cpcu gauge sparse areas era5 tp typically performs better than merra 2 prectotcorr iv regarding influences on hydrologic modelling errors and biases in the precipitation products tend to manifest in streamflow simulation performance the merra 2 prectotcorr driven hydrologic simulation tends to underperform relative to the era 5 tp simulation in regions where lake effect precipitation is common on account of era 5 tp having an overall wet bias and merra 2 having a dry bias specifically in these areas however in the central portion of the glb where lake effect precipitation is less prevalent and there is a dense precipitation observation network merra 2 prectotcorr tends to outperform era 5 this investigation advances our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr for estimating historic precipitation and forcing hydrological models for the glb thus providing important guidance for the application of the two state of the art precipitation products in hydrological modeling and other hydro climatological related tasks for similar regions e g with significant lake effect precipitation and or at middle to high latitudes here the influence of the two different precipitation products on streamflow simulations generated with a land surface hydrological model were characterized however the influence of the two precipitation products on groundwater and groundwater surface water interaction simulations is not clear hence future work will focus on the application of the two precipitation products to a fully integrated surface water groundwater model for the glb e g s xu et al 2021 in addition the investigation methodology herein will be extended to other surface water basins to provide a more complete performance assessment for the two

two analysis products incorporate many advances in precipitation analysis as compared to other data sets in particular bias correction is employed in the merra 2 total precipitation prectotcorr reichle et al 2017 while era5 assimilates observed precipitation information hersbach et al 2020 in recent years merra 2 prectotcorr and era5 total precipitation tp have received extensive attention in hydro climatological analysis and modelling e g xu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 hamal et al 2020 kolluru et al 2020 chen et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 rivoire et al 2021 however caution should be taken while assessing and interpreting the performance of the two precipitation products for different regions since the data sources vary spatially for both era5 s precipitation assimilation scheme and merra 2 s precipitation bias correction scheme satellite precipitation information is assimilated in the era5 system for global areas but with the additional assimilation of radar rain gauge merged precipitation exclusively over the conterminous united states conus hersbach et al 2020 in merra 2 prectotcorr the precipitation over africa is fully corrected to the cmap product rescaled while a latitude dependent correction scheme using gauge only gridded precipitation analysis is applied to the remaining areas reichle et al 2017 therefore for instance it is not surprising that the

in nepal merra 2 prectotcorr underestimated observed precipitation hamal et al 2020 while era5 tp provided a precipitation overestimation y chen et al 2021 with the previous work in mind there are still outstanding questions related to regional performance characteristics for the two precipitation products firstly the bias correction scheme is latitude dependent for the merra 2 prectotcorr product with the full correction to the cpc unified daily precipitation cpcu over the 42 5 s 42 5 n land areas except for africa and null correction in high latitude lands poleward of 62 5 latitude prectotcorr is a weighted average of cpcu and merra 2 pure model precipitation between 42 5 62 5 latitudes in both hemispheres with the weight of cpcu decreasing from 1 0 at 42 5 latitude to 0 at 62 5 latitude reichle et al 2017 cpcu is a gauge only gridded precipitation analysis xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 it remains unanswered how the latitude dependent precipitation correction scheme and the rain gauge network density impact the performance of merra 2 prectotcorr in transition regions between 42 5 62 5 latitudes secondly in era5 the radar rain gauge merged precipitation estimates are assimilated exclusively over conus hersbach et al 2020 but it is not known to what extent the performance of era5 tp can be improved through the addition of radar rain gauge precipitation over conus thirdly lake effect precipitation detection continues to pose a challenge to weather and climate modelling and it is not clear how era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr perform in lake affected areas to address the aforementioned questions the study herein examines the hydrological performance of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr over the laurentian great lakes basin glb in north america the glb which straddles the u s and canadian border and contains the largest body of fresh surface water on earth is critical to the economies and ecosystems of u s and canada the glb region has also been the focus of many of hydro climatological studies e g pietroniro et al 2007 huang et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 haghnegahdar et al 2014 gaborit et al 2017 peltier et al 2018 xu et al 2015 2017a 2020 kiefer et al 2019 xu 2020 xu et al 2021 the glb basin is located between 40 and 50 n which facilitates an assessment of the impact that the linearly changing precipitation correction scheme between 42 5 62 5 latitude used in merra 2 prectotcorr has on product performance the basin straddles the u s and canadian border thus offering the opportunity to verify the added benefit from the assimilation of radar rain gauge precipitation over conus in era5 additionally lake effect precipitation is an important phenomenon within the glb norton and bolsenga 1993 liu and moore 2004 kristovich and spinar 2005 zhao et al 2012 king et al 2020 during fall and winter when very cold and dry continental arctic air masses move across the warmer great lakes the temperature and moisture differences between the lake surface and the air can lead to evaporation and trigger rapidly developing cumulus clouds or storms which in turn bring considerable lake effect precipitation to downwind shore areas hence the glb is also well suited for examining the skill of era5 and merra 2 products in detecting lake effect precipitation the present study is organized as follows section 2 outlines the reanalysis precipitation products study domain reference data hydrological model and the verification metrics for precipitation estimation and simulated streamflow section 3 presents the precipitation assessment results and is followed in section 4 by an investigation of precipitation influences on streamflow simulations finally discussion and conclusions are provided in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 data and methods 2 1 study region this work examines the hydrological performance of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr products over the glb land area the glb includes the five great lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario and the surrounding lands in the canadian province of ontario and a few u s states fig 1 in fig 1 the glb boundary is delineated based upon the aster global digital elevation model data and agrees with that as shown in other studies norton and bolsenga 1993 pietroniro et al 2007 huang et al 2012 haghnegahdar et al 2014 xu et al 2015 2017a 2017b the glb is characterized by a humid continental climate the land cover types mainly include cropland deciduous forest coniferous forest mixed forest built up urban and water bodies xu et al 2015 as previously mentioned the glb is well suited for the study herein due to its locational and physiographic characteristics that facilitate an analysis of the linearly shifting precipitation bias correction scheme between 42 5 and 62 5 latitude in merra 2 prectotcorr and the added benefit from the assimilation of radar rain gauge precipitation over conus in era5 additionally the glb is suited for evaluating the skill of the two precipitation products in estimating lake effect precipitation lake effect precipitation activities typically snowfalls play an important role in the climate of the glb e g norton and bolsenga 1993 liu and moore 2004 zhao et al 2012 notaro et al 2014 however in practice difficulties in measuring snowfall often pose a challenge for lake effect precipitation estimation the snow gauge captured snowfalls need to be converted to the water equivalent values which increases the uncertainty in measuring lake effect snowfalls further the relatively low density of the weather station network in lake effect areas may not sufficiently capture the lake effect pattern the deficiencies in weather and climate models also pose a challenge for capturing lake effect precipitation e g when the model spatial resolution is too coarse to represent the lake effect morphology notaro et al 2014 or the model lacks the sufficient representation of ice cover impacts sharma et al 2018 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 reanalysis products in this work two sets of state of the art reanalysis products era5 and merra 2 are used era5 is the latest generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis based on ecmwf s integrated forecasting system ifs cycle 41r2 hersbach et al 2020 era5 offers a higher spatial resolution 31 km and many other improvements as compared to its predecessors era interim era 40 era 15 etc including the assimilation of radar rain gauge merged precipitation ncep stage iv quantitative precipitation estimates exclusively over conus hersbach et al 2020 merra 2 is a reanalysis product derived from nasa s goddard earth observing system model version 5 12 4 geos 5 12 4 and its data assimilation system gelaro et al 2017 merra 2 represents the latest progress from nasa in atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era the released merra 2 data fields are provided at a spatial resolution of 0 5º in latitude and 0 625º in longitude a latitude dependent bias correction is employed to generate prectotcorr reichle et al 2017 specifically the merra 2 model derived precipitation is fully corrected to the cpcu product in low to midlatitude land areas equatorward of 42 5 latitude except africa but with null correction over high latitude lands poleward of 62 5 latitude over middle to high latitudes of land between 42 5 and 62 5 latitude in both hemispheres a gradually changing precipitation correction scheme was applied to ensure a linear shift from a full use of cpcu at 42 5 latitude to a full use of the merra 2 model derived precipitation at 62 5 latitude the era5 hourly data including tp surface air temperature surface incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface pressure surface dewpoint temperature and 10 meter wind and the merra 2 hourly data including prectotcorr surface air temperature surface incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface pressure surface specific humidity and surface wind speed were acquired from copernicus data and services https www copernicus eu en access data and nasa ges disc data archive https disc gsfc nasa gov respectively for the time period from january 1 2014 to december 31 2018 the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr products are herein evaluated on a daily 24 h basis using reference daily observations of precipitation whereas other quantities along with precipitation are used to drive a hydrologic model see section 2 2 3 based on the work of xu et al 2019 which demonstrated that the relative performance of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr as well as other precipitation products was not changed for three different time intervals 2002 2012 2012 2015 and 2002 2015 the 5 year time period january 1 2014 to december 31 2018 is considered sufficient to capture the performance of the two precipitation products hence the use of a longer study period would be expected to result in the same conclusions albeit with a significant increase in computational burden for the hydrological model calibration 2 2 2 reference precipitation observations daily precipitation observations from the global historical climatology network ghcn menne et al 2012 are used as the reference to validate era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr for a 5 year period extending from january 1 2014 to december 31 2018 a standard quality control procedure is employed to exclude daily points with flags indicating missing or estimated precipitation values the ghcn stations with less than 1000 valid daily precipitation observations during the 5 year study period are also excluded and only the stations shown in fig 1 are used for validation 2 2 3 hydrological model and streamflow observations the comparison of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr with the ghcn precipitation observations is the first phase of evaluation the second phase of evaluation examines the influence of the two precipitation products on hydrologic simulations environment and climate change canada s mesh modélisation environmentale communautaire surface

documented e g pietroniro et al 2007 haghnegahdar et al 2014 gaborit et al 2017 xu et al 2015 2017a 2017b the standalone mesh version 1 4 1398 https wiki usask ca display mesh releases is used in this work the hourly precipitation data from era5 and merra 2 are used to drive the respective mesh model simulations the same set of additional hourly meteorological forcing inputs including surface air temperature incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface wind speed pressure and specific humidity which were obtained either from the merra 2 analysis product or from the era5 analysis product see section 4 are used with the two sets of precipitation inputs for driving the mesh model to facilitate the assessment of precipitation input data influences on stream flow simulation to optimize the streamflow simulations for each precipitation input each mesh model run is calibrated to the streamflow observations for the target subbasins fig 2 based upon a global calibration scheme haghnegahdar et al 2014 the list of calibrated parameters which is same as in haghnegahdar et al 2014 includes the soil physiography properties for crop grass deciduous forest coniferous forest and mixed forest gru types the calibration objective function is formulated using the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency criterion for the square root of daily flows the model is run at a resolution of 1 6th of a degree 15 km using a time step of 30 min the calibration period is from january 1 2015 to december 31 2018 with a spin up of 365 days january 1 2014 to december 31 2014 the model calibration was conducted on the niagara supercomputer at the scinet high performance computing consortium of the university of toronto using parallel dynamically dimensioned search dds as implemented in the ostrich software matott 2017 dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 is a model independent automatic calibration algorithm for computationally expensive and heavily parameterized hydrologic models the algorithm can automatically scale the search i e from globally to locally to find the best solutions within the specified number of model evaluations by dynamically and probabilistically narrowing the parameter value search neighborhood the 18 target subbasins for streamflow evaluation are located within three distinct regions of the glb corresponding to the three boxes as shown in fig 2 with 7 subbasins in the eastern region 5 in the mid southern region and 6 in the northwestern region streamflow measurements are derived from the hydat hydrometric database at water survey of canada for the canadian subbasins and the usgs national water information system for the u s subbasins 2 3 evaluation metrics the precipitation validation is conducted at point scale i e the gridded precipitation products are resampled onto the reference stations fig 1 using a nearest neighbor approach before comparison to station observations at each reference station the mean error me mean absolute error mae root

to 1 with 1 as the optimal value 3 assessment of precipitation products 3 1 intercomparison of mean daily precipitation there is a high degree of spatial and seasonal variations in precipitation for the glb basin lake effect snowfalls can significantly enhance fall and winter precipitation in the lake effect zones adjacent to the great lakes norton and bolsenga 1993 scott and huff 1996 fig 3 presents the mean daily precipitation from era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr respectively over the glb land surfaces as indicated by era5 tp fig 3a the areas located east and south east of the great lakes typically receive the highest average winter precipitation which is mainly attributed to lake effect snowfalls lake effect precipitation is typically evident to the south and east of lake superior and along the eastern coasts of other great lakes norton and bolsenga 1993 zhao et al 2012 indeed the spatial pattern of era5 mean daily winter precipitation fig 3a is very similar to that of snowfall climatology over the basin norton and bolsenga 1993 fig 2 therein although partial lake effect precipitation such as that to the south and east of lake superior is also detected in merra 2 prectotcorr fig 3d the winter precipitation enhancement in lake effect areas relative to non lake effect regions is less evident in merra 2 prectotcorr fig 3d than in era5 tp fig 3a in particular the merra 2 prectotcorr product indicates minimum winter precipitation received in the shore areas east of lake huron fig 3d which is inconsistent with the expected heavy lake effect snowfalls in the area e g norton and bolsenga 1993 zhao et al 2012 both precipitation products indicate that the glb receives more precipitation in summer figs 3b and 3e than in winter figs 3a and 3d clearly era5 tp provides higher annual mean precipitation than merra 2 prectotcorr over the glb in the eastern glb where significant lake effect precipitation is expected era5 tp fig 3c exceeds merra 2 prectotcorr fig 3 f by up to 2 mm day for annual mean daily precipitation in contrast era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr tend to be similar in terms of annual mean precipitation for the non lake effect zones e g the western sides of the great lakes michigan and superior and the inland regions east of lake michigan 3 2 performance scores here the in situ verification performance of the two precipitation data sets is compared against reference observations from ghcn fig 4 shows the mean daily precipitation errors for era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr the era5 tp precipitation typically shows me close to or greater than 0 across the validation stations fig 4a the largest positive me i e precipitation overestimation in era5 tp tends to occur in the eastern part of the glb especially in areas located east and south east of lake ontario fig 4a in the western glb west of the 82 w meridian the era5 tp precipitation overestimation is less evident however it should be noted that reference stations are very sparse within the canadian portion of this region fig 4a merra 2 prectotcorr severely underestimates precipitation i e it shows strong negative me errors in the lake effect zones adjacent to the eastern shores of lakes huron ontario and erie fig 4b over the glb land area merra 2 prectotcorr is equivalent to cpcu in the region south of 42 5 n and is a weighted average of cpcu and merra 2 pure model derived precipitation in the area north of 42 5 n with the model s weight increasing with latitude reichle et al 2017 in the eastern glb the significant precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr is likely to stem from cpcu because the weights for the merra 2 pure model precipitation in this region are very small 0 0 15 depending upon the latitude cpcu is a gauge based gridded precipitation product xie et al 2007 chen et al 2008 and the quality of cpcu analysis is highly related to the gauge network density chen et al 2008 in the eastern shore areas of lakes huron ontario and erie precipitation gauges are relatively sparse this may degrade the skill of cpcu in capturing lake effect snowfalls or summer convective precipitation events which are typically associated with considerable spatial precipitation gradients and are difficult to accurately capture by a low density gauge network e g m chen et al 2008 in contrast to the lake effect areas me is typically close to 0 for merra 2 prectotcorr in the non lake effect regions such as west of lake michigan and the inland area surrounded by lakes michigan huron and erie fig 4b in these areas located between 40 and 45 n cpcu dominates merra 2 prectotcorr and the relatively high gauge network density and less heterogeneous precipitation spatial pattern favors the performance of cpcu figs 5 and 6 present the rmse and correlation coefficient r results obtained for the two daily precipitation products it is important to note that the climatological day difference between reference daily observations and daily precipitation products under evaluation can adversely impact rmse and r results when a precipitation analysis is evaluated on a daily basis it is important to align the climatological days between the analysis and reference data as closely as possible in this study the ghcn reference precipitation observations were provided on a daily basis while the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation values were available on an hourly basis to this end using the hourly spaced data the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr daily precipitation time series should be constructed with respect to the 24 h windows that align with the climatological day for ghcn daily precipitation observations however a common climatological day does not exist for the ghcn stations because the recording time of ghcn daily precipitation varies substantially in space and for different station data sources menne et al 2012 hence for the ghcn reference stations in the u s portion of the glb the site dependent climatological days as indicated in menne table 2 therein et al 2012 are used in this study in the canadian portion most of the ghcn stations are provided by the environment and climate change canada eccc weather station network which typically has a climatological day ending at 0700 local time i e 1200 utc for the glb of the following day for daily precipitation observations hutchinson et al 2009 hopkinson et al 2011 therefore a common climatological day i e a 24 hr period ending at 1200 utc of the following day is used for all the reference stations in the canadian portion the climatological day issue has no impact on the me metric which is based upon the long term mean information the rmse values for merra 2 prectotcorr are typically around 3 0 5 0 mm day for the canadian and northern state of michigan i e the land area east of lake michigan and west of lake huron regions and about 5 0 7 0 mm day in the remaining regions fig 5b a similar spatial pattern of rmse is shown for era5 tp but with slightly greater rmse errors fig 5a mae not shown is very similar to rmse in terms of spatial pattern for both precipitation products the r values for era5 tp typically exceed 0 4 across the validation stations with overall higher r skill for the canadian region fig 6a merra 2 prectotcorr fig 6b generally provides higher r values than era5 tp fig 6a across the glb the region that shows consistently high r values exceeding 0 6 for merra 2 prectotcorr lies to the west of lake michigan fig 6b overall in the eastern glb the two precipitation products perform better in the canadian portion relative to the u s portion in terms of both rmse and r metrics which differs from the me score skill assessment fig 4 fig 7 provides the average performance scores stratified by season for the western glb west of the 82 w meridian the eastern glb east of the 82 w meridian and the entire glb respectively in the eastern glb merra 2 prectotcorr substantially underestimates mean daily precipitation for all seasons with an average me of approximately 0 4 mm day fig 7a cyan the merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation underestimation east of 82 w is larger in winter and fall me below 0 4 mm day than in summer and spring me above 0 4 mm day this may indicate that lake effect snowfall typically occurring in winter and fall is relative to summer rainfall even more underestimated by merra 2 prectotcorr in the western glb the mean precipitation from merra 2 prectotcorr tends to be very close to the reference i e the average me is close to 0 in all seasons fig 7a pink this is related to the limited lake effect snowfall and the high cpcu gauge network density in the region in addition for the lake effect precipitation that does occur in the western glb there is limited representation in the validation results as stations are very sparse for lake effect zones to the east and south of lake superior fig 4b the average me errors for era5 tp exhibit similar seasonal variability for the western fig 7a red and eastern fig 7a blue regions of the glb the average me for era5 tp is close to 0 in summer and autumn and exceeds 0 2 mm day in winter and spring with slightly greater precipitation overestimation in the eastern glb the two precipitation products both exhibit the largest mae and rmse errors in summer and the lowest mae and rmse in winter fig 7b and c this reflects the sensitivity of the two error metrics to precipitation intensity and the time series correlation between reference values and the precipitation products under assessment in summer the glb receives the largest mean precipitation and the two precipitation products exhibit the lowest correlation with the reference data fig 7d which corresponds to the large mae and rmse errors fig 7b and c a possible explanation for the relatively low r fig 7d in summer is that the precipitation products underestimate the frequency of strong precipitation but overestimate the occurrences of weak precipitation in the season additionally the relatively low performance skills may also be related to the disparity in spatial representativeness between gridded precipitation products and point reference observations the gridded precipitation analysis due to spatial interpolation related smoothing is often unable to accurately capture short lived localized intense precipitation events which are common in the glb during summer in contrast the two precipitation products exhibit better time series correlation with the reference data in winter fig 7d which in combined with overall weaker mean winter precipitation leads to lower mae and rmse errors fig 7b and c overall merra 2 prectotcorr is superior to era5 tp in terms of mae rmse and r metrics across the different seasons and different regions of the glb fig 7b d in particular the summertime mae and rmse correlation r for merra 2 prectotcorr are considerably lower higher than their counterparts for the era5 tp precipitation 4 impact of differing precipitation products on hydrological simulations the variation in precipitation forcing inputs is expected to translate into discrepancies in hydrologic simulations however the high degree of spatial variability along with nonlinearity in hydrological response may increase the complexity associated with quantifying the magnitude of uncertainties induced into hydrologic model output via precipitation forcing inputs e g kitzmiller et al 2011 masih et al 2011 getirana et al 2011 yen et al 2014 gabriel et al 2014 faramarzi et al 2015 in this section the impacts of the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr products on mesh streamflow simulations within the glb are addressed as mentioned in section 2 2 3 we construct two sets of hourly meteorological forcing inputs where the precipitation data were taken from era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr respectively but with the remaining meteorological forcing inputs including surface air temperature incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface wind speed pressure and specific humidity all taken from the merra 2 reanalysis product gelaro et al 2017 the two sets of forcing data are then respectively used to drive the mesh model the model simulations are calibrated to the streamflow observations for the target subbasins fig 2 to optimize the performance of each input forcing data set the model calibration period is from january 1 2015 to december 31 2018 with a spin up of 365 days january 1 2014 to december 31 2014 fig 8 provides the pbias and ns values from the two sets of mesh simulations for the target subbasins as shown in fig 2 the metrics are calculated based upon the daily stream discharge time series from january 1 2015 to december 31 2018 the metrics pbias and ns for the subbasins that are located within the eastern glb corresponding to box 1 as shown in fig 2 in the mid southern region corresponding to box 2 as shown in fig 2 and in the northwestern glb corresponding to box 3 as shown in fig 2 are shown in the top middle and bottom portions of fig 8a and b respectively the hydrographs for the subbasins in the three regions are provided in figs 9 to 11 the performance of streamflow simulations in the eastern part of the basin is discussed here first the merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation driven modelling tends to underestimate the observed stream discharge in the eastern region fig 9 the pbias values exceed 20 and can reach 40 80 for the majority of gauge stations fig 8a orange bars in the top portion which is thought to be related to the precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr in the eastern region figs 4b and 7a the subbasins 02dc012 02hl004 04256000 and 04213000 all show higher pbias and lower ns values than other subbasins in this region fig 8 these four subbasins are in close proximity to the prectotcorr precipitation minimum that is centered near the east shore of lake huron 02dc012 and 02hl004 or near the lake effect zones east of lakes ontario and erie 04256000 and 04213000 also the underpredicted peak stream flows for the four subbasins mainly occur in late fall to early summer of the following year fig 9a b f and g which further reflects the influence of lake effect precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr the summer precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr also influences streamflow simulations as demonstrated during the summer of 2017 for the subbasins 02ed003 fig 9c and 04256000 fig 9f in the eastern glb the era5 tp precipitation relative to merra 2 prectotcorr typically produces higher simulated stream discharge fig 9 in accordance with the average discrepancy between the two precipitation data sets for this region figs 3 and 4 the era tp precipitation driven modelling performed best for the subbasin 02dc012 figs 8 and 9a the pbias values from the era5 tp precipitation driven modelling are within 20 for most gauge stations in the eastern region fig 8a blue bars in the top portion in terms of the ns value in the area the streamflow simulations forced by the era5 tp precipitation are also typically superior to their merra 2 prectotcorr counterpart fig 8b in contrast the merra 2 prectotcorr forced modelling typically outperformed the era5 tp precipitation forced simulations in the mid southern region of the glb fig 10 the significant underestimation in simulated discharge observed in the eastern glb was not observed for the merra 2 prectotcorr forced simulations in this region the pbias values from both the merra 2 prectotcorr and era5 tp forced simulations are all within 20 for the subbasins in the region fig 8a middle portion the largest pbias 20 and lowest ns from the merra 2 prectotcorr forced modelling in the mid southern region occurred for the subbasin 04122200 fig 8 which is near the east shore of lake michigan fig 2 a typical lake effect precipitation zone this further reflects the influence of lake effect precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr fig 10b in contrast the relatively weak pbias within 10 and high ns values exceeding 0 5 produced by the prectotcorr forced simulations for the subbasins in the southeastern inland portion east of lake michigan 04119000 04101500 and 04185000 fig 8b coincide with the relatively high skill of merra 2 prectotcorr in detecting the precipitation intensity and variability in non lake effect regions see section 3 2 for subbasin 04154000 merra 2 prectotcorr resulted in a pbias close to 0 fig 8a however the corresponding ns value 0 17 is relatively low fig 8b this is in part caused by the 2017 mid summer extreme stream discharge event which is an outlier for the subbasin and not adequately captured in either the merra 2 prectotcorr or era5 tp forced simulations fig 10a the ns values obtained from the era5 tp precipitation forced modeling are typically very low or even negative for the subbasins in the mid southern region of the glb fig 8b blue bars in the middle portion this is mainly because the era5 tp precipitation input in combination with the water loss via evapotranspiration determined by the merra 2 reanalysis product typically overpredicts wet conditions in spring and winter but underpredicts dry conditions in late summer and early fall fig 10 which is consistent with the seasonal variability in average era5 tp me in this region fig 7a additionally the lower r for era5 tp compared to merra 2 prectotcorr in the mid southern region fig 6 also corresponds with the relatively low ns values produced by the era5 tp forced simulations for subbasins in the northwestern region of the glb the two sets of hydrologic simulations perform similarly with the exception of the area north and east of lake superior on average both sets of simulations tend to either match or overestimate the observed streamflow in the region fig 8a bottom portion the merra 2 prectotcorr forced modelling produces the largest streamflow overestimation a pbias of around 30 for the far north subbasin 02bb003 fig 8a which may partly reflect the influence of precipitation bias in this area the possible causes for the merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation bias in subbasin 02bb003 include the degraded cpcu skill due to the sparse precipitation gauges as well as the increased weight of merra 2 pure model precipitation 0 3 at this latitude in prectotcorr although precipitation verification stations are very sparse in the region north and east of lake superior fig 4b it is clear that subbasin 02bb003 receives less summer and annual precipitation in the era5 tp dataset compared to merra 2 prectotcorr fig 3 which corresponds to a smaller streamflow overestimation a pbias of about 10 for the simulations forced with era5 tp fig 8a and fig 11a however both sets of hydrologic simulations provide ns values in the same range 0 35 0 46 for subbasin 02bb003 fig 8b primarily because flow overprediction mainly occurred in summer and fall and spring snowmelt peak flows were generally well captured fig 11a for subbasins 04024430 and 04027000 located in the near shore areas southwest of lake superior the overall flow underestimation is minimal for both sets of simulations fig 8a however mid summer extreme stream discharge events are often difficult to predict figs 11b and 11c thus leading to relatively low ns values fig 8b for subbasin 04059500 both sets of hydrologic simulations produced a pbias of about 20 and low ns values fig 8 reflective of summer streamflow overprediction fig 11d that corresponds to the modest precipitation overestimation in the area that extends from the northwest of lake michigan to the south of lake superior fig 4 the two sets of hydrologic simulations perform well in terms of both pbias and ns values for subbasins 04056500 and 04045500 located in the area southeast of lake superior fig 8 clearly the performance of the two sets of mesh model runs associated with each region of the glb is reasonably consistent with the skill of the two precipitation input data sets as compared against the ghcn precipitation observations it should be noted that the specific performance metric values for the streamflow simulations are also potentially impacted by meteorological forcing inputs other than precipitation although the relative performance of the two precipitation products in driving hydrological models is the focus of the present study to further characterize the relative performance between the two precipitation products the two sets of mesh hydrologic simulations are repeated after replacing the non precipitation meteorological forcing inputs including surface air temperature incoming shortwave and longwave radiations surface wind speed pressure and specific humidity from merra 2 with those from the era5 reanalysis product the acquired era5 reanalysis product does not directly provide the surface specific humidity that is required for driving the mesh model hence the specific humidity forcing input is derived from the era5 surface dewpoint temperature and surface pressure in addition according to the conversion equation provided in zotarelli et al 2010 the acquired 10 meter wind speed of era5 is adjusted to the surface 2 meter wind speed that is also required for driving mesh the resulting pbias and ns values for the streamflow simulations are shown in fig 12 as expected the specific metric values associated with each model run are different between fig 12 and fig 8 which reflects the influence of the era5 vs merra 2 reanalysis products with respect to the meteorological forcing inputs other than precipitation however the relative hydrological simulation performance of the two precipitation data sets associated with each region remains unchanged in the eastern region of the glb substantial positive pbias values i e stream discharge underestimation still prevail in the merra 2 prectotcorr driven modelling fig 12a orange bars in the top portion this is again attributed to the precipitation underestimation in merra 2 prectotcorr for this region the era5 tp precipitation driven mesh modelling again produces higher relative to merra 2 prectotcorr simulated streamflow and tends to exhibit a negative pbias for most subbasins in the eastern region of the glb fig 12a blue bars in top portion which is again consistent with the mean differences between era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr for this region the ns values obtained from the two sets of model runs are typically low 0 2 with the exception of subbasin 02dc012 where the era5 tp based modelling produced a ns close to 0 6 fig 12b for mean stream flow both sets of precipitation products again perform very well in the south central region of the glb with pbias ranging from 16 to 8 fig 12a middle portion the prectotcorr driven modelling again outperforms the era5 tp counterpart in the context of ns values in the south central region fig 12b middle portion the merra 2 prectotcorr forced modelling provides ns values that approach or exceed 0 5 for subbasins 04119000 04101500 and 04185000 in the southeastern area of the state of michigan fig 12b middle portion in the northwestern glb the relative hydrological modelling performance of the two precipitation products also remains unchanged when the additional non precipitation meteorological forcing inputs are changed mean stream flow is considerably overpredicted i e a large negative pbias in the northernmost subbasin 02bb003 with prectotcorr forced modelling and for subbasin 04059500 with both prectotcorr and era5 tp precipitation forced modelling fig 12a bottom portion pbias values for all other subbasins within the northwestern region are within 10 both precipitation products again produced relatively high ns values for the 02bb003 04056500 and 04045500 subbasins 5 discussion 5 1 differences between era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr the era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr products as well as their relative influence on hydrological modelling were compared and assessed over the glb the two precipitation products performed differently especially in the eastern and mid southern portions of the glb this is not surprising since the two products are derived from different data sources era5 tp is produced by ecmwf s ifs cycle 41r2 with the assimilation of radar rain gauge merged precipitation ncep stage iv qpe over conus hersbach et al 2020 in contrast merra 2 prectotcorr is a weighted average of cpcu and merra 2 pure model derived precipitation derived from nasa s geos 5 12 4 and its data assimilation system in the glb region with the cpcu s weight decreasing with increasing latitude gelaro et al 2017 their performance differences are also related to their discrepancy in spatial resolution era5 tp has a spatial resolution of 0 28º 31 km while merra 2 prectotcorr is provided at a spatial resolution of 0 5º in latitude and 0 625º in longitude the two precipitation products typically also performed differently in other regions e g the northern great plains and nepal as pointed out in section 1 in era5 the ncep stage iv qpe analysis nelson et al 2016 is assimilated over conus hersbach et al 2020 one of the objectives for the present study is to quantify the improved performance of era5 tp over the u s due to the assimilation of ncep stage iv qpe results show that the assimilation of the ncep stage iv qpe over conus substantially suppresses warm season mean precipitation biases in era5 tp however the assimilation provides a relatively low benefit to era5 tp in winter and spring fig 7a which is in part due to the relatively low skill of radar based qpe in the cool season nelson et al 2016 also in the u s portion of the eastern glb era5 tp does not significantly benefit from the assimilation of ncep stage iv qpe the era5 tp precipitation overestimation i e positive me dominates in both the u s and canadian regions of the eastern glb fig 4a in particular era5 tp provides pronounced precipitation overestimation in the u s region near the eastern end of lake ontario fig 4a where the average precipitation from ncep stage iv qpe is remarkedly higher than the prism precipitation nelson et al 2016 fig 2 therein this may imply the presence of substantial biases in ncep stage iv qpe over this area since prism is a gauge based gridded precipitation analysis generated by applying a statistical precipitation elevation model to station precipitation observations daly et al 1994 2008 many of which are included in the ghcn dataset menne et al 2012 in a bias blind assimilation system i e based upon the assumption of unbiased errors in observation and model as used in era5 hersbach et al 2020 observational biases if present would produce a suboptimal analysis dee 2005 on average the era5 tp product overestimates precipitation over the glb fig 7a in the era5 reanalysis system air temperatures over the great lakes are typically underestimated in winter and overestimated in summer hersbach et al 2020 which may lead to the precipitation biases in era5 tp over the glb region in other regions e g xu et al 2019 chen et al 2021 although the similar biases in surface air temperatures were unknown the overall precipitation overestimation in era5 tp has also been observed hersbach et al 2020 also found unrealistically high era5 tp for some locations a possible explanation for the era5 tp overestimation in other areas without the assimilation of radar gauge based qpe is that the era5 atmospheric model moist physics parameterization resulted in overly frequent precipitation occurrences which is common for weather and climate models stephens et al 2010 the glb region facilitates an assessment of the impact that the latitude dependent precipitation correction scheme used in merra 2 prectotcorr has on the product performance which is another objective for this study when cpcu is the dominant component i e at latitudes in the vicinity of 42 5 n or lower merra 2 prectotcorr typically underestimates heavy precipitation with considerable spatial precipitation gradients e g lake effect snowfall and summer convective precipitation in areas with a low density precipitation gauge network as a result the merra 2 prectotcorr precipitation driven hydrologic modelling often underpredicts observed streamflow in these areas this is especially evident in the eastern region of the glb where lake effect precipitation and summer convective precipitation events are common in the areas east of lakes huron ontario and erie in this region precipitation gauges used for producing cpcu are relatively sparse which degrades the skill of cpcu in capturing localized intense precipitation events in contrast merra 2 prectotcorr performs very well for precipitation estimation and streamflow simulation in cpcu dominated areas with a relatively high density rain gauge network as found in the southern region east of lake michigan however when merra 2 modeled precipitation is a substantial component of prectotcorr typically at the latitudes higher than 48 n precipitation overestimation is a concern for regions receiving low to moderate annual precipitation since the merra 2 atmospheric modelling tends to overestimate the frequency of weak precipitation such a condition is especially applicable to the far north areas of the glb where streamflow overprediction is evident in the hydrologic modelling forced by merra 2 prectotcorr 5 2 limitations in this study the precipitation evaluation is unavoidably influenced by certain limitations firstly there is disparity in spatial representativeness between gridded precipitation products and point reference observations in practice gridded precipitation products or forecasts are typically verified against either point station observations via resampling of gridded precipitation products or forecasts onto observational stations with a nearest neighbor approach or gridded precipitation observations via averaging of point station observations within the grid cells of precipitation products or forecasts brown et al 2008 tustison et al 2001 the two verifications approaches have their respective pros and cons verification against gridded observations can mitigate the spatial scale mismatch but uncertainties related to smoothing and insufficient sampling often exist in the gridded reference data in contrast the point station records do not contain any smoothing issue and can be viewed as true observations but the point scale verification is often subject to representativeness error in this study given that era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr have different grid cell sizes they are evaluated at an equivalent spatial scale point scale which facilitates the performance comparison between the two precipitation products although the verification may contain some errors associated with the spatial mismatch the evaluation results for the two precipitation products are consistent with their impacts on streamflow simulations at the subbasin scale this demonstrates that the relative performance between merra 2 prectotcorr and era5 tp which is of primary interest for the study herein is functionally independent of the spatial mismatch in point scale precipitation evaluation as a topic of future research sensitivity of glb precipitation product validation to spatial matching approaches could be evaluated however that goes beyond the scope of the study herein a second limitation of the study is that the reference ghcn dataset is not entirely independent of the two precipitation products under assessment the ncep stage iv qpe assimilated in era5 ingests gauge precipitation information causing a possible dependence between era5 tp and ghcn however the dependence between era5 tp and ghcn is expected to be weak since i radar observations rather than gauge precipitation information are the dominant data source for precipitation estimation in ncep stage iv qpe and ii era5 tp is still predominantly governed by the era5 atmospheric model system a dependence may also exist between merra 2 prectotcorr and ghcn via cpcu which may ingest partial precipitation information from the ghcn dataset such a limitation is unavoidable for this study because the withholding or leave one out verification methodology e g m chen et al 2008 hutchinson et al 2009 cannot be employed herein a third limitation relates to the relative sparsity of reference stations in the canadian portion of the western glb which in turn leads to spatially restrained precipitation validation in this area to help fill this gap future work could include a comparison between era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr and satellite precipitation e g trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis chomps and imegr for the glb region 6 conclusions the main findings of this study are as follows i the latitude dependent precipitation correction scheme used in merra 2 prectotcorr has a significant impact on the product performance at latitudes in the vicinity of 42 5 n or lower the performance of merra 2 prectotcorr is governed by the skill of cpcu which typically performs very well but often underestimates intensive precipitation e g lake effect snowfalls and summer convective precipitation in sparsely gauged areas in the cpcu analysis when the merra 2 model precipitation component becomes substantial in prectotcorr typically at latitudes higher than 48 n precipitation overestimation is a concern ii era5 tp often overestimates precipitation especially in winter and spring the assimilation of ncep stage iv qpe over conus in era5 can benefit era5 tp although any added benefit is strongly influenced by the skill of ncep stage iv qpe iii unsurprisingly due to the discrepancy in data sources era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr performed differently overall era tp is superior to prectotcorr in detecting lake effect precipitation the relative performance for the two precipitation products is also spatially varying prectotcorr tends to outperform era5 tp in precipitation estimation in the cpcu rain gauge dense areas which are typically located at latitudes below or in the vicinity of 42 5 n in contrast at higher latitudes or in the cpcu gauge sparse areas era5 tp typically performs better than merra 2 prectotcorr iv regarding influences on hydrologic modelling errors and biases in the precipitation products tend to manifest in streamflow simulation performance the merra 2 prectotcorr driven hydrologic simulation tends to underperform relative to the era 5 tp simulation in regions where lake effect precipitation is common on account of era 5 tp having an overall wet bias and merra 2 having a dry bias specifically in these areas however in the central portion of the glb where lake effect precipitation is less prevalent and there is a dense precipitation observation network merra 2 prectotcorr tends to outperform era 5 this investigation advances our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of era5 tp and merra 2 prectotcorr for estimating historic precipitation and forcing hydrological models for the glb thus providing important guidance for the application of the two state of the art precipitation products in hydrological modeling and other hydro climatological related tasks for similar regions e g with significant lake effect precipitation and or at middle to high latitudes here the influence of the two different precipitation products on streamflow simulations generated with a land surface hydrological model were characterized however the influence of the two precipitation products on groundwater and groundwater surface water interaction simulations is not clear hence future work will focus on the application of the two precipitation products to a fully integrated surface water groundwater model for the glb e g s xu et al 2021 in addition the investigation methodology herein will be extended to other surface water basins to provide a more complete performance assessment for the two

of global rainfall measurements for a very long time inadequate rain gauge density portends that the distribution of rainfalls cannot be well captured considering its high variability in time and space ouma et al 2012 ayanlade et al 2018 chen et al 2018 wolski et al 2020 in sub saharan africa the rain gauge density for a majority of the regions is often poor thereby limiting hydrological impact studies that require rainfall as a key forcing onyando et al 2005 liechti et al 2012 kimani et al 2017 moreover where rain gauge networks exist there are often issues related to the quality and accuracy of measurements limited observations due to poor maintenance of the instruments data rights and hence sharing impediments habib et al 2012 maidment et al 2014 chwala and kunstmann 2019 these bottlenecks motivate practicing hydrologists in such regions to look beyond the available ground instruments for alternative data sources to support impact analyses more recently there has become the need to combine new data collection and processing tools with a view to increase the reliability of such predictions olang and fürst 2010 gebrechorkos et al 2018 zittis 2018 in ungauged basins studies have shown that satellite rainfall products can be used as an alternative source of meteorological data important for river basin management studies blöschl et al 2013 maggioni and massari 2018 belete et al 2020 brocca et al 2020 in limited gauged basins other studies have noted the need to corroborate the existing measurements with products derived from satellite based measurements considering their extensive and dependable global coverage sorooshian et al 2000 jiang et al 2018 lakew et al 2020 consequently the production and application of several satellite precipitation products spps has more recently seen an upward trend across many regions around the globe harris et al 2014 beck et al 2017 liu et al 2017 chen et al 2018 camici et al 2020 while no single product can be said to be perfect for all conditions there is the critical need to test their utilities and reliabilities for applications across various hydro climatic and physiographic conditions some studies already indicate that over complex topography and diverse climatic conditions the uncertainties of the spps can be high rommily and gebremichael 2011 dingman 2015 there has been increasing interest in the application of satellite precipitation products over east african regions of data scarcity näschen et al 2018 oduor et al 2020 pellarin et al 2020 a majority of the studies have focused around the greater lake victoria drainage basin considering its economic significance awange 2021 habib et al 2012 olang et al 2014 williams et al 2015 in relatively smaller transboundary basins however not much has been done partly because of the varied national basin management plans that govern observed data sharing and acquisition thereby limiting requisite validation of satellite based rainfall products in a composite study over east africa kimani et al 2017 noted that most of the satellite precipitation products generally replicate the rainfall patterns but with observable differences when it comes to reproducing characteristics of orographic rainfall events the precipitation products significantly overestimated rainfall amounts in the mountainous areas of east africa similarly the performance of climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirpsv2 and tropical application of meteorology using satellite data tamsatv3 over eastern africa has been found to be varied and weaker in the coastal and mountainous regions dinku et al 2018 consequently according to li et al 2009 the results for some of the products such as tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm based multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa can be much improved by using a systematically bias corrected tmpa rainfall data from literature a majority of studies have largely focused on understanding the performance of trmm 3b42v7 and chirpsv2 products in the region this is partly because they are quasi global products with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution with uninterrupted and uniformly distributed precipitation estimates for the tropical region huffman et al 2007 ngoma et al 2021 also the focus of the studies has been on understanding drought and flood events which are adequately captured by the two products ayugi et al 2019 few studies have focused on other products such as the new integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements gpm 3imerg6 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswepv2 2 tamsatv3 and to some extent the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr which are considered relatively novel and improved over the years this study incorporates such products with a view to understand their performance and applicability for extended use in hydrological modeling in a mesoscale tropical river basin several approaches have been employed to establish the reliability of satellite precipitation products as an alternative source of data knapp et al 2011 gebre and ludwig 2015 belete et al 2020 a common and most used approach is through comparison of derived georeferenced rainfall estimates with rain gauge measurements through statistical measures such as the root mean square error rmse absolute mean error ame correlation coefficients cc and bias moriasi et al 2007 thiemig et al 2013 another approach which is also gaining presence lately is the use of hydrological models the model is first optimized using the available in situ rainfall data and subsequently used to simulate response of the catchment using the georeferenced spps stisen and sandholt 2010 dessu and melesse 2012 maggioni and massari 2018 camici et al 2020 the simulated discharges are then compared with observed discharges using objective functions such as kling gupta efficiency and nash shutcliffe efficiency kling 2002 kling and nachtnebel 2009 in this study the two approaches were disparately tested with a view to better understand the satellite precipitation products for possible use in water allocation studies within the sio malaba malakisi river basin of east africa the statistical measures were first applied through direct comparison of the rainfall datasets and subsequently the indirect model approach further used to understand the discharge variations in selected areas with observed data it also provided an opportunity for the application of the continuous semi distributed runoff model cosero in a tropical basin the evaluation was important to discern products that can be used locally for enhanced catchment management in the transboundary river basin spanning western kenya and eastern uganda in east africa 2 tools and methods 2 1 the study area the study area is the sio malaba malakisi river basin smmrb a shared basin located between longitudes 33 7 and 34 7 e and latitudes 0 1 and 1 2 n on the western kenya border region with eastern uganda in total 5000 km2 are drained by three main rivers the sio river that flows from mt elgon and into lake victoria in the south malakisi and malaba rivers that flow into l kyoga and its wetlands in the south west the drainage pattern of the main stream sio river is dendritic with a high drainage density at its northern most point the elevation of the smmrb rises with mt elgon to an altitude of 4320 m above sea level masl while it merges with lakes victoria and kyoga at an altitude of 1135 and 1033 masl respectively fig 1 the basin is nestled between these two striking topographic features which play an important role in the hydrology of the region based on the two features the area experiences two types of rainfall orographic rainfall which occurs around mt elgon and convectional rainfall near lake victoria the rainfall pattern is normally bimodal with long rains between march and may mam and the short rains between september and november son the average annual rainfall amounts in the basin vary according to the different climatic zones the humid upstream region receives upwards of 2000 mm the sub humid mid basin region receives 1511 mm per annum while the semi arid downstream area receives an average of 776 mm annually mugalavai et al 2008 temperatures in the basin are also highly influenced by orographic regimes due to mt elgon mean maximum temperature is 28 c in the low lying areas and about 5 around the slopes of mt elgon the vegetation and landcover comprise of high altitude moorland and forest moist savannah dry savannah and farmlands the area around the slopes of the mountain comprise of forests and the mt elgon national park and forest reserve further there are grasslands wetlands woodland shrubland and small scale cropland irrigated and rain fed dale 1940 iucn 2005 wrem 2008 2 2 gauge based datasets historical 10 day aggregates of observed precipitation time series was obtained from the kenya meteorological department kmd a data quality assessment criterion was applied based on completeness of data atleast 60 complete value difference from and its proximity to nearest neighbors as well as a check for systemic errors and extreme values in this manner only 9 out of 39 gauging stations were selected and a subset period of 1998 2016 chosen the rainfall stations in the smmrb tend to be located in densely populated areas specifically in schools and government premises they are also located in areas of intense agricultural activity as well as near forest stations fig 1 the acquired data henceforth served as the reference for the evaluation of downloaded satellite precipitation estimates additionally daily streamflow records from hydrological stations in the smmrb were acquired from the water regulatory authority wra in kenya for the period 1981 2016 fig 1 the time series has extended periods of missing values due to measurement challenges faulty instruments and limited reporting of measured values unfortunately hydro meteorological data acquisition in uganda proved to be an unresolvable challenge tables 1 and 2 provide a summary of the attributes of the rainfall and hydrological stations used in the study respectively 2 2 1 rainfall gauge distribution to get a better understanding of the performance of the satellite precipitation estimates against the observed precipitation we firstly explore the status of the observed precipitation and the station distribution the observed precipitation denote a specific pattern in rainfall amounts and distribution across the basin for instance there are similarities on rainfall amounts and distribution among stations that are closer to each other or those at similar altitude table 1 fig 1 for example busia 1228 masl is closer to nambale 1234 masl bungoma 1427 masl is closer to nzoia 1490 masl and webuye 1562 masl is closer to lugari 1673 masl hence the pairs depict almost similar rainfall distribution fig 2 busia and nambale lie in the middle of the basin and depict larger distribution of rainfall which could be an effect of their equidistant from two key natural features mt elgon and lake victoria whose different rainfall regimes orographic and convectional rainfall regimes contribute to increased rainfall amounts in the middle of the basin 2 3 satellite precipitation products spps satellite precipitation products are based on data derived from various sensors and satellites they can also include other data sources such as ground radar gauge networks or forecasts from model or reanalysis in this study six satellite precipitation products were chosen because of their diversity high spatial resolution coverage domain and periods of availability maidment et al 2017 additionally the suitability of the products to capture precipitation patterns and extremes over a tropical region was considered the product attributes are described in table 3 2 3 1 chirpv2 the chirps dataset is a composite of five different data inputs that include in situ rainfall measurements pentadal precipitation climatology quasi global geostationary thermal infrared satellite observations from both the climate prediction center infrared product and the national climatic data center infrared product knapp et al 2011 funk et al 2015 it also utilizes the trmm product from nasa li et al 2009 and atmospheric model rainfall fields from noaa climate forecast system version 2 saha et al 2010 the pentadal rainfall estimates are generated from satellite data based on cloud cover duration which is based on regression models calibrated using trmm they are expressed as a percent of normal and multiplied by the corresponding precipitation climatology station data is then blended with this data to produce chirps dinku et al 2018 some of the africa daily data has a finer spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 to support land surface modeling activities the final estimates are available in netcdf geotiff and esri bil formats funk et al 2015 2 3 2 trmm 3b42v7 trmm 3b42 v7 product combines passive microwave precipitation estimates from the special sensor microwave imager and sounder trmm microwave imager the advanced microwave sounding unit the microwave humidity sounder and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer the passive microwave data is first calibrated using the combined trmm microwave imager and trmm precipitation radar product and then used to calibrate geosynchronous infrared inputs rainfall estimates are freely available and have a temporal coverage of 1998 2019 with subsequent datasets provided by its successor the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm 3imerg6 huffman et al 2007 alazzy et al 2017 2 3 3 mswep v2 2 mswepv2 is a unique precipitation estimate that combines the advantages of gauge satellite and reanalysis datasets to provide reliable precipitation estimates at a global scale it optimally combines 76 747 gauge observations to determine precipitation estimates from worldclim including kitale station which is near the study area ncei noaa 2021 global historical climatology network daily ghcn d global summary of the day gsod and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc the product merges these sources with non gauge based sources such as infrared gridded satellite gridsat global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap and trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt and reanalysis products such as the interim reanalysis era interim center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 product beck et al 2019 the processing involves gauge data quality control to remove erroneous zeros as is common in gsod database gauge based assessment of satellite and reanalysis datasets determination of long term mean precipitation frequency correction and dataset harmonization the satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets are then merged and a gauge correction scheme applied to the final product the mswepv2 product is designed for hydrological modeling and to merge the highest quality precipitation data sources available as a function of time scale and location nair and indu 2017 beck et al 2019 2 3 4 tamsatv3 the dataset used in this study is derived from the tamsat version 3 0 dekadal 10 day as a temporal timestep for rainfall estimates the algorithm comprises two main data inputs meteosat thermal infrared tir imagery from the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat and rain gauge measurements for calibration the algorithm is a cloud indexing approach where the duration of cold cloud tops exceeding a certain temperature threshold acts as a proxy for rainfall maidment et al 2014 2017 for the african region the tamsatv3 rainfall estimates have been validated using observed daily rain gauge measurements from five countries that is mozambique niger nigeria uganda and zambia tarnavsky et al 2014 2 3 5 persiann cdr persiann cdr uses the archive of gridded satellite gridsat b1 infrared data as an input to the persiann model the persiann model algorithm combines ir and pmw information from multiple global geosynchrous satellites as the primary source of precipitation information the algorithm uses an artificial neural network ann model to extract cold cloud pixels and neighboring features from geo longwave ir images it then associates variations in each pixel s brightness temperature to estimate the pixel s surface rainfall rate sorooshian et al 2000 ashouri et al 2015 in order to eliminate pmw observations in the cdr product the nonlinear parameters of the ann model are trained and remain fixed when persiann is used for retrospective estimation of rainfall rates using gridsat b1 infrared window data the resulting estimates are then bias corrected using the global precipitation climatology project gpcp 2 5 monthly precipitation product liu et al 2017 this product has been specifically developed for climate and variability studies 2 3 6 gpm 3imerg6 the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements gpm 3imerg6 final run product combines precipitation estimates from all microwave sensors ir observations from whatever constellation of satellites operating around the earth at a given time and monthly gauge data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and a half hour temporal resolution the algorithm is important over regions that do not have ground based precipitation measuring equipment such as the smmmrb the imerg version 6 algorithm is able to merge the early precipitation estimates collected between the years 2000 2014 during the operation of trmm satellite tan et al 2019 in this manner it is possible to retrieve past precipitation estimates and extend the recording period which is critical for hydrological studies 2 4 evaluation of satellite products our main focus was to evaluate the performance of 6 satellite precipitation product estimates by comparing them to station observations across the smmrb the comparison was done at both the monthly and annual time steps in the next step the products were first resampled to 0 25 by 0 25 pixel resolution then used as input in a hydrological model to further compare their performance with observed discharge in an indirect comparison approach this section describes the methodology applied 2 4 1 the approach employed point values from the pixels of each satellite product was georeferenced to gauge location and extracted from the raster files downloaded from data access sites table 3 a point based comparison between the rain gauge stations and the extracted satellite pixel value was applied to evaluate performance of the products in this study the satellite derived rainfall estimates and the observed rain gauge data were aggregated for the period 1998 2016 since this is the period that coincides with the availability of relatively continuous rainfall gauge measurements in the area to allow for comparison of the products with the rain gauge scales the satellite estimates were aggregated to monthly and annual temporal resolutions the analysis then focused on the comparison of individual gauge observations versus satellite estimates as done by alazzy et al 2017 and lakew et al 2020 to guide the comparative analysis two different analytical approaches were applied the continuous statistical measurement and a hydrological evaluation using the cosero hydrological model 2 4 2 statistical measures various statistical measures were applied to corroborate the performance of satellite precipitation products with gauged observations table 4 in this regard the following validation measurements were used correlation coefficient cc mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and percent bias r bias these are calculated as shown in table 4 eqs 1 5 respectively moriasi et al 2007 thiemig et al 2013 where p est are the satellite precipitation estimates and p obs is the observed rain gauge precipitation over bar is the mean and n is the number of samples considered 2 4 3 spatial evaluation spatial evaluation was done by first conducting a resampling of all the spps rasters to a common spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the mean daily pixel values were then extracted and aggregated to monthly and then annual sums for each product for the period of investigation kimani et al 2017 lakew et al 2020 this was done to allow a fair comparison of the products since they have different spatial and temporal extents the products were then mapped over the study area and compared based on the long term mean monthly and mean yearly precipitation performances 2 4 4 hydrological evaluation the hydrological simulations were performed using the conceptual rainfall runoff model cosero continuous semidistributed runoff model e g eder et al 2005 stanzel et al 2008 kling and nachtnebel 2009 kling et al 2015 herrnegger et al 2018 2015 2012 wesemann et al 2018 klingler et al 2021 which has a construct that is comparable to the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model bergström 1995 the model was developed at the university of natural resources and life sciences vienna boku and evolved from a model structure that was originally developed for real time runoff forecasting for the enns river in austria nachtnebel et al 1993 since then substantial improvements have been incorporated into the model e g for the application of cosero to water balance studies real time flood forecasting systems distributed routing issues or for implementing new optimization methods herrnegger et al 2012 2018 cosero accounts for actual evapotranspiration interception storage soil water storage separation of runoff into different flow components and routing by means of a cascade of linear and non linear reservoirs a detailed description of the model including some previous applications and model equations can be found in kling et al 2015 given the limited availability of spatially distributed data in the smmrb the model was setup in a lumped manner with the smmrb being divided into ten sub catchments fig 1 table 1 the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm30 dem farr and kobrick 2000 was used for sub basin and stream delineation sub basin outlets consider gauge station locations but also important physical characteristics e g the confluence of important tributaries land use maps for developing mean land use classes were obtained from the european space agency land cover classification map of africa esa www esa int esa multimedia images 2017 10 african land cover which has a resolution of 20 m and distinguishes 10 land use classes for africa and 10 classes for the smmrb dominant land use and vegetation were considered to characterize each sub basin in this study the acquired satellite precipitation estimates were used as rainfall inputs into the cosero model to predict possible catchment runoff responses for this study climatic research unit time series cru ts v 4 01 global gridded data from the university of east anglia harris et al 2014 for potential evapotranspiration was used the simulation results were compared with historical measured records at 3 gauging stations the observed records for gauging station 1ab01 had many errors and since it pours into gauging station 1ad02 the later stations record were used instead the simulated monthly discharges were compared with the measured discharge acquired from the wra 2 4 5 simulation periods and parameter evaluation the streamflow simulation was done for the period 1983 2016 with a spin up period of two years 1981 and 1982 to equilibrate the system states and to mitigate for unknown initial conditions the model was calibrated for the period 1983 2002 25 years and validated for the period 2003 2016 13 years the cosero model was run with monthly timesteps wesemann et al 2018 mehdi et al 2021 the shuffle complex evolution sce optimization algorithm method was applied for the calibration of the model the sce optimization method was chosen over other optimization methods such as monte carlo rosenbrock and the dynamically dimensioned search dds because it combines three crucial concepts desirable in a conceptual watershed hydrological model calibration i systemic evolution of a complex of points across the parameter space ii competitive evolution and iii complex shuffling these elements make the sce method effective robust flexible and efficient duan et al 1994 kratzert et al 2018 nachtnebel et al 2013 schulz et al 2016 a total of 13 parameters were selected for calibration in the smmrb the calibration procedure exposed the poor quality of observed discharge data with the many gaps weakening the performance of certain products fig 3 to evaluate the model performance the following objective functions are applied table 5 3 results 3 1 evaluation of satellite precipitation products performance 3 1 1 performance against station observations monthly time scale the performance of the satellite products in comparison to the station observations were evaluated and compared over the smmrb the observed low rainfall amounts at the lower altitude region is in contrast to the high amounts recorded in the rest of the basin fig 4 table 1 this can be attributed to the fact that the rest of the basin receives both orographic and convectional rainfall events with increasing amounts towards mt elgon kansiime et al 2013 kendal 1969 consequently all products except mswepv2 2 overestimated the rainfall amounts in this area which normally experiences convectional type of rainfall at a monthly time scale chirpsv2 performed best with a correlation coefficient of 0 75 followed by mswepv2 2 and tamsatv3 at 0 72 each gpm 3imerg6 at 0 70 while trmm 3b42v7 and persiann cdr registered a performance of 0 60 and 0 58 respectively table 6 the better performance by chirpsv2 and tamsatv3 and mswepv2 2 may be because the estimates are bias corrected using gauge measurements hence improving the quality of the final product at port victoria fs station the station at the lowest altitude closest to lake victoria mswepv2 2 underestimated rainfall amounts while reproducing seasonal rainfall patterns with the lowest overall pbias of 4 persiann cdr and gpm 3imerg6 posted high pbias performances of 59 and 49 respectively this is particularly observable in the overestimated rainfall peaks in a majority of the stations fig 4 at lugari the station at the highest altitude all the products performed much closer to station observations than in any other station largely the pbias performance significantly improved in trmm 3b42v7 28 tamsatv3 21 and chirps 14 tables 6 and 4 the scatter plot in fig 5 presents the evaluation of the six satellite precipitation products with rain gauge measurements at the monthly time scale all the products correctly represent the spatial distribution of rainfall however persiann cdr and gpm 3imerg6 have a wider scatter than the other products they also tend to overestimate rainfall amounts beyond 300 mm per month on the other hand the mswepv2 2 product underestimates rainfall amounts but with a smaller scatter the rainfall fields for chirpsv2 and tamsatv3 also have less scatter with marked agreement with station observations in addition the differences in monthly average precipitation amount enlarges as the precipitation amount increases the wide rainfall field scatter for gpm 3imerg6 indicate an overestimation in the majority of the measurements in the period 2003 2014 in a correlation matrix table 7 all the products show a positive correlation with gauge measurements however the strongest relationship is with chirpsv2 0 75 followed by tamsatv3 0 72 and mswepv2 2 0 72 gpm 3imerg6 showed a stronger relationship with chirpsv2 0 79 than with gauge values or any other product table 7 on the other hand persiann cdr 0 59 and trmm 3b42v7 0 60 registered average performances when compared to gauge observations in general the pairs of mswepv2 2 and trmm 3b42v7 mswepv2 2 and chirpsv2 tamsatv3 and chirpsv2 also have a strong correlation with each other 0 89 at the monthly scale 3 1 2 evaluation at an annual time scale at the annual scale trmm 3b42v7 and mswepv2 2 underestimate the rainfall events with a correlation coefficient of 0 60 and 0 77 respectively with an overall pbias of 36 and 2 persiann cdr and gpm 3imerg6 overestimate the rainfall events with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 and 0 67 and a pbias of 58 and 38 respectively fig 6 table 8 on the other hand chirpsv2 and tamsatv3 register good performances at this time step compared to other products however when we consider the pbias the root mean square error and the correlation coefficient chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 marginally outperform tamsat in the scatter plots of the annual sums fig 7 persiann cdr overestimates most of the rainfall amounts with a wider scatter compared to other products gpm 3imerg6 also overestimates a majority of the rainfall events with a wider scatter beyond the 3000 mm range trmm 3b42v7 tamsatv3 and chirpsv2 overestimate rainfall amounts but with less scatter than persiann cdr and gpm 3imerg6 however it is also evident that mswepv2 2 slightly underestimates rainfall at the annual time step similar to the underestimation observed in the monthly evaluation 3 1 3 spatial evaluation results the precipitation products were resampled to the same spatial extent 0 25 0 25 then analyzed mean monthly values and mean annual values were retrieved from each product and the results evaluated for the period 2003 2014 gpm 3imerg6 registered the highest rainfall amounts in the basin during the month of april with an average long term mean of 289 6 mm closely followed by persiann cdr at 230 1 mm fig 8 in all products the highest amount of rainfall is registered around lake victoria to the south as opposed to the mt elgon area to the north however trmm 3b42v7 180 3 mm and mswepv2 2 183 3 mm registered lowest amounts of rainfall during the period under study this result is consistent with the statistical evaluation results seen in fig 4 and table 6 at an annual scale gpm 3imerg6 and persiann cdr once again registered high amounts of rainfall at 2134 mm and 1957 3 mm respectively followed by chirpsv2 at 1634 5 mm and tamsatv3 at 1550 6 mm per annum interestingly all the products registered high amounts of rainfall in the southern part of the basin where the station port victoria fs recorded the lowest amounts of rainfall for the same period fig 9 this may be an indication of the errors that exist in recording observed rainfall measurements in the region further this anomaly in rainfall events could be attributed to two things i the existence of both convectional and relief rainfall in the area and ii the presence of a large water body lake victoria kendal 1969 3 2 indirect evaluation with a hydrological model 3 2 1 water balance evaluation the different satellite precipitation products were used as input into the cosero model to generate discharge the simulations were then compared against gauge measurements as a performance measure a summary of the overall statistical performance is provided in the appendix of this article appendix tables a 1 and a 2 in basin 2 which is characterized by a mountainous terrain the performance indicates overcompensation by the model for most of the generated discharges this could be attributed to both the quality of observed discharge data at 1ad02 as well as the varying capability of some of the satellite products to retrieve rainfall events in mountainous regions dinku et al 2011 chen et al 2013 in basin 2 the difference between simulated discharge and observed discharge is much higher in chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 while it is lowest in trmm 3b42v7 and gpm 3imerg6 this is consistent with li et al 2009 and kimani et al 2017 who observe that trmm based products underperform in mountainous terrains it also shows that cosero model tried to compensate for the deficiency in the performance of products such as chirpsv2 mswepv2 2 and persiann cdr generally simulated discharge exceeds the observed discharge for all the products in basin 2 in basin 3 the water balance performance by all the products improve significantly compared to basin 2 trmm 3b42v7 performs best while mswepv2 2 performs poorly compared to the other products in basin 8 the largest basin among the three there is significant changes in the water balance performance by all the products with the best performance posted by gpm 3imerg6 and chirpsv2 while the worst performance was by mswepv2 2 and persian cdr however the difference in performance among the products is marginal in this basin as is the case in the previous 2 basins fig 10 3 2 2 actual evapotranspiration actual evaporation estimates of over 1000 mm or 66 of the rainfall is not unusual in the study area piper plinston and sutcliffe 1986 alemayehu et al 2017 however since no known actual evaporation data exists for the basin cru ts v4 01 potential evapotranspiration data was used to drive the model shi et al 2017 in this regard the eta performance of the six spps with the cosero model showed marked differences across the basin persiann cdr registered the highest eta value of over 1600 mm a throughout the basin while mswepv2 2 registered a value closest to the estimated area average of 1000 mm a in all the basins in basin 2 only simulations with trmm 3b42 and persiann cdr recorded higher eta values during the validation process compared to the calibration process the trmm 3b42 then registered reduced eta value in basin 3 during the validation process while persiann cdr maintained a high eta value in basin 8 all the products exhibit higher eta values during the validation process with trmm 3b42v7 382 66 mm and persiann cdr 218 59 mm recording much higher validation values over the calibration values fig 11 in general the large differences in eta simulations highlight the uncertainties in this water balance component also it becomes clear that the eta simulations strongly depend on the rainfall input the model and calibration process allows for compensation of biases in rainfall inputs by adjusting the eta component 3 2 3 bias performance evaluation the various products registered varied bias performances in different basins however the average magnitude of bias fell below 39 mm across the three basins which indicates better performance by the model even though persiann cdr registers a basin average bias performance of 39 66 mm it also posted an extreme bias of 100 mm in basin 8 during the validation process an indication of deterioration in model performance due to numerous outlier values in the product fig 12 in the same basin the lowest bias was by gpm 3imerg6 at 27 4 mm in basin 2 mswepv2 2 exhibits the lowest bias of less than 0 5 mm in the validation procedure trmm 3b42v7 and tamsatv3 register a bias of 2 57 mm and 7 14 mm respectively in basin 3 fig 12 in the same basin persiann cdr registered the highest bias at 17 91 mm hence the weakest performance of the six products in the validation process generally gpm 3imerg6 showed the lowest overall bias performance across the three sub basins 14 5 mm followed by mswepv2 2 16 15 mm trmm3b42v7 19 68 mm tamsatv3 19 91 mm and chirpsv2 21 mm fig 12 3 2 4 nse performance evaluation the nse validation performance from basin 8 indicate a performance range of 0 58 0 73 by all the products except persiann cdr which posted an nse value of 0 24 the highest nse performance for basin 8 was produced by mswepv2 2 nse 0 73 followed by gpm 3imerg6 nse 0 69 and chirps nse 0 68 however in the upper basins the overall nse performance was average for basin 2 nse 0 50 and deteriorated in basin 3 nse 0 39 from an average of nse 0 58 for basin 8 for all the products fig 13 more specifically the highest performance in basin 2 was gpm3 imerg6 nse 0 60 followed by mswepv2 2 nse 0 53 chirpsv2 nse 0 52 and trmm 3b42v7 nse 0 51 the lowest nse value was by tamsatv3 nse 0 38 in basin 3 the nse performance range was between 0 31 and 0 48 with tamsatv3 posting the lowest value at 0 31 while mswepv2 2 posted the highest at 0 49 to better understand the performance of the products in the smmrb we can deduce nse performance from basin 8 which had fairly complete observed discharge data in the study area in that regard mswepv2 2 gpm 3imerg6 chirpsv2 trmm 3b42v7 and tamsatv3 exhibit decreasing performances in that order fig 13 4 discussion the overall performance of the six analyzed products for the region is acceptable however chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 outperformed the other products in both the statistical and hydrological model evaluation just as observed over the blue nile in eastern africa the products are able to replicate the highest volume of precipitation throughout the two rainy seasons mam and ond as captured by station measurements belete et al 2020 this result is consistent with those of dinku et al 2018 who reported chirpsv2 as best suited for estimating rainfall across the east african terrain over a product such as tamsatv3 on the other hand the good performance by mswepv2 2 is because it integrates daily gauge observations in calibrating rainfall estimates while accounting for errors in reporting times hence guaranteeing good performance even across ungauged basins maidment et al 2014 funk et al 2015 beck et al 2019 the third best product overall was gpm 3imerg6 which performed well in the model evaluation even though it overestimated rainfall in some parts of the basin this is also consistent with results from other parts of eastern africa where gpm 3imerg6 was found to overestimate rainfall by upto 30 in the western ethiopian highlands wedajo et al 2021 all the products were able to capture the seasonal rainfall patterns in the basin however at the annual scale using both the statistical approach and the cosero model for basin wide evaluation the bias performance of a product such as persiann cdr pbias 58 and 100 mm was quite high further the performance for trmm 3b42v7 pbias 36 and 30 mm in basin 2 and 3 confirm that the product is influenced by topography ouma et al 2012 kimani et al 2017 consequently the results mirror those of a study in neighboring nzoia river basin which proposed adjustments or a correction index for the use of trmm based products in the area based on temporal scales topography and rainfall season ouma et al 2012 to overcome errors in the final rainfall estimates most products incorporate gauge measurements and the closest gauge to the study area used in calibration of the spps is kitale ke000063661 ncei noaa 2021 however even though persiann cdr and tamsatv3 also include gauge observations from ghcn and gpcp for calibration maidment et al 2014 liu et al 2017 this is not a guarantee for better performance in the area as exemplified by persiann cdr as for the varying performance of spps in the cosero hydrological model in the area two observations are evident first the quality of the measured hydro meteorological data used cannot be guaranteed this was noted in the disparity between the low rainfall volumes recorded at port victoria fs station and the spatial analysis that show relatively high rainfall events near lake victoria secondly the results obtained here reflect those obtained from previous studies with other models coron et al 2012 alfieri et al 2013 which conclude that the reliability of certain model simulations such as glofas and mordor6 decreases from the humid european basins to the hydrologically heterogeneous african basins for example in basin 8 the highest kling gupta efficiency kge performance was registered by mswepv2 2 0 77 and chirpsv2 0 75 while the poorest performance was by persiann cdr 0 37 this varied performance is a clear indication of the data acquisition challenges and how it impacts hydrological studies in african basins the overall bias performance for tamsatv3 19 92 mm was closer to trmm 3b42v7 19 70 mm and better than chirpsv2 21 0 mm which initially had better performances in the statistical evaluation trmm 3b42v7 inconsistent in mountainous terrains of the tropical region ouma et al 2012 showed a slight improvement in the model evaluation for basin 2 at the slopes of mt elgon the terrain was found to poorly impact rainfall estimation by most satellite products because of the high altitude most product sensors give cold cloud detection as an indication of rainfall events dinku et al 2011 the eta simulations for instance in basin 8 showed substantial differences for simulations with tamsatv3 mswepv2 2 and persiann cdr our results underline the large uncertainties in actual evapotranspiration simulations and that the eta simulations strongly depend on the rainfall inputs the model and calibration process allows for compensation of biases in rainfall inputs by adjusting the eta water balance component measurements of eta would allow to narrow down the uncertainties but are not available the next steps would be to make decisions as to whether and how satellite data can be processed further so that they can be used in conjunction with the gauge data preliminary results suggest that they can be used but with slight modifications dinku et al 2018 the real issue is therefore to determine if it is possible to configure a locally robust calibration blueprint that can be applied to the satellite data to ensure that they are compatible with the available gauge data and a calibrated rainfall runoff model in this regard a multi objective calibration process might be useful for the study area 5 conclusions in this study we compared the performance of six satellite precipitation products with gauge data and determined their quality as inputs to a hydrological model in a data sparse tropical basin we achieved this by firstly focusing on the comparative performance of each satellite product within the sio malaba malakisi river basin smmrb basin afterwards we tested the usefulness and suitability of each product in driving hydrological simulations with the cosero model on a monthly timestep the model was calibrated using available discharge data from three sub basins calibrated parameters reflect any errors or inconsistencies in the gauge data such as inadequate spatial representation or the manner in which the gauge data was used to obtain sub basin average rainfall inputs 1 all the products were able to replicate rainfall patterns in space and time but showed systematic errors in rainfall retrieval that decreased with an increase in rainfall amounts the systematic errors were mainly in overestimations and showed seasonality as they were larger during the ond rainy season than during the mam rainy season the errors were more evident in a monthly timescale but decreased in a yearly timescale 2 products input data affected their performances in rainfall retrieval most of the products whose precipitation estimates are derived from multiple sensors such as ir tir pmw reanalysis products and gauge observations performed better than those whose estimates rely only fewer sensors or data for example persiann cdr which relies heavily on ir measurements registered weak results in large parts of the basin while products that combine multiple sensors with gauge observations such as chirpsv2 mswepv2 2 tamsatv3 gpm 3imerg6 and trmm 3b42v7 recorded better performances this increased their ability to retrieve different types of rainfall over smmrb a single sensor such as ir alone tends to limit rainfall retrieval ability of different rainfall regimes the distribution of the rain gauges used in calibration also affects the performance of spps therefore there is need to regularly update the algorithms with denser rain gauge data where applicable this affects the way each product varies in performance from region to region 3 for hydrological studies in the region five of the satellite products evaluated can be considered for application however errors in high altitude areas need to be considered during the ond season especially for products using only infrared sensors or fewer sensors to reduce orographic effects elevation and wind direction data are recommended to be included as input data in the development of algorithms to improve the accuracy of orographic rainfall retrieval 4 the cosero hydrological model performance shows quite a good performance in the middle of the basin by most of the products however the bias evaluation and the eta simulations indicate that the model tends to compensate for the performance and biases of products such as persiann cdr and mswepv2 2 5 persiann cdr was found to overestimate rainfall amounts by up to 60 and is therefore not ideal for use as an input in hydrological models in the area chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 products perform best with a kge of 0 73 and 0 77 and a pbias of 14 and 4 respectively 6 at the lower altitude port victoria station all the products were found to overestimate the rainfall amounts except mswepv2 2 7 for the purposes of water resource assessments the findings indicate that it is crucial to select the spps which show good performances in direct comparison with rainfall gauge data and hydrological simulations only then can it be used for water resource allocation and planning the example of persiann cdr shows that one cannot simply use any spps but that a careful selection process is necessary 8 based on our results chirpsv2 is the best precipitation product followed by mswepv2 2 and can therefore be applied in water allocation studies in the smmrb credit authorship contribution statement paul omonge formulated the research

8068,study region sio malaba malakisi river basin east africa study focus poor rain gauge density is a limitation to comprehensive hydrological studies in sub saharan africa consequently satellite precipitation products spps provide an alternative source of data for possible use in hydrological modeling however there is need to test their reliabilities across varied hydro climatic and

insights for the region our results indicate that chirpsv2 product performed best followed by mswepv2 2 as they suitably detected seasonal and annual rainfall amounts throughout the basin however at lower altitudes most of the products overestimated rainfall as indicated by the performance measures in some parts of the basin the cosero output signify an underperformance by persiann cdr and a good

of global rainfall measurements for a very long time inadequate rain gauge density portends that the distribution of rainfalls cannot be well captured considering its high variability in time and space ouma et al 2012 ayanlade et al 2018 chen et al 2018 wolski et al 2020 in sub saharan africa the rain gauge density for a majority of the regions is often poor thereby limiting hydrological impact studies that require rainfall as a key forcing onyando et al 2005 liechti et al 2012 kimani et al 2017 moreover where rain gauge networks exist there are often issues related to the quality and accuracy of measurements limited observations due to poor maintenance of the instruments data rights and hence sharing impediments habib et al 2012 maidment et al 2014 chwala and kunstmann 2019 these bottlenecks motivate practicing hydrologists in such regions to look beyond the available ground instruments for alternative data sources to support impact analyses more recently there has become the need to combine new data collection and processing tools with a view to increase the reliability of such predictions olang and fürst 2010 gebrechorkos et al 2018 zittis 2018 in ungauged basins studies have shown that satellite rainfall products can be used as an alternative source of meteorological data important for river basin management studies blöschl et al 2013 maggioni and massari 2018 belete et al 2020 brocca et al 2020 in limited gauged basins other studies have noted the need to corroborate the existing measurements with products derived from satellite based measurements considering their extensive and dependable global coverage sorooshian et al 2000 jiang et al 2018 lakew et al 2020 consequently the production and application of several satellite precipitation products spps has more recently seen an upward trend across many regions around the globe harris et al 2014 beck et al 2017 liu et al 2017 chen et al 2018 camici et al 2020 while no single product can be said to be perfect for all conditions there is the critical need to test their utilities and reliabilities for applications across various hydro climatic and physiographic conditions some studies already indicate that over complex topography and diverse climatic conditions the uncertainties of the spps can be high rommily and gebremichael 2011 dingman 2015 there has been increasing interest in the application of satellite precipitation products over east african regions of data scarcity näschen et al 2018 oduor et al 2020 pellarin et al 2020 a majority of the studies have focused around the greater lake victoria drainage basin considering its economic significance awange 2021 habib et al 2012 olang et al 2014 williams et al 2015 in relatively smaller transboundary basins however not much has been done partly because of the varied national basin management plans that govern observed data sharing and acquisition thereby limiting requisite validation of satellite based rainfall products in a composite study over east africa kimani et al 2017 noted that most of the satellite precipitation products generally replicate the rainfall patterns but with observable differences when it comes to reproducing characteristics of orographic rainfall events the precipitation products significantly overestimated rainfall amounts in the mountainous areas of east africa similarly the performance of climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirpsv2 and tropical application of meteorology using satellite data tamsatv3 over eastern africa has been found to be varied and weaker in the coastal and mountainous regions dinku et al 2018 consequently according to li et al 2009 the results for some of the products such as tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm based multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa can be much improved by using a systematically bias corrected tmpa rainfall data from literature a majority of studies have largely focused on understanding the performance of trmm 3b42v7 and chirpsv2 products in the region this is partly because they are quasi global products with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution with uninterrupted and uniformly distributed precipitation estimates for the tropical region huffman et al 2007 ngoma et al 2021 also the focus of the studies has been on understanding drought and flood events which are adequately captured by the two products ayugi et al 2019 few studies have focused on other products such as the new integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements gpm 3imerg6 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswepv2 2 tamsatv3 and to some extent the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr which are considered relatively novel and improved over the years this study incorporates such products with a view to understand their performance and applicability for extended use in hydrological modeling in a mesoscale tropical river basin several approaches have been employed to establish the reliability of satellite precipitation products as an alternative source of data knapp et al 2011 gebre and ludwig 2015 belete et al 2020 a common and most used approach is through comparison of derived georeferenced rainfall estimates with rain gauge measurements through statistical measures such as the root mean square error rmse absolute mean error ame correlation coefficients cc and bias moriasi et al 2007 thiemig et al 2013 another approach which is also gaining presence lately is the use of hydrological models the model is first optimized using the available in situ rainfall data and subsequently used to simulate response of the catchment using the georeferenced spps stisen and sandholt 2010 dessu and melesse 2012 maggioni and massari 2018 camici et al 2020 the simulated discharges are then compared with observed discharges using objective functions such as kling gupta efficiency and nash shutcliffe efficiency kling 2002 kling and nachtnebel 2009 in this study the two approaches were disparately tested with a view to better understand the satellite precipitation products for possible use in water allocation studies within the sio malaba malakisi river basin of east africa the statistical measures were first applied through direct comparison of the rainfall datasets and subsequently the indirect model approach further used to understand the discharge variations in selected areas with observed data it also provided an opportunity for the application of the continuous semi distributed runoff model cosero in a tropical basin the evaluation was important to discern products that can be used locally for enhanced catchment management in the transboundary river basin spanning western kenya and eastern uganda in east africa 2 tools and methods 2 1 the study area the study area is the sio malaba malakisi river basin smmrb a shared basin located between longitudes 33 7 and 34 7 e and latitudes 0 1 and 1 2 n on the western kenya border region with eastern uganda in total 5000 km2 are drained by three main rivers the sio river that flows from mt elgon and into lake victoria in the south malakisi and malaba rivers that flow into l kyoga and its wetlands in the south west the drainage pattern of the main stream sio river is dendritic with a high drainage density at its northern most point the elevation of the smmrb rises with mt elgon to an altitude of 4320 m above sea level masl while it merges with lakes victoria and kyoga at an altitude of 1135 and 1033 masl respectively fig 1 the basin is nestled between these two striking topographic features which play an important role in the hydrology of the region based on the two features the area experiences two types of rainfall orographic rainfall which occurs around mt elgon and convectional rainfall near lake victoria the rainfall pattern is normally bimodal with long rains between march and may mam and the short rains between september and november son the average annual rainfall amounts in the basin vary according to the different climatic zones the humid upstream region receives upwards of 2000 mm the sub humid mid basin region receives 1511 mm per annum while the semi arid downstream area receives an average of 776 mm annually mugalavai et al 2008 temperatures in the basin are also highly influenced by orographic regimes due to mt elgon mean maximum temperature is 28 c in the low lying areas and about 5 around the slopes of mt elgon the vegetation and landcover comprise of high altitude moorland and forest moist savannah dry savannah and farmlands the area around the slopes of the mountain comprise of forests and the mt elgon national park and forest reserve further there are grasslands wetlands woodland shrubland and small scale cropland irrigated and rain fed dale 1940 iucn 2005 wrem 2008 2 2 gauge based datasets historical 10 day aggregates of observed precipitation time series was obtained from the kenya meteorological department kmd a data quality assessment criterion was applied based on completeness of data atleast 60 complete value difference from and its proximity to nearest neighbors as well as a check for systemic errors and extreme values in this manner only 9 out of 39 gauging stations were selected and a subset period of 1998 2016 chosen the rainfall stations in the smmrb tend to be located in densely populated areas specifically in schools and government premises they are also located in areas of intense agricultural activity as well as near forest stations fig 1 the acquired data henceforth served as the reference for the evaluation of downloaded satellite precipitation estimates additionally daily streamflow records from hydrological stations in the smmrb were acquired from the water regulatory authority wra in kenya for the period 1981 2016 fig 1 the time series has extended periods of missing values due to measurement challenges faulty instruments and limited reporting of measured values unfortunately hydro meteorological data acquisition in uganda proved to be an unresolvable challenge tables 1 and 2 provide a summary of the attributes of the rainfall and hydrological stations used in the study respectively 2 2 1 rainfall gauge distribution to get a better understanding of the performance of the satellite precipitation estimates against the observed precipitation we firstly explore the status of the observed precipitation and the station distribution the observed precipitation denote a specific pattern in rainfall amounts and distribution across the basin for instance there are similarities on rainfall amounts and distribution among stations that are closer to each other or those at similar altitude table 1 fig 1 for example busia 1228 masl is closer to nambale 1234 masl bungoma 1427 masl is closer to nzoia 1490 masl and webuye 1562 masl is closer to lugari 1673 masl hence the pairs depict almost similar rainfall distribution fig 2 busia and nambale lie in the middle of the basin and depict larger distribution of rainfall which could be an effect of their equidistant from two key natural features mt elgon and lake victoria whose different rainfall regimes orographic and convectional rainfall regimes contribute to increased rainfall amounts in the middle of the basin 2 3 satellite precipitation products spps satellite precipitation products are based on data derived from various sensors and satellites they can also include other data sources such as ground radar gauge networks or forecasts from model or reanalysis in this study six satellite precipitation products were chosen because of their diversity high spatial resolution coverage domain and periods of availability maidment et al 2017 additionally the suitability of the products to capture precipitation patterns and extremes over a tropical region was considered the product attributes are described in table 3 2 3 1 chirpv2 the chirps dataset is a composite of five different data inputs that include in situ rainfall measurements pentadal precipitation climatology quasi global geostationary thermal infrared satellite observations from both the climate prediction center infrared product and the national climatic data center infrared product knapp et al 2011 funk et al 2015 it also utilizes the trmm product from nasa li et al 2009 and atmospheric model rainfall fields from noaa climate forecast system version 2 saha et al 2010 the pentadal rainfall estimates are generated from satellite data based on cloud cover duration which is based on regression models calibrated using trmm they are expressed as a percent of normal and multiplied by the corresponding precipitation climatology station data is then blended with this data to produce chirps dinku et al 2018 some of the africa daily data has a finer spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 to support land surface modeling activities the final estimates are available in netcdf geotiff and esri bil formats funk et al 2015 2 3 2 trmm 3b42v7 trmm 3b42 v7 product combines passive microwave precipitation estimates from the special sensor microwave imager and sounder trmm microwave imager the advanced microwave sounding unit the microwave humidity sounder and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer the passive microwave data is first calibrated using the combined trmm microwave imager and trmm precipitation radar product and then used to calibrate geosynchronous infrared inputs rainfall estimates are freely available and have a temporal coverage of 1998 2019 with subsequent datasets provided by its successor the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm 3imerg6 huffman et al 2007 alazzy et al 2017 2 3 3 mswep v2 2 mswepv2 is a unique precipitation estimate that combines the advantages of gauge satellite and reanalysis datasets to provide reliable precipitation estimates at a global scale it optimally combines 76 747 gauge observations to determine precipitation estimates from worldclim including kitale station which is near the study area ncei noaa 2021 global historical climatology network daily ghcn d global summary of the day gsod and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc the product merges these sources with non gauge based sources such as infrared gridded satellite gridsat global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap and trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt and reanalysis products such as the interim reanalysis era interim center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 product beck et al 2019 the processing involves gauge data quality control to remove erroneous zeros as is common in gsod database gauge based assessment of satellite and reanalysis datasets determination of long term mean precipitation frequency correction and dataset harmonization the satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets are then merged and a gauge correction scheme applied to the final product the mswepv2 product is designed for hydrological modeling and to merge the highest quality precipitation data sources available as a function of time scale and location nair and indu 2017 beck et al 2019 2 3 4 tamsatv3 the dataset used in this study is derived from the tamsat version 3 0 dekadal 10 day as a temporal timestep for rainfall estimates the algorithm comprises two main data inputs meteosat thermal infrared tir imagery from the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat and rain gauge measurements for calibration the algorithm is a cloud indexing approach where the duration of cold cloud tops exceeding a certain temperature threshold acts as a proxy for rainfall maidment et al 2014 2017 for the african region the tamsatv3 rainfall estimates have been validated using observed daily rain gauge measurements from five countries that is mozambique niger nigeria uganda and zambia tarnavsky et al 2014 2 3 5 persiann cdr persiann cdr uses the archive of gridded satellite gridsat b1 infrared data as an input to the persiann model the persiann model algorithm combines ir and pmw information from multiple global geosynchrous satellites as the primary source of precipitation information the algorithm uses an artificial neural network ann model to extract cold cloud pixels and neighboring features from geo longwave ir images it then associates variations in each pixel s brightness temperature to estimate the pixel s surface rainfall rate sorooshian et al 2000 ashouri et al 2015 in order to eliminate pmw observations in the cdr product the nonlinear parameters of the ann model are trained and remain fixed when persiann is used for retrospective estimation of rainfall rates using gridsat b1 infrared window data the resulting estimates are then bias corrected using the global precipitation climatology project gpcp 2 5 monthly precipitation product liu et al 2017 this product has been specifically developed for climate and variability studies 2 3 6 gpm 3imerg6 the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurements gpm 3imerg6 final run product combines precipitation estimates from all microwave sensors ir observations from whatever constellation of satellites operating around the earth at a given time and monthly gauge data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and a half hour temporal resolution the algorithm is important over regions that do not have ground based precipitation measuring equipment such as the smmmrb the imerg version 6 algorithm is able to merge the early precipitation estimates collected between the years 2000 2014 during the operation of trmm satellite tan et al 2019 in this manner it is possible to retrieve past precipitation estimates and extend the recording period which is critical for hydrological studies 2 4 evaluation of satellite products our main focus was to evaluate the performance of 6 satellite precipitation product estimates by comparing them to station observations across the smmrb the comparison was done at both the monthly and annual time steps in the next step the products were first resampled to 0 25 by 0 25 pixel resolution then used as input in a hydrological model to further compare their performance with observed discharge in an indirect comparison approach this section describes the methodology applied 2 4 1 the approach employed point values from the pixels of each satellite product was georeferenced to gauge location and extracted from the raster files downloaded from data access sites table 3 a point based comparison between the rain gauge stations and the extracted satellite pixel value was applied to evaluate performance of the products in this study the satellite derived rainfall estimates and the observed rain gauge data were aggregated for the period 1998 2016 since this is the period that coincides with the availability of relatively continuous rainfall gauge measurements in the area to allow for comparison of the products with the rain gauge scales the satellite estimates were aggregated to monthly and annual temporal resolutions the analysis then focused on the comparison of individual gauge observations versus satellite estimates as done by alazzy et al 2017 and lakew et al 2020 to guide the comparative analysis two different analytical approaches were applied the continuous statistical measurement and a hydrological evaluation using the cosero hydrological model 2 4 2 statistical measures various statistical measures were applied to corroborate the performance of satellite precipitation products with gauged observations table 4 in this regard the following validation measurements were used correlation coefficient cc mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and percent bias r bias these are calculated as shown in table 4 eqs 1 5 respectively moriasi et al 2007 thiemig et al 2013 where p est are the satellite precipitation estimates and p obs is the observed rain gauge precipitation over bar is the mean and n is the number of samples considered 2 4 3 spatial evaluation spatial evaluation was done by first conducting a resampling of all the spps rasters to a common spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the mean daily pixel values were then extracted and aggregated to monthly and then annual sums for each product for the period of investigation kimani et al 2017 lakew et al 2020 this was done to allow a fair comparison of the products since they have different spatial and temporal extents the products were then mapped over the study area and compared based on the long term mean monthly and mean yearly precipitation performances 2 4 4 hydrological evaluation the hydrological simulations were performed using the conceptual rainfall runoff model cosero continuous semidistributed runoff model e g eder et al 2005 stanzel et al 2008 kling and nachtnebel 2009 kling et al 2015 herrnegger et al 2018 2015 2012 wesemann et al 2018 klingler et al 2021 which has a construct that is comparable to the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model bergström 1995 the model was developed at the university of natural resources and life sciences vienna boku and evolved from a model structure that was originally developed for real time runoff forecasting for the enns river in austria nachtnebel et al 1993 since then substantial improvements have been incorporated into the model e g for the application of cosero to water balance studies real time flood forecasting systems distributed routing issues or for implementing new optimization methods herrnegger et al 2012 2018 cosero accounts for actual evapotranspiration interception storage soil water storage separation of runoff into different flow components and routing by means of a cascade of linear and non linear reservoirs a detailed description of the model including some previous applications and model equations can be found in kling et al 2015 given the limited availability of spatially distributed data in the smmrb the model was setup in a lumped manner with the smmrb being divided into ten sub catchments fig 1 table 1 the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm30 dem farr and kobrick 2000 was used for sub basin and stream delineation sub basin outlets consider gauge station locations but also important physical characteristics e g the confluence of important tributaries land use maps for developing mean land use classes were obtained from the european space agency land cover classification map of africa esa www esa int esa multimedia images 2017 10 african land cover which has a resolution of 20 m and distinguishes 10 land use classes for africa and 10 classes for the smmrb dominant land use and vegetation were considered to characterize each sub basin in this study the acquired satellite precipitation estimates were used as rainfall inputs into the cosero model to predict possible catchment runoff responses for this study climatic research unit time series cru ts v 4 01 global gridded data from the university of east anglia harris et al 2014 for potential evapotranspiration was used the simulation results were compared with historical measured records at 3 gauging stations the observed records for gauging station 1ab01 had many errors and since it pours into gauging station 1ad02 the later stations record were used instead the simulated monthly discharges were compared with the measured discharge acquired from the wra 2 4 5 simulation periods and parameter evaluation the streamflow simulation was done for the period 1983 2016 with a spin up period of two years 1981 and 1982 to equilibrate the system states and to mitigate for unknown initial conditions the model was calibrated for the period 1983 2002 25 years and validated for the period 2003 2016 13 years the cosero model was run with monthly timesteps wesemann et al 2018 mehdi et al 2021 the shuffle complex evolution sce optimization algorithm method was applied for the calibration of the model the sce optimization method was chosen over other optimization methods such as monte carlo rosenbrock and the dynamically dimensioned search dds because it combines three crucial concepts desirable in a conceptual watershed hydrological model calibration i systemic evolution of a complex of points across the parameter space ii competitive evolution and iii complex shuffling these elements make the sce method effective robust flexible and efficient duan et al 1994 kratzert et al 2018 nachtnebel et al 2013 schulz et al 2016 a total of 13 parameters were selected for calibration in the smmrb the calibration procedure exposed the poor quality of observed discharge data with the many gaps weakening the performance of certain products fig 3 to evaluate the model performance the following objective functions are applied table 5 3 results 3 1 evaluation of satellite precipitation products performance 3 1 1 performance against station observations monthly time scale the performance of the satellite products in comparison to the station observations were evaluated and compared over the smmrb the observed low rainfall amounts at the lower altitude region is in contrast to the high amounts recorded in the rest of the basin fig 4 table 1 this can be attributed to the fact that the rest of the basin receives both orographic and convectional rainfall events with increasing amounts towards mt elgon kansiime et al 2013 kendal 1969 consequently all products except mswepv2 2 overestimated the rainfall amounts in this area which normally experiences convectional type of rainfall at a monthly time scale chirpsv2 performed best with a correlation coefficient of 0 75 followed by mswepv2 2 and tamsatv3 at 0 72 each gpm 3imerg6 at 0 70 while trmm 3b42v7 and persiann cdr registered a performance of 0 60 and 0 58 respectively table 6 the better performance by chirpsv2 and tamsatv3 and mswepv2 2 may be because the estimates are bias corrected using gauge measurements hence improving the quality of the final product at port victoria fs station the station at the lowest altitude closest to lake victoria mswepv2 2 underestimated rainfall amounts while reproducing seasonal rainfall patterns with the lowest overall pbias of 4 persiann cdr and gpm 3imerg6 posted high pbias performances of 59 and 49 respectively this is particularly observable in the overestimated rainfall peaks in a majority of the stations fig 4 at lugari the station at the highest altitude all the products performed much closer to station observations than in any other station largely the pbias performance significantly improved in trmm 3b42v7 28 tamsatv3 21 and chirps 14 tables 6 and 4 the scatter plot in fig 5 presents the evaluation of the six satellite precipitation products with rain gauge measurements at the monthly time scale all the products correctly represent the spatial distribution of rainfall however persiann cdr and gpm 3imerg6 have a wider scatter than the other products they also tend to overestimate rainfall amounts beyond 300 mm per month on the other hand the mswepv2 2 product underestimates rainfall amounts but with a smaller scatter the rainfall fields for chirpsv2 and tamsatv3 also have less scatter with marked agreement with station observations in addition the differences in monthly average precipitation amount enlarges as the precipitation amount increases the wide rainfall field scatter for gpm 3imerg6 indicate an overestimation in the majority of the measurements in the period 2003 2014 in a correlation matrix table 7 all the products show a positive correlation with gauge measurements however the strongest relationship is with chirpsv2 0 75 followed by tamsatv3 0 72 and mswepv2 2 0 72 gpm 3imerg6 showed a stronger relationship with chirpsv2 0 79 than with gauge values or any other product table 7 on the other hand persiann cdr 0 59 and trmm 3b42v7 0 60 registered average performances when compared to gauge observations in general the pairs of mswepv2 2 and trmm 3b42v7 mswepv2 2 and chirpsv2 tamsatv3 and chirpsv2 also have a strong correlation with each other 0 89 at the monthly scale 3 1 2 evaluation at an annual time scale at the annual scale trmm 3b42v7 and mswepv2 2 underestimate the rainfall events with a correlation coefficient of 0 60 and 0 77 respectively with an overall pbias of 36 and 2 persiann cdr and gpm 3imerg6 overestimate the rainfall events with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 and 0 67 and a pbias of 58 and 38 respectively fig 6 table 8 on the other hand chirpsv2 and tamsatv3 register good performances at this time step compared to other products however when we consider the pbias the root mean square error and the correlation coefficient chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 marginally outperform tamsat in the scatter plots of the annual sums fig 7 persiann cdr overestimates most of the rainfall amounts with a wider scatter compared to other products gpm 3imerg6 also overestimates a majority of the rainfall events with a wider scatter beyond the 3000 mm range trmm 3b42v7 tamsatv3 and chirpsv2 overestimate rainfall amounts but with less scatter than persiann cdr and gpm 3imerg6 however it is also evident that mswepv2 2 slightly underestimates rainfall at the annual time step similar to the underestimation observed in the monthly evaluation 3 1 3 spatial evaluation results the precipitation products were resampled to the same spatial extent 0 25 0 25 then analyzed mean monthly values and mean annual values were retrieved from each product and the results evaluated for the period 2003 2014 gpm 3imerg6 registered the highest rainfall amounts in the basin during the month of april with an average long term mean of 289 6 mm closely followed by persiann cdr at 230 1 mm fig 8 in all products the highest amount of rainfall is registered around lake victoria to the south as opposed to the mt elgon area to the north however trmm 3b42v7 180 3 mm and mswepv2 2 183 3 mm registered lowest amounts of rainfall during the period under study this result is consistent with the statistical evaluation results seen in fig 4 and table 6 at an annual scale gpm 3imerg6 and persiann cdr once again registered high amounts of rainfall at 2134 mm and 1957 3 mm respectively followed by chirpsv2 at 1634 5 mm and tamsatv3 at 1550 6 mm per annum interestingly all the products registered high amounts of rainfall in the southern part of the basin where the station port victoria fs recorded the lowest amounts of rainfall for the same period fig 9 this may be an indication of the errors that exist in recording observed rainfall measurements in the region further this anomaly in rainfall events could be attributed to two things i the existence of both convectional and relief rainfall in the area and ii the presence of a large water body lake victoria kendal 1969 3 2 indirect evaluation with a hydrological model 3 2 1 water balance evaluation the different satellite precipitation products were used as input into the cosero model to generate discharge the simulations were then compared against gauge measurements as a performance measure a summary of the overall statistical performance is provided in the appendix of this article appendix tables a 1 and a 2 in basin 2 which is characterized by a mountainous terrain the performance indicates overcompensation by the model for most of the generated discharges this could be attributed to both the quality of observed discharge data at 1ad02 as well as the varying capability of some of the satellite products to retrieve rainfall events in mountainous regions dinku et al 2011 chen et al 2013 in basin 2 the difference between simulated discharge and observed discharge is much higher in chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 while it is lowest in trmm 3b42v7 and gpm 3imerg6 this is consistent with li et al 2009 and kimani et al 2017 who observe that trmm based products underperform in mountainous terrains it also shows that cosero model tried to compensate for the deficiency in the performance of products such as chirpsv2 mswepv2 2 and persiann cdr generally simulated discharge exceeds the observed discharge for all the products in basin 2 in basin 3 the water balance performance by all the products improve significantly compared to basin 2 trmm 3b42v7 performs best while mswepv2 2 performs poorly compared to the other products in basin 8 the largest basin among the three there is significant changes in the water balance performance by all the products with the best performance posted by gpm 3imerg6 and chirpsv2 while the worst performance was by mswepv2 2 and persian cdr however the difference in performance among the products is marginal in this basin as is the case in the previous 2 basins fig 10 3 2 2 actual evapotranspiration actual evaporation estimates of over 1000 mm or 66 of the rainfall is not unusual in the study area piper plinston and sutcliffe 1986 alemayehu et al 2017 however since no known actual evaporation data exists for the basin cru ts v4 01 potential evapotranspiration data was used to drive the model shi et al 2017 in this regard the eta performance of the six spps with the cosero model showed marked differences across the basin persiann cdr registered the highest eta value of over 1600 mm a throughout the basin while mswepv2 2 registered a value closest to the estimated area average of 1000 mm a in all the basins in basin 2 only simulations with trmm 3b42 and persiann cdr recorded higher eta values during the validation process compared to the calibration process the trmm 3b42 then registered reduced eta value in basin 3 during the validation process while persiann cdr maintained a high eta value in basin 8 all the products exhibit higher eta values during the validation process with trmm 3b42v7 382 66 mm and persiann cdr 218 59 mm recording much higher validation values over the calibration values fig 11 in general the large differences in eta simulations highlight the uncertainties in this water balance component also it becomes clear that the eta simulations strongly depend on the rainfall input the model and calibration process allows for compensation of biases in rainfall inputs by adjusting the eta component 3 2 3 bias performance evaluation the various products registered varied bias performances in different basins however the average magnitude of bias fell below 39 mm across the three basins which indicates better performance by the model even though persiann cdr registers a basin average bias performance of 39 66 mm it also posted an extreme bias of 100 mm in basin 8 during the validation process an indication of deterioration in model performance due to numerous outlier values in the product fig 12 in the same basin the lowest bias was by gpm 3imerg6 at 27 4 mm in basin 2 mswepv2 2 exhibits the lowest bias of less than 0 5 mm in the validation procedure trmm 3b42v7 and tamsatv3 register a bias of 2 57 mm and 7 14 mm respectively in basin 3 fig 12 in the same basin persiann cdr registered the highest bias at 17 91 mm hence the weakest performance of the six products in the validation process generally gpm 3imerg6 showed the lowest overall bias performance across the three sub basins 14 5 mm followed by mswepv2 2 16 15 mm trmm3b42v7 19 68 mm tamsatv3 19 91 mm and chirpsv2 21 mm fig 12 3 2 4 nse performance evaluation the nse validation performance from basin 8 indicate a performance range of 0 58 0 73 by all the products except persiann cdr which posted an nse value of 0 24 the highest nse performance for basin 8 was produced by mswepv2 2 nse 0 73 followed by gpm 3imerg6 nse 0 69 and chirps nse 0 68 however in the upper basins the overall nse performance was average for basin 2 nse 0 50 and deteriorated in basin 3 nse 0 39 from an average of nse 0 58 for basin 8 for all the products fig 13 more specifically the highest performance in basin 2 was gpm3 imerg6 nse 0 60 followed by mswepv2 2 nse 0 53 chirpsv2 nse 0 52 and trmm 3b42v7 nse 0 51 the lowest nse value was by tamsatv3 nse 0 38 in basin 3 the nse performance range was between 0 31 and 0 48 with tamsatv3 posting the lowest value at 0 31 while mswepv2 2 posted the highest at 0 49 to better understand the performance of the products in the smmrb we can deduce nse performance from basin 8 which had fairly complete observed discharge data in the study area in that regard mswepv2 2 gpm 3imerg6 chirpsv2 trmm 3b42v7 and tamsatv3 exhibit decreasing performances in that order fig 13 4 discussion the overall performance of the six analyzed products for the region is acceptable however chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 outperformed the other products in both the statistical and hydrological model evaluation just as observed over the blue nile in eastern africa the products are able to replicate the highest volume of precipitation throughout the two rainy seasons mam and ond as captured by station measurements belete et al 2020 this result is consistent with those of dinku et al 2018 who reported chirpsv2 as best suited for estimating rainfall across the east african terrain over a product such as tamsatv3 on the other hand the good performance by mswepv2 2 is because it integrates daily gauge observations in calibrating rainfall estimates while accounting for errors in reporting times hence guaranteeing good performance even across ungauged basins maidment et al 2014 funk et al 2015 beck et al 2019 the third best product overall was gpm 3imerg6 which performed well in the model evaluation even though it overestimated rainfall in some parts of the basin this is also consistent with results from other parts of eastern africa where gpm 3imerg6 was found to overestimate rainfall by upto 30 in the western ethiopian highlands wedajo et al 2021 all the products were able to capture the seasonal rainfall patterns in the basin however at the annual scale using both the statistical approach and the cosero model for basin wide evaluation the bias performance of a product such as persiann cdr pbias 58 and 100 mm was quite high further the performance for trmm 3b42v7 pbias 36 and 30 mm in basin 2 and 3 confirm that the product is influenced by topography ouma et al 2012 kimani et al 2017 consequently the results mirror those of a study in neighboring nzoia river basin which proposed adjustments or a correction index for the use of trmm based products in the area based on temporal scales topography and rainfall season ouma et al 2012 to overcome errors in the final rainfall estimates most products incorporate gauge measurements and the closest gauge to the study area used in calibration of the spps is kitale ke000063661 ncei noaa 2021 however even though persiann cdr and tamsatv3 also include gauge observations from ghcn and gpcp for calibration maidment et al 2014 liu et al 2017 this is not a guarantee for better performance in the area as exemplified by persiann cdr as for the varying performance of spps in the cosero hydrological model in the area two observations are evident first the quality of the measured hydro meteorological data used cannot be guaranteed this was noted in the disparity between the low rainfall volumes recorded at port victoria fs station and the spatial analysis that show relatively high rainfall events near lake victoria secondly the results obtained here reflect those obtained from previous studies with other models coron et al 2012 alfieri et al 2013 which conclude that the reliability of certain model simulations such as glofas and mordor6 decreases from the humid european basins to the hydrologically heterogeneous african basins for example in basin 8 the highest kling gupta efficiency kge performance was registered by mswepv2 2 0 77 and chirpsv2 0 75 while the poorest performance was by persiann cdr 0 37 this varied performance is a clear indication of the data acquisition challenges and how it impacts hydrological studies in african basins the overall bias performance for tamsatv3 19 92 mm was closer to trmm 3b42v7 19 70 mm and better than chirpsv2 21 0 mm which initially had better performances in the statistical evaluation trmm 3b42v7 inconsistent in mountainous terrains of the tropical region ouma et al 2012 showed a slight improvement in the model evaluation for basin 2 at the slopes of mt elgon the terrain was found to poorly impact rainfall estimation by most satellite products because of the high altitude most product sensors give cold cloud detection as an indication of rainfall events dinku et al 2011 the eta simulations for instance in basin 8 showed substantial differences for simulations with tamsatv3 mswepv2 2 and persiann cdr our results underline the large uncertainties in actual evapotranspiration simulations and that the eta simulations strongly depend on the rainfall inputs the model and calibration process allows for compensation of biases in rainfall inputs by adjusting the eta water balance component measurements of eta would allow to narrow down the uncertainties but are not available the next steps would be to make decisions as to whether and how satellite data can be processed further so that they can be used in conjunction with the gauge data preliminary results suggest that they can be used but with slight modifications dinku et al 2018 the real issue is therefore to determine if it is possible to configure a locally robust calibration blueprint that can be applied to the satellite data to ensure that they are compatible with the available gauge data and a calibrated rainfall runoff model in this regard a multi objective calibration process might be useful for the study area 5 conclusions in this study we compared the performance of six satellite precipitation products with gauge data and determined their quality as inputs to a hydrological model in a data sparse tropical basin we achieved this by firstly focusing on the comparative performance of each satellite product within the sio malaba malakisi river basin smmrb basin afterwards we tested the usefulness and suitability of each product in driving hydrological simulations with the cosero model on a monthly timestep the model was calibrated using available discharge data from three sub basins calibrated parameters reflect any errors or inconsistencies in the gauge data such as inadequate spatial representation or the manner in which the gauge data was used to obtain sub basin average rainfall inputs 1 all the products were able to replicate rainfall patterns in space and time but showed systematic errors in rainfall retrieval that decreased with an increase in rainfall amounts the systematic errors were mainly in overestimations and showed seasonality as they were larger during the ond rainy season than during the mam rainy season the errors were more evident in a monthly timescale but decreased in a yearly timescale 2 products input data affected their performances in rainfall retrieval most of the products whose precipitation estimates are derived from multiple sensors such as ir tir pmw reanalysis products and gauge observations performed better than those whose estimates rely only fewer sensors or data for example persiann cdr which relies heavily on ir measurements registered weak results in large parts of the basin while products that combine multiple sensors with gauge observations such as chirpsv2 mswepv2 2 tamsatv3 gpm 3imerg6 and trmm 3b42v7 recorded better performances this increased their ability to retrieve different types of rainfall over smmrb a single sensor such as ir alone tends to limit rainfall retrieval ability of different rainfall regimes the distribution of the rain gauges used in calibration also affects the performance of spps therefore there is need to regularly update the algorithms with denser rain gauge data where applicable this affects the way each product varies in performance from region to region 3 for hydrological studies in the region five of the satellite products evaluated can be considered for application however errors in high altitude areas need to be considered during the ond season especially for products using only infrared sensors or fewer sensors to reduce orographic effects elevation and wind direction data are recommended to be included as input data in the development of algorithms to improve the accuracy of orographic rainfall retrieval 4 the cosero hydrological model performance shows quite a good performance in the middle of the basin by most of the products however the bias evaluation and the eta simulations indicate that the model tends to compensate for the performance and biases of products such as persiann cdr and mswepv2 2 5 persiann cdr was found to overestimate rainfall amounts by up to 60 and is therefore not ideal for use as an input in hydrological models in the area chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 products perform best with a kge of 0 73 and 0 77 and a pbias of 14 and 4 respectively 6 at the lower altitude port victoria station all the products were found to overestimate the rainfall amounts except mswepv2 2 7 for the purposes of water resource assessments the findings indicate that it is crucial to select the spps which show good performances in direct comparison with rainfall gauge data and hydrological simulations only then can it be used for water resource allocation and planning the example of persiann cdr shows that one cannot simply use any spps but that a careful selection process is necessary 8 based on our results chirpsv2 is the best precipitation product followed by mswepv2 2 and can therefore be applied in water allocation studies in the smmrb credit authorship contribution statement paul omonge formulated the research

8069,study region reclamation of wetlands including peatlands is legally required in the athabasca oil sands region following bitumen extraction via surface mining which leaves large open pits that are backfilled with saline tailings waste study focus six years of hydrochemical data 2013 2018 from the sandhill fen watershed sfw a 52 ha upland peatland catchment that was built upon highly saline soft tailings were used to evaluate salinity and ion patterns and provide insight on its trajectory in general electrical conductivity ec increased throughout sfw from 1 reduced inflow and outflow 2 changes in water table positions and 3 increased mixing of site wide waters new hydrological insights for the region salinity has increased site wide over time as ec increased by an average of 1585 and 2313 µs cm in the wetland and margins respectively from 2013 to 2018 the uplands were the only region where ec declined by 1747 µs cm over the six years there is also evidence of mixing with underlying tailings waste na cl dominant as the chemical composition of sfw waters shifted from largely ca dominant in 2013 90 to na dominant by 2018 70 based on its current conditions sfw cannot support freshwater peat forming bryophytes and is most chemically similar to naturally occurring saline fens a shift in design strategies is recommended replicating saline instead of freshwater

water quality salinity sodium mixing analysis 1 introduction the current disturbance footprint from bitumen extraction via surface mining in the athabasca oil sands region aosr is approximately 900 km2 and has the potential to increase up to 4800 km2 if all current leases are utilized government of alberta 2020 during the surface mining processes entire landscape surfaces are removed and excavated up to 75 m deep to access the bitumen rich mcmurray formation government of alberta 2020 leaving large open pits in the post mining landscape to mitigate this disturbance the environmental protection and enhancement act legally requires oil companies to reclaim these landscapes back to pre disturbance functioning capability province of alberta 2020 as part of the reclamation strategy these pits are backfilled with tailings waste material referred to as composite tailings which are a saline non segregating slurry containing tailings sand fine tailings and oil sands process water ospw composite tailings have elevated salinity from naturally occurring saline sediments disturbed during mining contributes na and cl kessler et al 2010 leung et al 2003 lord and isaac 1989 and from chemicals naoh and caso4 used during bitumen recovery contributes na ca 2 and so4 2 chalaturnyk et al 2002 matthews et al 2002 since these composite tailings are used to backfill open pits as the first step of the reclamation process there is high potential for salinization of constructed ecosystems in the aosr wetlands are an important component of the reclaimed landscape as they comprise approximately half of the pre disturbance western boreal plains landscape with 90 considered peatlands rooney et al 2012 vitt et al 1996 the natural stratification of the undisturbed organic soil profile enables peatlands to perform many important ecosystem functions and feedbacks nwaishi et al 2015a waddington et al 2015 including carbon sequestration nwaishi et al 2015b rooney et al 2012 and water regulating functions waddington et al 2015 that are critical for adjacent ecosystems as the aosr is characterized by a sub humid climate with multi year water deficits devito et al 2012 2005 smerdon et al 2007 2005 constructing peatlands comes with an array of challenges ketcheson et al 2016 as their critical ecosystem functions and feedbacks typically form over millennia clymo 1983 nwaishi et al 2015a and there are no established methods for their creation following surface mining the potential for ecosystem salinization adds additional complexity and is a barrier towards long term success of constructed peatlands in the aosr while water quality may not directly influence hydrological function it has an important influence on the microbial leung et al 2003 and vegetation communities present hartsock et al 2021 lilles et al 2010 trites and bayley 2009a vitt et al 2016a which in turn affect peat accumulation hydrologic properties and long term peatland development hartsock et al 2021 trites and bayley 2009b the movement of water throughout this landscape is inextricably linked to the transport of solutes in reclaimed landscapes in the aosr salt ingress into reclaimed systems is of concern for their long term success as elevated salinity can negatively impact vegetation growth and peat accumulation glaeser et al 2016 lilles et al 2010 pouliot et al 2012 rooney and bayley 2011 trites and bayley 2009b 2009a vitt et al 2020 despite evidence of salt ingress in reclaimed forested upland systems successful vegetation growth has been achieved as salt accumulation is maintained at depths beyond the rooting zone or is limited to low slope positions kelln et al 2008 kessler et al 2010 elevated salinity and na concentrations are a greater concern in reclaimed lowland and peatland ecosystems due to runoff from uplands and their higher water table wt positions saturated soils can promote upward diffusion from the strong concentration gradient between the composite tailings at depth and the relatively fresh water at the surface bailey 2001 kessler et al 2010 merrill et al 1983 evapotranspiration can draw water and associated solutes towards the surface merrill et al 1983 moran et al 1990 rezanezhad et al 2012a where evapo concentration can increase salinity biagi et al 2019 simhayov et al 2017 there is also potential for advective transport throughout the peatlands and the broader reclamation landscape from areas influenced by deeper saline groundwater systems kessel et al 2018 vessey et al 2019 while peat structure can buffer the effects of saline waters via ion attenuation from the polarity and presence of closed and dead end pores hoag and price 1995 rezanezhad et al 2016a peat used in reclamation quickly reaches its buffering capacity due to the elevated ion concentrations and degraded peat material biagi et al 2021 rezanezhad et al 2012b vessey et al 2019 additionally cation exchange can release adsorbed na back into solution as higher valent ions such as ca 2 and mg 2 have a higher affinity to soil particles carroll 1959 evidence of a combination of these mechanisms has already been observed in reclaimed peatlands as salinities and ion concentrations have increased considerably since construction biagi et al 2019 kessel et al 2018 simhayov et al 2017 vessey et al 2019 that are considerably higher than most undisturbed peatlands in the aosr e g bogs poor fens moderate rich fens and extreme rich fens chee and vitt 1989 trites and bayley 2009a vitt and chee 1990 as a result borkenhagen and cooper 2019 reported shifts in plant communities at the nikanotee fen caused in part by site wide increases in ec and vitt et al 2016b 2020 reported that continued increases in sodium concentrations at the sandhill fen watershed could alter community structure in the wetland especially with respect to bryophytes that are particularly sensitive to sodium currently only two constructed peatland watersheds exist within the aosr daly et al 2012 wytrykush et al 2012 and with the likelihood of salinization it is critical to understand the most effective design strategies that can effectively flush salts while limiting their impact on the ecosystem and promote peatland development the objectives of this research are to use the first six years of hydrochemical data from a recently constructed peatland to 1 examine changes in inorganic solute distribution 2 understand the influence of the dominant hydrological fluxes on the concentration and distribution of inorganic solutes and 3 use stable isotopes of water to identify major source waters and their interactions this work advances upon that presented in biagi et al 2019 which assesses the early hydrochemical patterns as a result of management practices while this study assessed the longer term patterns since active management ceased 2 site description the sandhill fen watershed sfw was constructed in the northwest corner of a formerly mined area 1977 1999 called east in pit and is part of syncrude canada ltd s base mine 57 02 n 111 35 w located approximately 40 km north of fort mcmurray alberta this region is situated in the wbp ecoregion of western canada which is characterized by a cold and sub humid climate where mean annual potential evapotranspiration 607 mm exceeds mean annual precipitation 456 mm with 342 mm of precipitation falling predominantly as rain between may and september environment canada 2020 wytrykush et al 2012 thirty year climate normal data 1981 2010 for fort mcmurray indicates that average annual daily temperature is 0 7 1 2 c where lowest and warmest temperatures typically occur in january averaging 18 8 5 0 c and july averaging 16 8 1 1 c respectively environment canada 2020 the sfw was built atop 35 m of composite tailings containing ospw followed by a 10 m tailings sand structural cap the sfw has a 17 ha fen wetland 35 ha upland including 20 ha of upland hillslopes that vary in elevation from 3 to 8 m above the wetland referred to as hummocks fig 1 wytrykush et al 2012 there is a total of seven hummocks which were constructed of mechanically placed tailings sand and were designed to create upland recharge areas to supply water to the wetland area excluding the hummocks 0 5 m of clay was laid on top of the tailings sand cap to maintain water table wt position and to attenuate upward migration of salts from the ct layer followed by 0 5 m of peat mineral mix and 0 5 m of peat in the uplands and wetland respectively peat placed in the wetland was harvested and salvaged in the fall 2010 from the upper 0 6 m of a poor fen north of syncrude s base mine and was placed with a bulldozer in january 2011 inflow and outflow can be managed via a pump system that was installed during construction intended to maintain wetness and mitigate the elevated salinity in addition to precipitation and groundwater water can be supplied to the clay lined water storage pond referred to as the inlet from a nearby undisturbed lake mildred lake which gradually flows through a gravel dam into the wetland area of sfw surface and near surface water flow east and through a v notch weir when at the outlet where water is collected in a sump which has a pump system to discharge water it should be noted that outflow this water can only occur when the sump pump is activated and otherwise water accumulates in the outlet without any pump activation further details on the pump system can be found in biagi et al 2019 and nicholls et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 field measurements a network of 30 near surface fully slotted pvc wells were installed during 2013 2014 throughout sfw fig 1 to depths between 0 48 and 1 02 m in 2013 11 near surface wells were installed which expanded by 22 near surface wells in 2014 ten solinst ltc levelogger junior pressure transducers were deployed at the bottom of these near surface wells that took measurements of water level water temperature and electrical conductivity every 15 min from may to october each year from 2014 to 2018 wells instrumented with these leveloggers changed over the study period and are indicated in table a1 levelogger measurements were only made in five wells surrounding boardwalk 3 from july to september in 2013 before the network of wells and sampling frequency expanded in 2014 table a1 manual measurements of water level were made monthly at minimum for quality assurance and control solinst level measurements were corrected for barometric pressure using a solinst barologger to increase the spatial representation of water quality parameters discrete measurements of temperature electrical conductivity and ph were taken monthly at minimum using a ysi professional plus multiparameter or ysi pro dss instrument at over 50 surface and well sampling sites fig 1 all ec values both discrete and continuous were corrected to 25 c hayashi 2004 the ysi instruments were calibrated before each use while the sampling period was the same among all years may to october sample distribution and frequency varied slightly each year as the sampling strategy changed over the years table a1 in 2013 13 surface and near surface water samples were taken between weekly and monthly frequencies in 2014 and 2015 sample sites increased to 21 and 19 sites respectively and were sampled bi weekly in 2016 sampling distribution and frequency decreased consideraby due to the fort mcmurray horse river wildfire where samples were taken at 12 sites monthly from july to october upland wells were excluded from sampling in 2015 and 2016 in 2017 and 2018 sample sites increased again to 21 sites and were sampled on a monthly basis table a1 all near surface wells were purged up to 24 hours prior to sample collection using a model 428 biobailer that was cleaned and environmentalized between sites samples were also collected using model 428 biobailer which captures water throghout the entire water column in the slotted well samples were stored in 500 ml or 1000 ml petg sample bottles and kept in a cooler until they could be stored at 4 c duplicate samples were taken every ten samples and both field and laboratory blanks were included in each sampling campaign for quality assurance and quality control wells were named according to their position within sfw where the suffix b represents wells along boardwalks one to three tr represents wells in the margins transition and up represents wells in the uplands fig 1 samples taken during pumping events were reduced to surface water samples in wetland area only and included b1 s1 b2 s1 b3 s1 and the outlet rainfall isotope samples were collected via precipitation isotope collectors that were installed adjacent to met stations fig 1 based on the design of gröning et al 2012 rainfall was analyzed for major ions when there was excess water available after stable isotope samples were taken snowmelt was also sampled for major ions directly from snowpack samples which were allowed to melt before filtering and analysis additionally snowmelt runoff from hillslopes was collected via runoff collectors and were analyzed for major ions fig 1 details on runoff collector construction can be found in biagi and carey 2020 3 2 laboratory sample preparation all samples were vacuum filtered within 24 hours of collection surface water samples were filtered using gf f 25 mm 0 7 µm filters for particulate organic carbon analysis while well samples were filtered using 47 mm 0 45 µm nitro cellulose filters filtrate for major ion analysis were stored in 60 ml translucent hdpe bottles at 4 c before being transported to the biogeochemistry laboratory university of waterloo samples were analyzed for na k mg 2 ca 2 cl and so4 2 using ion chromatography with dionex ics 6000 ionpac as18 and cs12a analytical columns the minimum detection limit was 0 2 mg l for na k and mg 2 and was 0 1 mg l for ca 2 cl and s sulfate n nitrate and n nitrite as part of the analytical quality assurance and control procedures 5 of samples were re run as duplicates hco3 concentrations were calculated by multiplying the alkalinity values by a conversion factor of 1 22 which is a standard conversion method csuros 1994 stable isotope samples stored in 20 ml polyethylene scintillation vials at room temperature and transferred to the mitchell research group at the university of toronto ratios of hydrogen and oxygen were analyzed using a los gatos research dtl 100 water isotope analyzer five standards of known isotope composition with δ 2h ranging from 154 to 4 purchased from los gatos research were used for calibration in addition to periodic checks using the international standards vsmow2 and slap2 during analytical runs samples were interwoven with standards at a ratio of 3 1 3 3 data analysis ion concentrations were converted from mg l to mmol l or meq l to compare the relative abundance of ions in piper diagrams as the molecular weight for each ion is incorporated into the converted values stable isotope of water results δ2h and δ18o were plotted against a local meteoric water line lmwl that was developed for syncrude canada ltd s mildred lake base mine along with mine source waters baer 2014 baer et al 2016 a local evaporation line lel was developed in biagi et al 2019 and is used in this study 4 results 4 1 general hydrochemical trends 4 1 1 annual patterns in general ec increased across the sfw over the study period and the occurrence of wet and dry years biagi et al 2021 had little influence on the observed year over year increase fig 2 average wetland ec increased by 1600 µs cm from 2013 to 2018 530 µs cm every two years while average margin ec observed a larger increase of 2300 µs cm from 2013 to 2018 and has stabilized since 2016 fig 2 table a2 unlike the wetlands where a year over year increase was typically observed the highest average ec in the margins occurred during wet years 2016 and 2018 of 4272 and 3922 µs cm respectively whereas dry years 2014 2015 and 2017 were considerably lower averaging 2765 2911 and 3531 µs cm respectively fig 2 table a2 the upland areas were the only region that exhibited a decrease in annual ec across study years where values decreased from 3870 µs cm in 2013 2123 µs cm in 2018 however this is potentially skewed as only one measurement was taken in 2013 fig 2 when comparing average upland ec across 2014 2018 values are relatively consistent throughout the upland fig 2 table a2 ion concentrations emulated ec patterns with values increasing site wide year over year fig 2 of particular importance is the rising na concentrations compared to other ions average na concentrations were relatively low in 2013 whereas ca 2 typically exceeded na in early years in general na concentrations increased overtime whereas ca 2 concentrations decreased or stabilized fig 2 average na and ca 2 concentrations in 2013 were 56 87 and 190 mg l and 107 287 and 632 mg l in the wetland margins and uplands respectively na increased considerably by 2018 where average concentrations were 349 469 and 350 mg l in the wetland margins and uplands respectively where some sites reached up to 886 1090 and 570 mg l respectively table a2 comparatively average ca 2 only moderately increased in the wetland to 263 mg l from 2013 to 2018 and decreased in the margins and uplands to an average of 252 and 116 mg l respectively 4 1 2 spatial patterns while ec generally increased across the site it varied spatially as some areas remained relatively fresh 1000 µs cm while other areas exceeded 8500 µs cm fig 3 through the first six years an ec gradient developed along two main transects 1 across the wetland and 2 from the south upland swale towards the north margins of sfw fig 3 in 2013 there was little gradient across the wetland as all areas had similar average ec 1000 µs cm the highest average ec in 2013 was in the uplands 3870 µs cm which decreased northward towards the south margins 2391 µs cm the wetland 1580 µs cm and to the northern margins 670 µs cm fig 3a the ec across the wetland transect increased in the following years where ec was highest at b1 and decreased towards b3 ecs in 2015 and 2018 averaged 2897 and 3803 µs cm at b1 2445 and 3309 µs cm at b2 and 1323 and 2242 µs cm at b3 respectively fig 3b c where maximum ec at b1 b2 and b3 reached 7426 5498 and 3745 µs cm respectively in 2018 table a3 following 2013 ec became lowest in the uplands averaging 1295 and 993 µs cm in 2015 and 2018 respectively and highest in the southern margins averaging 3984 and 5230 µs cm in 2015 and 2018 respectively fig 3b c the average wetland and northern margin ec were intermediate and averaged 1563 and 2710 µs cm in the wetland and 2029 and 2007 µs cm in the northern margins for 2015 and 2018 respectively fig 3b c 4 2 influence of precipitation wetland and margin ec had opposing responses to changes in wt from rainfall average ec of 45 µs cm and evaporation fig 4a considering all wetland sites from 2014 to 2018 excluding 2013 with high pump activity pearson correlation results indicate a significant negative correlation between wetland wt position and ec p 1 3e 28 r2 0 2 where increases and decreases in wetland wts were followed by a decrease dilution of ions and increase concentration of ion in ec respectively this pattern was more evident in dry years 2014 2015 and 2017 where wts continuously declined throughout the growing season as ec increased at all boardwalks table a3 seasonal increases in ec evapo concentration became greater as the years progressed as average ec in the wetland from may to october increased by 402 368 and 865 µs cm in 2013 2015 and 2018 respectively table a3 in contrast margin ec was positively correlated with wt position where increasing wt position increased ec ion mobilization and a decrease in wt lowered ec p 5 7e 17 r2 0 1 fig 4b seasonal ec changes were subtle in the margin where average ec either decreased or showed minimal change from may to october across study years table a3 upland wt position and ec was variable over the study period and were not significantly correlated p 0 09 r2 0 02 table a3 4 3 influence of the pumps in early years the combination of inflow and outflow maintained lower ec in the wetland in 2013 the outflow pump was highly active biagi et al 2021 and resultant wetland ec was relatively low fig 3 following 2013 the outflow pump was only active for pre planned drainage events in 2015 2017 and 2018 of 55 102 and 210 mm of outflow respectively biagi et al 2021 while outflow was low in 2015 ec still decreased at all boardwalks by 1000 µs cm yet these values returned back to pre pumping salinities within two weeks following the pumping event 2800 µs cm table 1 however during the 2017 and 2018 outflow pump events ec remained similar to pre pumping values or increased post pumping table 1 despite the events being considerably longer 122 and 276 h respectively than the 2015 outflow pumping event 60 h biagi et al 2021 a 100 year rainfall event 92 mm in 24 h occurred shortly after the 2018 pumping event which likely resulted in the lower ec two weeks following pumping table 1 4 4 influence of mixing in 2013 site wide water samples were predominantly ca dominant 90 of all samples which classified mostly as ca so4 47 and ca hco3 41 whereas only 6 of samples were na dominant fig 5 this chemical composition matched that of input waters inflow and rain which were ca hco3 dominant following 2013 the chemical composition of site wide waters began to shift where 69 of samples were ca dominant and 31 were na dominant in 2015 and by 2018 73 were na dominant and only 27 of samples were ca dominant fig 5 additionally 32 of samples in 2018 compared to 2 and 0 in 2015 and 2013 respectively are na cl dominant which is similar to the chemical composition of ospw while this shift towards na dominant waters is evident across all sites this pattern varied spatially where the margins experienced the greatest shift from ca to na dominant waters followed by the wetland and uplands fig 5 these high na areas corresponded to the highest ec areas in sfw whereas more ca dominant areas correspond with lower ec regions within sfw fig 3 stable isotopes of water also indicate increased mixing of sfw waters over time as the variability in both δ2h and δ18o decreased year over year fig 6 average δ2h and δ18o and their respective standard deviations decreased from 129 2 16 9 and 15 1 3 2 respectively in 2014 to 134 6 9 6 and 16 3 1 5 respectively in 2018 in 2014 and 2015 there was a large evaporative signal indicated by the number of samples that plot along the lel this evaporative signal decreased over time as samples shifted down the lel where most samples in 2018 plot on the lower portion of the lel between the isotopic signatures of sfw groundwater and ospw fig 6 in general sfw waters from early years 2014 2015 plot closer to the signature for sfw input waters which overtime showed increased similarity to the chemical signature of ospw 5 discussion the sfw was designed as a pilot project to test how peatlands could be constructed on top of composite tailings in the aosr and to evaluate how the designed watershed develops in terms of hydrology water chemistry and vegetation the ubiquitous salinity in aosr reclaimed landscapes poses a considerable challenge for reclamation success as excess salinity negatively affects peatland vegetation development and ultimately peat accumulation overall ecosystem function biagi et al 2021 and feedback mechanisms waddington et al 2015 as a result reclaimed systems are expected to have higher salinity than their natural analogues until these salts are flushed from the system over time ketcheson et al 2016 nwaishi et al 2015a since salt accumulation in these constructed systems is inevitable it is critical that these reclaimed peatlands are designed to limit accumulation 5 1 why is salinity increasing at sfw three main mechanisms can explain the observed year over year increase in ec and ion concentrations throughout sfw 1 a reduction in inflow and outflow 2 shifts in wt position and 3 increased mixing of site wide waters with deeper saline ospw 5 1 1 reduction in inflow and outflow the major hydrological change observed during the first six years was the shift in the dominant fluxes related to management biagi et al 2021 2019 nicholls et al 2016 in 2013 inflow and outflow were more than double the precipitation and evapotranspiration both 800 mm which kept ec and ion concentrations relatively low as fresh water was supplied to the water storage pond and saline water was removed via outlet pumping fig 2 and 3 ec and ion concentrations at the margins was considerably higher than in the wetland as they were not directly affected by the pumping following 2013 the management regime shifted and water was only pumped out when wts became high and flooded the boardwalks once or twice a year in 2015 outflow pumping was still effective at temporarily lowering wetland ec table 1 while pumping events in 2017 and 2018 had minimal or no influence in lowering ec despite removing a greater volume of water table 1 due to the year over year accumulation of ions the single event outflow pumping events in 2017 and 2018 was likely of insufficient duration to flush salts and may have led to increased mobilization of highly saline margin water into the wetland it is unlikely that without a consistent outflow the sfw will be unable to effectively flush salts and lower overall ec 5 1 2 water table position following 2013 wt position primarily responded to precipitation inputs and evaporation wetland wt position was negatively correlated with wetland ec indicating evapo concentration in response to wt decline throughout the growing season or dilution from precipitation inputs fig 4 in contrast margin wt position was positively correlated to ec where ions were mobilized during wet conditions fig 4 most of the margin area borders the base of the hummocks and the south swale which has been identified as the region where upwelling and lateral advection of saline groundwater ospw occurs as the clay liner does not extend under the hummocks fig 3 biagi et al 2019 vessey et al 2019 during wet conditions an increase in wt directs water and saline groundwater from the hummocks to the wetland spennato et al 2018 this mirrors deeper groundwater ec patterns in the 10 m tailings sand cap where reported groundwater ec were lowest underneath the wetland 1000 2000 µs cm and highest in the margin areas 2000 4000 µs cm twerdy 2019 while upland wts were not significantly correlated to ec it was the only region within sfw that observed a decrease in ec with time fig 3 which suggests flushing of ions via recharge due to their high topographic position in the watershed 5 1 3 increased mixing of waters the shift in chemical and isotopic composition of waters overtime suggests increased mixing across sfw piper diagrams indicate that many sites primarily margin sites that border hummocks shifted towards the chemical composition of ospw na cl dominant in 2013 90 of samples were ca 2 dominant as many of the construction materials used in sfw were high in ca 2 biagi et al 2019 while ca 2 was still the dominant ion in 2015 a shift towards increasingly na dominant water emerged particularly in the margins fig 5 by 2018 most of the site wide samples 70 were na dominant indicating considerable presence of ospw this shift in chemical composition is an indication of increased mixing and is supported by the decreased variance in δ2h and δ18o with time implying that surface and near surface sfw water is becoming increasingly similar fig 6 additionally the evaporative signal isotopic enrichment declined over time as fewer samples plot along the lel this matches the observed decline in evapotranspiration since 2016 directly measured at the sfw wetland biagi et al 2021 overall the decreased isotopic variability among samples and increased similarities to the chemical composition of ospw fig 5 fig 6 suggest that sfw waters are becoming increasingly mixed across the site with an increased influence of ospw saline groundwater and ospw emerges at the surface in the margin areas highest ec and na concentrations which are at the base of the hummocks hillslopes biagi et al 2021 2019 vessey et al 2019 the clay liner intended to limit the upward flux of ospw that extends throughout the upland swale margins and wetland is absent from the hummocks which provides windows for ospw to be transported to the surface and spread to other regions of sfw in general solutes from ospw that underlie the sfw likely diffuse upwards into the 10 m tailings sand cap due to the strong concentration gradient between the underlying ospw 4000 µs cm and the overlying groundwater 1000 4000 µs cm which flows northeast twerdy 2019 these solutes are transported via advection the physical movement of chemical constituents via water flow via groundwater which emerges at the southern hummocks hummocks 7 and 8 fig 3 where there clay liner is absent once this water reaches the surface at the base of these hummocks it can mix with surface and near surface waters especially under wet conditions fig 4 comparatively diffusion through the clay and peat soil layers throughout the remainder of sfw is a slow process and was likely a minimal contributor to the overall salinity a conceptual diagram of these transport processes within sfw is presented in figure 9 of biagi et al 2021 5 2 what is the fate of sfw elevated ec and ion concentrations will be a lasting legacy in sfw and across the aosr due to the sheer volume of highly saline tailings waste that is incorporated back into the reclaimed landscape while reclaimed forested systems have exhibited resilience to elevated ec and na due to the lower wts lilles et al 2010 wetlands are more susceptible to salinization as near surface saturation enhances ion mobilization to the surface kelln et al 2008 merrill et al 1983 considering the total volume of ospw underneath the sfw 2 25 107 m3 and the average na concentration of ospw 1005 mg l there was approximately 2 25 1010 g of na within the footprint of the sfw at the time of commission based on the current volume and chemistry of water that has been flushed from the sfw via outflow from 2013 to 2018 2 2 105 m3 only 0 2 of na from the underlying ospw has been flushed between 2013 and 2018 the capacity for sfw to remove these salts within the wetland is limited by the poor buffering capacity of the degraded peat biagi et al 2021 vessey et al 2019 the lack of flushing via outflow and continued emergence of saline groundwater ospw at the base of the hummocks in wet conditions suggesting ions will only continue to accumulate in sfw waters evidence has materialized that the sfw wetland is shifting away from a peatland system based on the current wt position biagi et al 2021 shift in vegetation vitt et al 2020 2016b degraded peat properties biagi et al 2021 and continual increases in ec fig 2 biagi et al 2019 in general vegetation communities and productivity decline with increasing ec and sodium concentrations phillips et al 2016 trites and bayley 2009a 2009b and while some species can tolerate saline and sodic waters nwaishi et al 2015a rezanezhad et al 2016b vitt et al 2020 wells and price 2015 many freshwater peat forming species such as bryophytes cannot increases in wt position and soil moisture have been linked to increases in ion mobilization via both diffusion and advection hoag and price 1995 kelln et al 2008 kessler et al 2010 which is a key characteristic of peatlands where the ideal wt position is close to the surface the high ec and na concentrations reported in sfw have long exceeded that of natural freshwater peatlands in the region chee and vitt 1989 hartsock et al 2021 vitt and chee 1990 and are most similar to natural saline fens hartsock et al 2021 wells and price 2015 that naturally occur in alberta climate change is an additional barrier for the success of reclaimed peatlands as the potential ecosystem response to warmer and wetter climate meehl et al 2007 could lead to an overall decline in peatland wt positions and a subsequently drier environment from an increase in evapotranspiration ireson et al 2015 thompson et al 2017 while natural peatlands have water conserving feedback mechanisms that could potentially mitigate wetter or drier conditions waddington et al 2015 these mechanisms are currently absent in constructed peatlands biagi et al 2021 which put them at much greater risk for continued salinization over time the potential for increased precipitation delivered as rain with climate change could increase dilution in the wetland but could also increase ion mobilization of ospw in the margins comparatively drier conditions could continue to enhance ion concentrations in constructed peatlands as wt decline will amplify via further evapo concentration and reduced snowpacks will greatly reduce the annual freshwater input during spring snowmelt biagi and carey 2020 overall the absence of feedback mechanisms waddington et al 2015 put sfw at risk for enhanced saline conditions regardless of wetter or drier conditions with the onset of climate change 5 3 recommendations elevated salinity is an unavoidable and long lasting barrier towards constructed peatland success in the aosr and designing landscapes capable of flushing these salts without accumulating excessive amounts over time will be the key to their long term success while using a deeper peat soil column during construction would increase the adsorption capacity and removal of ions this is only a temporary solution as soil adsorption capacities are quickly reached due to the elevated concentrations vessey et al 2019 following the recommendations in biagi et al 2021 a general shift in the design strategy for constructed peatlands could help the overall success of these systems which include 1 increase the flushing capacity of the sfw via enhanced recharge and a naturally flowing outlet 2 extend the clay liner beneath the entire peatland watershed and increase the depth of the peat column and 3 shift design goals to better match the outcome in a disturbed landscape first enhancing system recharge via constructing larger hummock structures with high infiltration soils will increase dilution and limit the upward movement of saline water biagi and carey 2020 kelln et al 2008 lukenbach et al 2019 a free flowing outlet that allows for outflow during wet conditions i e when the wt exceeds a certain threshold could also help flush solutes from the system and limit ion accumulation in the wetland secondly extending the clay liner beneath the hummocks will help limit the formation of highly saline areas where ospw is emerging at the surface fig 3 this will also help direct recharge water directly to the margins and wetland and limit any loss of recharge water to deep percolation additionally a deeper peat column in the fen area greater than the current 0 5 m could encourage more attenuation of ions from the saline water the nikanotee fen has both of these components fully extended clay liner and deeper peat column and have shown lower salinities and influence of ospw kessel et al 2018 ketcheson et al 2017 lastly shifting the landscape design strategy to incorporate a perched or upgradient peatland system may reduce potential for salinization as the upgradient areas in sfw have lower salinities from flushing via recharge over time fig 3 peat forming species not necessarily freshwater species may establish more successfully in an upgradient peatland that would receive freshwater input directly from precipitation and recharge where excess water and salts could flow to a down gradient marsh system with vegetation species that can thrive in saline waters and inundated conditions see figure 9 in biagi et al 2021 that said there is unlikely any ecosystem design that will completely eliminate the elevated salinity in constructed peatlands as the near surface wt required for peatland development promotes the upward movement of salts to the surface avoiding salinization all together in constructed peatlands may not be possible and as such designing constructed peatlands similar to naturally occurring saline peatlands with salt tolerant species capable of accumulating peat trites and bayley 2009b volik et al 2017 wells and price 2015 may offer the best chance for success 6 conclusion this research aimed to understand the development of salinity patterns in the sandhill fen watershed sfw a constructed peatland watershed following a heavily managed hydrologic regime to provide insight on its potential for long term success as a peat forming wetland in general ec increased year over year throughout sfw from 2013 to 2018 particularly in the wetland and margin areas the uplands were the only region that observed a decrease in ec over the study period three main mechanisms can explain these salinity patterns firstly reduced inflow and outflow caused year over year ion accumulation throughout the system as there was no flushing of saline waters secondly water table position influenced the hydrochemistry as declining wts enhanced evapo concentration in the wetlands while higher water tables in margins mobilized ions lastly increased mixing of sfw waters with saline groundwater has led to elevated ec and sodium concentrations throughout the system based on its current conditions sfw cannot support freshwater peat forming bryophytes and is most similar to naturally occurring saline fens in the region elevated salinity may be unavoidable in constructed peatland watersheds due to ubiquitous salinity in the post mining landscape shifting design strategies to reconstructing naturally occurring saline peatlands might offer another avenue to increase the success of these systems

km2 and has the potential to increase up to 4800 km2 if all current leases are utilized government of alberta 2020 during the surface mining processes entire landscape surfaces are removed and excavated up to 75 m deep to access the bitumen rich mcmurray formation government of alberta 2020 leaving large open pits in the post mining landscape to mitigate this disturbance the environmental protection and enhancement act legally requires oil companies to reclaim these landscapes back to pre disturbance functioning capability province of alberta 2020 as part of the reclamation strategy these pits are backfilled with tailings waste material referred to as composite tailings which are a saline non segregating slurry containing tailings sand fine tailings and oil sands process water

chemicals naoh and caso4 used during bitumen recovery contributes na ca 2 and so4 2 chalaturnyk et al 2002 matthews et al 2002 since these composite tailings are used to backfill open pits as the first step of the reclamation process there is high potential for salinization of constructed ecosystems in the aosr wetlands are an important component of the reclaimed landscape as they comprise approximately half of the pre disturbance western boreal plains landscape with 90 considered peatlands rooney et al 2012 vitt et al 1996 the natural stratification of the undisturbed organic soil profile enables peatlands to perform many important ecosystem functions and feedbacks nwaishi et al 2015a waddington et al 2015 including carbon sequestration nwaishi et al 2015b rooney et al 2012 and water regulating functions waddington et al 2015 that are critical for adjacent ecosystems as the aosr is characterized by a sub humid climate with multi year water deficits devito et al 2012 2005 smerdon et al 2007 2005 constructing peatlands comes with an array of challenges ketcheson et al 2016 as their critical ecosystem functions and feedbacks typically form over millennia clymo 1983 nwaishi et al 2015a and there are no established methods for their creation following surface mining the potential for ecosystem salinization adds additional complexity and is a barrier towards long term success of constructed peatlands in the aosr while water quality may not directly influence hydrological function it has an important influence on the microbial leung et al 2003 and vegetation communities present hartsock et al 2021 lilles et al 2010 trites and bayley 2009a vitt et al 2016a which in turn affect peat accumulation hydrologic properties and long term peatland development hartsock et al 2021 trites and bayley 2009b the movement of water throughout this landscape is inextricably linked to the transport of solutes in reclaimed landscapes in the aosr salt ingress into reclaimed systems is of concern for their long term success as elevated salinity can negatively impact vegetation growth and peat accumulation glaeser et al 2016 lilles et al 2010 pouliot et al 2012 rooney and bayley 2011 trites and bayley 2009b 2009a vitt et al 2020 despite evidence of salt ingress in reclaimed forested upland systems successful vegetation growth has been achieved as salt accumulation is maintained at depths beyond the rooting zone or is limited to low slope positions kelln et al 2008 kessler et al 2010 elevated salinity and na concentrations are a greater concern in reclaimed lowland and peatland ecosystems due to runoff from uplands and their higher water table wt positions saturated soils can promote upward diffusion from the strong concentration gradient between the composite tailings at depth and the relatively fresh water at the surface bailey 2001 kessler et al 2010 merrill et al 1983 evapotranspiration can draw water and associated solutes towards the surface merrill et al 1983 moran et al 1990 rezanezhad et al 2012a where evapo concentration can increase salinity biagi et al 2019 simhayov et al 2017 there is also potential for advective transport throughout the peatlands and the broader reclamation landscape from areas influenced by deeper saline groundwater systems kessel et al 2018 vessey et al 2019 while peat structure can buffer the effects of saline waters via ion attenuation from the polarity and presence of closed and dead end pores hoag and price 1995 rezanezhad et al 2016a peat used in reclamation quickly reaches its buffering capacity due to the elevated ion concentrations and degraded peat material biagi et al 2021 rezanezhad et al 2012b vessey et al 2019 additionally cation exchange can release adsorbed na back into solution as higher valent ions such as ca 2 and mg 2 have a higher affinity to soil particles carroll 1959 evidence of a combination of these mechanisms has already been observed in reclaimed peatlands as salinities and ion concentrations have increased considerably since construction biagi et al 2019 kessel et al 2018 simhayov et al 2017 vessey et al 2019 that are considerably higher than most undisturbed peatlands in the aosr e g bogs poor fens moderate rich fens and extreme rich fens chee and vitt 1989 trites and bayley 2009a vitt and chee 1990 as a result borkenhagen and cooper 2019 reported shifts in plant communities at the nikanotee fen caused in part by site wide increases in ec and vitt et al 2016b 2020 reported that continued increases in sodium concentrations at the sandhill fen watershed could alter community structure in the wetland especially with respect to bryophytes that are particularly sensitive to sodium currently only two constructed peatland watersheds exist within the aosr daly et al 2012 wytrykush et al 2012 and with the likelihood of salinization it is critical to understand the most effective design strategies that can effectively flush salts while limiting their impact on the ecosystem and promote peatland development the objectives of this research are to use the first six years of hydrochemical data from a recently constructed peatland to 1 examine changes in inorganic solute distribution 2 understand the influence of the dominant hydrological fluxes on the concentration and distribution of inorganic solutes and 3 use stable isotopes of water to identify major source waters and their interactions this work advances upon that presented in biagi et al 2019 which assesses the early hydrochemical patterns as a result of management practices while this study assessed the longer term patterns since active management ceased 2 site description the sandhill fen watershed sfw was constructed in the northwest corner of a formerly mined area 1977 1999 called east in pit and is part of syncrude canada ltd s base mine 57 02 n 111 35 w located approximately 40 km north of fort mcmurray alberta this region is situated in the wbp ecoregion of western canada which is characterized by a cold and sub humid climate where mean annual potential evapotranspiration 607 mm exceeds mean annual precipitation 456 mm with 342 mm of precipitation falling predominantly as rain between may and september environment canada 2020 wytrykush et al 2012 thirty year climate normal data 1981 2010 for fort mcmurray indicates that average annual daily temperature is 0 7 1 2 c where lowest and warmest temperatures typically occur in january averaging 18 8 5 0 c and july averaging 16 8 1 1 c respectively environment canada 2020 the sfw was built atop 35 m of composite tailings containing ospw followed by a 10 m tailings sand structural cap the sfw has a 17 ha fen wetland 35 ha upland including 20 ha of upland hillslopes that vary in elevation from 3 to 8 m above the wetland referred to as hummocks fig 1 wytrykush et al 2012 there is a total of seven hummocks which were constructed of mechanically placed tailings sand and were designed to create upland recharge areas to supply water to the wetland area excluding the hummocks 0 5 m of clay was laid on top of the tailings sand cap to maintain water table wt position and to attenuate upward migration of salts from the ct layer followed by 0 5 m of peat mineral mix and 0 5 m of peat in the uplands and wetland respectively peat placed in the wetland was harvested and salvaged in the fall 2010 from the upper 0 6 m of a poor fen north of syncrude s base mine and was placed with a bulldozer in january 2011 inflow and outflow can be managed via a pump system that was installed during construction intended to maintain wetness and mitigate the elevated salinity in addition to precipitation and groundwater water can be supplied to the clay lined water storage pond referred to as the inlet from a nearby undisturbed lake mildred lake which gradually flows through a gravel dam into the wetland area of sfw surface and near surface water flow east and through a v notch weir when at the outlet where water is collected in a sump which has a pump system to discharge water it should be noted that outflow this water can only occur when the sump pump is activated and otherwise water accumulates in the outlet without any pump activation further details on the pump system can be found in biagi et al 2019 and nicholls et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 field measurements a network of 30 near surface fully slotted pvc wells were installed during 2013 2014 throughout sfw fig 1 to depths between 0 48 and 1 02 m in 2013 11 near surface wells were installed which expanded by 22 near surface wells in 2014 ten solinst ltc levelogger junior pressure transducers were deployed at the bottom of these near surface wells that took measurements of water level water temperature and electrical conductivity every 15 min from may to october each year from 2014 to 2018 wells instrumented with these leveloggers changed over the study period and are indicated in table a1 levelogger measurements were only made in five wells surrounding boardwalk 3 from july to september in 2013 before the network of wells and sampling frequency expanded in 2014 table a1 manual measurements of water level were made monthly at minimum for quality assurance and control solinst level measurements were corrected for barometric pressure using a solinst barologger to increase the spatial representation of water quality parameters discrete measurements of temperature electrical conductivity and ph were taken monthly at minimum using a ysi professional plus multiparameter or ysi pro dss instrument at over 50 surface and well sampling sites fig 1 all ec values both discrete and continuous were corrected to 25 c hayashi 2004 the ysi instruments were calibrated before each use while the sampling period was the same among all years may to october sample distribution and frequency varied slightly each year as the sampling strategy changed over the years table a1 in 2013 13 surface and near surface water samples were taken between weekly and monthly frequencies in 2014 and 2015 sample sites increased to 21 and 19 sites respectively and were sampled bi weekly in 2016 sampling distribution and frequency decreased consideraby due to the fort mcmurray horse river wildfire where samples were taken at 12 sites monthly from july to october upland wells were excluded from sampling in 2015 and 2016 in 2017 and 2018 sample sites increased again to 21 sites and were sampled on a monthly basis table a1 all near surface wells were purged up to 24 hours prior to sample collection using a model 428 biobailer that was cleaned and environmentalized between sites samples were also collected using model 428 biobailer which captures water throghout the entire water column in the slotted well samples were stored in 500 ml or 1000 ml petg sample bottles and kept in a cooler until they could be stored at 4 c duplicate samples were taken every ten samples and both field and laboratory blanks were included in each sampling campaign for quality assurance and quality control wells were named according to their position within sfw where the suffix b represents wells along boardwalks one to three tr represents wells in the margins transition and up represents wells in the uplands fig 1 samples taken during pumping events were reduced to surface water samples in wetland area only and included b1 s1 b2 s1 b3 s1 and the outlet rainfall isotope samples were collected via precipitation isotope collectors that were installed adjacent to met stations fig 1 based on the design of gröning et al 2012 rainfall was analyzed for major ions when there was excess water available after stable isotope samples were taken snowmelt was also sampled for major ions directly from snowpack samples which were allowed to melt before filtering and analysis additionally snowmelt runoff from hillslopes was collected via runoff collectors and were analyzed for major ions fig 1 details on runoff collector construction can be found in biagi and carey 2020 3 2 laboratory sample preparation all samples were vacuum filtered within 24 hours of collection surface water samples were filtered using gf f 25 mm 0 7 µm filters for particulate organic carbon analysis while well samples were filtered using 47 mm 0 45 µm nitro cellulose filters filtrate for major ion analysis were stored in 60 ml translucent hdpe bottles at 4 c before being transported to the biogeochemistry laboratory university of waterloo samples were analyzed for na k mg 2 ca 2 cl and so4 2 using ion chromatography with dionex ics 6000 ionpac as18 and cs12a analytical columns the minimum detection limit was 0 2 mg l for na k and mg 2 and was 0 1 mg l for ca 2 cl and s sulfate n nitrate and n nitrite as part of the analytical quality assurance and control procedures 5 of samples were re run as duplicates hco3 concentrations were calculated by multiplying the alkalinity values by a conversion factor of 1 22 which is a standard conversion method csuros 1994 stable isotope samples stored in 20 ml polyethylene scintillation vials at room temperature and transferred to the mitchell research group at the university of toronto ratios of hydrogen and oxygen were analyzed using a los gatos research dtl 100 water isotope analyzer five standards of known isotope composition with δ 2h ranging from 154 to 4 purchased from los gatos research were used for calibration in addition to periodic checks using the international standards vsmow2 and slap2 during analytical runs samples were interwoven with standards at a ratio of 3 1 3 3 data analysis ion concentrations were converted from mg l to mmol l or meq l to compare the relative abundance of ions in piper diagrams as the molecular weight for each ion is incorporated into the converted values stable isotope of water results δ2h and δ18o were plotted against a local meteoric water line lmwl that was developed for syncrude canada ltd s mildred lake base mine along with mine source waters baer 2014 baer et al 2016 a local evaporation line lel was developed in biagi et al 2019 and is used in this study 4 results 4 1 general hydrochemical trends 4 1 1 annual patterns in general ec increased across the sfw over the study period and the occurrence of wet and dry years biagi et al 2021 had little influence on the observed year over year increase fig 2 average wetland ec increased by 1600 µs cm from 2013 to 2018 530 µs cm every two years while average margin ec observed a larger increase of 2300 µs cm from 2013 to 2018 and has stabilized since 2016 fig 2 table a2 unlike the wetlands where a year over year increase was typically observed the highest average ec in the margins occurred during wet years 2016 and 2018 of 4272 and 3922 µs cm respectively whereas dry years 2014 2015 and 2017 were considerably lower averaging 2765 2911 and 3531 µs cm respectively fig 2 table a2 the upland areas were the only region that exhibited a decrease in annual ec across study years where values decreased from 3870 µs cm in 2013 2123 µs cm in 2018 however this is potentially skewed as only one measurement was taken in 2013 fig 2 when comparing average upland ec across 2014 2018 values are relatively consistent throughout the upland fig 2 table a2 ion concentrations emulated ec patterns with values increasing site wide year over year fig 2 of particular importance is the rising na concentrations compared to other ions average na concentrations were relatively low in 2013 whereas ca 2 typically exceeded na in early years in general na concentrations increased overtime whereas ca 2 concentrations decreased or stabilized fig 2 average na and ca 2 concentrations in 2013 were 56 87 and 190 mg l and 107 287 and 632 mg l in the wetland margins and uplands respectively na increased considerably by 2018 where average concentrations were 349 469 and 350 mg l in the wetland margins and uplands respectively where some sites reached up to 886 1090 and 570 mg l respectively table a2 comparatively average ca 2 only moderately increased in the wetland to 263 mg l from 2013 to 2018 and decreased in the margins and uplands to an average of 252 and 116 mg l respectively 4 1 2 spatial patterns while ec generally increased across the site it varied spatially as some areas remained relatively fresh 1000 µs cm while other areas exceeded 8500 µs cm fig 3 through the first six years an ec gradient developed along two main transects 1 across the wetland and 2 from the south upland swale towards the north margins of sfw fig 3 in 2013 there was little gradient across the wetland as all areas had similar average ec 1000 µs cm the highest average ec in 2013 was in the uplands 3870 µs cm which decreased northward towards the south margins 2391 µs cm the wetland 1580 µs cm and to the northern margins 670 µs cm fig 3a the ec across the wetland transect increased in the following years where ec was highest at b1 and decreased towards b3 ecs in 2015 and 2018 averaged 2897 and 3803 µs cm at b1 2445 and 3309 µs cm at b2 and 1323 and 2242 µs cm at b3 respectively fig 3b c where maximum ec at b1 b2 and b3 reached 7426 5498 and 3745 µs cm respectively in 2018 table a3 following 2013 ec became lowest in the uplands averaging 1295 and 993 µs cm in 2015 and 2018 respectively and highest in the southern margins averaging 3984 and 5230 µs cm in 2015 and 2018 respectively fig 3b c the average wetland and northern margin ec were intermediate and averaged 1563 and 2710 µs cm in the wetland and 2029 and 2007 µs cm in the northern margins for 2015 and 2018 respectively fig 3b c 4 2 influence of precipitation wetland and margin ec had opposing responses to changes in wt from rainfall average ec of 45 µs cm and evaporation fig 4a considering all wetland sites from 2014 to 2018 excluding 2013 with high pump activity pearson correlation results indicate a significant negative correlation between wetland wt position and ec p 1 3e 28 r2 0 2 where increases and decreases in wetland wts were followed by a decrease dilution of ions and increase concentration of ion in ec respectively this pattern was more evident in dry years 2014 2015 and 2017 where wts continuously declined throughout the growing season as ec increased at all boardwalks table a3 seasonal increases in ec evapo concentration became greater as the years progressed as average ec in the wetland from may to october increased by 402 368 and 865 µs cm in 2013 2015 and 2018 respectively table a3 in contrast margin ec was positively correlated with wt position where increasing wt position increased ec ion mobilization and a decrease in wt lowered ec p 5 7e 17 r2 0 1 fig 4b seasonal ec changes were subtle in the margin where average ec either decreased or showed minimal change from may to october across study years table a3 upland wt position and ec was variable over the study period and were not significantly correlated p 0 09 r2 0 02 table a3 4 3 influence of the pumps in early years the combination of inflow and outflow maintained lower ec in the wetland in 2013 the outflow pump was highly active biagi et al 2021 and resultant wetland ec was relatively low fig 3 following 2013 the outflow pump was only active for pre planned drainage events in 2015 2017 and 2018 of 55 102 and 210 mm of outflow respectively biagi et al 2021 while outflow was low in 2015 ec still decreased at all boardwalks by 1000 µs cm yet these values returned back to pre pumping salinities within two weeks following the pumping event 2800 µs cm table 1 however during the 2017 and 2018 outflow pump events ec remained similar to pre pumping values or increased post pumping table 1 despite the events being considerably longer 122 and 276 h respectively than the 2015 outflow pumping event 60 h biagi et al 2021 a 100 year rainfall event 92 mm in 24 h occurred shortly after the 2018 pumping event which likely resulted in the lower ec two weeks following pumping table 1 4 4 influence of mixing in 2013 site wide water samples were predominantly ca dominant 90 of all samples which classified mostly as ca so4 47 and ca hco3 41 whereas only 6 of samples were na dominant fig 5 this chemical composition matched that of input waters inflow and rain which were ca hco3 dominant following 2013 the chemical composition of site wide waters began to shift where 69 of samples were ca dominant and 31 were na dominant in 2015 and by 2018 73 were na dominant and only 27 of samples were ca dominant fig 5 additionally 32 of samples in 2018 compared to 2 and 0 in 2015 and 2013 respectively are na cl dominant which is similar to the chemical composition of ospw while this shift towards na dominant waters is evident across all sites this pattern varied spatially where the margins experienced the greatest shift from ca to na dominant waters followed by the wetland and uplands fig 5 these high na areas corresponded to the highest ec areas in sfw whereas more ca dominant areas correspond with lower ec regions within sfw fig 3 stable isotopes of water also indicate increased mixing of sfw waters over time as the variability in both δ2h and δ18o decreased year over year fig 6 average δ2h and δ18o and their respective standard deviations decreased from 129 2 16 9 and 15 1 3 2 respectively in 2014 to 134 6 9 6 and 16 3 1 5 respectively in 2018 in 2014 and 2015 there was a large evaporative signal indicated by the number of samples that plot along the lel this evaporative signal decreased over time as samples shifted down the lel where most samples in 2018 plot on the lower portion of the lel between the isotopic signatures of sfw groundwater and ospw fig 6 in general sfw waters from early years 2014 2015 plot closer to the signature for sfw input waters which overtime showed increased similarity to the chemical signature of ospw 5 discussion the sfw was designed as a pilot project to test how peatlands could be constructed on top of composite tailings in the aosr and to evaluate how the designed watershed develops in terms of hydrology water chemistry and vegetation the ubiquitous salinity in aosr reclaimed landscapes poses a considerable challenge for reclamation success as excess salinity negatively affects peatland vegetation development and ultimately peat accumulation overall ecosystem function biagi et al 2021 and feedback mechanisms waddington et al 2015 as a result reclaimed systems are expected to have higher salinity than their natural analogues until these salts are flushed from the system over time ketcheson et al 2016 nwaishi et al 2015a since salt accumulation in these constructed systems is inevitable it is critical that these reclaimed peatlands are designed to limit accumulation 5 1 why is salinity increasing at sfw three main mechanisms can explain the observed year over year increase in ec and ion concentrations throughout sfw 1 a reduction in inflow and outflow 2 shifts in wt position and 3 increased mixing of site wide waters with deeper saline ospw 5 1 1 reduction in inflow and outflow the major hydrological change observed during the first six years was the shift in the dominant fluxes related to management biagi et al 2021 2019 nicholls et al 2016 in 2013 inflow and outflow were more than double the precipitation and evapotranspiration both 800 mm which kept ec and ion concentrations relatively low as fresh water was supplied to the water storage pond and saline water was removed via outlet pumping fig 2 and 3 ec and ion concentrations at the margins was considerably higher than in the wetland as they were not directly affected by the pumping following 2013 the management regime shifted and water was only pumped out when wts became high and flooded the boardwalks once or twice a year in 2015 outflow pumping was still effective at temporarily lowering wetland ec table 1 while pumping events in 2017 and 2018 had minimal or no influence in lowering ec despite removing a greater volume of water table 1 due to the year over year accumulation of ions the single event outflow pumping events in 2017 and 2018 was likely of insufficient duration to flush salts and may have led to increased mobilization of highly saline margin water into the wetland it is unlikely that without a consistent outflow the sfw will be unable to effectively flush salts and lower overall ec 5 1 2 water table position following 2013 wt position primarily responded to precipitation inputs and evaporation wetland wt position was negatively correlated with wetland ec indicating evapo concentration in response to wt decline throughout the growing season or dilution from precipitation inputs fig 4 in contrast margin wt position was positively correlated to ec where ions were mobilized during wet conditions fig 4 most of the margin area borders the base of the hummocks and the south swale which has been identified as the region where upwelling and lateral advection of saline groundwater ospw occurs as the clay liner does not extend under the hummocks fig 3 biagi et al 2019 vessey et al 2019 during wet conditions an increase in wt directs water and saline groundwater from the hummocks to the wetland spennato et al 2018 this mirrors deeper groundwater ec patterns in the 10 m tailings sand cap where reported groundwater ec were lowest underneath the wetland 1000 2000 µs cm and highest in the margin areas 2000 4000 µs cm twerdy 2019 while upland wts were not significantly correlated to ec it was the only region within sfw that observed a decrease in ec with time fig 3 which suggests flushing of ions via recharge due to their high topographic position in the watershed 5 1 3 increased mixing of waters the shift in chemical and isotopic composition of waters overtime suggests increased mixing across sfw piper diagrams indicate that many sites primarily margin sites that border hummocks shifted towards the chemical composition of ospw na cl dominant in 2013 90 of samples were ca 2 dominant as many of the construction materials used in sfw were high in ca 2 biagi et al 2019 while ca 2 was still the dominant ion in 2015 a shift towards increasingly na dominant water emerged particularly in the margins fig 5 by 2018 most of the site wide samples 70 were na dominant indicating considerable presence of ospw this shift in chemical composition is an indication of increased mixing and is supported by the decreased variance in δ2h and δ18o with time implying that surface and near surface sfw water is becoming increasingly similar fig 6 additionally the evaporative signal isotopic enrichment declined over time as fewer samples plot along the lel this matches the observed decline in evapotranspiration since 2016 directly measured at the sfw wetland biagi et al 2021 overall the decreased isotopic variability among samples and increased similarities to the chemical composition of ospw fig 5 fig 6 suggest that sfw waters are becoming increasingly mixed across the site with an increased influence of ospw saline groundwater and ospw emerges at the surface in the margin areas highest ec and na concentrations which are at the base of the hummocks hillslopes biagi et al 2021 2019 vessey et al 2019 the clay liner intended to limit the upward flux of ospw that extends throughout the upland swale margins and wetland is absent from the hummocks which provides windows for ospw to be transported to the surface and spread to other regions of sfw in general solutes from ospw that underlie the sfw likely diffuse upwards into the 10 m tailings sand cap due to the strong concentration gradient between the underlying ospw 4000 µs cm and the overlying groundwater 1000 4000 µs cm which flows northeast twerdy 2019 these solutes are transported via advection the physical movement of chemical constituents via water flow via groundwater which emerges at the southern hummocks hummocks 7 and 8 fig 3 where there clay liner is absent once this water reaches the surface at the base of these hummocks it can mix with surface and near surface waters especially under wet conditions fig 4 comparatively diffusion through the clay and peat soil layers throughout the remainder of sfw is a slow process and was likely a minimal contributor to the overall salinity a conceptual diagram of these transport processes within sfw is presented in figure 9 of biagi et al 2021 5 2 what is the fate of sfw elevated ec and ion concentrations will be a lasting legacy in sfw and across the aosr due to the sheer volume of highly saline tailings waste that is incorporated back into the reclaimed landscape while reclaimed forested systems have exhibited resilience to elevated ec and na due to the lower wts lilles et al 2010 wetlands are more susceptible to salinization as near surface saturation enhances ion mobilization to the surface kelln et al 2008 merrill et al 1983 considering the total volume of ospw underneath the sfw 2 25 107 m3 and the average na concentration of ospw 1005 mg l there was approximately 2 25 1010 g of na within the footprint of the sfw at the time of commission based on the current volume and chemistry of water that has been flushed from the sfw via outflow from 2013 to 2018 2 2 105 m3 only 0 2 of na from the underlying ospw has been flushed between 2013 and 2018 the capacity for sfw to remove these salts within the wetland is limited by the poor buffering capacity of the degraded peat biagi et al 2021 vessey et al 2019 the lack of flushing via outflow and continued emergence of saline groundwater ospw at the base of the hummocks in wet conditions suggesting ions will only continue to accumulate in sfw waters evidence has materialized that the sfw wetland is shifting away from a peatland system based on the current wt position biagi et al 2021 shift in vegetation vitt et al 2020 2016b degraded peat properties biagi et al 2021 and continual increases in ec fig 2 biagi et al 2019 in general vegetation communities and productivity decline with increasing ec and sodium concentrations phillips et al 2016 trites and bayley 2009a 2009b and while some species can tolerate saline and sodic waters nwaishi et al 2015a rezanezhad et al 2016b vitt et al 2020 wells and price 2015 many freshwater peat forming species such as bryophytes cannot increases in wt position and soil moisture have been linked to increases in ion mobilization via both diffusion and advection hoag and price 1995 kelln et al 2008 kessler et al 2010 which is a key characteristic of peatlands where the ideal wt position is close to the surface the high ec and na concentrations reported in sfw have long exceeded that of natural freshwater peatlands in the region chee and vitt 1989 hartsock et al 2021 vitt and chee 1990 and are most similar to natural saline fens hartsock et al 2021 wells and price 2015 that naturally occur in alberta climate change is an additional barrier for the success of reclaimed peatlands as the potential ecosystem response to warmer and wetter climate meehl et al 2007 could lead to an overall decline in peatland wt positions and a subsequently drier environment from an increase in evapotranspiration ireson et al 2015 thompson et al 2017 while natural peatlands have water conserving feedback mechanisms that could potentially mitigate wetter or drier conditions waddington et al 2015 these mechanisms are currently absent in constructed peatlands biagi et al 2021 which put them at much greater risk for continued salinization over time the potential for increased precipitation delivered as rain with climate change could increase dilution in the wetland but could also increase ion mobilization of ospw in the margins comparatively drier conditions could continue to enhance ion concentrations in constructed peatlands as wt decline will amplify via further evapo concentration and reduced snowpacks will greatly reduce the annual freshwater input during spring snowmelt biagi and carey 2020 overall the absence of feedback mechanisms waddington et al 2015 put sfw at risk for enhanced saline conditions regardless of wetter or drier conditions with the onset of climate change 5 3 recommendations elevated salinity is an unavoidable and long lasting barrier towards constructed peatland success in the aosr and designing landscapes capable of flushing these salts without accumulating excessive amounts over time will be the key to their long term success while using a deeper peat soil column during construction would increase the adsorption capacity and removal of ions this is only a temporary solution as soil adsorption capacities are quickly reached due to the elevated concentrations vessey et al 2019 following the recommendations in biagi et al 2021 a general shift in the design strategy for constructed peatlands could help the overall success of these systems which include 1 increase the flushing capacity of the sfw via enhanced recharge and a naturally flowing outlet 2 extend the clay liner beneath the entire peatland watershed and increase the depth of the peat column and 3 shift design goals to better match the outcome in a disturbed landscape first enhancing system recharge via constructing larger hummock structures with high infiltration soils will increase dilution and limit the upward movement of saline water biagi and carey 2020 kelln et al 2008 lukenbach et al 2019 a free flowing outlet that allows for outflow during wet conditions i e when the wt exceeds a certain threshold could also help flush solutes from the system and limit ion accumulation in the wetland secondly extending the clay liner beneath the hummocks will help limit the formation of highly saline areas where ospw is emerging at the surface fig 3 this will also help direct recharge water directly to the margins and wetland and limit any loss of recharge water to deep percolation additionally a deeper peat column in the fen area greater than the current 0 5 m could encourage more attenuation of ions from the saline water the nikanotee fen has both of these components fully extended clay liner and deeper peat column and have shown lower salinities and influence of ospw kessel et al 2018 ketcheson et al 2017 lastly shifting the landscape design strategy to incorporate a perched or upgradient peatland system may reduce potential for salinization as the upgradient areas in sfw have lower salinities from flushing via recharge over time fig 3 peat forming species not necessarily freshwater species may establish more successfully in an upgradient peatland that would receive freshwater input directly from precipitation and recharge where excess water and salts could flow to a down gradient marsh system with vegetation species that can thrive in saline waters and inundated conditions see figure 9 in biagi et al 2021 that said there is unlikely any ecosystem design that will completely eliminate the elevated salinity in constructed peatlands as the near surface wt required for peatland development promotes the upward movement of salts to the surface avoiding salinization all together in constructed peatlands may not be possible and as such designing constructed peatlands similar to naturally occurring saline peatlands with salt tolerant species capable of accumulating peat trites and bayley 2009b volik et al 2017 wells and price 2015 may offer the best chance for success 6 conclusion this research aimed to understand the development of salinity patterns in the sandhill fen watershed sfw a constructed peatland watershed following a heavily managed hydrologic regime to provide insight on its potential for long term success as a peat forming wetland in general ec increased year over year throughout sfw from 2013 to 2018 particularly in the wetland and margin areas the uplands were the only region that observed a decrease in ec over the study period three main mechanisms can explain these salinity patterns firstly reduced inflow and outflow caused year over year ion accumulation throughout the system as there was no flushing of saline waters secondly water table position influenced the hydrochemistry as declining wts enhanced evapo concentration in the wetlands while higher water tables in margins mobilized ions lastly increased mixing of sfw waters with saline groundwater has led to elevated ec and sodium concentrations throughout the system based on its current conditions sfw cannot support freshwater peat forming bryophytes and is most similar to naturally occurring saline fens in the region elevated salinity may be unavoidable in constructed peatland watersheds due to ubiquitous salinity in the post mining landscape shifting design strategies to reconstructing naturally occurring saline peatlands might offer another avenue to increase the success of these systems
